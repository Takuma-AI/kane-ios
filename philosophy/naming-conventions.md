# Naming Conventions in Takuma OS

## The Emoji Rule

### Projects Get Emojis 🎯
Living work that evolves and has personality:
- 🌒 TAKUMA - Company operations
- 🌎 EARTH - External collaborations  
- ⚔️ SIDE QUESTS - Experiments
- 🌅 SHOKUNA - Ventures
- 🎯 Your Project - Whatever you're building

### Utilities Don't Get Emojis
Stable infrastructure that supports all work:
- knowledge - Curated wisdom
- tools - Workspace utilities
- research - Ongoing investigations
- plan - Daily planning
- philosophy - Core principles

## Why This Matters

**Visual Clarity**: Instantly distinguish active work from supporting resources.

**Path Stability**: Utilities have clean paths for scripts and automation.

**Personality Where It Belongs**: Projects are living things. Infrastructure is infrastructure.

**Consistent Expectations**: Everyone knows what to expect from folder names.

## Choosing Emojis for Projects

When creating a new project, choose an emoji that:
- Captures the essence or energy of the work
- Is easy to type (avoid complex emoji combinations)
- Won't be confused with existing projects
- Feels right (trust your instincts)

Common patterns:
- 🌍🌎🌏 for global/earth-related work
- 🚀🎯🔥 for goal-oriented projects
- 🌊🌿🌸 for organic/growing initiatives
- ⚡💡🔮 for innovative/experimental work
- 🏗️🛠️⚔️ for building/crafting projects

Remember: The emoji becomes part of the project's identity. Choose thoughtfully, but don't overthink it. The work will reveal if the emoji fits.
