# Takuma Goals - Todo Lists

## Goal 1: Takuma's identity is defined and established

### Extract and document the consistent patterns across Kane and Hashi product visions
**What to do:**
- Read through both Kane and Hashi vision documents
- Identify the recurring themes (understanding before action, human agency, etc.)
- Write a 1-page synthesis of "What all Takuma products share"
- Save as `core/patterns-across-products.md`

**Why this matters:** Before we can articulate identity externally, we need to see what patterns already exist across our work.

**Success looks like:** A clear document that shows the DNA shared by our products - the throughline that makes them all "Takuma products"

### Create the mon (family crest) exploration framework
**What to do:**
- Research Japanese mon design principles (symbolism, simplicity, recognition)
- Document 5-10 mon that resonate with Takuma's philosophy
- For each, explain: What it traditionally represents, Why it connects to our work
- Create `core/identity/mon-exploration.md`

**Why this matters:** The mon system gives us a visual language for thinking about identity that's rooted in meaning, not just aesthetics.

**Success looks like:** A thoughtful exploration document that connects visual symbols to our core philosophy, setting up future logo work

### Write three versions of the 30-second Takuma explanation
**What to do:**
- Version 1: For a technical friend who knows AI
- Version 2: For a family member who doesn't
- Version 3: For a potential client/partner
- Each should be 2-3 sentences max
- Save as `core/identity/elevator-pitches.md`

**Why this matters:** Forces us to distill the essence into language that works in real conversations, not just internal documents.

**Success looks like:** Three explanations you'd actually use when someone asks "What's Takuma?"

### Document 'Takuma moments' - when the company feels most itself
**What to do:**
- Recall 3-5 specific moments when Takuma felt most aligned with its purpose
- For each moment, capture: What happened, Why it felt right, What it reveals about identity
- Look for patterns across these moments
- Create `core/identity/takuma-moments.md`

**Why this matters:** Identity reveals itself in action. By studying when things felt most "right," we discover what we actually are.

**Success looks like:** A collection of real moments that illuminate the identity through lived experience

### Establish the product naming philosophy
**What to do:**
- Study current names: Kane, Hashi, Takuma itself
- Extract the principles (Japanese concepts? Single words? Meanings?)
- Write guidelines for future product names
- Generate 5 potential names for hypothetical products as examples
- Create `core/identity/naming-philosophy.md`

**Why this matters:** Consistent naming creates cohesion. It's how Apple products feel like a family even when diverse.

**Success looks like:** Clear principles that would help name the next product in a way that feels unmistakably Takuma

### Create the 'Words are Code' demonstration piece
**What to do:**
- Take one page from the Takuma OS (maybe from handbook)
- Show how changing specific words would change company behavior
- Create 2-3 concrete examples: "If we changed X to Y, then Z would happen"
- Make it visceral - show how words literally execute as company behavior
- Save as `core/identity/words-as-code-demo.md`

**Why this matters:** This is our core insight - making it tangible helps others (and us) understand what makes Takuma different.

**Success looks like:** A piece that makes someone go "Oh, I get it now" about how Takuma works

**Why this matters:** Can't find the right clients without knowing what "right" looks like.

**Success looks like:** A clear rubric you could use to evaluate any potential client in 5 minutes

### Research and list 10 potential bespoke clients
**What to do:**
- Find 10 companies/founders who fit the ideal profile
- For each: Company name, Founder, Why they might need us, One specific struggle we could address
- Include mix of warm connections and cold prospects
- Save as `bespoke/prospect-research.md`

**Why this matters:** Move from abstract "finding clients" to concrete "these specific people."

### Create the Takuma Bespoke one-pager
**What to do:**
- One page that explains what Bespoke does differently
- Include: Our philosophy, Types of projects, How we work, One case study (EPC)
- Design for sending as PDF or sharing as link
- Save as `bespoke/one-pager.md` (content first, design later)

- Package 3: Ongoing partnership (monthly retainer)
- For each: What's included, Ideal for whom, Rough pricing
- Create `bespoke/service-packages.md`

- Start with hardcoded examples
- Ship to `labs/kane/codebase`

**Why this matters:** This IS Kane - the shift from data to memory.

---

Each todo is designed to be:
- Concrete enough to start today
- Small enough to complete in one focused session
- Clear about what "done" looks like
- Building toward the larger goal

The key is making progress on each goal in parallel, not completing one before starting another.
