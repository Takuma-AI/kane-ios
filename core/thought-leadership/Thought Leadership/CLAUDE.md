# Thought Leadership Writing Guide

## Core Philosophy

Write like every word costs $100. Make each one earn its place.

## What These Posts Are

- **200-400 words max** - If it needs more, it's trying too hard
- **One crystalline idea** - Not three ideas pretending to be one
- **Seth Godin brevity meets Paul Graham depth** - Short but resonant
- **Substance over style** - No college essay openings, no "everyone says"

## What These Posts Aren't

- Generic LinkedIn thought pieces
- Critiques without alternatives
- Technology pessimism
- Academic exercises

## Writing Principles

### 1. Start Strong
No throat-clearing. Jump straight into the idea. First sentence should make them stop scrolling.

Bad: "Everyone's talking about AI agents these days..."
Good: "I rewatched The Matrix last week. Got chills every time I heard the word 'agent.'"

### 2. Make It Personal
Use "you" not "everyone." Make readers examine themselves.

Bad: "People are falling into the AI hype"
Good: "Are you consumed by it? How many tasks did you delegate today?"

### 3. Acknowledge Nuance
The world isn't black and white. AI is empowering AND pacifying. Social media did connect people AND created echo chambers. Honor both truths.

### 4. Use Concrete Images
Abstract ideas need tangible anchors.

Examples:
- "The toothpaste won't go back in the tube"
- "Passive energy sources for the machine world"
- "Words ARE code"

### 5. Reveal, Don't Preach
Let insights emerge from observation. Let analogies do the heavy lifting.

Bad: "This is just like humans being batteries in The Matrix!"
Good: "What are humans when every thought is outsourced? Passive energy sources for the machine world we're building."

### 6. End with Choice
Leave readers with agency, not despair. Show the fork in the road.

Examples:
- "The choice is still yours. For now."
- "The tools exist. The question is whether anyone remembers how to hold them."
- "Stop thinking about coding with words. Start thinking about words as code."

## Topic Criteria

Good topics:
- Challenge conventional thinking about AI/technology
- Reveal hidden incentive structures
- Offer imagination-based alternatives
- Connect technical concepts to human experience

Avoid topics that:
- Require extensive context to understand
- Sound smart but say nothing new
- Criticize without offering alternatives
- Feel forced or inauthentic

## The Editing Test

Before publishing, ask:
1. Could this be 50 words shorter?
2. Does every sentence advance the idea?
3. Would I stop scrolling to read this?
4. Is the core insight clear in 10 seconds?
5. Does it shift perspective, not just inform?

## Post Creation Process

1. **Always propose outlines and hooks first** before writing the full post
2. **Create individual files** for each post (e.g., `04-everything-becomes-art.md`)
3. **Present the hook and outline** for approval before drafting
4. **Number files sequentially** to maintain order
5. **Focus on substance** - each post should explore human expression, imagination, and agency

## Remember

These aren't blog posts. They're perspective shifts delivered in minimum viable words. 

Make them feel, not just think.
Make them question, not just nod.
Make them remember, not just read.
