# Words Are Now Code (And Your Business Is a Codebase)

## Core Idea
We keep saying "we can code with words" but that's backwards. Words ARE code. Thoughts compile into systems. Your business is becoming a codebase written in natural language.

## Opening Hook
"Everyone's excited that we can 'code with words.' They're missing the revolution: words are now code."

## Key Points

### The Surface Understanding
- "I can use ChatGPT to write Python!"
- "AI helps me code faster!"
- Still thinking of code as separate from language
- Missing what's actually happening

### The Deep Reality
- Words, ideas, thoughts are now executable programs
- Not metaphorically - literally
- Your business strategy compiles
- Your vision runs in production

### What This Changes
- Software engineering: most refined craft of intent declaration
- Why? PRDs, specs, system design = declaring intent
- Now every industry can declare executable intent
- Consultants always built word programs - now they actually run

### The One-Person Unicorn, Reimagined
- Not someone juggling agent tabs
- Someone whose thoughts are the codebase
- Clean, beautiful system of executable ideas
- Business logic written in words, not code

### Your Business as Software
- Strategy documents → executable programs
- Processes → functions that actually run
- Culture → the operating system
- Vision → the source code everything inherits from

## Closing
"Stop thinking about AI helping you code. Start thinking about your thoughts as code. Your business isn't using software - it's becoming software."
