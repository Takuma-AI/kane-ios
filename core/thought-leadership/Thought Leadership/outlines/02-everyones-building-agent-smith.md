# Everyone's Building Agent Smith

## Core Idea
The entire AI industry is building Agent Smith - specialized agents that fragment human intent. We need to build Neo's training program instead.

## Opening Hook
"In The Matrix, Agent Smith multiplies into specialized copies that overwhelm through numbers. Sound familiar?"

## Key Points

### The Agent Smith Model
- One agent for email
- Another for calendar
- Another for tasks
- Another for decisions
- Each optimized, autonomous, fragmented

### Why This Pacifies
- Humans become managers of AI employees
- Intent gets fragmented across functional silos
- You lose the whole by optimizing each part
- Agency outsourced to the collective

### The Alternative: Neo's Lab
- Not agents that do things FOR you
- Programs you download and wield yourself
- Tools that amplify YOUR abilities
- You remain the programmer of reality

### The Critical Difference
- Agent Smith: "Let me handle that for you"
- Neo's Lab: "Here's how to bend reality yourself"
- One creates dependence
- One creates gods

### The Real Question
"Do you want a thousand agents doing your thinking, or do you want to think with the power of a thousand?"

## Closing
"Everyone's racing to build better Agent Smiths. We're building the dojo where humans remember they're Neo."
