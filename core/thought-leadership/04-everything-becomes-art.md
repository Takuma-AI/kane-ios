# Everything Becomes Art

Everyone's racing to give AI longer leashes. More autonomy. More decisions. 

They're building themselves out of the picture.

When machines can handle every obligation, what's left isn't leisure. It's pure expression.

But only if you choose to express.

Look at what you do today. Which parts are obligation? Which could be vehicles for your imagination?

A budget isn't numbers - it's a portrait of what you value. A business isn't optimization - it's your vision of how the world could work. Code isn't just function - it's opinion made manifest.

Why display transactions as memory orbs instead of efficient rectangles? Because you have a specific feeling you want people to experience. Among infinite possibilities, why this one? That choice - that's where imagination lives.

The industry is automating away human judgment. But judgment is all we have left.

Everything you touch can carry your fingerprint. Every system can embody your worldview. Every interaction can manifest how you think things should be.

The question isn't whether AI will replace your work.

The question is whether your work expresses anything worth preserving.

Stop optimizing yourself out of existence. Start treating your work like art.

Not because it makes you irreplaceable.

Because it makes you human.
