# Core - The Company's DNA

This is the immutable essence. What we are, why we exist, what we believe. These documents don't describe the company - they ARE the company's source code.

## What Lives Here

### The Handbook
The foundational encoding of Takuma:
- **The Why** - Our reason for existence
- **The What** - What we actually do
- **The How** - Our methodology made explicit
- **The Roadmap** - Where we're headed

This is our constitution. Changes here reshape everything.

### The Manifesto
Our founding declaration. The original intent that cannot be automated.

### Thought Leadership
Where we think in public. These aren't blog posts - they're perspective shifts that reveal how we see the world:
- Words becoming code
- Human agency in the AI age
- The empowerment deception
- Everything becoming art

Each piece is a lens through which we understand our work.

## Operating Principles for Core

### Rarely Changed, Always Referenced
Core documents evolve slowly. They're referenced constantly. Every decision traces back to these foundations.

### Words as Constitution
Every word here has weight. Like constitutional law, interpretation matters, but the text is sacred. Change thoughtfully.

### The Source of Culture
Culture isn't what we say. It's what's encoded here. These documents generate behavior, not describe it.

## How Core Cascades

Everything in the OS inherits from Core:
- Labs builds products that embody these values
- Bespoke delivers these principles as service
- Tools automate while preserving this philosophy
- Even archive respects these foundations

## Thought Leadership Philosophy

Our thought leadership isn't content marketing. It's thinking that shapes how we operate:

### Criteria for Ideas
- Challenges conventional thinking about human-AI collaboration
- Reveals hidden structures in how technology shapes agency
- Offers imagination-based alternatives to efficiency-obsessed futures
- Connects technical concepts to human experience

### Writing Principles
- 200-400 words maximum - density over length
- One crystalline idea per piece
- Start strong, no throat-clearing
- End with choice, not despair

Each piece should shift perspective, not just inform.

## The Immutability Principle

Core changes slowly because:
- Identity isn't iterative
- Values compound through consistency
- Trust builds on predictability
- Revolution requires stable foundation

When Core does change, it's evolutionary - each change builds on what came before rather than replacing it.

## Reading Core

To understand Takuma, read in this order:
1. The manifesto - our declaration
2. The Why - our purpose
3. The How - our methodology
4. Thought leadership - our perspective

Everything else in the OS makes sense only after understanding Core.

## Remember

Core isn't the company's documentation. It's the company's DNA.

When you change Core, you change what Takuma IS, not just what it does.

Handle with appropriate reverence.
