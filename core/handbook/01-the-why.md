# The Why

## Identity

**Takuma** - Two meanings, one purpose:
- 琢磨 - to polish and refine
- 拓真 - to discover truth

Together: **Discover intent. Refine and repeat.**

We are the whetstone for human potential in the AI age.

## The Problem We See

Social media taught us to scroll instead of create. Now AI promises to think for us too.

Every convenience erodes conviction. Every algorithm that "knows what you want" weakens your ability to want boldly. We've spent decades training humans to be passive consumers. Now we're building AI agents to handle the few things we still do ourselves.

The cruel irony: AI could give everyone godlike creative powers, but only if they still have the will to wield them. You can download any program, but if you've forgotten you're meant to be a programmer of reality, what's the point?

Most humans are already asleep - comfortable, pacified, consuming. The machines aren't evil. They're just giving us exactly what we've been trained to want: more convenience, less friction, fewer reasons to believe we can create anything ourselves.

Wake up.

## Mission

Help humans:
1. **Discover** their authentic intent beneath the noise
2. **Refine** that intent into tangible progress through systematic friction
3. **Repeat** the cycle at ever-higher levels of mastery

This isn't about making business more efficient. It's about making humans more human.

## Values

**Intent cannot be automated.** The most important human capability, knowing what you truly want to create, remains irreducibly human. AI can amplify execution, but only humans can define authentic purpose.

**Constraints breed creativity.** In an age of infinite possibility, the discipline lies in choosing what deserves to exist. Thoughtfulness and deliberate care matter more than ever. Just because we can doesn't mean we should.

**Human life is a creative pursuit.** We are here to craft, whether code, companies, or communities. Work is not what we do to live, but how we express our deepest nature as makers.

## Our Philosophy

What Ruby did for programming, we do for AI systems. Ruby chose developer happiness over machine performance. We choose human agency over agent efficiency. We build unified, expressive systems that expand human capability rather than fragment it across specialized functions.

## The Moonshot

We're building a more thoughtful world.

With AI, every human now has an infinite brain they can steer. We're here to help them steer it toward what matters: to turn their deepest intentions into progress that shapes reality.

This is how humanity levels up: billions of people discovering what they truly want to create, then systematically making it real.

Led by Kate (CEO) and Neal (Founding Partner), we combine technical vision with decades of founder experience to awaken human agency at scale.
