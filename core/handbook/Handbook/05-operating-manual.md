# Operating Manual

What happens inside our spaceship?

## One-Week Cycles

**Progress happens in weeks, not months.** In the age of AI where everything moves fast, anything beyond a week can feel like infinite time and leads to scope creep.

**Monday-Thursday:** Progress period
**Friday:** Cooldown, ship, and plan next week

Fixed time, variable scope. We ship on time by adjusting scope, not moving deadlines.

**In-Person Collaboration:** At least 2 days per week of synchronous jamming, with morning or afternoon dedicated together time. Which 2 days decided during Friday planning.

## Daily Rhythm

**8:30am Daily Call (5-10 min):**
- What's today's focus?
- Any other commitments affecting availability?
- Hold each other accountable to priorities

**Evening Update (before signing off):** What actually shipped?

Track everything in Basecamp. Every project has a clear leader.

Note: Client daily check-ins happen Monday-Thursday only. Friday is internal progress day.

## Customer Selection

We only take work that:
- Teaches us about intent to progress transformation
- Aligns with how we want to spend our time
- Commands premium value

Quality of learning > quantity of revenue.

## Financial Planning

**Monthly reviews:** 
- How are we trending?
- What mix of customer vs. product work?
- What needs adjustment?

The more efficient our customer work, the more time for product experiments.

## Transparency

**Name the work.** Every task states why it matters to TAKUMA.

**Name the focus.** If we have other priorities this week, we say so upfront and set expectations correctly.

**Name the progress.** Every todo includes how it builds toward our goals.

## Accountability

**Set realistic expectations.** If we find we're not meeting our own commitments, we have honest conversations about why.

**Miss gracefully.** If we can't deliver, we communicate early.

**Learn systematically.** Every miss teaches us something.

## Decision Making

**Kate as CEO** has final call on:
- Strategic direction and vision
- Client selection and engagement terms
- Product priorities
- Resource allocation

**Neal as Founding Partner** has responsibility to:
- Challenge decisions that feel misaligned
- Propose alternative approaches
- Voice concerns immediately, not after the fact
- Provide perspective from experience

**The Rhythm:**
Morning call often surfaces decisions. Quick discussion, clear decision, move forward. When bigger decisions need more time, we schedule it. No decision paralysis.

## Handbook Review

**Every 3 months:** Review and update this entire handbook to reflect what we've learned and how we've evolved.
