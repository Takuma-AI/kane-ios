# The Money

## Company Structure

TAKUMA is an LLC owned 50/50 by Kate Lee and Neal Sales-Griffin.

As business and creative partners, equal ownership reflects our shared commitment to this vision.

## Compensation Model

**No salaries** - We're owners, not employees  
**50% of profits** - Available for partner draws (this is our total compensation)  
**50% reserves** - Set aside for taxes (~30-40%) and operations

This means we only eat when the business eats. Perfect alignment.

**Important**: The 50% we draw is after-tax money. The company pays taxes from reserves, so partner draws are free and clear.

## How It Works

**Primary Model: Quarterly Distributions**
- Track profit throughout the quarter
- At quarter end, distribute based on contribution
- Each person's share reflects the value they created
- Maximum total distribution: 50% of quarterly profit

**Exception: Emergency Draws**
- If cash is urgently needed before quarter end
- Requires partner consent
- Counts against quarterly distribution
- Still subject to 50% total cap

**Quarterly Meeting:**
- Calculate total profit for the quarter
- Agree on contribution percentages
- Distribute accordingly (minus any emergency draws)
- Review reserves and tax obligations
- Reality check on business health

## Why This Model

**Cash flow friendly** - Only take money when we make money  
**Tax simple** - LLC pass-through, no payroll complexity  
**Aligned incentives** - Success of business = personal income  
**Maximum flexibility** - No fixed salary costs during experiments

## The Long View

We're building an asset together, not just earning income.

The 50/50 draw model ensures we can live while building, but the real value compounds in what we create together - the methodologies, products, and transformation we enable.
