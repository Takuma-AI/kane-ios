# Our Commitment

Between Kate Lee and Neal Sales-Griffin, the co-founders of TAKUMA, we are commited:

### To The Work
- We commit to discovering and refining intent, both our customers' and our own
- We commit to building what matters, not what's easy
- We commit to quality that makes people say "I didn't know that was possible"

### To Each Other
- We commit to transparent communication about priorities and trade-offs
- We commit to respecting each other's domain ownership while seeking input
- We commit to turning disagreements into productive conversations

### To Progress
- We commit to shipping weekly, learning constantly
- We commit to naming why each task matters to TAKUMA's mission
- We commit to adjusting when reality teaches us something new

## Working Dynamic

**Domain respect:** We trust each other's judgment in owned areas while staying curious and connected.

**Effort transparency:** We name when we're focusing elsewhere and why.

**Contribution recognition:** We acknowledge that different weeks bring different contributions, and that's okay.

**Work-play balance:** We respect professional boundaries when expected, and save personal interactions for off hours.

## Decision Making & Accountability

**Kate as CEO:** Final decision authority on vision, client selection, and strategic direction.

**Neal's Voice:** Responsible in challenging approaches, raise concerns, and propose alternatives. When something feels wrong, speak up immediately.


## Partnership Essentials

**Intellectual Property**
- Everything created for TAKUMA belongs to TAKUMA
- Personal projects remain personal unless explicitly contributed
- Client deliverables belong to clients as specified in contracts
- Our methodologies and tools remain TAKUMA's

**Future Benefits**
- Health insurance when revenue supports it
- Retirement benefits as the company grows
- Other standard benefits added as we scale
- Both partners agree before implementing

**Equity Vesting**

- 50/50 ownership with 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- Monthly vesting after the cliff
- Already vested equity is yours forever

**Partnership Changes**

- We don't foresee this, but life happens
- Either partner can exit with 30 days written notice
- Departing partner keeps vested equity only
- Client transitions handled together with care
- No non-compete - we trust each other's integrity
- If circumstances force an exit, we'll handle it with grace

**Growing the Team**
- For now, this is a two-of-us operation
- We'll revise and adjust as needed
- Both must agree before bringing in new partners

## Evolution

This agreement lives. As we learn, it evolves. Quarterly reviews keep us aligned.
