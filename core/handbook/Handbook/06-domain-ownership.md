## How It Works

Each domain influences the others:
- Business Development discovers needs that drive Product Innovation
- Systems Design enables Product Innovation at scale
- Product Innovation embodies our methodology in tools
- Strategic Relationships amplifies our reach and impact
- Education ensures clients actually transform, not just receive
- Thought Leadership connects everything

Domain ownership means proactive progress and decision rights, not rigid boundaries. We seek each other's input constantly.
