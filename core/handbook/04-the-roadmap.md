# The Roadmap

Our primary bet is building products that help humans understand and shape themselves. Consulting serves as optional funding and learning, not the core path.

### The Main Bet: Kane
**A money app that helps you understand yourself from the inside out.**

Kane is our primary focus - the first example of what consumer software becomes in the AI age. Not an app with AI features, but an experience that was impossible before: conversations that evolve based on your unique patterns, questions that deepen as the relationship develops, a system that literally becomes different for each person.

Money is the perfect wedge because it's honest - you can't fake what you actually buy. Every transaction is a decision, every pattern reveals identity. Kane helps you see three versions of yourself:
- Who you think you are
- Who you want to be  
- Who your spending says you really are

This isn't about budgeting. It's about understanding who you're becoming through the most honest mirror we have.

### Supporting Through Selective Consulting
**Learning while building, funding while shipping.**

We remain open to consulting engagements that:
- Fund our product development without dilution
- Teach us about real-world intent-to-progress transformation
- Align with our methodology and values
- Command premium rates for our unique approach

These engagements aren't the goal - they're fuel for the main bet. Every client interaction teaches us something about how humans discover and refine their intent, feeding back into Kane's development.

### The Evolution Path

**Short Term (Now):** All-in on Kane
- Ship weekly iterations based on user conversations
- Test core assumptions about money and identity
- Build the experience that proves the paradigm
- Use consulting selectively to maintain runway

**Medium Term:** Kane validates the model
- Kane demonstrates product-market fit
- Revenue from Kane reduces consulting dependency
- Methodology crystallizes through real usage
- Second product emerges from Kane learnings

**Long Term:** Platform emergence
- Multiple products using the same core philosophy
- Tools that let others build intent-oriented experiences
- Consulting becomes rare, high-value strategic work
- Products generate sustainable revenue

## Why This Works

**Products compound, consulting doesn't.** Every line of Kane code builds lasting value.

**Kane is the proof.** Success with Kane validates the entire philosophy.

**Focus beats fragmentation.** One great product beats ten good ideas.

**Learning through building.** Real users teach us more than any client engagement.

The roadmap is simple: Make Kane undeniable. Everything else follows.
