# The Roadmap

We start by being the whetstone ourselves. We evolve into creating whetstones for others.

### Phase 1: We Are The Whetstone
**Consulting that unlocks impossible progress.**

We're not consultants who deliver PDFs. We're forward-deployed engineers of intent.

The whetstone reveals what's already there through patient pressure and strategic friction. We prepare your kitchen and act as sous chef while you remain the visionary. Every technical decision encodes best practices invisibly so you focus on what matters: how your creation should feel.

We amplify your expertise, not replace it. You steer, we navigate. You design the experience, we handle the architecture. Fixed time, variable scope - shipping something real beats perfecting assumptions.

Every engagement teaches us how intent crystallizes into executable reality.

### Phase 2: Productizing The Practice
**Our methods become their tools.**

Two categories emerge:

1. **Custom solutions**: Built specifically for them, they own and steer - their word programs made real
2. **TAKUMA tools**: Our methods as products, they license and use - the Ruby of AI systems

Customers become beta testers of our evolving methodology.

### Phase 3: Products Overtake Consulting
**Scale through software, not hours.**

The tools become so essential that customers can't imagine working without them.
Consulting becomes the exception, products become the rule.

Every human becomes a programmer of reality through natural language.

## Why This Works

**We're forward-deployed engineers of human potential.** Every engagement teaches us how intent becomes progress in the real world.

**Consulting funds innovation.** Revenue today enables products tomorrow.

**Customers validate direction.** What they desperately need becomes what we build.

**Network effects of agency.** Awakened creators awaken others.

## The Product Lab

Beyond consulting engagements, we allocate a monthly time budget for building experimental products. These products are designed to directly address the progress we seek to create:

- **KANE**: Personal finance as value expression
- **TakumaOS**: The platform that makes word programming natural

Each explores how to return humans to their nature as creators.
