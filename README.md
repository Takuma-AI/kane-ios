# Takuma OS

A living system for organizing work that emerges from the process of defining it.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Takuma-AI/takuma-os.git
cd takuma-os

# Create your workspace from the template
cp -r workspace-template ~/my-workspace
cd ~/my-workspace

# Start with a Side Quest
cd "‚öîÔ∏è SIDE QUESTS"
mkdir "üî¨ My First Experiment"
```

**Using Claude Code?** See `SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

Read `philosophy/getting-started.md` for the full introduction.

## What's Included

### üìö knowledge/
Curated wisdom that informs our work. Books, frameworks, and insights from:
- 37signals (Getting Real, Shape Up, REWORK)
- The Great CEO Within
- Jobs to be Done methodology
- And more...

### üõ†Ô∏è tools/
Utilities that reduce friction:
- `basecamp-sync` - Upload markdown to Basecamp
- `youtube-transcribe` - Extract wisdom from videos

**Quick access**: Use `./sync` and `./yt` from the root directory.

### üí≠ philosophy/
The principles behind Progress Management:
- Why progress > projects
- Naming conventions (emojis and organization)
- Getting started guide

### üìÅ workspace-template/
A starter structure for your own workspace:
- Project directories with emoji convention
- Utility directories without emojis
- Example CLAUDE.md for AI context

## Core Principles

**Progress > Projects**: Work emerges from the process of defining it. Don't over-plan.

**Living Documentation**: CLAUDE.md files capture context and evolve with your work.

**Knowledge-Informed**: Let the curated wisdom guide your decisions.

**Maintained Agency**: You decide, tools and AI amplify.

## The Emoji Convention

- **Projects get emojis** (üåç EARTH, ‚öîÔ∏è SIDE QUESTS) - living work with personality
- **Utilities don't** (knowledge, tools, research) - stable infrastructure

This creates instant visual distinction and keeps utility paths clean for automation.

## Your First Day

1. **Explore knowledge/** - Start with Getting Real or Shape Up
2. **Create a Side Quest** - Low commitment, high learning
3. **Use CLAUDE.md** - Document context as you work
4. **Let it evolve** - Don't force structure prematurely

## Contributing Back

When you create something worth sharing:
1. Copy it to your fork of Takuma OS
2. Clean up any sensitive content
3. Submit a pull request
4. Help others experience Progress Management

## Philosophy

This isn't about imposing structure - it's about creating space for work to reveal what it wants to become. The system should feel alive, not mechanical.

For deeper understanding, read:
- `philosophy/progress-management.md` - The core methodology
- `philosophy/getting-started.md` - Practical first steps
- `knowledge/Books/Getting Real/` - The philosophical foundation

## Support

This is an evolving system. If something doesn't make sense, that's valuable feedback. Open an issue or contribute improvements.

Remember: The magic isn't in the structure - it's in the approach.
