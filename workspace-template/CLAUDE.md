# My Workspace

## Overview
This is my personal implementation of Takuma OS - a living system for organizing work that emerges from the process of defining it.

## Current Focus
[What am I working on right now? What questions am I exploring?]

## Active Projects

### üåç EARTH/
[External collaborations and public-facing work]

### ‚öîÔ∏è SIDE QUESTS/
[Experiments and explorations]

## Workspace Principles
- Let work reveal what it wants to become
- Maintain context in CLAUDE.md files
- Reference knowledge/ for frameworks and wisdom
- Move work between directories as purpose clarifies

## Personal Notes
[Anything specific about how I like to work, tools I use, patterns I've noticed]

## Remember
This workspace is alive. It should evolve as I do.
