# Phase 0: Discovery

Initial research, requirements gathering, and project definition.

## Contents

- `discovery.md` - Refined insights from user research
- `lees-requirements.md` - Original requirements from Lee (COO)
- `service-agreement.md` - Commercial terms and project scope

## Purpose

This phase captured the authentic struggle before we started building:
- What manual work are we eliminating?
- Who feels the pain most acutely?
- What's the minimum viable solution?

All work here was completed before the project kickoff.
