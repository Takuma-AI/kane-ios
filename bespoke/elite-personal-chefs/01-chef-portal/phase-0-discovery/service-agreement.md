# Service Agreement: Chef Portal Development
**Elite Personal Chefs × TAKUMA**

## Project Overview
By September 1st, 2025: One core experience transforms from spreadsheet to product. More importantly, you gain the capability to build digital experiences yourself—imagining and creating new features as naturally as you design private dinner experiences.

## Our Collaboration
You know how to build a restaurant: concept, kitchen design, equipment selection, hiring specialists for beverage programs or pastry. We're teaching you to do the same for digital experiences—except your specialists are AI agents, your kitchen is a development environment, and your equipment is code that you own and control.

What TAKUMA does for digital experiences mirrors what EPC does in the physical world. We both believe in empowering entrepreneurs to build what they envision, just in different mediums. This is how you scale like the "Scalable Restaurant Group" you envision—digital systems that grow your business.

## Scope of Work

### Deliverable 1: Working Chef Portal
By September 1st, one complete workflow transforms from spreadsheet to product. You're in the driver's seat making all product decisions—we handle the technical implementation while ensuring you understand every choice. 

Our philosophy: Quality over complexity. We'll scope down as needed to ensure you truly own what we build together. Better to ship one thoughtful feature you can evolve than multiple features that feel foreign.

Week 0 Discovery determines the starting point: chef-side experience (how they view payments and business value), operations automation (Lee's spreadsheet workflows), or both. Success means immediate, tangible value for your business.

### Deliverable 2: Your Development Kitchen
A complete environment under your control:
- Product development setup on your computer
- GitHub repository under your organization  
- Deployment pipeline you own on Render
- AI "sous chefs" customized based on EPC needs
- Documentation for every command and process

Success: You can describe a new feature and implement it with AI assistance, without us.

### Deliverable 3: Capability Foundation
Initial skills to build independently:
- Navigate and modify your codebase
- Deploy changes to production
- Direct AI agents effectively
- Understand the architecture decisions we made together

You'll make and deploy your first solo change during Week 2. From there, you can expand your portal through:
- **Independent development** using your AI sous chefs
- **Hourly support** ($200/hr) for guidance on specific challenges
- **Two-week sprints** ($5,000) when you need thought partnership on complex features

## Timeline
Three weeks total: Week 0 (Discovery), Week 1 (Design & Build), Week 2 (Test & Launch)
*See Appendix A for detailed timeline*

## Investment & Terms

### Foundation Sprint: $5,000
*Early partner rate - 58% off $12,000 market value*

**What's Included:**
- Week 0: Discovery and kitchen setup
- Weeks 1-2: Intensive building together  
- All three deliverables (working portal, development environment, capability foundation)

**Payment Structure:**
- $2,500 upon signing (50%)
- $2,500 due September 1st, 2025 (50%)
- Payment is for time, expertise, and methodology transfer—not contingent on specific outcomes
- Client-caused delays don't affect payment schedule; TAKUMA-caused delays adjust timeline

**Definition of Done:**
We commit to delivering our full effort and expertise. Success ranges from minimum viable (one workflow productized) to full completion (all three deliverables achieved). If technical obstacles or scope changes arise, we pivot together to ensure you still receive value. Payment reflects our time and knowledge transfer, not just final outcomes—you're investing in capability building, not just code.

### Ongoing Support: $200/hour
After September 1st, available as needed. Minimum 1-hour increments, billed monthly.

### Ownership & IP
**You own:** All code, GitHub repo, deployment, documentation, AI configurations for your portal.
**We retain:** Development methodology and system prompts (licensed for your use only).

## Mutual Commitments

**TAKUMA:** Deliver working portal by September 1st, ensure you understand every component, set up scalable architecture, document everything clearly, be available for questions.

**EPC:** Dedicate 3+ hours/day during Weeks 1-2 (this is hands-on learning time), provide system access before Week 0, make decisions within 24 hours, test and provide feedback actively.

## Working Through Challenges

**If technical obstacles arise:** We'll adjust our approach together. If something proves more complex than expected, we'll document the limitation and find an alternative path that still delivers value.

**If scope needs to change:** We'll collaboratively reduce features to ensure you get at least one complete, working workflow within our timeframe.

**If either party needs to pause:** Life happens. We can pause the project with 48 hours notice. If TAKUMA causes the delay, we'll adjust the payment timeline accordingly. If EPC causes the delay, final payment remains due September 1st and any additional work beyond the original timeline is billed at $200/hour.

The goal is progress, not perfection—delivering real value to your business while building your capabilities.

## Next Steps
1. Review and sign this agreement
2. Submit 50% initial payment
3. Provide access to current systems/data
4. Schedule Week 0 kickoff for August 12th
