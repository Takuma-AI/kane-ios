## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Chef Portal (Current)
Transform spreadsheet operations into first digital product. Lee gains capability to build independently.

### Phase 2: Operations Codification
Encode business processes as executable documentation. Every workflow becomes code.

### Phase 3: Full OS Deployment
EPC runs as software. Natural language instructions drive operations. Business evolution through document updates.

## Core Principles
- **Chef-Centric:** Everything serves the chef's ability to deliver excellence
- **Operational Elegance:** Beautiful systems that work effortlessly
- **Growth Through Quality:** Scale by elevating, not compromising
- **Owner Control:** Lee maintains complete ownership and understanding

## Repository Structure
This will be a separate repository that EPC owns:
- github.com/elitepersonalchefs/epc-os
- Managed as submodule within takuma-os/bespoke/elite-personal-chefs/
- Complete autonomy while maintaining connection to Takuma methodology

## Next Steps
1. Complete chef portal foundation sprint
2. Extract operational patterns from current systems
3. Begin encoding core workflows as documentation
4. Gradually transition from manual to systematic
