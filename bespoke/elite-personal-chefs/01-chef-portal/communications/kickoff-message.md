# Chef Portal Project Kickoff

*For posting to Basecamp*

---

*[Note for co-founder: Thanks for the thorough review. I've incorporated your feedback throughout: clarified all time commitments with specific session times and daily 4pm check-ins, broke down the Week 2 integration work day-by-day to show contingency planning, added Friday as an explicit buffer day, and reframed success metrics as 'Progress Benchmarks' with Baseline and A+ tiers to allow for variable outcomes. The Monday afternoon session now explicitly includes a reconnect for Claude Code setup, and I've made it clear the spreadsheet automation is independent of portal completion so Thursday isn't blocked. The overall tone now emphasizes shared learning goals over rigid deliverables while maintaining clear expectations for what we're building together.]*

## The Vision

We're building a simple payment system that chefs control. One source of truth for what was charged, what was collected, and what they're owed. No more spreadsheet errors, no more payment chasing.

## The Epicenter We Found

If chefs can easily collect accurate payments at point of service, and those payments automatically flow to Lee's payroll queue, we eliminate 80% of the manual work.

## Two-Part Solution

### Part 1: Chef Payment Portal (Days 1-8)

A simple mobile-friendly app where chefs:

- Enter job details once they're assigned
- Collect payment (dinner parties) or send invoices (meal prep)
- See their earnings

### Part 2: Spreadsheet Redesign for Payroll Processing (Day 9)

Keep the operational flexibility of spreadsheets while eliminating manual data entry by integrating it with Square.

## The 10-Day Schedule

### Week 1: Design the Experience

**Monday, Aug 18**

- 9:30-11am CST: Breadboarding workshop
- Between sessions: Install Claude Code (our coding agent for this project - [learn more](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)) with provided instructions (self-paced)
- 3-4pm CST: Claude Code walkthrough
    - Hands-on intro to Claude Code basics
    - Start static site project together (can continue as week-long self-paced learning)
    - Work backwards from product vision

**Tuesday, Aug 19**

- 9:30-11am CST: Draw fat marker sketches
- Afternoon: Build your own first interface mocks with Claude Code
- 4-4:30pm CST: Quick progress check-in - set expectations for Wednesday

**Wednesday, Aug 20**

- 11:30am-12:30pm CST: Review and refine interfaces (note adjusted time)
- Afternoon: Continue interface iteration
- 4-4:30pm CST: Quick progress check-in - set expectations for Thursday

**Thursday, Aug 21**

- 3:30-4:30pm CST: Finalizing session - connect interfaces and complete demo
- Can we click through the whole experience and feel good? 

**Friday, Aug 22**

- If Thursday is go: No work needed from you, Takuma prepares prompts and materials for Week 2
- If Thursday needs more: Buffer day to refine interface together
- Goal: Clickable experience we're happy with before Week 2

### Week 2: Make It Real

**Monday-Wednesday**

- Wire up Square and database integration
- We will guide the process, but break things down for you
- Deploy to Render

- Afternoon: You build database schema and models with AI
- 4-4:30pm CST: Progress check-in

**Tuesday, Aug 26**

- 9:30-11am CST: Working with Square APIs session
- Afternoon: You implement Square integration with AI
- 4-4:30pm CST: Progress check-in

**Wednesday, Aug 27**

- 9:30-11am CST: Buffer session if needed
- 3:30-4:30pm CST: Deadline for deployment
- Wire everything together and deploy to Render

**Thursday, Aug 28**

- 9:30am-12pm CST: Spreadsheet upgrade session
- Redesign the payroll calculation spreadsheet + build no-code automations to connect it to Square

- Review what we built
- Celebrate progress
- Plan next steps

## Daily Rhythm (variable)

- **Morning sessions**: 9-10am CST (adjust as needed)
- **Afternoon check-ins**: 4pm CST (30 min) - quick progress sync and next-day planning
- **Async support**: Response within 2 hours during business hours
- **Your homework**: 2-3 hours daily hands-on work with Claude Code

---

## Progress Benchmarks

**Baseline**
You've learned to design and build with AI. The portal is deployed, the spreadsheet automation works, and you understand how to make changes to the system.

**A+**
One chef is ready to use the portal with a real customer by Monday. Payments flow automatically to Lee's queue. You feel confident extending the system on your own.

The real win happens at Baseline - everything else is bonus momentum.

## Key Principles

1. **Start simple** - Focus on the highest quality payment experience first
2. **Chef owns collection** - Can't claim payroll until payment confirmed  
3. **Single source of truth** - What client paid = what lands in spreadsheet = what chef gets
4. **Ship daily** - Real usage teaches what theory cannot

## What You'll Learn

- How to find the product epicenter
- How to create elegant product experiences that solve real problems
- How to work with AI to build production software
- How to automate spreadsheet workflows
- How to think in systems, not features

## Your Homework Before Monday

1. **Review the breadboard skeleton** - Treat it as a skeleton to expand upon. Read Shape Up for further reference.
2. **Draft your chef announcement** - How would you introduce this portal to chefs?

   - Focus on their experience: Why should they care? What problem does this solve for them?
   - The goal here is to crystallize the vision so we're entering next week with the chefs at the top of our minds.
3. **Come ready to share** - Your expansions and ideas for the breadboard

This isn't about building every feature. It's about building the right foundation.

Let's ship something real.
