# Day 1: Breadboarding & Your First Ship
*Monday - Two Sessions*

**Let's fire up the kitchen and start building.**

Today we're doing two things:
1. **Scoping the chef portal** - Getting crystal clear on exactly what we're building
2. **Shipping something real** - Setting up your tools and deploying your first webpage

By end of day, you'll have a concrete blueprint for the portal and proof that shipping software isn't magic.

## Morning: Breadboarding Session (90 minutes)

**What It Is:** We'll sketch the portal using fat marker thinking - no details, just the core flows. Think of it like drawing directions on a napkin. We're finding the epicenter (the one thing that must work) and mapping how chefs move through the experience. No pretty pictures, no technical details - just boxes, arrows, and plain language describing what happens where.

**Come Ready With:**
- Specific examples of when invoice/payment collection went wrong
- What chefs actually say when they complain (their exact words)
- The difference between dinner party and meal prep workflows

**You'll Leave With:** A breadboard - the simplest possible map of screens and actions that solves the core problem.

## Afternoon: Intro to Claude Code + Deploying a Static Site (60 minutes)

Quick exercise with Claude Code - you'll create a real webpage announcing the portal and deploy it live. This isn't about learning to code. It's about seeing how simple it is to ship something real.

**Have Ready:**
- How you'd explain the portal to a chef over dinner
- 30 minutes of focused time

## Technical Setup

Make sure Claude Code is running:
```bash
cd ~/epc-os
claude
```

When you type "hello" - Claude will immediately start guiding you.

*Remember: This is about understanding how simple it is to ship something real. The portal itself comes later. Today is just the announcement.*
