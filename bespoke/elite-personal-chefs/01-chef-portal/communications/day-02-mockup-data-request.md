# Day 02 - Mockup Data Collection Request

## Purpose
To create realistic mockup data for the Chef Portal interface design, we need actual chef service data that represents the typical workflows and patterns of your business.

## Task Description

### What We Need
A comprehensive data set from **ONE representative chef** covering **TWO WEEKS of historical services**. This chef should exemplify the type of business model and service patterns you want to encourage more of at Elite Personal Chefs.

### Required Data Fields

For each service/contract in the two-week period, please provide:

#### Core Service Information
- **Date of Service** - When the service was performed
- **Client Name** - Full name of the client
- **Client Contact Info** - Email, phone number, address
- **Service Type** - (e.g., Dinner Party, Meal Prep, Private Event, etc.)
- **Event Details** - Any relevant notes about the service

#### Financial Information
- **Total Contract Value** - The full amount charged to the client before commission
- **Food/Grocery Costs** - Actual grocery expenses for the service
- **Miscellaneous Costs** - Any other reimbursable expenses (containers, special equipment, etc.)
- **Deposit Amount** (if applicable) - How much was paid upfront
- **Tip Amount** (if applicable) - Any gratuity added by the client

#### Payment & Status Information
- **Payment Method** - How the client paid (Square POS, Invoice, etc.)
- **Payment Status** - Paid, Pending, Overdue
- **Invoice Sent Date** - When the invoice was sent
- **Payment Received Date** - When payment was collected
- **Chef Payout Amount** - What the chef received after commission (85% of contract + 100% reimbursables + 100% tips)

#### Additional Context
- **Guest Count** (for events) - Expected vs. actual attendees
- **Team Split** (if applicable) - If multiple chefs worked this service
- **Any Adjustments** - Discounts, changes from original quote, etc.

### Format Suggestion
A spreadsheet with columns for each data field above, with one row per service. Feel free to use whatever format is most convenient for you to compile this information.

### Selection Criteria for the Chef
Choose a chef who represents:
- Your ideal business model (not too simple, not overly complex)
- Mix of service types (both dinner parties and meal prep if possible)
- Typical payment collection patterns
- Standard commission structure (15% to EPC)

### Why This Matters
This real data will help us:
1. Design screens that handle actual complexity, not theoretical scenarios
2. Ensure all necessary fields are accounted for in the interface
3. Create realistic user flows for payment collection
4. Test edge cases that occur in practice
5. Build mockups that chefs will recognize as authentic

### Timeline
Please provide this data by **end of day Tuesday** so we can incorporate it into the interface mockups we're building with Claude Code.

### Privacy Note
Feel free to anonymize client names/contact info if needed for privacy, but keep the financial data accurate as that's crucial for the design.
