# Day 8: Portal on the Internet

Team,

Great milestone today - the EPC Portal is accessible on the internet and the Square integration is working. We successfully tested invoice creation and payment webhooks.

Really good to see this progress from our pen and paper sketches to a working Rails app that's actually processing Square invoices. You've both learned a lot to get here.

**Quick Update:**

I've pushed documentation to main under /docs/ with:
- [go-live-todos.md](https://github.com/chefaustinyancey/epc-portal/blob/main/docs/go-live-todos.md) - The remaining tasks we agreed on today
- [authentication-implementation-plan.md](https://github.com/chefaustinyancey/epc-portal/blob/main/docs/authentication-implementation-plan.md) - Simplified approach (no email needed!)

**Next Steps:**

Pull the latest from main to see the docs:
git checkout main
git pull

Then use these materials to work with Claude on making progress on:
1. Merging Lee's styling changes
2. Implementing the password change feature
3. Setting up error states

Let me know if you want an end-of-day update. Otherwise, we're set to meet tomorrow to work on the spreadsheet automation.

Just a few more pieces before this is ready for chefs.

Kate
