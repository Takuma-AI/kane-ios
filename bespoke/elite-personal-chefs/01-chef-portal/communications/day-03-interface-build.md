# Day 3: Let's Build Something We're Proud Of

## Where We Are

Two days of serious progress: We discovered the epicenter (what's my schedule?), sketched the interface, and nailed down how to present the money equation. The hard thinking is behind us. We know what we're building. Today we make it real.

## Claude Code Setup (Optional)

If you find yourself with a few minutes before our call and want to get set up:

```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/kateleext/epc-portal.git
cd epc-portal

# Open in Cursor 
cursor .

# Initialize Rails (one time only)
rails new . --force --css=sass --skip-jbuilder

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

No worries if you're swamped - we can do this together on the call.

## Things to Have Handy

- [ ] That money equation you were working on (if you had time)
- [ ] If you got the repo set up, great - if not, we'll do it together

## Today: Ship the Epicenter

12:30pm EST - We build ONE screen that does its job well. Not ten screens. Not every edge case. Just the schedule view with pending payments and the money equation. No feature creep, no "while we're at it," no "wouldn't it be nice if." We spent 90 minutes yesterday getting the design right. Now we execute with discipline.
