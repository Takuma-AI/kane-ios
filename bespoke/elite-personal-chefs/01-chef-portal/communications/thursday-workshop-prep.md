# Workshop Prep Message for EPC

## Subject: Thursday's Spreadsheet Automation Workshop - What to Prepare

Hey Lee & Team,

Excited for Thursday's workshop! We're going to eliminate those 10+ hours of manual spreadsheet work using Make.com - a visual automation platform that's 3x cheaper than Zapier and way more powerful than basic integrations.

### What We'll Build (2 hours)
A complete automation that:
- Captures Square payments instantly
- Updates your spreadsheet automatically  
- Calculates commissions (15%/85% split)
- Tracks payment pipeline (Unbilled → Paid → Chef Paid)
- Handles team splits and edge cases
- Sends you notifications when action is needed

### Please Prepare Before Thursday

1. **Have these accounts ready:**
   - Your Square login (we'll connect in sandbox first)
   - Google account that owns the spreadsheets
   - **Create a free Make.com account**: Go to make.com and sign up (takes 2 min, no credit card needed)

2. **Bring 3 recent payment examples:**
   - A standard chef payment
   - A team split payment (if you have one)
   - Any "weird" payment that required special handling

3. **Think about your business rules:**
   - Is it always 15% commission? Any exceptions?
   - How do team splits work exactly?
   - What about tips, refunds, adjustments?

4. **Access to your current spreadsheet**
   - We'll design a cleaner structure together
   - But need to see what you're tracking now

### Why Make.com Instead of Zapier?
- **Cost**: $9/month vs Zapier's $50+/month
- **Visual builder**: You can see exactly how data flows
- **Error handling**: Know immediately when something fails
- **Future growth**: Can expand to client communications, chef onboarding, etc.

### Workshop Agenda

**Hour 1: Discovery & Design (60 min)**
- Review your current pain points with real examples
- Show you Make.com's visual interface
- Design the payment flow together
- Map out edge cases and rules

**Hour 2: Build & Test (60 min)**
- Build the automation while you watch
- Test with your real payment examples
- Show you how to modify it yourself
- Set up monitoring and alerts

### What Success Looks Like
By end of workshop:
- Payments flow from Square to Sheet automatically
- You understand how to modify the automation
- Monday payroll takes <1 hour instead of 10+
- You have ideas for what else to automate

### One Important Note
We'll start in Square's sandbox (test mode) during the workshop, then switch to production once everything works perfectly. This means no risk to your actual payment data while we're building.

**Any questions before Thursday?** Let me know what specific pain points you want to make sure we address.

Looking forward to giving you your Mondays back!

P.S. - After this workshop, you'll be able to build other automations yourself. Imagine automating client follow-ups, chef scheduling, invoice reminders... the possibilities are endless.
