# Day 2: From Sketches to Mockups

## Setup Instructions

Your development environment is ready. Here's how to access it:

### 1. Get the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kateleext/epc-portal.git
cd epc-portal
```

### 2. Open in Cursor
```bash
cursor .
```

### 3. Review the README
The README file has your complete workflow. Key sections:
- **Quick Start** - Initial setup steps
- **Command Reference** - Commands we'll use (`/mockup`, `/database`, etc.)
- **Working Process** - How to start each session

### 4. Initialize Rails (One Time Only)
```bash
rails new . --force --css=sass --skip-jbuilder
```

## What We'll Do After Sketches

Once your sketches are finalized, we'll:

1. **Start Claude Code** in the terminal
2. **Use `/mockup` command** to build HTML from your sketches
3. **Test in browser** at localhost:3000
4. **Refine based on clicking through**

## For Now

Focus on finalizing your sketches. The system is ready when you are.

The repository contains all instructions Claude needs to help you build. Everything else can wait until the sketches tell us what to build.
