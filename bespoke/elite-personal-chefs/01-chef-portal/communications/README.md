# Communications Hub

Daily setup instructions and session preparation materials for the Chef Portal project.

## Purpose

This folder contains communication materials sent to Chef Austin and Lee before each working session. These help them:
- Prepare their environment
- Understand what we'll be building
- Come ready with the right questions
- Install necessary tools ahead of time

## Structure

- `day-01-setup.md` - Day 1 breadboarding and Claude Code installation
- `day-02-setup.md` - Day 2 Rails introduction (to be added)
- `day-03-setup.md` - Day 3 interface refinement (to be added)
- Additional daily instructions as needed

## Usage

Send the relevant day's setup instructions 24 hours before each session to give adequate preparation time.

Each document should include:
1. What to expect in the session
2. Any tools to install beforehand
3. Information to gather or questions to consider
4. Clear success criteria for the day

## Philosophy

These aren't technical manuals. They're expectation-setters that help non-technical founders feel prepared and confident heading into each building session.
