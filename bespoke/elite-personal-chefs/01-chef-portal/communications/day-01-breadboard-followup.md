# Day 1 Progress & Fat Marker Assignment

## Today's Breadboard

[INSERT POLISHED BREADBOARD IMAGE HERE]

We crystallized the epicenter: **Chefs need to get paid.** Everything else is decoration.

The core flow:
- Chef sees their clients and statuses
- Chef enters final service amount
- Client pays directly
- Money flows efficiently

## Your Assignment: Fat Marker Sketches

Before tomorrow morning, sketch these two screens using fat markers on paper:

### 1. My Clients Screen
Where chefs view past and present services (grouped by status - upcoming, pending, paid). Consider:
- How do statuses group? Tabs? Sections? 
- What info shows without clicking?
- Where does "Create new service" button live?

### 2. Service Details Screen  
Where chefs edit client details, service info, and finalize the invoice. Think about:
- What fields group together (date/time/address vs. financial items)?
- What's the flow from editing details to finalizing?
- Where does "Finalize invoice" button sit?

## Critical Rules (from Shape Up)

**"Fat marker sketches are about structure, not appearance."**

Use:
- Squiggly lines for text (~~~~~)
- Boxes for areas/sections [    ]
- X's for images/icons
- Words only for critical labels

**"The challenge is to be concrete without being too detailed."**
- No colors
- No fonts
- No pixel-perfect alignment
- Just information hierarchy

**"Think about what goes where, not how it looks."**

Mobile-first. If it works on a phone, desktop is free.

## Post Your Sketches

Upload photos to this thread - messy is perfect. We're thinking, not decorating.

Remember: "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast." We're building mental discipline before we unleash AI.

See you tomorrow at 9am to turn these into reality.
