## Teaching Philosophy

### Week 1 Focus
- **They drive**: Interface design decisions
- **Takuma guides**: Design principles, user experience
- **Outcome**: They own the product vision

### Week 2 Focus
- **Takuma drives**: Technical wiring, integrations
- **They observe**: Learn by watching and asking
- **Outcome**: They understand how it works

### Progressive Complexity
1. Start with static HTML (landing page)
2. Move to Rails ERB views (server-rendered)
3. Add Rails controllers and models
4. Wire real data (Square API)
5. Automate operations (spreadsheets)

### System Prompts Strategy
- Week 1 prompts: Interface-only, no backend
- Week 2 prompts: Integration and wiring
- Post-project: Full-stack development

## Success Metrics

### Week 1
- [ ] All 6 screens designed and clickable
- [ ] Mobile-responsive interface
- [ ] Clear user flow documented
- [ ] Team can explain every design decision

### Week 2
- [ ] Square payments flow to portal
- [ ] Data appears in Lee's queue
- [ ] One real payment processed
- [ ] Team can modify system independently

---

## Risk Mitigation

### If they struggle with Claude Code:
- Provide more direct examples
- Pair program key sections
- Focus on understanding over doing

### If Square integration is complex:
- Start with manual confirmation
- Add webhook automation later
- Keep MVP scope tight

### If spreadsheet automation fails:
- Manual CSV export as backup
- Gradual automation rollout
- Keep existing process in parallel
