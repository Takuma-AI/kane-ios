# Internal Notes - Chef Portal Development

## The Real Work: Prep Week
Building EPC's own mini "Takuma OS" - complete system of prompts, architecture decisions, and technical scaffolding that makes their sprint magical. The two-week sprint is essentially the test drive for our prep week product.

## Prep Week Architecture
- **Personalized System Instructions**: AI agents communicate in chef-friendly language
- **Project Structure**: Simplified product lab structure with clear organization
- **Technical Scaffolding**: Rails best practices encoded invisibly
- **System Prompts as CTO**: Entire technical decision system in markdown
- **Git-for-Concepts**: Version control for ideas, not just code

## Chef's Core Energy
From voice messages, highest energy around:
1. Being "fucking in it, all up in it" - deep involvement
2. Seeing everything from day one, no black boxes
3. Building together from square one
4. Understanding ROI through chef acquisition
5. Teaching non-technical founders to build

Not asking to learn Rails - asking for control and understanding. Kitchen metaphor perfect: he's executive chef, we're training his AI sous chefs.

## Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Lee out of spreadsheets (measurable)
- **Secondary**: Foundation for chef acquisition tools
- **Long-term**: Platform for "what's my life at EPC?" calculator

## What We're Really Building
1. Development environment Chef uses independently
2. Foundation for entire chef platform vision
3. New way of working empowering non-technical founders
4. Proof that "AI sous chef" model works

## Methodology Extraction
This is project 1 of 3 to extract V1 repeatable template. Every decision becomes part of service methodology. Prep week intensity creates illusion of ease during execution.
