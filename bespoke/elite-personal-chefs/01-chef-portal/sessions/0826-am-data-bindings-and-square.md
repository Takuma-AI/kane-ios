Them: Would say Dearest (Kate) again, so it's like given a double greeting. And so it figured all that out and fix that. Y. Eah. So I got those done. Six. Check, check. And then there's two more. That I got to figure out. One time, amy said. One of the proposals. Just didn't populate correctly. It didn't give the nice flowy email for whatever reason. Fixed. All right. Yeah, Some of the things is just her kind of, like, logging experience, and if it's not an issue that we can recreate. Then. Sometimes those aren't bugs. Sometimes those are just kind of things that happened. If it's not like an issue that we can recreate the environment or the situation and have that same outcome happen again. Sometimes it's not a bug. Sometimes it's just something that happened one time. Right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Understood. We can counsel Amy to report things in a way that is more structured. Yeah. So I just need to make that Google form right now. I made it, like, in five minutes because I just needed something. Yeah. I just did that as you were talking. I made that. Okay. Awesome. Thank you. Shafi. I've teased the bathroom really quick. ciera Thank you, chef. Because it's cool. Because that problem that she put in at the bottom now doesn't exist anymore. So I fixed two of these in one shot. Yeah. Okay. Did you see me trying to make edits last night and I couldn't get it to work? Okay, so you can't see my chat. So I spent, like, an hour trying to get something to work, and it kept telling me that it was working, but it wasn't displaying it. I just gave up, went to bed. There's no issue. When I was just trying to change the black borders and the black text to maybe blue. Just to give it some color and see what it looked like. And I could never get it to work. I'm local. Said it was working. So I didn't push. I don't remember. I think I just gave up and went to bed. I didn't actually push it. Okay? So when you're looking at that right there, The food cost, service staff, miscellaneous, and the box. What color is that on your screen? Can I say something from a design perspective? My preference from a design perspective is for that text. Text, Food cost service staff Miscellaneous for that text to be black. Because there's really no compelling design reason for it to have color. If we want to add in color just for the sake of adding it in. I would add it to the client name. Perhaps to amount due, perhaps to. The cash payout and the equity payout, because those are kind of like highlighting, and there's like, a compelling design reason to highlight those things. And so that would just be my counsel as far as when we look at applying color to typography, it needs to be purposeful and not just for decoration. But that would be just my designer sense talking. Yeah. My concern was that I couldn't get it to work. That's all I'm saying. Okay? Good. Yeah. Exactly. So that did show up. It just looks. Doesn't look good. Okay, cool. I think you see the little. Yeah. I also tried to make the phone blue and the little matte thing of color and then the envelope yellow, and it worked. And then it just didn't work. Then it was gone. So, I don't know, maybe I didn't commit the changes or something, but it looked cool. But that's just little stuff. We can do that one. Yeah, totally. Yeah. I think it just shows one. It gives you an option between the two monitors. Shafi. I added that into the actual farm. So that when abc's the form. Because she's not accessing the spreadsheet to them. So I send the Google form. So I got you on it, though. We're good. Didn't. I didn't realize that it was going to put it after, but it put it after, but it's okay. With this Christina Lebel thing. So you see the screenshot? I haven't checked it. I assume what happened was Amy just didn't like the way it looks, so she deleted it. Now it's gone, so I can't use it to fix anything. I can't do anything with that because it's now deleted. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I understand that. I understand that. Okay? All form updates complete. Other things, okay? Oh, I didn't even know you could do that. It's tiny up there. I don't know how you can see it. Authentication styles fixed. Now. Sign and page styles are now working. It's starting to get there. They give it the pisses me off and I can't put an image in. Also, (Kate) Can you move your mouse around and move your cursor? Can you just click after it's starting to get here. Like, click after the word it in your line. Your cursor doesn't move. How that works. Yeah, okay. Right. Then I just got to figure out why I can't copy and paste into it. Title Bar properties option. Input overflow fixed. Okay? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Opening. Okay? Yeah. We want you to create many new clients. Okay? To check out. Oh, what you were just doing, okay. Yeah. A lot to keep up with, right? But we like drinking from a fire hose. I did that this morning. I ran two claws at once to do two fixes at once. That'd be fucking crazy, though, because it'll just make some shit up. Until we were working on that pricing logic, and it was like, I've updated this to an $800 global minimum. Like what? We never even said the word 800 once. How would you come up with that? Now. No. 800 has never been a thing, ever. Now you put an 850. Eight fifties, our minimum for family style dining. And one two hundreds are minimum for plated. And it was throwing out, like, crazy numbers. Like weird math. Not hitting minimums? I don't know. It sticks now. Yeah. What is it? Yeah. Yeah, okay. I learned CSS when I first started dicking around with Chat gbt. Remember I was like, hey, I'm going to make an app. Teach me how to make a math. No. I don't. Yeah. For this current rollout. Yes. The Future State. The Future State will be onboarding new shafts, yes. Okay? Unfortunately. Yeah, I believe so. Yes. What's up? It just has an exclamation point. Oh, you added that. What are those symbols? In the fields. Yeah. Madness. Okay? Yeah. Config routes. Oh, okay. Aha. Yeah. Yeah, it's good to have that frame of reference and being able to hunt down things as well. Yeah. Yeah. Excellent. Reiterating. Yeah. Is it all ready? Hey, look. Can you just look at this real quick? Hold on one second. So this is what this says to do. In. Cursor. Put this in the bash file. And then I can copy with wind shift and S and then run this command. Does that look like something we should do? To do what? To screenshot. Okay? Yeah. Right. Then can I tell it to access it? Yeah, you'd say, like, access this. Start a new folder. Right here. Right. So get out of there. And now this is another question I was going to ask. Where do I go if I want to make a new folder? Where do I click on. Where's my. Where do I go right now? Unclick everything. No, I didn't hear what you said. In a terminal. Make directory. Oh, yeah. Yes. Screenshot. That's good. Close the Claude folder. I was looking for something earlier. Yes. All right. It is a good time. Okay, so, Dan, what would I do? I would make another folder under Screenshot that just says, like, images. And put it in there. I can dump it right in the screenshot. Yeah. Okay, now let's try it one time. I print screen. This right. Control alt, print screen. Okay? Control, alt, print, screen, and then I go to here and right click. Ok. Paste doesn't work. Control V, make sure you want to paste image. Paste. Okay. Great. Hit enter. I'm going to rename it. Rename? Like this? Right here. Enter does nothing. F2. Is it a hold down function? Yeah, it is F2, you're right. Okay, cool. All right, cool. Thank you for that. Okay? Look. I went to the terminal and did bin rails. Look. I didn't ask it to start the server. Oh, yeah. I meant to do rail server. That's what I meant to do. Right. That's what I meant. The wrong thing. Is it space? Yes, rail server. Where'd you see that? Whatever. Start conserver. Yeah. That's right. Password. Password. Okay, this is an admin dash board. Yeah. Okay, so we got to go put in both the sandbox API keys and the real API keys from Square. Yeah, I kind of remember how we did that. Went into Developer Tools for Square up or something like that. API key. Okay? Okay? First off. Yeah. Okay? Well, yeah, I forgot about that. Tab complete. Oh, you're talking to Claude with this right here. And you're saying, ask the user this. Well, I don't even remember what it was called. Square developer dashboard. Yeah, it would be down in Settings or something. Going off the memory. Oh, my God. All right. Yeah, we want to be in Sam. Yeah. Okay? What do we have in here? Perfect service model and controller. Now integrate square invoicing. Here's how it works. Well. Chef intersects, details total created. Molly Square says invoice of client pay. Square notifies portal. Chef payment, admin fees payment. Jeff and admin. Oh, it created the env for me. Yeah. Yeah. When you first set up the first one, the quote generator, and you connect with square. You went in and made selections, Right. For how square was going to actually operate when it went to the app. Is that correct? All right. Scroll the way down. Find the env. Okay. Sandbox application id sandbox application id. Copy. Sandbox. Application id. And then sandbox access token. Copy. Ms access token. Locations. Yeah. And save control s. Oh, my God. Stop it. What do you mean? How do I get a joke? What? 's the joke? You see what dot? Well, because earlier on our first iteration, we had all those dots, and they were, like, communicating things. What it communicates. Yeah. (Kate) we do have this hard stop at 11. So what do we think we are going to be able to actually wrap up? Initials are in. Access tokens, APIs. They're in personal access, so I don't know. These questions. Many of this. Yeah. Not talk to me like that. I'm just a boy. Oh, my God. Cool. Yeah, Right. Because if there is a standard way to integrate, that's very easy for AI to research the standard way to integrate and then map it to what you have going on. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. It'll work. It'll work it out. Okay? Yeah. Okay? We'll do that. We have our 12 and then a one. And so we'll do work on that between the executive team meeting in our Progress Check at 5, I guess 4 year time. So we'll do all that this afternoon. Yeah, okay. Yeah, all exciting. This is it. I love it. I love it. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Yeah. These longer learning sessions is a lot of information, and it's like there's a certain muscle memory and internalizing the info by doing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The faster we go. Right now. Let's go. The shoe is going to drop at any minute on this, and the price is going to go to the roots. And so we need to be making enough money to justify it. Cool. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah. You're going to kick us out. We know. Oh, you are? Okay. Got it. Okay, guys.
