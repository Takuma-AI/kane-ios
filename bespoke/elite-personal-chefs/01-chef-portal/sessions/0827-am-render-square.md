Meeting Title: EPC Portal Square Integration and Deployment Strategy
Date: Aug 27

Transcript:
 
Them: Saying all this good stuff.  
Me: There's some differentiation that needs to happen, because my problem with that is that it's not clear what the action is.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Now, right? Like in a perfect world. Which is what we thought through. And this is the kind of thing where, as we do more product reps and as we think through things in more detail and have more practice in that, we'll start to be able to preemptively design for those things earlier on.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: In a breadboard stage. We kind of, like, flew past it a little bit. But. In a service is upcoming. The action to the chef is go deliver the service and go invoice the client.  
Them: Right.  
Me: When the action is when an invoice has been. Once an invoice have been sent and it hasn't been paid yet, the action to the chef is make sure the client pays. Those two are different sections. And I think if an invoice has been sent already, even if it's upcoming, for some weird reason, it was sent early. The action to the chef is still make sure the client pays.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: So there's that weird gray area.  
Them: Agree.  
Me: So maybe one way to offer this is to keep it under upcoming services, because it is upcoming. But to pin upcoming but unpaid. Upcoming bus scent invoices to the top. Or something like that. Not to the top of the entire page, but to the top of upcoming.  
Them: To the top of upcoming services.  
Me: Yeah. Or on the ui, show it. And this is where we have basically, like, two types of status in play, right? Like, we have the type of status that's about when the service was. And there's this status. There's basically two status columns that we're trying to reflect. On a very fundamental level. There's. Has this service been happened yet? But basically have you click yet and then there has to service been paid for. Yet.  
Them: Yeah. I'm tracking with that, okay? Yep.  
Me: So we didn't really design what those two statuses in mind.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So that's not ideal in that if we words are really think from about this from scratch, we might come up with okay, maybe instead of three groups, there needs to be four groups. Something like that.  
Them: Yeah. Okay, right.  
Me: But I like that we kept it simple.  
Them: That's what I was going to say. I would lean into simplicity.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. Okay. So do you have a. Do you have a suggested approach?  
Me: I think this adjusted approach is that. You should prevent, for example, people mistakingly Xintong an invoice for something that hasn't happened yet.  
Them: Y.  
Me: But, for example, locking the button. Until that day. Until the service day. I think simplicity doesn't come for free. Simplicity comes with opinion. Like, if you want to keep it simple, you got to have an opinion on how things should happen. Our logic was not wrong. In that if a service, well, if a service is still upcoming, that no invoice should have been sent yet. If the service, if the invoice has been, or if the service is over to you, then the invoice should have been sent already.  
Them: Right? Correct.  
Me: Like, basically, those two status columns should be in sync.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But they're not, because there's manual action that the chef needs to take in order to get them in sync.  
Them: To get them in sync. Yeah. Okay, so while we've been talking about this, I've now just been thinking about a behavior. That I just want to throw out whether we should be designing to accommodate this behavior. Or if we should just be suggesting a behavior al change. We have some chefs. Who like to tee up a lot of future invoices in draft and schedule them to send. So that they have upcoming services and they schedule them to send after they've completed the service, but they draft them all at once.  
Me: Okay? So. This is where you need to take a stance on if they are shifting towards the EPC portal, then should they even be messing around in square at all?  
Them: Right? Yes. There, okay?  
Me: So then why does that happen? Right. That happens. Hypothetically. Because right now, creating the invoice is work. And we don't want to think about that work after the fact. It feels good to see that money up front. Which is for those supposed to do. Like, theoretically. Basically, this portal is the equivalent of. All these invoices have been drafted already.  
Them: And clicking send. Is the thing that. Okay.  
Me: Yeah. Even though they don't exist square yet.  
Them: In theory. Yes. So we are. The portal is actually designing that. Effectively designing that experience of building the drafts.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: But the drafts. Their drafts don't live on square.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Which may or may not be a desired outcome for you guys in the long run.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: It's just more complicated right now to say that every new service already is in sync with an invoice that's drafted on square. And then every time something is updated or edited here, you got to also then have the integration to update it on square.  
Them: Right.  
Me: That's.  
Them: And so I'm just thinking through from my perspective, from an operations perspective. If the draft lives here and it doesn't get created in square until they hit the send invoice button, that makes no difference to me whatsoever from an operational standpoint. And my thinking is.  
Me: It could make a difference from forecasting standpoint of seeing the preview of how much is in the pipeline.  
Them: Seeing the preview of how much is in the pipeline. Understood? Okay, so this is more of a Chef Austin question because, Sheffy, you look more at the pending money in square than I do. I just have faith that 99% of that is going to get resolved. So I barely ever look at that pending number. I look at pending numbers in the sheets. So with the portal. Holding the drafts. That would still that behavior for me still feels exactly the same since I'm relying on the sheets to understand pending and not looking at squared or understand pending. To me it feels exactly the same to look at the portal to understand pending and not have it be represented. Square. But I know that you look at the square numbers. A lot more often than I do. The only reason I do that at all. Just so you know where my mind is. Is in case I have to go fight the client. Right. So if something is like three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, six weeks overdue, Yeah, well, overdue. Overdue will always be in square.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Anyway, because those will have been sent. But there's also that bucket that is, like, pending. That's not really overdue yet. It's outstanding. That's what they call it.  
Me: Like a service. Like that is a service that is scheduled, that has a dollar amount assigned to it, that has no invoice representation on square.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Which, like right now, if the chef doesn't create it on in advance, it wouldn't exist on square anyway.  
Them: Go ahead. Correct.  
Me: In the future, it might make sense as an upgrade to this portal.  
Them: Right.  
Me: I'm just saying that there's that possibility, right? Every time you create on create new service. And you click on Create Service. A draft invoice is created on square and then every time an information changes on this portal, It says.  
Them: It automatically updates it.  
Me: Yeah, that's more complicated.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But it's also more neat and an enterprise grade. Portal would probably do that. There's a reason why we probably would avoid that complexity right now, because you can, as you can imagine with all of these fields, Anything can break.  
Them: Okay? So I want to allow you the space to finish talking through. So that nuance of the overdue invoices will exist in square. But the outstanding bucket that is like those things that are scheduled and in drafts. Those wouldn't exist in squares. So how does that feel? Yeah. To you. That's fine, because then basically you're saying we only use square, but we absolutely need it. Ask to clients right now. Right now. Yes. Red 7 is just internal for the chef.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Correct to save on complexity? Yes, 100%.  
Me: Okay, great.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Okay? So to circle back on the conclusion here. So then what I'm suggesting to stick to our original simplicity. Is. There's unpaid invoices up there. There's upcoming services. There's services that has been passed, has not been paid yet.  
Them: Y.  
Me: Which we need to decide what to do with. Maybe those things. There's an action to the chef, right? The action to the chef is to create and send the invoice. So maybe there needs to be a separate call out that is only there when that happens.  
Them: Meaning that they have completed the service, but they have yet to invoice the client.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Yeah, I think that that should be highlighted, yes.  
Me: So the question is where that would be highlighted. Right. Like, if you look at the chef portal,  
Them: Because they need.  
Me: And let's just say.  
Them: Well.  
Me: And let's just say for now that there's also the weird case of the service hasn't happened yet, but it's invoiced already. That just should never happen. And put enforce that. You could enforce that by locking the send invoice button.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Until the day off.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Basically 10 is disabled. If the date of service is not at least today. That's what happened.  
Them: Okay? Yeah. All right, and let me think through this whole thing of if they completed the service but didn't send the invoice yet and how we are alerting them to this portal. Yo, get off your ass and send this invoice.  
Me: I'm almost thinking that it should be a section up top, like, even above unpaid invoice. That's like, top action. Right.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: There's action you're responsible for. There's action your client is responsible for.  
Them: Right. The action that you are responsible for is to send the invoice. After you complete the service, okay? Yes. I think, yeah. I was trying to think if there is a way to elegantly change the name of. That top. Overdue status area. To elegantly contain both of those ideas, but I don't see something that is. Clear that could be immediately communicate that.  
Me: And to be clear, like, if you have completed the service, And it's same day of it will still be under upcoming because I'm talking about the service was yesterday.  
Them: Yeah, I understand. Yeah.  
Me: And for now, we're simplifying it by making it just like counting by the day, no hours considered. So even if. Yeah, so it's okay. It's for it to say upcoming if it happened this morning.  
Them: Right.  
Me: For now.  
Them: Yes, I understand that.  
Me: In a dirty option. Move it to unpaid.  
Them: I think that that's okay. Yeah.  
Me: And so, with that in mind, you should be designing for that to never happen. Like, as in, you should be designing for the chef to never not invoice, decline until, like, the day after, right? So it's okay for it to be, like, in your face and annoying? Up there. In my view.  
Them: Yeah, I agree. I'm thinking. I'm thinking through edge cases and how prevalent they are. It is a very, very, very, very rare occurrence that we would feel a need to build a client. Fully before a service was completed. I know it's happened in the past. But it's like a rare, rare, rare outside.  
Me: You could leave that button open and just part of the confirm button, there's a confirmed. Do you really want to send the invoice now button? In that dialogue, you could do something along the lines of, in most cases,  
Them: Yeah. In most cases, we invoice the client after the service has been rendered.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay? And I'm not trying to over engineer for something that happens.01% of the time either. So I'm just trying to think through. Because I feel like I've only run into that maybe twice in the time I've been back in this chair.  
Me: All right. Let's not think about that for now. For now. I think the actual thing, the actual design decision that we need to make is, well, the past, but haven't been invoiced yet. And I think that should be a separate I think that should be a separate call out up there, and we don't need to overcomplicate it. We can just make a section that looks exactly like the udders that only shows up if there are. So, like, most of the time, it should show. It should not be visible. So there's a section conditionally visible that has basically action required.  
Them: Okay? Okay? Okay, that makes complete sense to me.  
Me: Okay? So action required, and it's, like, super focused. There's one button that's like, review and send. Invoice.  
Them: Send invoice. Yep, got it.  
Me: We don't have to do that right now either. That's just, like, something I want to call out. I think we should prioritize the authentication and render.  
Them: Got it. Okay? Yep, let's do that.  
Me: And then get something deployed, and then that's a relatively easy fix. That's like a garnish.  
Them: Okay, I got it. Understood.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? But see, this is the kind of nuance that. There's more to it.  
Them: Yeah. Right. Yeah. Okay.  
Me: Okay, chef. Your time to take over. We're ready.  
Them: Buddy. Well, the first thing I'm going to say, (Kate)  
Me: Yes.  
Them: We did a breakdown. We're going to show off numbers. So we did a comprehensive breakdown of every dollar booked on the quote generator so far. We broke it out.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: From dinner parties to weekly recurring revenue.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And I wanted to share those numbers with you. And so from the weekly recurring revenue, and then we added up every weekday book so far at the amount they've booked, plus all of the dinner parties.  
Me: Exciting.  
Them: Want to take a guess as to that number?  
Me: I have no idea.  
Them: $41,441. 1 2, 3, 4, 5, 6789 have been weekly recurring and this is their recurring revenue total in our tlr. And so from 34,000 of it has been dinner parties. So the quote generator has book 41k, which is 6200 in TLR, which we paid 5400 for. So in eight weeks, you built a profitable. AI agent. Which is pretty awesome. Unbelievable.  
Me: Caveat that some of those services you might have booked without it, too.  
Them: No, those were. Yeah, sure. They went to the quote generator and Amy talked to them on the phone, but they still pay you through the votes.  
Me: Understand.  
Them: Which she could do from a beach in Aruba, right? She doesn't have to be.  
Me: Thanks for showing that. And that's exciting. That's great to see. All right.  
Them: Are we going to render and creating EPC portal?  
Me: Not yet.  
Them: Not yet.  
Me: Go to cursor. So we're going to pull from. I have a feature. I have a branch. It was an under feature, but it's a branch called Square Fix. So pull that.  
Them: Pull down the feature branch.  
Me: It wasn't a bigger branch, but it's okay.  
Them: What? I didn't hear you because you were muted.  
Me: Oh, it wasn't a feature branch, but it was just a branch. It will find it.  
Them: Square invoicing.  
Me: No, that's your branch.  
Them: Pull down from GitHub. Pull down from GitHub the branch called square fix. Is that correct?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Pull down from GitHub. The branch square fix.  
Me: Let me just make sure and check and make sure that I'm not being dumb. Yeah, there's a branch.  
Them: Branch on GitHub. Let me fetch it. Yeah, you fetch it. So fetch.  
Me: Okay? The most urgent thing that we got to do is the authentication. Situation.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Actually, it might be right. In that if we deploy to render, we can test the square thing first and then work on the authentication. Because authentication has more unknown, so it might take longer. And the square thing has more predictability. So actually, let's do that. Let's deploy to render. ciera I changed my mind. All right. When it comes back, tell them that I'm in a bathroom. I'll be back in a minute.  
Them: Okay? No worries. (Kate) stepped in the bathroom. Never experienced that shit before, Lee. But it happens all the time. Wait door to door soliciting. Random stranger knocking on my door. That sounds awful. Mindstroke. Absolutely terrible. Okay, done. We're on the square. Fix branch. It's tracking the remote. Okay. Yes. Great.  
Me: Great. Okay? I don't know if you heard me, but I think. We have two tasks at hand. We have one, which is deploying to render and then getting the square webhook working. And then we have our second task, which is to work on the authentication flow, figuring out the sendgrid and how chefs are going to reset their passwords and et cetera. I originally did. You want to see something?  
Them: I'm on, like, day three. I'm on day three of waiting on my Sendgrid account to get approved.  
Me: Okay? So let's not do that yet. Because there's hacky ways for us to get that rolling, right? Like, you can technically ship it to one chef to start testing by creating account for them on render through the terminal and not have the whole flow ready. And you can still test it and see that it works, right? So let's actually work on your Right. Let's actually work on the render thing. Let's first merge this to main so that on render you can set this to main. And also because.  
Them: Main.  
Me: Yeah. Merges with me.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So while it does that. I'm going to explain something. So you remember how. On development environment, we used a EMV file, which is basically the file where all the keys are.  
Them: Y.  
Me: I had this talk with Chef a couple weeks ago when we deployed the booking app. Onto render onto his own render. But on production. Typically, instead of directly supplying render with the keys, which you can by setting environment variables. What we tend to do is we put all the keys in a safe.  
Them: Eah.  
Me: And then we put just one environment variable to on render, which is the key to that safe. And basically we encrypt auto credentials in a YAML file that exists in a code base that is indeed pushed and committed to GitHub. But GitHub doesn't store the key, so then you only give render access to the keys. And this is all because GitHub, even with a private repository. You just tend to not want to directly push and publish your keys on the Internet. Or like on, I mean renders the Internet too. But like GitHub is like someday you could add somebody to your organization. You could like have whoever has access to your repo will have access to your keys and you don't want that. So right now, because our intents right now is to get something on render, get something live. And in the short term, we're also. At least for today, we're still going to be testing with Sam Boss credentials, even though we're on render. For square because we need to test a webhook. So the end. Also the fact that for this app specifically all we need in environment variables. Is the square credentials. We don't have any other API calls. It's all pretty straightforward. So instead of going through all the trouble of the production credentials, we are just going to use ENV and on render, we are also going to just set the environment credentials. By going to the environment part of the dashboard. And pasting in the env file. And renderable. Have access to the same credentials and it'll still be sandbox. Makes sense. And we'll worry about production credentials. When we switch over to production credentials. Which is one we'll worry about, encryption and et cetera.  
Them: And in your mind, are we doing that tomorrow?  
Me: In my mind. We could do that tomorrow or even Friday. It's actually not a big deal. If you want to keep things simple because you don't have a ton of crazy credentials on his ab, this app has no AI as of right now. And it probably won't it for a while.  
Them: Right.  
Me: It's also not a big deal. To maintain all the credentials in your environment variable S rather than doing the credentials the encrypted one, which will be easier for you to manage because you could just log into, render and edit it on a dashboard. So then it becomes less complicated to like, oh, open the encrypted file and like, we're like the. The YAML formatting and all of that. It's like, it feels a lot more straightforward to directly manage your credentials on the environment variable. And it is still secure because render you got to trust a render is secure.  
Them: That's what EM means. Environment variable.  
Me: Environment variable, so it's the same thing. It's the same thing as the environment variables that you set on Render.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So let's do that for now. We don't need to switch over to encrypted until we have to.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Okay? So now it's in main. Let's go to render.  
Them: Yep. I'm going to go to render. We're going to go to my workspace.  
Me: Yes. So you just click icon.  
Them: Add new.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Okay, I won't drive.  
Me: Give me a second. Let's actually introduce you to something new.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So go back to cursor. Say that. You have to deploy this whole thing on render. And you want to do it via a blueprint.  
Them: Blueprint. I want to deploy this on render, and I want to do it via a blueprint.  
Me: So you know how you had to configure. All of the things manually. And set up both the database. And.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So there is actually an alternative. It was helpful to step through the graphic user interface like that. But there is a more production grade, sort of like more automated way to do it. Especially as you imagine more complicated applications will need, like, basically like a number of services to be connected on the same project or whatever.  
Them: Y.  
Me: So there is a shortcut to that, which is there's this render YAML file, which is basically a set of instructions for render on what are the services that you need? And so render basically takes this file and configures all of that automatically without you needing to play around with all the plans, auto, whatever. Now, it is not unlikely that it is going to. Let's see. Ask it to double check the latest render documentation on the plans. So part of that the render YAML file is going to specify what kind of plan. Is you're signing up for because it costs different amounts of money, right? So last time when I did this, Claude ran into errors because it used some legacy value that didn't exist on render anymore. So ask it to double check that. That's just to make. That's just to save us some time, hopefully.  
Them: Okay, double check. Render on.  
Me: On their own documentation. Like double check the specifications on render. For what the plan s available are and choose the most affordable plan because we don't need a ton of volume.  
Them: Can you double check the current documentation on render and then different pricing plans? And we need the most minimal one at this point.  
Me: Ask it why we need the Rails master key if we're using environment variables for credentials.  
Them: Why do we need the Rails master key? For using our. What are we using? ciera What'd you say?  
Me: Environment variables.  
Them: Environment variables. Okay, free tier details.  
Me: Yeah, It'll sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. It's time. For now, we can switch to paid. This afternoon or whatever.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: How you're managing secrets.  
Them: We're not. No secrets here. That's the whole point. Anyone can do it. Oh, my God. Is that going to be your chosen AI voice? No. I'm going to be like Mr. T. Or something. Hey, fool, what are you doing, man? Oh, my God. Hilarious. Don't click there.  
Me: And then ask. Where will I get the square web hook signature key.  
Them: Where will I get the square webhook signature key.  
Me: Understood? Okay, perfect. What about Environment Square? Environment? Ask it. You say that you want to test with SAM VOS credentials on render, so you need to specify environment variables for sandbox two. So ask it. What about square environment? Like there's a. There's a env value right now for square environment. I know that for a fact.  
Them: Okay. Do you want to add. I removed this signature keys right here for now.  
Me: Yeah, it'll be fine.  
Them: So say right now?  
Me: What about square environment? Because I want to use sandbox credentials on production, too.  
Them: Okay, what about the square environment? Because I want to use a sandbox. Credentials. Environment. I can't keep up with all these fucking words. I don't know.  
Me: It's fine. Just say that you want to use. You want to test with Sandbox credentials on render.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: There we go. I got it.  
Me: Okay, great.  
Them: We got it. It's just a lot of stuff that's not, like, native to me, so it's hard to memorize it all, really, that fast? I don't know what I'm saying. I'm just repeating you like a parrot. Yeah.  
Me: Okay, say commit and push this.  
Them: Committed and pushed us.  
Me: So if you scroll down. You see, like at the very bottom of the File Navigator, you see that file called Render YAML?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Click on it. This is the information which is a blueprint for render to build. Your build your application around. So that you don't have to configure all these things on your own.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Okay? So now you're going to go on render.  
Them: Don't render.  
Me: Click on add new.  
Them: Add new.  
Me: Yeah. Blueprint at the very bottom.  
Them: Friend.  
Me: And then connect the first one you see, which is EPC Portal.  
Them: Let's see. I'm going to call it epc Chef Portal.  
Me: Okay, so there was an issue.  
Them: There was.  
Me: Okay? Copy that issue. To cursor. Oops.  
Them: No. Want to let me go all the way? Control copy field Database not found in type file service.  
Me: Field database. Name.  
Them: I'm just going to read it to it.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Field Database name not found in type file service.  
Me: Hands free. This is the spec. I was trying to get it to read. The movement spec. Ific aha. Interesting, okay. All right, Go back to render.  
Them: Back to render.  
Me: Agree.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: All right, done. Great. So now you paste in these three things. Which you could actually just paste in from your EMV file.  
Them: Got it. I think I can handle that. Damn. There it is. Doink. Okay. Here's your square access token. I forgot if the equals counts. No.  
Me: Just a value.  
Them: What's happening?  
Me: On the graphic user interface. On render, there's an option to. Paste in a bunch of values. Straight from the EMV and have that be interpreted, but I guess not here. Okay?  
Them: It doesn't start with 1B. It starts with an EA thing.  
Me: I think it was the wrong thing. No, go back to the thing. Go back to the render. Scroll up. Yeah.  
Them: Wrong one. Right.  
Me: It was Assets Token, the second one.  
Them: Yeah. Access token, but it starts. With all the way.  
Me: No. The evil there that you was there. It was just line. It was just in a new line.  
Them: Okay? This is the access token.  
Me: Yeah. So if we scroll up.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The there.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: It just when there's a hyphen.  
Them: So then the location id. Is the next one, so location ID is the next one, which is here. And then the application id.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Is this one? Locks down. All right.  
Me: Okay? Deploy blueprint.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So now it's creating the web service and is creating a database for you without you needing to step through all of the things.  
Them: Can we manually did it last time. We created both.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Clicked on a whole bunch of shit. And so you're saying that now? It's reading off of. This. Okay?  
Me: So, for example, when an app gets more complicated on rails, And it needs to start having background jobs. Like creating batch notifications that get sent to the chef every week or something. That's not something that happens live on the web app. That's something that happens in the background by something called a background worker. So on render, that's basically a third instance that you need under the same app. Right. So when that happens, all this needs to do is go update the render YAML, and then this whole blueprint will be synced up. And I know. Just create that third service. And then every time you need some change in settings or whatever, the blueprint. You'll work with the AI agent to update the blueprint.  
Them: Oh, okay. Claude will update the blueprint.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: All right, so you see, I just made the database. Now click into the web service UPC Portal purple link. All right. Epc portal onrender com. That's a URL we need. Okay, now go to.  
Them: Square.  
Me: Developer square up. So now we're going to set up a web hook.  
Them: Do you see that? We went over that real fast, literally. Yeah. Wait. I want this. This is your website. Yes. Etc. Portal onrender. Com. Yeah.  
Me: So if you go into web.  
Them: I go into web. Bing.  
Me: And then you go to webhooks. Subscriptions.  
Them: Subscriptions.  
Me: Ad subscription.  
Them: Add subscription.  
Me: So that's where you put the notification URL. So now I want you to pull up. On cursor. There's a file. Called square webhook setup right under render. YAML down there. So it says enter your webhook URL. It says add endpoint. That just means subscription is the same thing. Enter your webhook URL. So the HTTPs. Thing that. But then we're copied that into square. But basically we're going to replace your domain.com with UPC portal onrender.  
Them: Y.  
Me: Com.  
Them: Es. I want to start from this. Go to here. And control. Copy. We go here.  
Me: Notification.  
Them: And we're going to go. Yes. Here. And then we're going to go back to here, and then we're going to grab this.  
Me: All right, deploy field. You're going to click into the deploy logs and paste that thing to Claude. All right? It's looking for secret key base for production environment. But we're not supposed to be using protection environment. That's the error. Okay, so paste, copy, paste. Not that part, not that part. You didn't. That part wasn't either. Just copy the whole thing by going on the three dots on the top right corner. Copy logs.  
Them: Copy logs. Copy log. That's a cool new trick.  
Me: Yeah. All right. Now go back to.  
Them: Still going back and doing what I was doing before.  
Me: Because we got to do that anyway.  
Them: Well, then. Okay, I see what you mean.  
Me: Yeah. So this is the URL that Square is going to use to notify our app that an invoice has been updated.  
Them: Okay, okay.  
Me: Yeah. And then if you scroll down, you're going to need to search for invoice related events you don't want. So these are like one should square notify you. We don't want all of it, right? Like we don't want all actions on square to. Be? Yes. But actually not. Invoice created and canceled, just payment made. Update it. Let's see. Go back to cursor. It had instructions. Payment made, it says update it and published. I'm not entirely sure why. It's needed. For update it and published, but I guess we could set it anyway.  
Them: Okay, so payment made. Updated publishing. Payment made.  
Me: There's no scent like Sense is just published.  
Them: What was the last one? Payment made. Updated post.  
Me: Yeah, you can ignore that. This is enough. The thing that we really care about is payment made. Basically, it'll notify the app, and the app is supposed to match that invoice ID to whatever exists in a database and then update the associated service status to paid.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: All right. Click save. It might run into error because the website isn't up yet. So actually, don't click it yet. Let's. Let's solve the render issue and then click that. So look at what Claude said about that issue.  
Them: Deployment is failing because Rails need to see.  
Me: It does need the master key. But we don't have. A fine whatever. Paste in the master key and let's run with it.  
Them: Master key on render.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Rails underscore master key. No worries. We know how to do this.  
Me: We're giving it the master key, but it's not really using it for anything.  
Them: Where is it a setting?  
Me: Environment.  
Them: Environment. Right. Environment. Environment. Variables. Environment.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Got it.  
Me: Then edit.  
Them: Yes, edit. And then we're going to add a new variable. It's going to be called.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Rails. Underscore. Master into space. Right. Master key.  
Me: Also, there's never underscore encode, basically. There's never, almost never. Space in code.  
Them: Like this.  
Me: Yes. And then the value you already have on your clipboard.  
Them: Look at that, just for a second. Okay, so that again?  
Me: Yeah, you already copied it, so just paste it. And then save. Now you go back to events. Top left.  
Them: Go back to events, right?  
Me: Now it's deploying.  
Them: Yes. Employing. We can watch the logs right here.  
Me: I have a question you to ask Claude. So I want to ask. Is the seed data going to run on production or on render?  
Them: Leap by clicking on. See like apple seed or seat.  
Me: Seed. You know how implanted seeds like Austin illy personal chefs. Com. Austin miller.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: Ask it if their seed data on when you deploy to.  
Them: Is the seed data you made also going to deploy on render? Yeah, I forgot. It's called that seed data. Not called dummy data. It's called seed data. For real.  
Me: Seed. For garden. Okay? Won't run. Now the seed reader will automatically run on deployment. Okay? I want you to also update the seed data so it stops calling you Austin Miller. And that is actually Chef Austen, Yansi. So give her the data. Your email address.  
Them: Stop calling me Austin Miller and call me Chef Austin Yancey. That's a u s T I n Y a n c e y. My email address is Chef austomelchefs. Com.  
Me: Haven't make the right password. Too. Great.  
Them: Is. Yay. Once the deploy completes. Let's watch it. Build sales.  
Me: Not a big deal. Just to copy it again and have it fix it.  
Them: Yeah. Do you want to do anything above it or just this one line?  
Me: This one is fine.  
Them: Okay? We are banging our heads against curse or.  
Me: These are very reasonable. Like errors.  
Them: Claud is my homeboy. What is your homeboy? One of my T shirts call is my homeboy. Fixed. Oh my God. Not to sq light 3 again. Okay?  
Me: So go back to render.  
Them: Going again.  
Me: This should be auto deploying. So go to events.  
Them: So leaves this little purple deploy thing. Here we go again. Missing a gym? It depends on. You need to add it to our bundle. We knew that. Go mining for gems. What is postgres? You see that all the time.  
Me: It's both postgres and sqlite. Are. Just call it different types of databases. Or different ways in which databases are stored. And configured. So it's just database. Postgres is just a database. That render provides and also for rails is typical to use on production. We can ask Claude to give us a more detailed lecture. To break down the dummy differences between Postgres and SQLite, and why escalate is used. On development and postgres use term production. But that is the convention.  
Them: Oh, interesting.  
Me: I would assume that SQLite is easier to run for your local computer. And post production.  
Them: Try to call it white. That's my word. Light is in it because it's actually, like, lightweight type of thing.  
Me: Right. I actually don't know the history. It's a genuine question that we could ask. Flawed.  
Them: Now. Use my tokens on that.  
Me: I don't care. It's just out.  
Them: I. When the money is there and I can actually pay myself a salary and relax and sleep at night, then I'll start that kind of shit, right?  
Me: It actually does not matter. All that matters to you is that there's a database. That database is configured a little bit differently on production versus on Sandbox. Because obviously what runs on an AWS machine is different from what runs on your local computer.  
Them: Yeah, it totally makes sense. SQ light means it's on your computer in postgres. Means that I'm a big boy server. That's cool. Nothing for me.  
Me: Tends. When there's code underlying all of this that tells the app what database to use and how to configure that connection. And sometimes there's errors and it's compatibility and setup. Where ver starts to try to read things as if they're escalite. And that's why errors occur. Or there's some file somewhere on production that tries to reference Escula, even though that is not used on production. And on your gem file. There's actually a section that four gems are only used in development and a section for gems are only used in production. And Escala is one of those gems that are only in development. And therefore on render, if there's something that tries to reference SQLite. It runs into an error because that gem is not installed on production. So right now we're technically deploying it to production. But we're swapping in sandbox. Credentials for just square. All right, click into that. Click in the Equipc portal on Render. Com.  
Them: Look in the way.  
Me: Then try and try to log in as whatever you just told.  
Them: Sepasten.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: How (Kate)  
Me: See if it actually ran the seed data. Oh, it did. All right.  
Them: This is out there on the interwebs.  
Me: Yes. But unlike the unlike epc booking.  
Them: Crazy.  
Me: We already have. Authentication.  
Them: I got two admins.  
Me: Yeah. This is cool. I took a screenshot. Is this your first Rails app? Live on the Live on.  
Them: (Kate) you know that you're muted.  
Me: I took a screenshot. This is your first rails from the ground up. Life on the Internet.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Are they?  
Them: August 27, 2025 Leave. Dude, it took us five years and six months.  
Me: Okay? Now.  
Them: We are tech start. We are text. All right, text status. Yeah, it only took a whole ass pandemic and another few years, we are finally texters.  
Me: Finally text our. Text Neil that quote right now.  
Them: Half our cohort gone, too. I know, right? A lot of those guys are no longer in business. We made it. Up.  
Me: I just talked O'Neill after a pandemic and have the cohort being gone, we are finally capital team.  
Them: Nice.  
Me: Capital s stars. All right. I don't know what's going on with the send invoice button being inconsistent and all of that. We'll fix that.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: Great.  
Them: I fixed.  
Me: All of our problems we solved when we merge lease css.  
Them: Yeah, that problem should be solved, actually.  
Me: Okay? Let's go back to.  
Them: Where's my dream? I like it back in green. It's not green. Where's my colors? Come on. I solved all of that.  
Me: Yeah, those problems will be solved. It'll be easy.  
Them: I fixed all of that. And then (Kate)  
Me: Because now it's live. Now it's live. You're just pushing changes to main and seeing it auto deploy like the old drill. Just don't, just don't overdo it. Don't deploy an entire.  
Them: I don't know. Third. You see what I sent you today?  
Me: Yes, I did.  
Them: 23 page document. Oh, my God.  
Me: Great.  
Them: I had an epiphany. I was like, why am I sitting here and prompting AI? AI should be prompting me. You tell me what to do. You're in charge. And I'll approve it. And put some guardrails in place. And I was like, go analyze the top eight shift marketplaces on the Internet right now, every single one of their web pages, and build a plan for how we're going to do this.  
Me: Okay? We're going to talk through that another time.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I would say that. Heavy on the read. Shape up, please. Because.  
Them: Six week sprint.  
Me: Not everything is about future parody. And if you Frankenstein together everything that it sounds like a good idea on the Internet that utter marketplaces have done. It's not going to be cool.  
Them: Yeah, that's understandable.  
Me: Yeah. But it's a good start.  
Them: Is a cool spot to be at.  
Me: But there's a reason why we started with the chef portal. There's a point of view there. And there's a way and a process for this epicenter, this nucleus, as you called it, to expand towards everything that you mentioned. Maybe not exactly as it's laid out. It's less about it being exactly SS laid out. And it's more like, okay, what is the point of having the features that's laid out there? What are the actual first principles?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Jobs that they're there to serve.  
Them: 100%. Yeah.  
Me: Okay, now back to square the second last tab.  
Them: Back to square.  
Me: Save. Okay? So we're going to go to admin.  
Them: We're going to go to admin.  
Me: No. Basically, the last tab.  
Them: Yeah. Or go ahead.  
Me: Your chef. And by the way, that thing, that red dot up there, that should be the EPC logo. That's called a favicon.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: We're going to make that the chef logo. You'll prompt Claw to do that for you.  
Them: Oh, nice. Love that.  
Me: But actually, favicons are still annoying because of the file format. And you need to create. We'll go into that another time, but I think that's a thing.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, I made that on the other app. That's an icon that basically, for different browsers, they take different formats. And so you need to go on one of those favicon generators on the Internet, upload your logo and create that.  
Them: Create it.  
Me: Or just go to the booking app and copy paste that entire folder over. Yeah.  
Them: Oh. That's the best way to do it.  
Me: Okay? Now here. Let's try opening john smith.  
Them: We're going to open it. To edit it.  
Me: No view.  
Them: We're going to view it.  
Me: Yeah. And we're going to send the invoice.  
Them: So this is a thing that I had to fix the last time where I Do we want this? To say this. Do we want this?  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Box. We do want it. It's like a stock app.  
Me: That's a default thing that comes from the browser.  
Them: And that's like, are you sure?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because this is an action that has customer impact. So you do want to see that. I don't know. So it won't show up here because we're on Sandbox.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: You need to go to. Give me a sec. So go back to admin. This is a little bit unusual. Refresh. I'm trying to see if it actually. Okay, view John Smith again. I don't know. That sent it. Or maybe it didn't merge the right changes. So I think it's more likely that there was an error. But the error was silent, so it didn't show up. Can you go to the render? Check the live logs.  
Them: Y.  
Me: Logs.  
Them: Render logs. Where is it?  
Me: I don't know.  
Them: Connect Square sandbox. Access token not configured. Square location ID is not configured.  
Me: Okay, I understand. I know what's going on. Go through cursor.  
Them: Cursor.  
Me: Basically. On production. My guess is that the code is trying to look for the encrypted file while we are still using the env.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So to say that to Claude and be like, let's fix all. The square service. To use environment variables even on production, because right now it's saying that it's not configured when it is actually configured in the environment variables. So because we put the keys in the environment variables and it tried to go to the safe to look for the keys, the keys aren't there.  
Them: We went ahead and put the square. Keys API keys onto render, so you can use those when testing. Right.  
Me: Call it? No. So call it environment variables.  
Them: We went ahead and put the environment variables. On. Render.  
Me: Because you can't hear me. You do control you. And why don't we just type? For this time.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: You can down arrow to get to the end of the line.  
Them: This down arrow gets to the end of line and then control u back to $. Okay?  
Me: Okay? So say that production code is trying to read encrypted credentials. But we want to use environment variables even on production.  
Them: Scripted credentials. Credential credentials. But we want to use the variable on production. Look at that. With no spelling errors. Are you kidding me? Lee. I can still spell. It. Hasn't taken that away from you yet. Not yet, but it's close.  
Me: That the issue? No, wait. No. That's not what I meant. That's not what I meant. Stop it. Escape. Escape. Escape. Say that? That's not what I meant. I meant that I think the square service, the square integration, is trying to use credentials from the encryptop file which don't exist. And we need to make sure that the square service, which is the file in charge of the square integration. Is using environment variables.  
Them: Yeah. The square credentials.  
Me: The squirt.  
Them: For the encrypted. Key, but we want to use the environment variables that we put in the render on production.  
Me: So it's more like the. So go to the line where it says, square credentials. The first three wars. The square. Integration is looking for the encrypted key, but we want to use environment variables.  
Them: The square. Integration. Square into integration is looking for the encrypted key, but we want to use the what environment variable, right?  
Me: Yeah. That we put into render, not on production. Like production doesn't mean that. We put in to render dashboard.  
Them: Okay? Found it.  
Me: You see the diff, you see? The Originally it was saying if Brio's environment is development, use environment, elves use credentials.  
Them: Real initial. As well instead.  
Me: And now we're saying that access token is just the environment variable.  
Them: Yeah. Totally.  
Me: Isn't it cool? It's like plain English.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Like logic. English.  
Them: Right. We're going to put it in anyways, like within the next 48 hours.  
Me: Okay? We may or may not like. It's okay to keep it on environment and you just switch it over to production. Keys. Literally. You could go on render right now, go into the environment variable s. And then put in square environment equals to production instead of sandbox and then change the keys to production keys and it would just be updated. So then you don't need to worry about the whole credentials. Encryption thing.  
Them: But why wouldn't you just go straight to the encrypted, like right now and skip all the sandbox stuff? What's the advantage?  
Me: So right now we don't want to, because the webhook thing that we need to test, and the only way to test that is on Sandbox, because we need to test that when you pay. The app and handle correctly, and you can't pay a real invoice on production.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Right, like you don't want to do that. So on Sandbox, the invoices are dummy, which means you can just click on the pay button. It'll just quote, unquote, pay.  
Them: Yeah, okay.  
Me: We can add the whole integration works. Because we don't want it to touch the real dollar figures. So that's why, with regards to the credentials thing, That's in some part, a decision that I'm making for you. In that I think in the short term, it's just a lot simpler to maintain, to directly be able to edit your credentials. On your render dashboard, as opposed to going through the whole ordeal with Claude on unencrypting the file and then managing the safe. It's just a lot more manageable to be like, no, here, damn, render. Like, here are the keys.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Yeah. But like the the application credentials that are encrypted are more production ready and like enterprise grade Rails applications will definitely use it. But right now, it's not really that. Like, I mean, come on, now you guys have a shared password with all your. Your chefs for square. Like, it's not like it's any less safe to have your credential directly on Render, which, on its own, is also meant to be a safe environment.  
Them: Yeah. Speaking of, now that we have this technology, Lee, we should probably figure out a way to get rid of that login page and do something. Put it in some kind of lockbox. Okay? Wet logging page. We ask her login sheet, like just being on the drive.  
Me: Yeah. Because there are still a lot of things that we aren't replacing with this product yet. You do want to get rid of that. Having all your chefs log in as Chef Austin on all your services is a huge security risk.  
Them: It's a huge security risk. Yeah.  
Me: Compared to that, pushing the keys to GitHub is less risky.  
Them: That is a huge risk. Yeah. I've been in the background. Trying to figure out how to get all of our chefs independently logged into Square using our payroll system that we already have. But then when we started this project, I was like, okay, let me put that on pause right now. Because I don't want to. Exactly.  
Me: Maybe they don't need to ISO. Square.  
Them: Have. Yeah.  
Me: But they shouldn't need to access Square.  
Them: Right.  
Me: That is square account.  
Them: Yeah. So there's all kinds of cool future states like that, like. Also, Lee, they don't even UPC email if they have it on their own company. Chef alyssa at brand. Com. Yeah. That's why when we were having that discussion around authentication and whether we should just use the Google authentication, we decided to know. Let's have them put in their actual address.  
Me: I mean, honestly, Google could still work. If they all use some form of Gmail. It doesn't have to be illegal.  
Them: Yeah, they don't. Yeah, they don't, though.  
Me: Usually Google Oauth, Facebook Oauth and Apple Oauth will cover most cases. There's one way to sign in.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Okay? So now let's go back to the production app. And try to send an invoice and see what happens. Refresh.  
Them: Refresh.  
Me: No. Refrigerate, send, invoice.  
Them: Refresh.  
Me: Actually check the status on render first.  
Them: Event.  
Me: Deploy failed.  
Them: Fixed database use environment variables.  
Me: Yeah. Deploy failed, so it's not been updated yet, so it won't work yet. So click on. Click on.  
Them: These are two different ones.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: The bottom one first.  
Me: The last one? Yeah, this one is. You want to fix this one?  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Go down. Okay? It's a seed data. So have it remove the seed data from the configuration. Or, like, actually. No paste in that error message. So basically, it's trying to create a new Chef Austin Yans. You want to deploy because of this, and it should instead update the seed logic to be like create if it doesn't exist.  
Them: We're doing this. That copy logs, and that was cool. I know. I love that.  
Me: Do you guys need to leave in five minutes.  
Them: We actually do not.  
Me: Okay? Let's try to not let it overrun forever anyway.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Wait, you do?  
Them: No. We're moving it. No. We just got word from our other team members that they need to move the meeting anyway.  
Me: Okay? Cool.  
Them: We're solid.  
Me: Okay, let's try to wrap in rap soon. I think the goal here is to get square working.  
Them: Unibos aposauts. Yes. Okay.  
Me: Yeah. It's a guest square working, and that's it. And then I have a docs document up there. If you click open docs.  
Them: Yes, I see it.  
Me: There's authentication implementation.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So I didn't overthink this. This is more so some initial investigation that Claude did.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So it's figuring out password reset, emails and stuff like that. So I would paste in this. If you have time, extra time in the afternoon and you want to work on get a head start on this. I would start a feature branch. Link Claw to this folder file. And be like, does this study what's been implemented already and help me understand what this is saying? And let's make progress towards implementing this. Basically, this is the feature that we're trying to implement. At least in this most simple version, is to have an email configuration for the password reset. That being said, if. You're saying that you need to get approved for Sendgrid or whatever. We could also push this back and just have this be a future branch that is in the works and not have to finish it. Before everything else can be done.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: But at minimum, you should create a mechanism such that you can create a chef and create an account for them with their login info. You can create a task password.  
Them: Yeah. Yes.  
Me: So that they can at least log in with the temp password even if the password reset doesn't work yet.  
Them: I just said okay.  
Me: Which is not ideal. But it's not like they're sensitive information on here that the chef has to ask access to that you don't. It's okay for you to know everybody's passwords.  
Them: Right.  
Me: For now.  
Them: Yes. Okay.  
Me: Okay, go back to render and check the status. Let's get the square integration over the line.  
Them: No problem. Escape.  
Me: Events. All right. Yeah. So you see, the plain language find or create by.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: So before it was trying to create a new chef, Austin Yancey, every time. And there's a database constraint that says that email addresses need to be unique. So because your account already exists. It ran into an error. All right, it's live. Okay, go to admin refresh. Click on john smith. Send invoice. So you see how the browser is loading. So now drop over there under unpaid invoices.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: If you click on remind.  
Them: Did we not click into that? Do we say we didn't want it to do that?  
Me: No, it should. I think it's because of sandbox. Quirks. It's okay. That. I think that should work on production. But we can verify that it's okay. Click on view for the john smith. Invoice. And then scroll down. It says invoice sense. Okay, that spacing needs to be fixed. Invoice sense August 27th. And then if you click on that link, It loads up the invoice.  
Them: Okay? And this is the invoice that it is telling us that it actually sent. This is just a copy of it.  
Me: Well, this is the invoice link that you will send to your client. But on the other end, it was already sent to the client.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Viewing of the invoice.  
Them: Viewing of the invoice that got sent, okay?  
Me: Okay? So this part works. So now we're going to click and try to pay it and see what happens. My bet is that it doesn't work perfectly. Yet. You can put in, like, dummy data. As long as you can click that button, I think we're good. Well, let me check with square sandbox.  
Them: What's the real one?  
Me: Payment. Info. I'm Googling this right now. Okay? You need to go to? Let's see. It signs me. It's signed me out, so I need to sign back. In.  
Them: I can just look that up, too.  
Me: Let's see.  
Them: Is there dummy data for square up sandbox testing for the credit card.  
Me: All right.  
Them: You put it in the chat. The other pieces to it.  
Me: Expiration date could be anything. And then the CBV is 1:1:1.  
Them: Okay? Maybe a one. One, one. Now, where is this? Where the hell did that go?  
Me: Actually. Give me a second. I feel that information. I went back. To squares actual website. And the number is different. So let's use the number that's on Squares website.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Four, 1, 1, 11111, 11 1. Yeah, basically 14 and then all ones. All right.  
Them: Be anything. This is all one.  
Me: Yeah. And then just hit pay, I think. Okay? Now go back to admin and see if anything changed.  
Them: Where's my tip line, man? Admin refresh.  
Me: It actually worked.  
Them: Eight and moved it to paid. Awesome.  
Me: Peyton died. Yeah.  
Them: Why do you sound so surprised that it worked?  
Me: Because something always happens. It's always more complicated than you think. This surprised me. I didn't get to test it end to end. But it is relatively straightforward. In that square is telling the app, hey, for this payment made.  
Them: Yeah, and it moved it. That's cool. So the web hook. Is hooked in in this sandbox environment.  
Me: Yeah. So the webhook. So when you created the webhook. We created it under Sandbox. So for production, we need to squish over to production. And create another product. Web Hook.  
Them: Okay. And is that, like, a relatively straightforward process?  
Me: Chef. Click on the square tab right next to this.  
Them: Click on the square tab Right next. To.  
Me: No, up there. Yes. Here you do the exact same. No, that was the right one. You click the exact you do the exact same thing that you did with the exact same URL, but you click on production. You see the production? Toggle up there. Click on production and you add subscription. You will need to create one that's basically identical to the sandbox one.  
Them: What are we trying to do right now? I'm ciera  
Me: No. Lee asked me a question. Which is like the web booked into sandbox. Yes.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Reduction. You're going to need to. We will swap the environment variables for the square production environment access tokens. And then while we do that, you also want to add another subscription here. With that production URL. You might want to delete the sandbox one. Just because then it'll be notifying both. Actually, no. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's bulk in the sense of square will be trying to notify your app with sandbox transactions that aren't actually that the app won't actually take because that don't actually exist on the app because the app will then be switch over to the production. Tokens. So I would delete it, but it doesn't actually matter. But yeah.  
Them: Delete it for safety.  
Me: So that's it. You swap over. You'd create this so the square will notify your app of production transactions. But right now, if you swap over, it'll run into errors because those production transactions don't exist. On the app. But this is also a reason why, now that I'm thinking about it, we might want to create a new app. For this webhook. Which is all the same thing. It's just swapping other the credentials and creating the web hook. So if you go back outside of web, if you exit web.  
Them: If I exit web, okay.  
Me: You create a new one. On there. And then you get. And then you call that new one the Chef Portal. This would be better, because then Square won't be trying to notify your app of transactions or invoices that weren't made on the Chef portal and won't be relevant to the Shop portal.  
Them: So this one. You're saying keep this one as the sandbox. And make a new one for the real one.  
Me: No, keep this one because the quote generator is using this one.  
Them: All right.  
Me: So, for example, actually. I'm wrong. I was wrong in that. It will still notify you of invoices. It will still notify the portal. Of invoices that are paid that aren't relevant to the portal because it never existed on a portal. Like. Of course. We want to get to a future state where all square invoices run through the portal. Right, but that's not tomorrow, so it will still notify the portal of invoices that don't exist on a portal. And the portal should just handle it correctly where it ignores it.  
Them: Oh, love. So already a former client pays. Is going to tell the portal, but the portal doesn't care.  
Me: Yeah. Unless you do the data import and also unless.  
Them: We're definitely going to do the data import. We go live tomorrow. We're not even going to let Alyssa touch this? Without uploading all of her clients. It should just be Max. He has to do it by herself.  
Me: Of course.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Of course, but you won't want to do that. With. You won't want to immediately do that with all your chefs. So. Yeah. So you're going to have a period of time where there's going to be a lot of invoices that don't exist on the portal.  
Them: No, we won at a time. Makes sense.  
Me: Yeah, but either way, it's good to separate it, such that you're using different keys on a code generator versus the portal. So that when you want to check an API log or something to see what went on, You don't have to be like, oh, this one was a code generator. The two things aren't mixed up together.  
Them: Yeah, for sure.  
Me: But I trust that you know how to do that. You just click on new application and it's the exact same thing.  
Them: Don't trust. I know how to do anything.  
Me: I'm just saying, you're just creating a new application and you're pasting in a new credentials, that's it.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Okay? So I think we're good for now in that the basic square integration works. Both on the creating the invoice and also on updating the invoice when it's paid. Which is all we care about. I will say that just now I was a little bit alarmed that the invoice didn't create successfully, but there was no error message. So that's the kind of error state that you'll will start to want to cover. And there's a command for that that I built into the Cloud workspace called error state. I think it's called error state. That is meant to.  
Them: Yeah, right, because then you wouldn't know. The chef wouldn't know that it didn't go.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You didn't get an alert. Yeah, okay.  
Me: And it could be very simple, like just a flash message that has the right error message. I think that was just an error case that it wasn't handled. Like, I think when it gets an error message from Square, right now it does show a flash message. Just now. The issue wasn't that Square returned an API error. The issue was that square was never called because it didn't read the keys. Which should still be covered by the error state. So it's fairly straightforward. And same thing with if you want to create a client, but somehow there's some error in creating the client that should serve as an error message. Too, so that's the kind of basis you'd want to cover. So the two things that are left are login management. And login management, as well as merging lease style changes. Which isn't just git merge because you basically need to cherry pick because there are conflicts with regards to there are changes made to the same file.  
Them: Yeah, okay. I got the cherry pick thing, but Claude can help us. Cherry pick?  
Me: Yeah, like basically, tell Claude that and we'll do this together. I think that, like, that's better. Where we're telling Claude to pull from the main branch and then pull from lease branch, create a new branch. So that we get to test everything thoroughly and nothing is irreversible. And then ask Claw to take all the style related changes from Lee while maintaining all of the logic. And JavaScript changes. On the main branch. Yeah.  
Them: Okay, so let me repeat back to you what you just said. We're going to take. We're going to make a new branch and call it like style changes, and we're going to merge Lee's branch that he was working on with those changes, and the main branch and all that will be together now on that branch. And so then we can tell the cloud command what you just did. Make sure we cherry pick all the changes we want, and then commit all those back to Maine and push them.  
Me: And maybe we shouldn't use the word cherry pick explicitly because then claw take that very literally to use to like get cherry pick feature.  
Them: No.  
Me: Versus we might. There might be. This is more like there might be merge conflicts. And in a case where there are merge conflicts. We need Claude to apply, basically discretionary effort to figure out how to resolve those conflicts, which is typically done by human engineer. Like, when there are conflicts, that human engineer goes by the diff. Like all the places where it's different and it's conflicted and chooses whether to choose the left or right that's what a human engineer does. So when you clock be that person by telling it the criteria of if it's a style change, we're keeping what's on these branch if it's not a style change, we're keeping what's on a main branch.  
Them: Okay? Y.  
Me: And then you test that locally and see if the style changes were applied correctly.  
Them: Eah. Okay, I'm tracking.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, got it.  
Me: So there's this dial bucket. And then there's the authentication bucket. And then there's the error state bucket. Other than that.  
Them: Those are the three things we need to do.  
Me: Those are great things. Between this and being ready to let one chef test it.  
Them: Understood. Okay. Holy jolly.  
Me: And then there's details like it decided for itself what the line items on square should look like. You probably would want have opinions on the wording of the line items and whatever. Basically, the connection between the. Interface of the line, items that you see here and what that translates into in square land. You might want to refine that. And then the tips thing that you talked about is probably a configuration somewhere. In this query API. But those are like garnishes. Makes sense. Okay? So we make good progress. The app is live.  
Them: Hell, yeah.  
Me: Works. With a sorta. You can't create new accounts and the buttons are weird.  
Them: Well, yeah. On this. On my branch. I did address the issue of being able to create new chef accounts. However, I did not test before I logged up yesterday. I did not test. The ability to add new client accounts, so I'm getting there.  
Me: Client accounts. Oh, you mean the new client.  
Them: A new client for the service. A new client for the service. Not client account.  
Me: Right now, you can add new chefs, but does that result in a new chef account that you can log into? It's a different story.  
Them: Correct. That is a different start. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? We're good to go.  
Them: Excellent.  
Me: So the quote, unquote homework. We can see if we want to do the afternoon check in. Let's make it an on call thing. Like, if you have a question, if you want to do the check in, we can hop on, but if not, we don't necessarily need it.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The homework would be to start a new feature brand and chisel away with Claude at that potential authentication implementation. For the email, but huge caution on don't over complicate it like Claude will overcomplicate it. It's very easy to overcomplicate authentication and reset password and stuff like that.  
Them: Okay? Just like a high level. A high level of our simplified map for authentication. Is because I heard it say just a couple of different things, and I want to lock in on what we feel is the best strategy for right now that has room for the future.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And for right now. We were going with the simplicity. Of us being able to set their initial password and them being able to update that password when they upon login, Is that correct?  
Me: Yeah. So the simpler way would be that instead of needing to set up the email server and everything, The simpler way would just simply be that you can set their password. And you can probably also view their password. And then if they do want to reset their password, it would be the mechanism where they enter the old password. To confirm their identity and then reset their password. But then I think to keep things simple, you should always be able to see their password on admin.  
Them: Okay? And that eliminates the need for us to send them an email.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: That gives them some kind of a link and tells them whatever is and blah, blah, blah. Because we can just do that. We can just tell them, log in with these credentials.  
Me: Exactly. Exactly. So I don't think that Claude markdown foul even covers that simplification. Which are probably discussed at. Or I can pass you guys a better markdown file that captures that simplification. But I think that is the easiest. And then the decision that you got to make on your end is deciding where to put the entry point to the reset password. Or maybe you don't need that link at all. Maybe you send them that link. Or something. Basically, how accessible is that link from the portal?  
Them: The reset password link.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And where is it kind of thing.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Styling authentication completion by letting chefs reset their passwords. And making the password visible on admin. And then what was the last thing I said?  
Them: Yeah. Eric.  
Me: And then the actual last thing, which it already kind of works. But the additional garnish is the alert that we talked about for services that has been passed. No invoice has been sent.  
Them: Said. Okay? Yeah. All right.  
Me: Section at the top. But I will put that at the very last.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: After everything else is done. That's basically a new feature.  
Them: Okay? Go as end of day tomorrow.  
Me: Yes. And tomorrow we're also doing the spreadsheet.  
Them: Okay? Okay? Wait. What's fighting? We're doing this, Frenchie.  
Me: Where we're designing these spreadsheet for automating payroll.  
Them: Because we still need the data collected somewhere because this isn't hooked into square payroll, so it's still. Data to be.  
Me: Where that data exists right now is square.  
Them: Yeah. So we still need to be able to pull that out so that we can verify. And we can see that into the square payroll system because right now it just seems heck it complicated and messy for us to try. To click a button and say, run Payroll.  
Me: To be clear, your existing workflow still works because when a client pays, you still get the square notification. It's just that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Instead of you manually watching for square notifications, it should just land every single invoice that has been paid onto a spreadsheet. Where, then the thing that we need to figure out is what is the invoice format that will allow something like a make.com or Zapier to extract the chef's name in a format that lands well on a spreadsheet? From the invoice. Basically 's name. Is just in a description right now. And we could make it a custom field on Square, But I tried it yesterday, and Square's API requires a paid plan. On the developer platform in order for you to be able to create invoices with custom fields. So the hack around that will be to keep the chef's name in the description, but follow a standard pattern that makes it easy for us to pass it through a filter fail proof, where something like an automation will be able to extract the chef's name.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: From this.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So that you have all the fields and columns you want. And not just a chef's name, but like all the fields, we need to align on a format of the description such that our automation can extract those fields from the invoice and land it on the spreadsheet.  
Them: Yeah. Okay? All right? And it's bulletproof as possible, okay?  
Me: Which it will be as long as invoices follow that format. It'll be bulletproof and we can have fallbacks on like okay, if that fails, it still lands on the spreadsheet, it just has the amounts without the and at the very least, it has to pay your information, so you'll have the customer name and you'll have the dollar amount. And at the very least, the worst that could happen is that the chef name is missing in the service details.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Are missing.  
Them: Okay? Okay? Okay. Yeah. It'll be like. It'll be good to talk through that because there is, like, the other nuance of the difference between what the client gets charged and what this, what the chef actually gets in payroll because of the. Minus the EPC commission, which I know can be like that. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, yeah. That's all. Like easy spreadsheet logic once you decide what it is. Or, like, about what it is. So that's why I blocked out, like, two hours tomorrow, I think, or something, or more than that. Because that's stepping through that calculation logic.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And a perfect thing about that, Lee, is that directly sets you up for me. And you next. Just do the KPI spreadsheet from that? Yeah, very easily.  
Me: You didn't understand the components. This was like automations is my personal passion. It was my personal introduction to tech. Basically, it was like I was on an ecommerce team. Working up things. It was a Magento backend for ecommerce site. And they had a lot of promotions that the marketing team wanted to do that the ECOM team insisted were impossible.  
Them: Hello.  
Me: To set up. And then I just played around with Zapier and created the most insane, complicated Zapiers that they've ever seen.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And now. I didn't know it at a time, but that was basically programming.  
Them: Right. Yeah, I messed around. As if you're just a little bit in the past. And then Nat went crazy on it. And it is.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Basic level programming for people who don't know how to travel.  
Me: I would argue that it is basically code, like in a sense, of the logical building blocks.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And understand the basics of how data flows by working with stuff like that. At my peak, I had a spreadsheet that managed all the paid memberships. Of a local grocery chain in Hong Kong. And when I said, at my peak, it's like that single spreadsheet managing all the stripe payments for the paid subscription and everything. That spreadsheet has seven zapiers running on it. Like automating. It wasn't just one zapier that automated records on its spreadsheet, it was like.  
Them: Oh, wow. Yeah.  
Me: It was intense. It was basically an app.  
Them: Oh, my gosh.  
Me: Like, a checkbox for, like, when you're ready to send the invoice.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then take the checkbox onto Google Sheets or trigger Zapier to go send the invoice.  
Them: Oh, my gosh. Amazing.  
Me: Portal is a spreadsheet. And, like, the checkboxes are buttons. That's what it was. And drop downs.  
Them: Yeah. Wow, right? Okay?  
Me: All right, so.  
Them: All right. Yeah. Good deal. Really good. Really good. Productive session. I cannot believe that we are actually tapped into square right now in this environment. So cool.  
Me: Yeah. Then it's live on the Internet.  
Them: Yes, and it's live. Which is amazing.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay. All right. I was taking notes. On the homework, but I've also been transcribing. So we should be good.  
Me: Great.  
Them: Should be good. Okay. Awesome. I need to put my mind a little bit onto in the business stuff for just a little bit, but I'm going to be banging on this. This afternoon. Yeah.  
Me: Is it's going to work in the sense of between now and Friday, there's, like, plenty time for this to be, like, production ready for at least one chef.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Me: Not that far. Yeah.  
Them: Excellent.  
Me: All right.  
Them: Excellent.  
Me: On track exactly as I predicted. Originally on the schedule.  
Them: Awesome. Perfect. I love it, I love it, I love it. All right. Awesome. Thank you. (Kate) appreciate you.
