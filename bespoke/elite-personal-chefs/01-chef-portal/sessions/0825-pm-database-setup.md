Them: Yeah, okay. Hell, yeah. Okay? Yeah. It looks so much like a terminal. You don't think about it. Because it is a term that's a bunch of red tags. Yeah. Tom fullering. Tom flew. ciera Getting tv on for jules. I know. I can't believe you show us that. Oh, my God. Seth, remind. S looks so cool. Close this. Okay? Okay? Yeah. You got it. You got it. It's the one next to it, isn't it? You got it. Yeah, up at the top. Burger. Yeah, that's the burger. Go. Click on View. Oh, to see what it looks like in mobile. Yeah. Click on view. Got it under shanna. Yeah. Okay, once again, she has everything on her tongue. Everybody's going to do everything on their punk. Wow. Okay? Yeah. Right, okay. Okay, okay. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay. Okay. All right. Like, part of the responsiveness. Of the css, okay? Wise men changed. Yeah, okay. Cool. Yeah. Now we're going to look at admin. Oh, can I ask one thing on this page before we. The tax here says 9%. Was that something that we decided? No, it's just a change we have to make. We got to make this taxes and fees and make it 4%. Okay? And then I'll put, like, a comma in there. That's in money format. Okay, go to admin. Oh, yeah, definitely. The chef can't mess around in the admin. Only a weekend. It is not loading. Yeah, it's still spinning. Get rid of. The admin people. Oh, the admin people. At this current time, yes, at this current time, Chef is the only chef that is also an administrator. But that may not always be the case. But yes, that is kind of the current model, yes. Yeah. Okay? Yeah. Right? What? He does graphic design. I do. Okay? To get out of here. Yeah. I'm here. I don't know why it defaults this. There we go. There's our colors. Yeah, right. No. Okay? Okay? That's understandable. Oh, on the left page. Okay. So what would be an alternative way of doing it? Yeah. Okay? So I think that we will need to kick off an email because we are not currently requiring that all of our chefs have elite personal chefs email addresses. Yeah, right. It's just a decision point. And that's why I said we do have a perspective on that, so that's why I was asking. I think that Shafi was working with Sengrid. I'm signed up for the 10,000, 50,000. Per month. Back to. Yeah. There's a button for it. Okay? Okay. Yeah, because duplicative of what's on the quote generator right now. And these particular preferences, like preferred service type, there may be a client that does private events and meal prep and whatever. So having it specifically be about the client and their contact information. And then all of these other things are generated as they look into new services with us. Makes sense. Yeah. Okay, I understand. I understand that, yes. Right. Okay, that makes sense. Build something that is slim, that we can ship quickly. That has the capability to be woven into the larger ecosystem. Okay? Yeah. Okay? Right now. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. That makes sense. I'm tracking with you. Okay? Service preferences. And billing information. And we're going to remove from the add new client form. Okay, I'm going to look at that. Tamir Reed. Where'd you go? Oh, you're here. On the ad new client form. Let's go ahead and remove service preferences that section. And also let's remove the Billie information. So that it's only the contact information card. Man, I (Kate) Say it one more time. Before you end it. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. We need change log up anymore. Start a new cloud. Full ass new Claude. Database md. Damn it. 's. Y. Eah. I mean, we're recording this, right? So whenever we need to revisit stuff, we will. Because, like you just said that you were able to download 37 signals code base. How fuck can we do that? That is pretty cool. Where do you get to code? Off? Of what? Inspect. How do you get to cope? Yeah. Right. You have to show me that sometime. Yeah. Interesting. Let's look what it says. That's going to be a question. Form has controller have missing. Okay, that shouldn't be. That's generally not how our chef's finances work. Sure. Go ahead and start. If you start talking and then I press it, it will. We figured that out. So go ahead, start talking. It cut you off. We got it. You're going. You're going. We're live. It's recording. Hey, we got it. Look. Cool. I know. I'm just saying, sometimes I can't figure out how to get it to record you because it cuts you off. So you have to be talking to, like, three seconds before it works. Goddamn bank is calling me. I need to take that. Okay? Okay? Correct. Okay? Okay? So you can just do something as simple as 2A, right? All of these values are calculated. But we need to change the tags. We change the tax right now or do that later. Change the word tax to taxes and fees and make it 4%, not 9%. Okay? Just FYI my mom Jamie blasting here with JT So it's going to be a little hectic. Okay? Thank you. Chad. Oh, lord. I already deleted me. I deleted. That's not what he meant at all. Okay? Say it again. Control u. I. What chef do we have? Yeah. You said we don't need the Arrow. Give me a second. Did you leave us? No, I'm in the middle of an. There we go. That's a potential. Okay? I mean, I have. I have a baseline understanding of the (Kate) Chanel databases, but, I mean, I've never had the opportunity to need to, like, construct one. Yeah. Okay? Everyone. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, because it's just about bloat. You don't want a whole bunch of empty stuff. Pairing. Yeah. Thousand of them. Yeah, okay, I understand. Yeah. I think it's probably loud over there, and he's trying to mitigate it. Like that one. I couldn't hear you guys. As soon as I hit Whisper Flow, you cut off immediately. Oh, really? Okay. I don't know why. Sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't. Yeah, I feel you. All right. Thank you. What is it saying now? Okay? That don't need to be there. Yeah. Right, okay. Do we have a plan? Okay? I just want to make sure you get the words. Right. Yes. Oh, you know it on service address Es that can also have unit. Guest count. Guest count. The words are very specific to private event, but guest count. The idea blends over to meal prep when you want to know how many people you are cooking for. Your vote is what? Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay, how's this coming? Basecamp or chat or what? Oh, it'll make sense to Claude. I'm sure you've thought of that already. Don't try to be nice to it. Well. Exactly. I would advise you to start being nicer to your. User is giving me a lot of feedback on the data base. Okay? Yes. It's just like the first time that I've really seen the inner workings of building out a database. Because generally speaking, anything that I've been doing has been very simple. Straightforward Fields, right? There you go. Nice. Of the database? Yeah. Oh, boy. We got to decide. I'll be going. Where did I just. Okay? Okay? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. As we grow. Oh, just empty stuff. Yeah. Okay. Look at that. Oh, my God. Great. Oh, my God, yes. Yeah. Right? Yeah. We spent an entire day. Just like sketching the first screen. Yeah. All of this. Oh, okay. Yeah, right. Yeah. Well, yeah, right. Yeah. The definition of code is broad. Right? Yeah. It's trying to test. Not yet. Yeah. Understood. Yeah. Look at that. Okay. Were those two buttons? What's going on there? Oh, edit. Okay. Yeah, that's the shop size. Okay, I understand. I get it. Okay. Type in Shannon. Start typing in Shannon's name. Start a new Claude and have it meticulously study the Covid. No. Yeah. Yes. Please, in its entirety and find out why things aren't working like they should be and give us a plan on how we should fix them. Look through every single line item, every bit of code for some of the things aren't populating and they should. So go discover those and then tell us that what you just covered and show us the plan of how to fix it. For example, the new service form is not letting you choose from clients that exist. The information client like their email address, phone number and location are not showing up on the View. If I view a client service. How much time do you have? Seth, Are things getting wild over at your place? That one's going to run. All right. And on this one over here, we're telling it to study the code base and come up with use cases for testing. Study the code base and come up with test cases that I can click through to make sure that the app works and that there's nothing failing. It should be a comprehensive test of the entire thing. To come up with those scenarios. Over here. I ended up okay. Yeah, we had something set for tomorrow morning. Yeah? Yes. That's a (Kate) Relax. Ing. Yeah. Make a dark folder and save this as a markdown file so we can refer back to it. Right. Okay, what about over here? Yeah, try it. Yes. Go ahead and implement these sixes and then meticulously study the entire code base and identify where there are more issues. And fix them as well. Right. Okay? With this data binding. Okay? I can kill this screen over here. Okay, good. To know. Okay? I think so. And so when you say push there, I say push this. These changes up to GitHub. Let's get push origin main right. That's the command. Hold on two seconds. We got to commit first. How come we don't have to name them in this one like we did in the other one? Is it naming him on its own? Nice. Oh, okay. We'll get there, okay? That's funny. Now I got to call Rick. Lee can catch up with him. And the deliveries are done. And Cardell finished his. Sent out the invoice. Yeah, I know. There's all kinds of. I have to run payroll. No, it's okay. No, we're good. We're, like, doing things. Yeah, right. In the morning? Yeah. 10:30. Yeah, we got one mile. Cool. Okay, we are back. Love it. Oh, Wednesday. It's a buffer session. Okay, cool. All right. Good deal. Yeah, and that sucks up time. Yeah. Okay, awesome. All right, Shafi, I'm going to run payroll. It's 36. 36 6.
