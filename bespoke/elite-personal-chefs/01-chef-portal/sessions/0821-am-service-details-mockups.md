Date: Aug 21

Transcript:
 
Me: What's up? You like what I did?  
Them: Lee and I were talking about how cool you are yesterday.  
Me: What?  
Them: Yes. Hello? Hello?  
Me: Hello? Hello? Hello.  
Them: We're like, I like (Kate) She's cool. He's like, hey, it's cool. Yes.  
Me: Thank you. You like what I did to the mockup? All right.  
Them: How do I get my hands on the actual HTML file?  
Me: It's on as of right now. As of, like, three seconds ago, it's pushed to main.  
Them: Did you paste?  
Me: Or actually, like, as of last night, I pushed it to a branch. And then I decided to push it to main, but I kept two versions, so I did mock up View on and Maka V2. So now, if you share your screen. At the bottom of cursor, there's a refresh button, which basically pushes and pulls the latest changes. From the repo. And then you'll see that.  
Them: Synchronize. Markup v2. Macho v1 mockup 2 mockup.  
Me: Oh, you can ignore Mockup. Actually, mouse, just v1 and v2. Mockup is a duplicate. You can delete it if you want. V1 is what you had by the end of yesterday, and NV2 is what I spent some time chiseling last night.  
Them: Weren't you just a chiseler?  
Me: One of the word is weird.  
Them: That's going to be at the bottom of Clyde chiseling.  
Me: Chiseling. So do you hear your screen?  
Them: All right. Oh, yeah. I'm ciera  
Me: So today, I think.  
Them: By the way, canceled my subscription.  
Me: Great. That's cool.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Y.  
Them: Through September 18th, though, so whatever.  
Me: Eah. So just a few things of what I did here.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: I didn't make a desktop yet because I didn't find it necessary, because I feel like we kept the information here so simple that it kind of works the same anywhere. If we want to add more rich information on desktop, we can, but that's a later thing that we could. It's optional.  
Them: Okay. I still read what (Kate) did.  
Me: Wait. What are you looking at?  
Them: I'm trying to look at. Where'd you write? This what you wrote?  
Me: So this. You won't see my cloud history, but you'll see the code. If you want, I can find that file. Paste it to you so you see what prompts I did. But I can send that to you after the meeting.  
Them: This should fill all of our stuff.  
Me: Yeah. This is still your chat history.  
Them: Yeah, okay.  
Me: When you opened it in a browser, you saw. It in you. So just walk you through real quick. I didn't make desktop changes just because it just didn't feel necessary at this point. I do think that on desktop it's not extremely space efficient. You can be looking at a lot more contracts in a single view than this. Right now, you're looking at four, max. But it serves a purpose for now. The main thing I did was I made the headers less heavy. And then I did the color coding on a numbers because ultimately, it's the money that's missing. And I push remind button to where the money is.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Because that's what it's about. And then the view and copy is kind of, like, consistent across the board. I think there's an option in the future for you guys to make the view and copy less overt. Right now, it doesn't hurt to have buttons be very in your face. Especially for, like, a utilitarian purpose.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But for an aesthetic purpose. It could make sense to make the copy more like an icon or whatever. But I think for chefs, keep it simple, keep it. Blatant. That makes sense. So that's most of what I did. It's pretty self explanatory. So I think the goal of today, I think this workflow works between us, where you guys get started on something, and I kind of just, like, at the end of the day, put in a little bit of sprinkle of what I see as what's good. So I think today we just want to do this exact same thing. But with the screen that we were sketching yesterday, Like the screen where you view the details of a service. You see the client details, you see the information links or whatever, that we can have a note field where you could put in nodes on what this client wants. Just in case. It's a scratch pad. And then on the right, it's the line items, the calculator. Like there was the finalized invoice, so we want that.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And then I think the way we're going to do this is we're going to kick start that process right now. Push some guidance to you around different ways to prompt Claude more flexibly pasting in images. All of that stuff. And then you guys can take it away for the rest of the day. And then just push it to remote by the end of the day. We don't necessarily need to do an end of day check in. And then at the end of the day, I'm going to pull whatever you guys worked on and I'm going to chisel it a little bit further. I know that yesterday. The other thing that I wanted to touch on is that, strictly speaking, There was, like, one more step in the middle between this and wiring things up. Right now, we're looking at, like, completely static, like a single file HTML mockup. This is, like, a true mockup. Before we get to wiring up the database such as this is working with a real client data that you could add and use service and all of that stuff. There's also the step of rearchitecting these HTML files into what is called ERB templates in Rails. Which means that basically, for example, if you look at one of these rows, This is a service item. Right. There's going to be a. What's called a partial in rails. That's like. This is the template for rendering a single service in the whole. On the home page, across the board. So, like, there's a step where Claude basically needs to go into this template, figure out what the components are, take that out, and organize it in a way that is scalable and reusable by Rails.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: But erb templates, unlike JavaScript, React. Components or whatever, like erb. Templates are very readable. Like, you look at it and it basically looks like HTML with some variable sprinkled in. So that way, like, when it does that, it'll be cool that you guys will get to see the difference between that architecture and, like, how those folders are organized versus this single monolith of a file. I don't want us to worry about that today. I think the goal for today's success means that for as many of the remaining screens as possible, we have something like this. And so the main remaining screens is the service details. Login is kind of boilerplate. Like, you can make it, but it's not rocket science. And then admin. There are other screen that is important. That we could push to tomorrow is the new service form. There are some details we need to figure out there. With regards to are we storing client profiles and drawing from the same client pool? Or are we retyping the client emails every single day or every single time? Service. Make a copy. There's some decisions we need to make over there. But for now, let's focus on the service details. At minimum by the end of today. Let's have the service details page. And at least a draft of the admin page.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And, Chef, you're now, like, a super experienced person in configuring what an admin panel needs. So it's the same.  
Them: Yes. Ma'am. Success. Walking into Monday morning. Is for me. Five pages. It's this one. Services. It's service details that you just said, which is coming next. It's admin, it's login, and then it's like Chef's Corner.  
Me: No chef's corner yet. Let's make that thing. That's the dessert. That's a treat.  
Them: Okay? Yes, chef. Yes, chef.  
Me: Everything else.  
Them: Lisa.  
Me: Just because we're now focused on his one job, which is to get paid.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: But there is one more thing. It's going to be able to reuse a lot of the same. We might be able to. It might make sense for us to reuse basically the same code as the view details, the service details. Pop up to do the new service form.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Right? Because you're entering a lot of same information. And in fact, in Rails a lot of most of the time. An edit form is the same as create form. It's just pre populated with the existing data. So let's start from the view details form, and then work backwards to see if we could just reuse the same thing for the new service.  
Them: Okay? Okay, service details today. Admin is a maybe.  
Me: Admin is it? Maybe. Yeah.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And now, again, we don't need to worry about because it's simple. And Chef's Corner is going to be next week.  
Me: Chef's corner is if you want to work on it, you can work on it. You've been gifted with the prompts to work on it. You can work on a version of that. It's up to you.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: In whatever. Basically, whatever code you push, whatever mockup you push, I'm down to. I'm down to help refine it.  
Them: I love it.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Let us do some damage.  
Me: Let's do some damage. Okay? So if you go back to cursor.  
Them: Let me ask a really ignorant question.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Why wouldn't we? Go onto the top five marketplaces on the Internet right now and screenshot these pages that they use and put in this. Use them. As the mockup.  
Me: You can. And also, let me think of the best answer for this.  
Them: Do you understand what I'm asking?  
Me: Yes.  
Them: I go get to the checkout screen on Angie's list, don't actually check out and just screenshot it and upload it as a mock.  
Me: So the answer is we can. But a lot of times what that will lead to is a lot of elements that don't belong.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: I think right now, for these two weeks. My goal here with you was to. Transfer the skill to you to know what you're doing from the ground up. So that when you take shortcuts like that in the future, you know what the trade offs are. And reality is, sometimes people do take trade offs like that. And in fact, if you hire a professional designer today, the first step that the designer would do is to fetch a bunch of UX UI inspirations and dump them on a figma, right?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So this is almost like jumping that step from taking an inspiration to treating the AI as the designer to also be able to then interpret the inspiration into what's actually applicable. What you're going to end up with if you take that route. More often than not. Unless you're very disciplined and very clear minded. With what exactly you want. If you take that shortcut. You're going to result with an interface that is actually just a copy paste of what other people have done. Which is fine if you're a copy paste business. But you do have unique quirks about you, right? So then you're less so designing a high quality experience from the perspective of what your unique business needs and you're more so borrowing whatever other people have done and bolting on whatever is missing from there. Which sometimes is good. Sometimes the alternative to doing that is not doing anything at all. Because you don't have to time to think from scratch. But then building the muscle so think from scratch means that even when you take that shortcut, You have at the back of your mind the caveat and the nuance that not everything here is applicable and you know how to steer it. Like if I pasted a screenshot inspiration to mock up today. I would basically be running, like, quick short circuit versions.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Process that we've been going through to figure out, wait, this makes sense. This does make sense, this element. But that's because I thought through that process many times. That answer a question? You can. A lot of people do. It's a huge hype cycle right now of people going on the no code tools, like lovable replit, like base 44, all of the no code builders that are like, why do you want to build today? And then you just put in their prompts and it just. Built, and then you can paste it in the link of a site you want to copy, and it'll basically clone it. But that's not. It's not a scalable thing most of the time, because that thing was not designed for you. Therefore, from the ground up, you're not thinking of what your business actually needs. It's just ticking the median of what's out there.  
Them: That makes sense.  
Me: Yeah. You might want to do that for, like, admin, because admin is pretty relatively boilerplate. It depends on how much you care about it.  
Them: Well, yeah. When we're talking about admin, we are talking about the side of things where we enter a new contract information and assign it to a chef, correct?  
Me: Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that is pretty boilerplate. You could, like, screenshot. In fact, there's a world where. There's a world where you don't build admin at all, and you just, like, wire the system up to, like, an air table or something.  
Them: Wire up to what?  
Me: Like, basically use an API to connect it to, like, an air table or a super base, a supabase that you can just manage like, and that is your admin. Versus having your own custom built admin page. That is always an option. But there is, like, more complexity to understand on the front of the integration. But.  
Them: Can you show me something stupid?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I'm ciera I just trained me for a second.  
Me: Nothing is stupid.  
Them: Can you show me how you put this jpeg in here?  
Me: You can do that in your file system. Or you can. Well, if you click on file.  
Them: On top left file.  
Me: Okay, the bottom line answer is there are about 10 ways to do this.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So this is. Just remember that this is just a folder in your file system. The same way so you can go to File Explorer and drag the file in the same way you move files around in your computer anywhere else. You can copy, paste. A file in the same way you can do with files on your computer. You can. Basically, you can add a file from a different interface and it will still show up here because this is just a reflection of whatever's in the folder.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So what? You can.  
Them: I'm trying to follow along.  
Me: Yeah. So I haven't been in travel. I haven't been describing what exactly to do yet.  
Them: This right here on the left. Is.  
Me: So the first way, if you click on file.  
Them: So I could do something as stupid as this. I could go here.  
Me: Sure.  
Them: Look at my pictures.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Go find what I'm looking for. Which now is called or what it is, but Jesus Christ. Downloads. So epc chef sketch.  
Me: Yes. But I don't think Claude can read it. I don't think so yet.  
Them: You don't think try to put a JPG in. Right, so here's what I did. I went here. I took this. Save image as. Can I put it right in here? So, chef. A.  
Me: Yes. Let's try that first. But I'm also going to show you my lazy way.  
Them: Okay? And now where do I put it?  
Me: Just save. Just click save. And then you go to Claude. Oh, you go to Cursor. And I think it's supposed to be there. Yeah, it's right there.  
Them: Right. Yeah, there it is. Okay, but. I want to slide it into specs.  
Me: Yeah, just for cleansing this.  
Them: If I want to be in a.  
Me: Let me show you the lazy way.  
Them: Okay. Hey, I accomplished my goal, at least. That's cool.  
Me: Yes, you would want to rename it into something that Claude can intuitively understand.  
Them: Yeah, exactly. What do we call this? We're calling this service detail.  
Me: It's our checkout because the chef isn't paying.  
Them: No, it's service detail.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: For now.  
Me: Okay? So if you go to the other way is if you simply copy image.  
Them: Service details. Mocked.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Mach1, mockup1. Okay?  
Me: If you simply go to go back to base camp.  
Them: Go to basecamp.  
Me: If you right click the image.  
Them: Right click.  
Me: And just click copy image.  
Them: Copy image.  
Me: And then you go to cursor. And select the mvp folder.  
Them: Yes. Right here.  
Me: Yeah, and you just hit paste. Just ctrl v or something.  
Them: If Pace is blocked out, so I'm going to try to control V. Should you want to paste image. Okay.  
Me: This needs to be more consistent because it's always in PNG format and it tends to always be named Image png. So then it's, like, easier. There's no, like, crazy hash of the ID of the, you know, the image and all of that. And it's quicker because you don't need to, like, click through your files with don't use a copy paste.  
Them: Okay? So this is an exercise in. Lee made this graphically. And then we uploaded it. It's got the minimum basic shit on. It. Minimum basic.  
Me: Yes. Yes, but.  
Them: Right. This is only one half of that page.  
Me: So this is why I said that I think this is a good exercise. In thinking with clarity around how to prompt. Claude. Also, this is a good exercise in starting a Neoclaud.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Because. You would want to refresh the contact. So context rot is one of the things that is a topic that people talk about a lot these days. These AIs, and I've told you this before, but these AIs all get progressively worse as you build on top of the context. So.  
Them: Start a new Claude. You mean turn this off?  
Me: You can click on the plus button. Or you click on Claude again, you can open, like, five different clouds and it can all work on your code base at the same time. You could have five different Claude mockup five different screens at the same time. If you do that, you might be able to get all five screens done by the end of the day. But then.  
Them: Well, we'll get there because I'm going to have five monitors. I got to set all that up? I got a sword.  
Me: I do that even when I only have one monitor. You click around the different tabs.  
Them: I know. You're young and smart, and I'm old and stupid.  
Me: No, it just takes mental clarity to juggle.  
Them: Right. That's a lot.  
Me: Clarity that comes from reps to juggle managing five different people at the same time. And being able to clearly instruct it what you want it to do.  
Them: Yeah, again. I'm going to get there. I promise I'll get there. I see the past forward. I just got to start going.  
Me: Before you start prompting, I'm going to break it down for you. Let's break it down. What we're trying to get done right now, we're trying to mock up the screen. Right. So what do we got to tell Claude?  
Them: What are we going to tell it?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Exactly what we're trying to do. I'm just going to talk to it like it's a person.  
Me: Yes. So what are we trying to do?  
Them: We're trying to mock up a chef's service details page. That shows them the total value of the contract and how much they get in cash and options. And they want to use this to be able to build a client. This mockup obviously isn't complete. It needs more stuff to it. So we can either decide that we're going to draw those things or we're going to just bang on the clock. So Lee and I discussion based on how much shit he's got on his plate and how much should I have on my plate?  
Me: Or you can describe the changes that you want.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You could paste in multiple screenshots. You could paste in the original sketch that I had had both sides. And then you could paste in this. You could paste into updated sketch we had yesterday for organizing the contract value to be up top.  
Them: For sure we can do this. One. That one? Yeah.  
Me: And you could put in both and you could be like, the goal of the screen is this one. Z XYZ xyz. You can find sample data from the CSV file. I would also mention that this is supposed to be the screen that happens when you click into view. On the Maka V2 so that it knows to be continuous with that.  
Them: And just said, this is the screen. That comes up when we click the View button. Mockup V2.  
Me: Yes. You want to tell it that you want to say. That. And by the way, I also want us to be conscious of the fact that we're assuming that it's going to be a pop up, which I think at the back of my mind makes sense because it tends to be a little faster. Or, like, a little smoother for it to not feel like it's navigating to a whole other page. When you click into a client. But that's not to be taken for granted. That's not always the case. Like some pop ups are better as full screens. So you would describe all of that. And you don't need to care about at this stage, I wouldn't care about the structure of your prompts. I would just care about comprehensiveness. Basically, for a starting prompt like this, you should be saying, you should be trying to say so much. That you hit the whisper flow, single transcription limit of six minutes. For starting prompts like this. So whisper flow like their limit for a single transcription to six minutes. For starting jobs like this. I almost always hit that times three. It's like a 15 minute prompt.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But for now, I would say that aim for. Five, six minutes. Of you. Just talk to what you're trying to have it do. And then at the end of it, say, like, hey, play back to me what I'm saying, because I'm a beginner in this, and I don't know. Necessarily if I've described things right. So can you interpret for me? What I'm saying. Play it back to me so I know we're on the same page before you go ahead and create the mockup. So you ready to go? So you'll paste in the images. And by the way, you can put in images in this folder. This way. This way it's more lasting. You can also paste images directly into the prompt.  
Them: I've done that with you before, too.  
Me: Okay? So you want to remember the hands free mode.  
Them: Yeah, I use it all time.  
Me: Yeah. All right, you ready to go?  
Them: All right, buddy, what is your day looking like? Okay. I thought we were going to. No, we're not going to both sit here. Okay. My top priority is getting Rick the things that he needs. As soon as possible. So that's really the only thing that is top of my agenda. I also put together a Google form for bug reporting. Thank you. Yeah, so that's cool. And I sent that link over to Amy. And so that should take some of the sting out of that communication, since it's just a fucking form. And that's what I got. So I got the Rick stuff, which will probably take couple hours just to get that stuff researched, ordered. And laid out. And I got his address, so we're good there. All right, as soon as that's done, can you and (Kate) get together and get all your environment set up so that you can claude from your own computer? Yeah, sure. That would be cool. And then what I'll do, Lee, is I'll just stay in here. With my screen shared. And I'll just work on it. And you can look and I'll ask for your feedback or whatever, anytime. Okay? Does that work? Yeah. If you want to see an update on where that. Or I'm like, hey, check this out. You just look over it there. Yeah, I got you like that, Rick. Shit. He's all stressing about that for this weekend. Wait. What? Because Rick's all stressed out about that for this weekend. Yeah, I know. That's why I was like, yeah, that's why. That's, like, priority for me. This is going to be goofy and rambling, so let me get my fucking shit together. All right. Okay, what do we want to do? Okay? I know what I want.  
Me: By the way.  
Them: To talk about. Yeah.  
Me: By the way, you know what? I started doing a lot. I've been going on. I moved into buy the lake. Studio apartment by the lake. So I keep. Whenever my mind is stuck on a situation, this with a prompt that is beyond my brain, and I'm like, where do I even begin? I go on a walk and I turn on Granola on my phone and. That people think I'm crazy because I'm just, like, walking around talking to myself. For, like, 30 minutes, and I come back and paste in the whole Granola to Claude.  
Them: Nice. Oh, speaking of Granola, Chef Rick is very interested in using granola for all of his client calls, which I think is a great idea. So we need to think about whether we just want to add him as a seat or whether we want. Because we can't just give him your login because it uses Google to log in. Adam has a seat. Okay. Understood. That's what I thought. That I wanted to make sure. I just saved $60 a month on cursor by downgrading. To just give him a shoe. $8.  
Me: That's an AI budget now.  
Them: That's exactly right. Okay. That's what I thought the answer would be, but I just wanted to make sure. Yeah. Okay? There we go. If you need to ever mute me, Lee, because I'm just getting annoying, just do it. No, I got you. We're good. So we're trying to create a page. That shows the details of each service. When we click on this service off of our services page, which we've also mocked up, we want to keep the same color schematic and the same theme across the board. And we want to design the screen. I have uploaded a few sketches that we created. And the whole purpose of this. Is for me as a chef and any chefs on my team. Can very quickly see the total value of the contract. They can see the deposit that has been paid by the client. They can input money that they need to bill the clients. They can input any food cost, they can input any service staff cost, and they can also any miscellaneous cost.  
Me: Rental for a dinner party.  
Them: For that. That needs to be added.  
Me: Food process is where the chef actually goes and purchases food from the grocery store. And reimbursement. Total do would of course, be the remaining contract.  
Them: Any miscellaneous and then we have to add a 4% taxes in fee line to be calculated. For that entire total. Because that is the credit card processing fees. And we call it quote taxes and fees because it's more subtle to the guest, but it is absolutely Credit card processing fee. The separation visually probably makes the most sense. To have the main part of this. Field that the chef tide of the remaining balance of food and cost. And then we need to minus out the deposit paid in the calculation. So when a client first comes into our organization, they pay a deposit. Typically, usually 99% of the time, it's 50% of the contract. That number is not the 50% of the final payment. The contract is adjusted. Number of people go up, number of people go down. Food cost. The style of the food changes, increasing the price so that number can be manipulated by the chef. The deposit simply locks in the client, and then the chef can edit everything from there because the chef is actually speaking with the client. Not every single service has food cost, staff cost, or miscellaneous cost. But the chef controls all that with the client after they get into their hands. So we want this to be very user friendly.  
Me: Away for them to build clients activity. From the previous screen.  
Them: This would be the edit button. The edit button would trigger this screen to pop up. And the chef would be able to type information. The small feature of cash versus options is reflective of our company as a whole and kind of the cool part of our business. But when A chef has $1,000 contract, for example, $1,000 in an arbitrary number that I just made up. If they have $1,000 contract. The chef will earn $850 of that or 85% of that contract. In cash. From our company via payroll, and they will earn 15% in company equity via options. For $150. So we're trying to explain to the world everyone who uses our system. That they're compensated in both cash and company equity. Which has never been done in the history of marketplaces. So we're trying to be a third wave company and show a new way of looking at marketplaces in a new way of looking at commissions, because we turn all of our commissions from our contractors. Into company ownership. So the very important piece. Honestly, the only thing that makes us different. From every other marketplace out there. But we are then the only marketplace out there that does this. And that's a six trillion dollar global industry. We're trying to be the industry leaders. In a $6 trillion industry, so very exciting things. But, yeah, that's all I've been thinking of. So bit that back to me in a way that I can understand it. I need to clearly understand that you clearly understand what I'm trying to build. And then I want you to give me a plan. Detailed of how we're going to go about building this. Systematically ask any clarifying questions that you need to. I'm okay to spend the entire day on the planning process of this before we ever actually build anything.  
Me: All right, quick note. Great job. Type in mockup. Mockup.  
Them: Knockup. I wasn't clicked in the box of Claude.  
Me: It's okay. You go to the app. The history is there.  
Them: Okay, markup.  
Me: Space and then paste in that everything you just said to whisper.  
Them: Okay. And I just said it in whisper flow, so I got to go to whisper flow. Which is.  
Me: Yeah, it's on computer. To go through your file explorer. Or just search for it? Just search. Whisper without the E.  
Them: Should have been on the.  
Me: It's w I s p r.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: O no, it's woh n o e.  
Them: Okay? How was that?  
Me: Copy button.  
Them: Okay, where's the copy button? Oh, there is a computer. That's what they thought of everything.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: (Kate) Boppen.  
Me: And then you can also type in more stuff as it's thinking. So you can say you can Supply the mockup V2, you can supply the mock pads to mock up V2. Like this is the latest mock we have of the homepage.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And also when I said edit button, it was the view button. It's the same thing. So make something up. Also, you didn't paste in the specific. Mockup images. So, I mean, it'll find it. It's fine. In the future, what I would do is I would group all the input, like all the data input.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: That you have in the folder, group them by the screen. So all the existing stuff that we had for the homepage, you could group that into home, and then you could group all the images for this new screen that you're trying to have it mock up, group them under service details or something like that.  
Them: And that would be Make a folder. Just saying, make a folder and call it home.  
Me: Yeah, like makeup holder under SPECs and under MVP. Because this basically this whole project is the quote, unquote mvp. In the future. You can imagine. It doesn't matter right now because reorganize it in the future. But you would imagine that when you add a new folder, when you add a new feature, you can always change the structure.  
Them: Interesting, okay.  
Me: It's asking. Sketches you uploaded. Is asking you for the sketches you uploaded, so go ahead and. Go ahead and put all the service details, related sketches. No, as in put it into a folder called Surface Details and then put that whole folder path. To clause with a cloud can just read all the images inside it.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And also tell that what to if you want. Tell. Tell it what? To take from each of the sketches, because they're slightly different, right? Like describe. There's the one on the fat marker sketch that has to both left and right. But I mean, like, it's okay. Actually, it's not the end of the world right now if it mocks up just the right side without the service details. On the left, because you could add that on, and that part is relatively simple.  
Them: All right. Understanding your service. You guys are screen looking at your breadboard and sample data. You want to service detail headed stream or chef can view and edit. Yeah. Display caching options Professional layout matching your existing design. Posits are usually the shifts can adjust, and I recall. It. Let's get you to see later. Use a real data. Build a structure matching your sketch. Pilot. Test it. Can I see the sketches you uploaded? I need to visual layout. Which service from your CSV should I use as the example? Should this be a pop up or a separate page? You have existing css styling I should match. Let me see your sketches first and I'll be able to draw.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Chef. I want to explain something to you. Take this opportunity to explain something to you. So if you click onto the mockup HTML file.  
Them: Mockup HTML file? Yes.  
Me: Into it. I'm going to show you something.  
Them: Which one?  
Me: Click onto V2.  
Them: Ether.  
Me: And close the image so that we have space. So if you look at this file, it starts off by saying that, hey, this is an HTML file. And then there's a head tag.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Head is the stuff that is not actually shown on a page. It's like the spec for the content that is shown on a page. So you get stuff like. It gets stuff like usually it will be like the link to the custom font. It would be like the meta title for the SEO and all that stuff. And then under this dial tag right now. You can see the style definition. Like all the CSS. That just defines the styling of the page. Like, what shape are the buttons? What color are the pills? And all that stuff. And then you scroll all the way down. Where body begins. So this is all the style definition.  
Them: Missed body.  
Me: No, all the way down.  
Them: Oh, right here.  
Me: No, like, much further down, it'll look very different. So this part is css, right? So then you get to all of this. So now you see.  
Them: There we go. There's the HTML.  
Me: Yeah. So you see the end of head, right? The end of the head tag. So that's the end of the description of the page. And we're moving on to the actual content of the page.  
Them: Y. Eah.  
Me: So is where the HTML is, which you're familiar with when you typed in H1. Hello, Jeffy. All right, so this is the same tech, right? But then if you look at these tags, You see some divs and the div say class equals to welcome text. For example, where it says, welcome back, Chef Alissa. Now, if you scroll up and look at the css, we don't have to do it right now. Or you could do control F to search the file. And you type welcome text. You can see this dial for welcome text being defined up there with the CSS that tells the HDMI body. Basically, for this text where it says, welcome back, Chef Alyssa, you should put it in this font. Just whatever you see welcome text, scroll a little bit up. Welcome, texas.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So that's where the style of welcome Tex is currently defined. Right. So this is when we create a single page mockup within a single HTML file. All the styles, all the interactions, all of that is defined in one single super long HTML file. As we build onto more things, such as having things be interactive, such as having multiple pages that draw from the same set of styles. Because for example, when we move on to having the pop up the finalized invoice button, you might want to draw from some of the same styles of the buttons are here. Right. You want that to be defined in one place rather than separately defined all across the pages. So then what happens is that instead of the style being directly inside this page, you break out the style sheet in a separate CSS file. And then on each of the HTML files, it basically inherits the same style from the same CSS style sheet.  
Them: Okay, yeah, that makes sense.  
Me: So that's sort of like.  
Them: I read these first.  
Me: Well.  
Them: Right. No, that's not right.  
Me: This is a different story. So the MD files are for the AI agents to read. I'm talking about the literal page itself. Like the literal. Like when you deploy an application on the Internet, this is your first explanation to the first example of. The art of breaking things down into components that work with each other so that each file isn't a thousand lines up. So when this style sheet breaks out and this HTML file inherits that style sheet,  
Them: Okay?  
Me: That's your first example of basically breaking things down into modules. And then in the future, then you get to the point where each of these containers are not separately coded, but they are like a rendering of a partial of the same component, which is like a service is one row and that row. And then there's like when we move this into Rails, and then Rails has its logic. That says for each surface under chef, under this chef name, render this partial for this client. Right? So then the home page HTML actually becomes like 20 line song instead of like a thousand. Because that stuff is, like, infinitely outsourced to other files. So I just wanted to tell you that because. As you're going to follow up with the next stuff. You can just ask it to create another stata HTML file. You could also choose to have it. Create a folder with the mockups and then have the CSS be broken out and then start your half. Both of the mockups inherit the same styles. The benefits to that is that this is work that will eventually be done by the agent who's going to transform this into Rails anyway. You're just, like, moving up some of the work. You know what I mean?  
Them: Yeah. So what you're saying is we could take this style right here? This is the style of it.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And apply it to any HTML files. So that is just automatically done and it all looks the same.  
Me: So that it all inherits. It's gonna. It's gonna need to do some edit because, for example, some of the styles defined here are very specific to this page. Right? Like right now, the button is literally called the view button, right? It's called edit button, copy button, right? And so when we tried to turn this into something that is reusable across more pages, So the view button is the one that's solid filled in. The copy button is the one that is outlined. Right. So as you take this dial sheet, From something that's specific to this one screen into something that's reused across many screens. You'll want this button to be renamed from the edit button and a copy button into something that's more like the primary button, secondary button. Or primary button, primary outlined button, something like that. So that on your new pop up, instead of having that button be separately defined, That button will now just inherit from the same style and say like primary button. And then it'll look the same. And then if you go back, and then if you change your mind. Oh, the primary button needs to be a lot bigger. Then you could just change that in one style sheet, and that change will be applied across all of your pages. Which you can start to understand why that's important as your app scales and ask the styles need to be more things.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Anyway, go ahead and just have it create a separate HTML mock, but I'm pointing that out to you as something that eventually the AI will get to doing. As we translate the Istmode static pages into the Rails app.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So right now, answer the questions right. You moved all the surface details PNGs into that file. I would do Hands Free mode again, and I would ask it, I would explain to it a little bit what components you like about each of the sketches. So that it doesn't just randomly make something based on all of the sketches. Like I think the one that this is the higher fidelity image that lee had from ChatGPT. That one is better in formatting. The one that I sketched. That was the last one we discussed. That one is more accurate.  
Them: Better for information flow.  
Me: And then the fat marker sketch is, like, the full thing. Which honestly might confuse it at this point. But you can describe, you can say that this describes how the page flows between what the existing mockup. And you can save the part on the left. On this specific sketch is mockup V2, and we're now looking to produce the right of this page. So I'm pushing you to be specific because you need that mental clarity internally. Eventually you can find in some of these things can be shortcut. You can tell it. I dumped out. I dumped all the PNGs here. What do you see? Let's make a plan. Like you could just do that too. Does that make sense?  
Them: Yeah. I totally get it. The taking notes for me part. Is here. How do you actually start? Right.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Go to terminal, type in wsl, yada yada. I could never memorize all that. Plus I did it 100 times. And then the next piece that I have to take all these notes on is how do I go connect everything to render.  
Me: I wouldn't worry about that right now.  
Them: So it can actually be real and live. Right. And then I'll have to take notes throughout. You're muted.  
Me: I wouldn't worry too much about that right now because I think the part about creating a new project. It feels foreign. It feels like there was a lot that we went through to get here for you right now. But you're going to start to internalize the underlying foundation, which is literally just you create a folder on your computer.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Folder to GitHub.  
Them: I'm not saying I'm worried about it. I'm just saying those are the knowledge parts that you have that I have to just simply take notes on. I understand now. After you've shown me how to work with the AI and do stuff. Which is. That's a whole learning curve in and of itself, too.  
Me: Yeah. And I'm going to sound like a broken record, but I'm going to repeat again and again the hidden learning curve that most people discount. And most people don't think enough about is the underlying product craft and product thinking.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Which is what we've been spending all week on.  
Them: For sure. Yeah. Pretty crazy. Okay? Let's try this one. Here we go. You ready? Because I can't hear you once I start, whisper I can't hear you or leave, just so you know.  
Me: Alice will try to not talk once you start it.  
Them: Okay? So the sketches I put in, the service details. Folder. And there's four different sketches I'm going to go through and tell you what I like. About each one and the intentionality behind each one, and hopefully we can mock something up that looks pretty good. So for your quick question, s. Number two. Which service? From the CSV. I don't care. Use whichever one you want. The one you Smith family is just fine. From now, let's just go ahead and make this as a static HTML page. As a separate page. If we turn into a pop up later, great. We'll figure that out. And then the existing css styling is the same style as the mockup HTML version 2. So mockup v2.HTML. Would be the styling. And so, as you're taking a look at these four sketches, The fact Marker sketch was our original. That kind of shows both pages. It shows the Chef Services page. But also the mockup V2 page. They're supposed to be two separate pages. We're focusing on the one on the right. I like the visual of the breadboard, the original mat marker sketch, because it does have the notes and the service details kind of on the left side. On the right side that has all of. The pieces that we need, the buttons, the cash and equity breakout, the total due and whatnot, the reimbursements. Maybe it's just out of order, but overall, I think that's probably like, the closest look to what we like. Chef Service Mockup 2. Here's another one. That looks pretty cool. It's kind of a different option. The contract value and then broken out with smaller fonts is the cash and options. I love that because that's my specific piece. This whole company and why I wanted to do it. And then, of course, the food, the miscellaneous, the service staff, which isn't shown here, but will be added. Minus the deposit and then the total due, which was what the client owes. Of course. We need to add in the tax. There. And there's always going to be an optional gratuity line. But the optional gratuity line isn't added here. It's added when we use whatever credit card system we're going to plug in. Whatever payment system. On the service details. Mockup 3. Here's a more simplified version of it still, same idea. Still showing that total value cash and options breakout, which we love. And the editable fields for the chef which is contracted miscellaneous costs and food cost and minus deposit. With the total with the 4% tax. I think with what we have here, we got pretty close. You can match the CSS styling of the mockup V2 page that we already made. That would be cool. In the home screen folder. That's the best one that we have so far. As far as the mockup, so you can look there for that.  
Me: Click on it. Great job. Let's do it.  
Them: Just get on my nerves.  
Me: There's an I.  
Them: Yeah, I know. I don't know why. That club. I closed it on accident. Oh, yeah, there's a copy thing. My bad. I'll get there.  
Me: Got it.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Why is it having issues reading? That. Let's see. Oh, because it's under specs. I know why.  
Them: Why?  
Me: Oh, it is. Reading it now. That's so cool. Sprouting.  
Them: Lots of culinary terms.  
Me: That was a great prompt.  
Them: That's a great what?  
Me: That was a great prompt.  
Them: Problem. It says perfect. I love the fat marker sketch. Yeah, thanks. Blood. I love the Fat Mercury sketch. You're welcome. Chef. You're welcome. Yeah. I love.  
Me: For future reference, if you want something to be a pop up, but you want to keep things simple by not. Bulking up the existing single page HTML with a pop up, which adds a lot of code to a single page. You could also ask it to mock up a static page, but as if the thing is a pop up. Like, as it literally make a page that has a dark background with like a pop up in the middle. And have that be a static page if you want that.  
Them: Interesting. Befuddling. Befuddling. That's not very. That's not good. No, that doesn't inspire confidence. We don't want to be fuddle anybody. Already befuddled, man. We already.  
Me: All right, Open it in your brother.  
Them: That does not inspire confidence at all. What am I doing? I was a nip in my browser.  
Me: Yeah. And then click.  
Them: Doing this.  
Me: But you need the whole thing with the so copy that whole thing with the one that you already have open. Now, the thing.  
Them: I understand.  
Me: You just copied it.  
Them: I don't know.  
Me: You go here.  
Them: Okay. You want this?  
Me: Yeah, but then.  
Them: Yeah. Then I want to change out some stuff. Yeah, I get it. Okay? So when you say you just copied it, what do you mean? So right now, I'm going to copy.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: How do I see that clipboard right there? How do I know what's on that?  
Me: Well, you can paste multiple times and it's still copied.  
Them: Like up arrow.  
Me: No.  
Them: Okay? So then it starts at home. Okay. It starts at home.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay. Smith's family. Private dinner party. 2,500 cash options. Food cost service staff, miscellaneous deposit paid. Contract.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: All right.  
Me: So you want it all more in one place, right? And you want the instead of breaking out the calculations in separate thing at the bottom, you want the input to directly already be the calculation. Unless you want the separate thing like that. Right now, there's, like, duplicate information.  
Them: Yeah, right.  
Me: And then there's the output.  
Them: Interesting. Okay, and so now you would, what, systematically leave another long message of all the things that need to be changed on this. Okay?  
Me: Before I go.  
Them: And this is where I need. This is leaves. It's for Lee and I need to work together. No, it's okay. I'm saying, like, this is how we're going to hand an egg. This. I'm like, yo, I made this. And you're like, well, this looks fucking stupid. I'm like, I know. Can you help me make it now it's stupid. And then you just talk into the thing of how to make it not look stupid. Right? Right. I think that you and I, from a workflow perspective, Can think through. Okay, I got this, right? And then I threw it in New York court. And then I'm going to go make the admin page and throw it into your court, and then I'm going to make the login screen, throw it into your fourth, and you're going to go back and be like, yo, I edited the blah, blah. Blah. What do you think? Let's look at it. We're like, yeah, this is pretty good.  
Me: Makes sense.  
Them: What do you think? I'm not that fluently. Yeah. I dig it.  
Me: Do you already feel accelerating? Like yesterday we spent X amount of hours doing whatever. Now. We're under an hour. We're at 59. We went stuff and we already have those mock up and all the other pages are only going to get faster.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: So I think that this is a few tips, I guess, like nudges on what I would change about. This is the redundant information stuff, like the input should just be the calculation. And then I would also because we eventually want to consolidate it and what likely will, even if it's not a pop up? We should consolidate everything into one or most of the things into one div. At least the calculation part should be one div. And when I say one div, it means that right. Now you see how it's broken out into many groups. So I think from a design perspective, and this is my opinion, It makes sense for us to have one quote, unquote, div. One group. Let's just call it. There's like, content groups. One content group for contract detail. So stuff like contact information. Whatever notes that. And then one group for, like, the calculation and Xintong the invoice.  
Them: Yeah, for sure. I get all that. Okay, Lee, what we need to do is. We need to log you into. Cursor. And pull up log you in as me into. To cursor, and you upload all of Appy's files into a folder. That's like app sketches or something like that.  
Me: You don't need to log into Cursor to do that.  
Them: How do you do it?  
Me: You can use basically any code editor. Any code editor. It's the only thing that you need a code editor for is basically like, git. So technically, technically, you could just clone the repository onto your computer and drag and drop the images in or whatever. And then on your terminal, do git, or you can upload, basically download any code editor. You don't need cursor, because cursor is something that requires an account. Versus something like vs. Code doesn't really need an account, so you just download a software. So the technical. You don't need to log into Cursor.  
Them: Okay, so I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is. And I want all of Appia's design files into my code base. How do I do that? Please. Computer. Right now? Yeah. First of all, I need to pull all of those individual screens out of the giant XD file. Which number one I'm not super well versed in xd, so I have to do a little bit of.  
Me: Output those individual schemes.  
Them: Jpegs or pngs or something. Unless you think can read a sketch file or an XD file, I'm not sure. If that's a thing. So I have to figure out how to output all of those screens. There's like.  
Me: Right now. There's a built in functionality in Adobe XD to export all artboards at Swans as assets.  
Them: Okay, awesome. Yeah. Okay, good deal. I know that she's got a lot of garbage. Artboards from her inspiration and whatnot. So I just have to make sure that I'm organize them in there. I'll put them in different categories for us so it can call to them fast. You don't have to organize anything. Don't worry about that. I'll do that. Okay, well, how does he do it then? How does he get it into this code base? Case.  
Me: He could get it into this code base whenever he gets set up. Because you want him to be able to work with Claude, too, right? Or he would just send you the folder and you just drop it in.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because it's just going to be a border of images. You can send it to you anywhere.  
Them: Oh, like email the folder.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. Can you try that, lee? Yeah. Send you the folder of images. Sure. Yeah, send the master folder. Don't try to open it or anything, and I'll see if I can just drag and drop the whole damn thing. Okay?  
Me: And then on your end, if you want Lee to have access to the code that you made, obviously push it.  
Them: Yeah. Right.  
Me: And so just you guys can figure out how you want to do this. Lee, I am going to be free in the afternoon between, let's say. 130 and 4.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Or like latest 5? So if you want to get set up on Cloud together, we can do that. I would also say that on Mac OS is relatively straightforward. In that you can just download cursor and then.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: For claude.  
Them: You just left the call. ciera I was like, why did you leave?  
Me: Are you okay with not doing an afternoon check in? Where I just leave you to it and you just let me know when you're done for the day and push it. Okay. And then I'll just see whatever you did.  
Them: Let's just see what happens.  
Me: And just see what happens. For Lee. Whenever you want to get set up, you can actually try doing that. And like asking me if you have roadblocks, but honestly, downloading cursor and downloading.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Claude on a Mac OS is relatively straightforward and well documented. You just need because if you haven't worked with code on your computer recently, you probably need to install some packages. But it's like what you need like homebrew to like install node js, and you need no JS to in stockcloud code cursor is just. You just download the package and install it like any other application.  
Them: Okay? Nice. If you just spend 20 minutes doing with him just because you're a nice safety that to have the first go around.  
Me: Yeah. For sure. Understood?  
Them: You're like a warm blanket.  
Me: For ciera just saying, like, you know, like, whenever you get to it, when you. Whenever you get to your other stuff and you. You need to get. And you get to it. Let me know. If I can be on a call, I can.  
Them: Yeah, okay.  
Me: I'll send you the information.  
Them: I got you. I understand. Okay? That sounds good to me. I will bang on it, and then I will reach out to you between those hours. If. I need a lift.  
Me: Great.  
Them: You said, like 130. After 130.  
Me: 1:30, 2, like 4:30. It's just like a hog. Me up for lunch. I'm like, yeah.  
Them: Yeah, I got you. Yeah. Okay? Sounds good. And chef. I sent you a thing on the stickers. I can order them. It's like $150. And then I would need to get expedited shipping. But they wouldn't be able to get to Rick until Wednesday, which means he would have them for next week. Well, if we don't do the expedited shipping, then they won't get to the role of stickers. Won't get to him until September 5th. Okay. That's all right. That's fine. Yeah. Okay?  
Me: Okay?  
Them: That's fine. Okay?  
Me: Good stuff.  
Them: ciera  
Me: Good stuff. You see it? You see it? The rest of the screens are just going to fall into place.  
Them: Yeah, it's going to be awesome.  
Me: All right. Great.  
Them: I'm excited. Yeah, we'll try to figure out how. I mean, that damn file, Lee, is it even going to be emailable, or is it too big? I won't know until I get into it. So, I mean, I can put it on the drive and you can download it from there. Let's try that.  
Me: You can also definitely zip it.  
Them: Let's try that. Yeah, I can zip it, too. Yeah. I can't actually open it. I got to be able to put the zipped file somewhere, right? Because I'll have the software. There is a native Unzip application. On your computer.  
Me: Like if you click open a zip folder, it will just.  
Them: It'll automatically open it. And then the files that I output will be image files. So they'll be openable with whatever you view regular images with. They'll either be JPEGs or PNGs. I'm assuming they'll be PNGs.  
Me: The hardest part of this is just going into sketch. And I mean, not even hard, but, like, just going into sketches, just exporting everything.  
Them: And exporting it, Yeah.  
Me: Putting it in a code base is not as big of a deal as you think as. As you're imagining right now. It's like, literally equivalent of in your file explorer. Selecting a bunch of images and dragging and dropping it into another folder. That's it.  
Them: Okay? Yeah.  
Me: Yay. Okay. All right. Good stuff. Bye. Bye. See? Ya.
