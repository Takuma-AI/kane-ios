Date: Aug 25

Them: And so it was cool to see that. And then Chef Austin was just, like, doing other stuff, like onboarding another chef, like writing venues and doing all kinds of other stuff. And so at the end of the day, I was like, all right. Here's what I did. Check it all out. I pushed a new branch. I think the only thing that we have left to do is to figure out the login screen, but check through our to do list and make sure that there's nothing else. That's like pending. And you can see it. Yeah, yeah. Yep, yep, yep. He did it over the weekend, so I was handing it off to him on Friday because, like, on the weekend, I like to kind of, like, log off and, like, do like, my whole personal life thing. But he was like, well, I'll get in there on the weekend and see if I can finish. And so I was very proud of us that we were able to work asynchronously. And I was able to do a lot of development on Friday. And then I say, hey, I pushed it up to the branch. Go grab it. Go finish it. So the only thing I haven't done this morning is go out there and sync up again to see what he did. He just sent me a screenshot, but I've been working in the business this morning doing, like, KPIs and whatnot. So I'm happy to know that we are getting a workflow. That we kind of as well. So it's a lot of learning really fast. And I'm hoping that. I'm picking up enough of the good protocols and good habits to not be building bad on top of bad from the beginning. Is like what I'm hoping. But that's why we come to you for guidance. On. All right. This is great. But a better protocol. Is this right? Yeah, he should be. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Okay? Yeah. Okay? I think he still admits a logging in. Okay? Yeah, okay. Check sound. Hello? Yeah, we got you on sound, Chef. Y. We can't see you, though. Now we can see you. Sign and styling fixed. There we go. There we go. Look at you. What did it say? It's like completing tasks and. It's like audibly letting (Kate) know when it's finished, when it's finished. A task that it's working on. Wouldn't let me in the meeting. No, I'm just joking. This is something on my end. I don't know what happened. He's just messing with you. Dude, I wrote a chat bot and put it into square up. And everyone that touches it tries to fuck with it. They don't actually try to use it for normal. Spinning in loops. Pretty funny. Like the psychology of people. I've had three different people that I thought I liked. It, try it out. And I'm not even remotely trying to use it like normal. They're just typing in dumb. Shit. It's like there's a science of AI. They're going to mess with this thought. It just makes me have to go do more work. Yeah. David pollock. Okay? Yeah. Fixed sign in a navbar styles. Oh, my God. That's cool. So it tells you. It tells you when it's done here in the check. That's sweet. Yeah, that definitely makes sense. That definitely makes sense. And when that page. When Cloud went through iterations on the page and I saw that information, I was like, oh, wow, this will be great. But, yeah, I didn't think through whether or not. Okay. This will be great for phase two. I was just like, oh, wow, this looks awesome. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I totally get that. I totally get that. Yeah, right. Yeah. Right. Like, assigning it or reassigning it to a different chef. Right. Like, maybe if it has to move. That's, like, admin thing, okay? Yeah. Okay? Yes. Probably What? The path of least resistance. Yeah. Right. Okay, okay. That totally makes sense. Okay. Yeah. Like, it probably changes by the day at this point, interchangeable. But right now, we've decided that I'm going to drive and Lee is going to run the company. So let's just do change is push to remote. You have to change that voice, man. That's creepy. Oh, stop. Yeah, I yelled at for using my tokens. I was like, you're wasting my. Yeah. Okay, understood. Oh, yeah, no, we've been. Yeah. Outside of just the core group of me, Chef, Amy, and Jean, we've just been talking about our tech partners. Yeah, we'll flag that, if that's anywhere. But for me, it's such a natural part of the story. You know what I mean? I use it as a marketing thing because it's such a cool story piece. Yeah, but we haven't published that anywhere. We haven't. Yeah, I don't think so. Right. Yeah. Right. What? Is that pool up too? Because he won't call me back. He's moving and shaking, buddy. Oh, my God. So good. So good. So good. Yeah, he'll let us know when it's a five billion dollar idea. Yeah. This is good. This is, like, really exciting. I am super geeked to see things kind of, like, start to get more fleshed out in reality, because just designing the visuals part has been really eye opening. And has felt really good. So I don't even know how this next part is going to feel. I'm really excited. Hi. All the latest changes from Main Share my screen. Okay. My screen first. Okay? All right, let me kill this. Let me kill this. Hit the refresh button. Refresh. And then please clean your repository working tree. Yeah, right. I'm back. Yeah. Where's my guy? Y. My tree. Yeah. Control you. Oh, to clear out, like, if I have all this. Well, look at that. Go ahead and pull down everything from the main branch in GitHub. Clean my tree, Claude. Please commit your changes or stash them. Git. Stash. Yes. Stash them. Yes, I did. What do you mean? This is not going to be the super system. So to answer your question, what I was doing. Was just playing around, like, we got the sheets done for homework. And I'm like. I started talking to it. It was like, would you like me to make you a chat bot? And I'm like, yeah, I want a chat bot. And then I just went down that rabbit hole while I was watching golf. It needs some refinement. What did it say? You didn't screenshot it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay? What is not. Where would you be looking for them? Perfect. All changes pulled successfully the repositories and significantly reorganized with new mockups. Reference design assets. Upload. Right here. Mockups. What are you looking for? You looking for this? Close out my computer. Okay? Okay, so for right now, So right now, as we speak. That thing that I created, that chat thing is the code is written and is live on Squarespace. Even if I deleted it out of here completely, it's still going to be live on squarespace and working. But if I want to continue to iterate on it, do you want me to move it to somewhere else? Okay? Why do I see my stash changes in the file system right now? That's what you want me to ask? Yeah. Okay? Why do I see all of my stashed files? In my tree. Files you're seeing are untracked. They're never committed to getting in the first place. All right. Okay? I understand. Go ahead and commit them on a different branch. Call it Chef Chatbot. I have to use the bathroom quickly. I will be right back. Yeah, sure. No, that's fine. Yeah. Go ahead and get checkout Main. Come on, whisper. I didn't say get lost. I could just run that. I don't know. Maybe not. Hey, questions for you. Why can't I upload an image? Into this. Why can't I control print screen, control pace? I can't do it. It won't do it. What am I doing wrong? I don't have a command button. I only have a control. Control C is copy Control V is paste. Okay? Let's say here. I'll just say your working directory right here. I control C and then control V. It's copy paste. If I go, let's say here. Say I go to this whatever. Control alt. Oh, okay. Let's just say copy. What? Copy this. Right click. Copy image. Control V does nothing. Okay. All right. That's fine. I didn't know if you had a quick answer. A quick answer? Okay? Y. Eah, okay. Where do I put that at? Okay? What? So right now. Is that right? That folder is right. Okay? Oh, testing. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. Thank you. Now I see where. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Wouldn't be there. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Okay? Okay? Okay. Understood. Okay. Okay? This is not admin. No, that's not admin. That is part of admin. You might be able to click on that link. There we go. There it is. Okay? Yeah. Okay? Just like natively in the browser. Okay, I understand. Yeah. Okay? Awesome. Okay, good deal. It is time. But going. Hey, look, I'm figuring out email, by the way, I'm waiting on my SendGrid account to be reviewed. Okay? Start a new clause. Start a new cloud. Oh, yeah. Just type Claude. Okay. Just typed it for me. All right. Okay? Yeah. Okay? Right. Okay? Right. I want to repeat that. Right now. If we do the. Force. We're saying that we're going to do a super system later and add this to it. Right. Okay? So we're going to run this command right here. Skip the css and the j builder. Oh. I see. Like this. What would you say to do? Yeah, I mean bundle install. I know that one. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay? Where do you see that? Cancel this guy. How do I do that? How do I do it? Cancel the whole thing. All right. Oh, yeah. That one's a hard one to remember. Is it something like in here? Probably. I found it. Yeah. Okay? Like I'm somewhere in here. I don't know. I don't think so. Okay? Can you kill the existing server that's running? So if I go to this right now, will it show me whatever it is? Currently. Okay? Yeah. Okay? What's. Okay? Yes. All right. Toggle the panel back up. Okay? What? A Control C. Control C twice is what? That kills the last command. Okay? All right. Okay, let's move forward. Yeah, right. Step two mockup analysis. I can see a well structured chef portal. Oh, can you now? Is it well structured? Think of controllers like filing cabinets. Each drawer holds related pages. You want me to keep clicking one. So we keep reading, right? Don't hit two because that's just going to fly through it, all right? Okay? Yeah, I see that. Yeah. I need to transform. You click on the Views folder. Yep. And you click on the application HTML, right? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, right. Erb stands for embedded ruby. Yeah. Good. Yes, interesting. All this would have been done by hand. Where is that man? No, go ahead. What are you saying? Turned into index. There's a dashboard for chefs and a dashboard for admin. Where is the dashboard for admin? Let me. Stupid question. I think I know the answer. You see where their words are grayed out? Where it says, like, hashtag. If it's grayed out, does that mean that it's not code? It's like the computer doesn't move it. Okay? And so how do you queue it up? You hit that hashtag and then you type in how do you make it gray? And all that kind of stuff. Right. Okay? Scroll up. Why does that not work? I'm just looking at them both at the same time. Why says 3000 here, but then in the actual thing it says 3001. Oh, because this is running on 3000. That's why. I just shut it down now. It goes the rail thing. Keep them flexible right now. We might have updates before tomorrow's meeting. I don't know. It is. Keep them flexible for right now. We might have updates for Portuguese meeting. Come back. My bad. You're good. I can mute you. Okay? Cloth. Yeah. Go to dashboard. Fix what? What did you just see? You saw the JavaScript. I'm looking for it. Script? Yeah, yeah, the bottom part. This stuff. Where do you want it? Yeah. Show you in. What? Add another one of these JS's and put it there. Right. It's also very useful for when you want to reuse bits of code. That you don't have to repeat them on each page, that you can make updates or refer to an existing file that lives somewhere outside of the HTML pages. Yeah. Right. Yes, that is correct. Okay? Right. Yes. Right. Should in the dashboard show services instead of clients. Just for everyone's knowledge, I do have a 12 o'clock. Within five minutes. So Lee can continue on with you if you need to. (Kate) You're asking me? I don't know. Is that what I was supposed to do? Yeah. Oh, push these changes. Okay. Yeah. Before I go. And that's get push main. Origin. Okay? It's whatever you want. What's the last week we have with you? We'll get you as much. Speaking Kitchen. Oh, I just told Claude. A command versus putting it in the terminal. That's funny. Oh, my God. I know. Y. Okay? Okay? Okay? Generally, yeah. Okay? Thank you. A lot. Yeah, there's a lot happening. Yeah, it just builds it based on the strategy and the decisions that you've already made. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Okay? Yeah, right. Setting up databases and whatnot should just be what it does. Naturally, right? Yeah. Okay? Yeah. Good. It's insane. Okay. All right. No, that's good. Spending a week on your interfaces is good because then we are more confident about the experience that we are creating. Right. Yeah, right. Yeah. This is definitely the more structured, strategic approach. And the way that we should be thinking about everything that we develop moving forward. So, yeah. I'm good. I'm excited. Yeah, we're going to have some cool sessions. Hell, yeah. We are awesome. Thank you. (Kate) Yay. Awesome. We'll see you this afternoon. Done with us.
