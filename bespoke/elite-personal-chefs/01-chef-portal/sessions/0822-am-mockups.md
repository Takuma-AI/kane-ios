Meeting Title: Design mockup review and development workflow strategy
Date: Aug 22

Transcript:
 
Me: Okay, I'll start by. Outlining. So I added in service details that weren't there before. I put the date, there's a little bit of a design consistency note, but because on a home page to date, Or at least on mobile, the date was above the name. I found it important for the actual screen itself to also have the date above the name. These details seed into the subconscious. Of subconsciously for a microsecond, and you look for the date, you're going to look for it above. Agree. And then I tried this contrast thing where to make it feel like two sections. You may or may not like the dark background, you could change it to a light gray. With black text if you want. I personally like this for clarity. For everyone. And then I renamed Contoto contract value to chef fee, because that is what it is, especially to the client. That is the line item that represents the culinary service. Here's.  
Them: He's in already.  
Me: Yeah. No. But you're in the landing room. Okay? So I was just saying to lee, That. First of all, I hope you feel better, Chef. Secondly, I was originally thinking. To use this session to introduce another command that we haven't gotten to before. Which is what I alluded to yesterday, which is decomposing. And actually, I'm a knockup into Rails views. I don't think we should do that today, given the circumstances. So instead of running with that. I'm just going to tell you guys the updates of what I did. To the mockup. And I'm going to make it, you guys assignment today over the weekend. To just purely do the rest of the mockups. So like the admin, the login screen, and also the form for creating a new. So I'll make that you guys homework to get that done, and then on Monday, I'll introduce you guys to. Okay, how do these mockups actually become views in a Rails app. I reorganized the folders a little bit. On the repository itself. There's now a mockups. Folder. And under the mockups folder, like at the roots, there's a mockups folder. And under the mockups folder, I broke out the style sheet. So right now there's a styles CSS and then there's a home HTML and service details.  
Them: We don't know what.  
Me: So both of those HTML files are inheriting from the same style sheet, which is why you'll see that changing the size of a button on the service details, which means this guys on the homepage as well kind of thing. So that was kind of like a beacon, like the very beginning step, the first baby step into honors den and decomposition. Or.  
Them: You have.  
Me: Modules, so you start to see that. I also say things. More I can mute. Oh, he's muted. Great. I also made things a little bit more responsive. So there's a desktop view and there's a mobile view. And that is purely controlled through the CSS styles. Not through any, like, dynamic logic. Like that. It's just css. Okay, so I'm gonna just, like, very quickly speed through the changes, and we can call it. I made a desktop view here. That reorganizes the buttons on desktop so that you can see more clients in one screen. So even in HTML files, you can link between HTML files within the same folder. When you click on View, it opens this. Oh, nice. Okay, but this is a dummy. This is basically a URL that links to a different file in the same folder. And I basically took some openated changes. Which is why all of this is on a branch. This is very important. All of this. This is on a branch called (Kate) Edits that is available on remote that you guys can pull from. And I would suggest that you guys branch away from that so that you have your own thing that isn't named (Kate) Edits. And I Basically, a few major changes. One, I group together all the client information out of service details. On the left as is on the original. Sketch. Put nodes near it, add it some service details that we're missing in the original mock. So the emails, phone number, address, stuff like that. And then I put a little button icon here for potentially being able to link to the proposal. You guys can decide if it's necessary. But basically, if we make this clickable, Ideally, we'll clickable then. It could be clickable when the proposal is available. If a proposal isn't available, it just won't be clickable. Like we could do something like that.  
Them: Yeah, okay.  
Me: On the right. The biggest opinion of the change I made was that I didn't like the word contract value because it felt very formal and sterile, and it's not clear what it means. Because, like total contract value. Well, did Santa total amount? The decline is paying. So what is total contract value? So to the client, that is just a fee for the chef service, right? So I called it chef fee. You can change it. Sec fit. I'm sure you guys know better words. And to the chef. It also feels intuitive as an like, this is my pay. Like, basically, the chef fee is my pay. But that is then broken out into 85% cash and at 15% equity. I tried to play with a few ideas for how to communicate the idea of equity. Because right now it's shown as a dollar amount. Right? Which is like, okay, this is like if you think about it like a stock, it's like this is the two days value of this stock, right? So, like, how do you communicate? So I added a little arrow. To almost, like, cut out. Like, this is like a. It's a stock ticker. Whatever, but. But not perfect. Not a perfect solution.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I know. In the screenshot I sent on basecamp, it was more complicated with a subtotal and everything. Ended up cleaning it up such that the amount that cannot be changed, which is tax and deposit paid. Are just in a little bit more faint of a gray, and they're just. There's no subtotal. It's just calculated all in one. I don't think chefs are the type of customer to, like, need to see every subtotal. And it makes it visually cleaner. And then the amount due below instead of total. Do you. Because the word total feels a bit like, what does it really mean? And this is just like the amount that's outstanding that hasn't been paid yet. All of this exists the same way on mobile. So this is when you implement a pop up, you could technically make a pop up full screen. Especially on mobile. So the same deal. If you click on View. You get the full screen pop up. And a thing I tried to do here was implement it. Basically the same design, except vertically stacked and also made the amount due sticky at the bottom. So clicking it immediately, even before you scroll, you already see how much money is owed, and you can take the actions that you want to take. Okay? So these are the changes I made. I know that I reconfigured a lot, like, (Kate) a bit of things. But these were the changes that I made, so do whatever you want with it. What I would do is I would hit the mockup command. And then describe what you want for the admin, what you want for the login, and have it all still be under the mockups folder using the same style sheet. The same css file. So the end state of what you guys would want after you've completed your homework is like admin HTML, login HTML, newservice, HTML. In that order of priority. Actually, it should be admin. HTML as a first priority, new service as the second priority in login as a third priority. So we would end up with five HTML files and one css file. In the mockups folder. That is definition complete and fully done.  
Them: Okay. All right. Admin you service login and then we have already.  
Me: Full and service details.  
Them: The service details. Got it. Okay.  
Me: And you guys believe to think a little bit about. I want to push you guys to be increasingly opinionated and demanding of your AI.  
Them: And refresh me.  
Me: In a sense of.  
Them: Yeah. We are very lightly giving guidance and being very. Just receptive to whatever it does right now.  
Me: Yes. And I'm saying, like, literally, you need to be able to look at these five mockups and be like, if we wired this up and this actually worked, I'm happy with this. Like, the details count. Like, you can't just be like, oh, this change can happen later. Does change. Like, it's true that some changes can happen later.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: But they add up. And they add up in ways that are fuzzy.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: In ways that actually if you push for to change right now, you might realize that the change you need is something different. So, for example, like, I need you guys to be, like, detail oriented in thinking through things like, oh, on a news service detail screen. How exactly do I add a client that doesn't exist yet? Am I allowed to add a client doesn't exist yet? Or to keep things super simple?  
Them: Okay? Yeah.  
Me: I would actually recommend this if we really want to keep things simple. Is to do the thing where you reenter the client information every time. Or make a copy, right? I don't know. I don't know if I actually recommend this. It depends on how much. It's a choice that you'll need to make. Right? Because then if you need to be able to create a client, then you don't just need a new service screen, you also need a new client screen.  
Them: Right. We don't like.  
Me: To build out. Initial data spec that's so large that keeps us from launching. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Which you could put, for example, if you put in a constraint that chefs can't create new clients, And you have to create from admin, then it's not a giant deal to have another pop up that just creates a new client. So you guys decide, or at least make an initial decision. And we can chisel that further. But you need to aim to be more detail oriented with these mockups. Then you guys have been so far. And it won't be perfect. It doesn't need to be perfect, but. Shooting for it will create progression. Because I want you guys to eventually be able to do this without me. Or that's what. Yeah. Absolutely. So you need to be able to. Be detail oriented in these mockups and critiquing it enough. Where you can get something from scratch to fully functional. Understood? Okay? When you walk me through quickly. The high level theory on how I'm accessing a branch. Am I just creating a new workspace? So you can switch branches on in the same workspace. It's a simple command line thing that says get checkout whatever available. That being said before, you could just say that there's a branch on GitHub that we can pull from called (Kate) Edits. Can you? And know that the window. Will stay at the bottom. Where it says. I'll show you how to do it. Lee. I'm the king of switching branches. Brother. Beautiful. Love that. One of my t shirts. Excellent. Yeah. So that's that. Again. I know I should. I shoved in a lot of changes to what you guys had last night. I hope this is good or whatever. You guys can edit it further, obviously, but these changes are a mixture of design opinions and. Usability things. Yeah. No, I absolutely love everything that you have done. I also, and I'm sure that Shaftsen as well, don't think that it's necessarily our complete deal yet, but it is much closer to the envisioning of the experience that we're trying to create. And so, yeah, Please do push it further, whatever is between this and your complete ideal, because this is your. Yeah. Don't delete it. No, of course not. No, but you can switch out of it. Also, you can't delete it. It's on GitHub forever. Whatever is between this and your ideal state, I don't know your business. You guys have worked with different. Like, a decade. Like, I don't. I don't know your business. So, like, whatever is between this and your ideal state. Push for it to get there. And by the way, you can get Claude to be your thought partner in that. You could describe stuff like what I love doing. So most people are stuck on using AI in ways where it's like they have to specify to it exactly what they want out of it. And that is one mode of doing it that is one. Claude auto prompts you to delete the branch. Well, it might be deleting the branch on your local, but it's not going to be deleted. On GitHub. Understood? Okay, I'll investigate why that's happening. But basically. What was I going to say? ciera I'm blanking out. Wait. I can just ask for. No. You can.  
Them: That we need to be pushing.  
Me: Yeah. I don't know. ciera guys.  
Them: Together.  
Me: No, I think that we are very appreciative. Of the time that you put into polishing because it gives both of us an understanding of what we should be shooting for. Before we say, oh, this screen is done. And so now. You doing these couple of times is really helpful for us to understand what an end state should really look and feel like. Plus, we have all of the learnings that we have from the design experience that we had with epi. And so totally tracking with you. That we need to be pushing Claude further to get further along to Endstein's than we have been. Slight reframe. Not even just pushing Claude further is pushing yourself further. To think with cloud, like, as in you're using cloud as your extension. But you guys, what you need to push further is also what do you call it? Your ask. How good is good enough? Yeah. It needs to feel like this is it. This is why we can't just go unlovable and ask an AI to just spin up the whole app for us. Because we care about the details, because this is our business. Right. So there's no point in building from scratch if you're not going to hold an opinion and hold a high regard for what is good enough. Yeah. Agree. That's just my prompt for. Oh, I remember what I was going to say. So most people. Tracks. He's going to lose her thought. Again. What I was saying was, like, most people use AI Coming from the perspective of I'm going to just. I need to prompt AI to do exactly what I know I wanted to do. And it'll stop there. It's either there, that, or it's, oh, hey, I gave me ideas and accepting it as good enough. What? Is. I don't have a term for this yet, but what's something that I found a lot of value in that I would encourage you guys to do? Is when there's something that's super ambiguous in your head. It's just a feeling and you can't (Kate) articulate it. Talk that feeling out. And be like, hey, AI, here's how I'm feeling about this. I have a hunch. Just something could be better about this. Here's why. I don't concretely know what element needs to change on here, but here's a screenshot of what I'm seeing. There Seems I'm feeling this gap. Whatever hunch you have between and what that gap is about. Right. If I'm a chef looking at this, I feel this way versus I want them to feel a different way. It sounds super intangible. But it will help you figure out together and articulate. Why you're feeling that way. About the thing. Yeah. So then it's okay if you feel like something is not satisfactory?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But you can't articulate why. Whatever you can articulate. Articulate it, and then AI will help you figure it out. Why?  
Them: Yeah. Awesome. Okay, no, this has been, like, not only a working session getting us up to speed on the lift, but it's also, like, a major pep talk that we need.  
Me: Because I know you can do this. I know you can do this. Even what you have. What do you guys have done? To be clear, was a great start. I'm just saying, if you want to be independent, if you want to be able to build out the rest of the system s with stability,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You need that opinion. You're not going to be able to bolt on the code generator. Basically, the more moving pieces there are to a single application, the more opinionated and disciplined you need to be about what really matters on the screen and why. Because you're going to get to the feature bloat, where you can do a hundred things on a single app and none of them are good experiences.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: In order for us to get to the point where this app is not like the code generator, which is like a one off prototype.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Right. Let's just call it that for now. Right. If you want this to be to truly scaleable thing which over time you can bolt on the menu generator. The quote generator. It's going to get messy if we don't be disciplined and high opinion need it. Enough about what's good enough. It's going to make unusual. That's how you end up with, like, an unusable product.  
Them: I just said? Yeah. Right. We want to build an ecosystem, not allow a Frankenstein.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It gets easier over time, but.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: You got to start pushing.  
Them: Okay. All right. Now, thank you for the thought process on the new Rev. It makes your thinking makes total sense to me. And seeing it articulated. Also makes total sense to me. So cool. The branch is called (Kate) Edit. So we can pull from. And then we should put our continuing work into a new branch. Okay? Awesome. I have the homework.  
Me: Which we look at it like more screens. These screens are relatively compared to the screens that have already been marked. These greens are relatively. Well, it's not straightforward in the sense of like Adam and has a lot of functional requirements.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Feel like we're building. A lot of it is building on work that we have already fought through strategically. So additional strategic thought is needed because the experience on the admin page is different. But so much of the underlying information that we ultimately need to manipulate. We already understanding why admin needs to be able to accomplish.  
Me: But anytime you're tempted to be like, whatever, this is good enough, just think about what's going to happen to the admin panel when you add, like, 20 more features. And you're just making your own life harder. You're the one who needs to use this.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Okay, I think we're good.  
Them: Okay. All right. That chef is serious.  
Me: Slide after.  
Them: Because he's never going to stop asking.  
Me: No, it's great. You will never stop asking that question. You never know. A billion dollar company, maybe.  
Them: Maybe you will.  
Me: It's less about that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, no, it's us. About that. It's more just like the whole reason why I'm not working a big tech job right now is to figure out something for myself, so.  
Them: Okay? Yeah, right. Exactly. You got dreams. You got aspirations. You got plans and shit.  
Me: I need to have myself the empty space in order to be able to make those plans. To figure out what they are.  
Them: Yes, exactly. Well, we are happy to be part of the experience that builds that build environment to thrive in.  
Me: Yeah. This is awesome. I'm learning so much from working with you guys. These are things that I've never been forced to articulate.  
Them: Awesome. Oh, right. Because you've just been doing. As opposed to having to do and also teach it. Right. Which is like a whole different way of thinking about it. Because all of those things that you're just doing, letting your subconscious handle.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Let us know what all those things are.  
Me: Like I instinctively want to make this change. Why?  
Them: Yeah, right. Exactly.  
Me: All right.  
Them: Okay. Awesome. I am going to get my environment set up by getting myself the right branch and everything going on my end, and then I'll see if I can start doing a little of the stuff, and then when Chef gets back in the seat, we will bang on this together.  
Me: Great. Perfect.  
Them: Awesome. Thank you again. It's amazing. I feel like new superpowers are being unlocked every day.  
Me: And by the way, even if you go hire an engineer and product designer, The level of pushing an opinion is still needed. Or else you're never going to be in a driver's seat and you're never going to have a curated experience that isn't a Frankenstein.  
Them: Right. Yeah, understood. Thank you. Yeah, thank you for that. Thank you for that bush. And it is something that I definitely need to work on myself and Chef needs to work on as well, because we Both always have 16 other threads going in the back of our head at all times that we're like, oh, I need to address that. Do we need to get to that? Do I need to get to that thing. And being able to focus on the task at hand until that task really feels like it is in a place to let it be for a second is sometimes difficult for us to do. Because we just let everything simmer. I'll just leave that on simmer, and I'll go over here and do this right.  
Me: What I'm about to say is probably not. Perfect. As a point of view. But I'm going to say it anyway. That's part of the difference between being an entrepreneur, starting a enduring company, versus being a freelancer doing whatever is in front of you. That's one of the differences. Right.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because part of there's working in the business, which is like, you can put out fires in front of you. You can do what will make you to money in front of you and all of that. But then for it to be an enduring business, you need to also juggle working on a business which is like, can we make this plain? Actually good. So that they can fly as far as we want it to fly.  
Them: Right. It's tough, right? Like, it's tough because we've been putting out fires for so long that whenever anything pops up, we think, like, oh, we immediately need to solve that. Right.  
Me: Another feature. It needs to happen immediately.  
Them: And sometimes. Which is why I have started. A bug reporter and a feature request list for Amy so that she's not Xintong those things directly to Shop Austin, so that there's a little bit of distance. And the thought process is more around prioritization as opposed to, I need to react to this text message right now.  
Me: Yeah, you could also set up a clawed agent or a Claude command for processing of whole list of feature requests and then serving as your thought partners to think through what's actually necessary. I might add that in the repo for next week.  
Them: Excellent.  
Me: I'm just like, you guys need that, because there's opening and needed approaches to that.  
Them: Oh, awesome.  
Me: You will see all sorts of schools of thoughts out there for how to do that. Right? Like, there are people who will be like, oh, you just queue up all the bug requests, all the book or all the feature requests, and then you just rank them or rate them, score them, and then you just on a docket and do them whenever you can. Which I don't think is the best approach.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Because.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: You don't know. You don't know. And there's always some deeper thinking that could be like, feature requests are one out of many inputs for deciding what to do.  
Them: Right. Yeah. We are learning how to be product designers in this new world, which I keep saying is so much different than when I was designing the ergonomic human factors shell for a consumer product. Right. It's just very different.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But it's still all about making the experience optimal for the human that's interacting with it.  
Me: A lot of it probably transfers. I'm excited to hear about all your adventures at some point. But anyway, we've gone on for enough. You have your homework?  
Them: Yes, we have. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We're going to get to work, and we're super excited, and we will chat.  
Me: Awesome.
