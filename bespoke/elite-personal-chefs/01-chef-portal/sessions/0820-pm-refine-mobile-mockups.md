Transcript:
 
Them: Good stuff, all right?  
Me: Am I muted?  
Them: There you go.  
Me: What's up, product genius? Es.  
Them: My God. Starring our broken minds out over here.  
Me: What's up? What's going on? How has things been treating your house? How is Claude been treating you?  
Them: Like this. We have been iterating, we have been doing, trying to get things. Do you like my thing, (Kate) or what?  
Me: This is good.  
Them: Oh, my God. Right. So we're trying things over here. We're trying to. We took the approach this time. Of iterating it. Directly through Cloud as opposed to giving it.  
Me: What we could do right now is we could talk through what we think of this in more detail. And I'm going to dump this entire transcript into cloud. And then we go, hey, Claude, can you implement these changes?  
Them: Heck, yeah. And actually, what I just did. When I asked Chef to do for me. Was to just put it up on screen so that I could screenshot it, because I think that we got to a point where it was close enough for me to take a screenshot and make some small edits. As far as being able to articulate. More clearly what we wanted to do for something that we wanted to emulate.  
Me: Why don't we just do that right now?  
Them: Which may or may not work.  
Me: No, I said as. Then why don't we just go ahead and talk through some of these changes right now and literally just apply it in real time?  
Them: I'm doing that right now. I love that. I love that. So can I just. And we can get Chef as soon as he gets back, but. I would want one small. I would want. One. Edit to Is this not sharing?  
Me: You're not sharing it now.  
Them: Am I not sharing? Something like that, all right. Let's see. How about this?  
Me: I don't see anything.  
Them: Oh, no, it's not like. Share from my little companion. Why I was reducing shokuna spidey since it was just. Oh, my God. Let me jump out and see if. What do we need to do? Eight monster.  
Me: Elder monster.  
Them: Oh, my God, no.  
Me: My computer is becoming a monster. It's actually becoming legit that a MacBook Air might not serve my full purpose. It's actually becoming legit right now, as in, my computer is fully running.  
Them: Oh, my gosh. I was going to try to share.  
Me: Do you want to just post this in basecamp?  
Them: Oh, yeah. Why don't I do that? Because it is, for whatever reason, just not allowing me to do what I want to do here.  
Me: Zusha. What I was saying is that we could basically look at the current state. We could discuss and talk out loud, like, between us. What we think. Needs to happen. And then I'm transcribing everything on Granola right now. So we could just paste that entire transcript into your cloud. And be like, hey, Claude, analyze this transcript. And create, like, a very detailed guide for your teammate to influence these changes. All right, so share your screen again. Ali said that he'd already worked on some edits.  
Them: Is it going, though? Is that true? All right. Adding.  
Me: Okay? The other thing here is that right now the width of this whole element is almost configured for it to be like a mobile experience. Yes, but also at the same time, if your chefs are also using it on the. If it's on mobile, then when it's actually stimulate the experience on mobile, which chef got to teach you how to do that? If we're looking at the desktop experience, then it could and should be much wider. So the way to test this. Yes. So we should do mobile first. But the way to actually do mobile first is not for the desktop. Like, right now, you're looking at a desktop. Experience, right? And the way to do it is not to have the desktop experience simulate as if it were mobile. It actually do the inspect view.  
Them: Oh. Okay?  
Me: Where we are stimulating the actual width of a mobile device, because right now this isn't the width of a mobile device either.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So I. ciera It's been a while since I've used Chrome, so we've got to figure out where is the button for us to.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Inspect view. Can you click on actually right click. Inspect. Yeah, there we go. And then do you see that little icon on the top left of the right panel? Yeah. Click on it. So now you're looking at. What's that you can control. So for dimensions. Up there on the bar on the left in the preview. Where it says responsive. You can click on the drop down. And you can choose the phone. Yeah. So just choose. Yeah. So this is what it currently looks like on a phone, if that is what we're optimizing. Yeah. So we can start here.  
Them: It's too small. Yeah.  
Me: But I do also think because your existing chefs are used to doing desktop, that's an afterthought, but after thought. Not because it's not important, but because it's easier to optimize your desktop once mobile is done.  
Them: Okay? Tiny, tiny phone. Okay. All right.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Time.  
Me: To be clear, this doesn't mean that the phone is tiny. Like when the. When the text becomes tiny, it means that the phone is bigger. Because erasure. So there's the 50% that you could turn into, like, 70 or 80 up there.  
Them: Yeah. Good resolution.  
Me: So this is really important. This is how you even with the booking app, I don't think you've been previewing things on mobile, right? So there are changes that you've made that probably have mobile implications that you're not aware of.  
Them: No.  
Me: And especially on a customer facing side, that's very important.  
Them: Yep. That's why we need a cto.  
Me: So you look at this. So this is how you get to look at any website from, like, the dimensions of a phone. Okay? Immediately.  
Them: Cool.  
Me: So if it's on, what do we want to look at right now? I'm okay if we want to look at desktop right now.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Okay? Okay? So if we're looking at desktop right now,  
Them: Yeah, I'm fine with that.  
Me: The buttons could probably go on the right, right? Like the rows could just become wider. That was what I was thinking.  
Them: Okay? The buttons on the top all the same size. What do we like them like that? Lee. Let's zone in on which buttons we were talking about. (Kate) were you talking about the buttons in the Rose?  
Me: Yes, I'm talking about the rose. Let's refine the rose and then worry about the whole page as a whole. Because I think logout shouldn't be there at all. Like, log out should be in the top, right? Above. Welcome, chef. Adam was like, you know how when you're on a. It's like the account drop down thing? On the top right? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You need a header.  
Them: Yeah, like we need a header. With an etc logo on it.  
Me: Create new service.  
Them: Okay? But in desktop view, we're saying that those buttons don't need to be on a robot, that they can be hanging out on the right of the price.  
Me: Yes. And they could be smaller, too, in a sense of like, a remind button is an important cause of action. The edit button. It's up to you whether you want to keep it as edit or do you want to keep make it like View details. Because it's like you're looking at a job.  
Them: Well. Yeah, well, I thought that. Is it more concise to say edit? Because that's what they're doing on that screen.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But they're doing both, right?  
Me: Like if I'm doing a job and I'm trying to finalize it. Edit doesn't feel like the right call to action. Edit is literally what you're doing. But also if you're trying to view the details of an event that's upcoming or whatever. You may not be trying to edit, you might just be trying to look at it. Even though at the same screen.  
Them: I'm understanding what you're saying because. Okay. This is more information here. Here than currently exists in the chef experience. Because right now, There's no place for them to go, necessarily. And look at event details that's outside of the quote generator or a PDF service agreement that doesn't exist in the same place.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So now we're saying. That there's actual information about the nature of the event that is viewable.  
Me: And by the way, you could have a details field within where if there's a quote that was coming from the CO generator, it could be a link to the code generator.  
Them: In this location.  
Me: For now. As a temporary solution before we unified the two systems.  
Them: Yeah. Right? Yeah. One of these buttons is a link to the, quote, generator proposal 100%.  
Me: Exactly. Exactly. But for now, it just feels like if I'm looking at this as my schedule, I can click on any. By the way, you can make the entire role clickable. Too. If you want that to be the case. Where you could basically click on the row itself rather than click on a button. So that's also an option. Copy. Okay? The other thing that's missing here is. I don't know if you want the contact information to be directly accessible here.  
Them: Or maybe there is a view, a fourth button. That's you, and that's where all the client stuff is paid. That's the proposal.  
Me: Okay? I would just make it one button that just says, There's just view. And that's the same place that you could edit. Like, edit is basically you view it and then you can edit it.  
Them: Okay? Right. Earlier. We were talking to you about earlier.  
Me: Yeah. Okay, so view. Okay? So. Yeah. On desktop, don't you think that it could be on the right. Like, it would look a little bit less.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The center alignment is definitely off. I see what you were trying to do with the right alignment. I think on a mobile phone, this is my opinion, but on a mobile phone, Left would be the most aligned visually. It's almost like. You know how when you pay someone on Venmo, Or like, someone asks, requests money from you on Venmo, and there's, like, a transaction popping up. There's, like, button under it. Yeah.  
Them: It's usually laughed Align. That's true. Okay? So, wait, are we talking about desktop view? Are we talking about mobile view? Right now. When you were talking about that particular alignment.  
Me: Mobile is about love to light like left alignment is about mobile.  
Them: Okay? So what are we working with right now? Mobile or desktop?  
Me: Let's do mobile. Let's commit to it. Let's commit to it.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Does that make sense to you guys to do mobile first?  
Them: Perfect.  
Me: Or are you, like, chefs are going to work on their laptop?  
Them: They were doing it after. We're doing. Yeah. You said it's easier to go from mobile to desktop to desktop to mobile, so it doesn't need to make any.  
Me: Yeah. Okay, great. One obvious thing is that the name and the overdue thing needs to be left aligned. Is there any information wise. Is there any information that you think is missing here?  
Them: We had a healthy discussion about whether or not the clients contact information needed to be. Here. I didn't necessarily think it was necessary on this particular screen because it could get everything tighter. Without it. But, I mean, I can be persuaded.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Lee, we would never want to have a copy button with something that's paid and done.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: No.  
Me: Opinion that paid and done.  
Them: He would not. Well, we might not, because what if DJ took off three weeks? And she wanted to go back and not have to type in all of his information again. So she went back to the last time that DJ had a service and copied it. Which is what she does now in the spreadsheets.  
Me: Yeah. There is a different option, by the way, which is to make a copy of function within creating a new service. So when you create a new service, you could say, like copy from a past service.  
Them: Yeah, I guess maybe. You're right.  
Me: Instead of that would reduce the clutter in terms of having the vast majority of on this page, you don't need every service to have a copy button. That's one option.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Because the use case is like when you actually want to copy something, right? And that's not all the time. And you have 20 buttons on this page.  
Them: Right. Yeah. Okay? I don't want to get lost in the sauce on that. So the use case is every single week. The chef will want to copy their recurring clients, which is the majority of their clients.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: As opposed to creating a new each time.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: But like you said, it doesn't necessarily have to be from this screen. It could be from the when they click Create new service.  
Me: Create a service.  
Them: Then they have the option to copy old services there. That's a perfectly workflow. Neither of which that's a perfectly valid workflow. Or a paradigm to work within, because we haven't really tested it either way.  
Me: I mean, to keep things simple. It's not a big deal to have a copy button there because you are going to have other buttons there anyway. And you could just move it later if you want. Okay? Cool. What else? So did we decide that Paid Undone was going to be on the screen as opposed to the separate.  
Them: We just put it there because we had the most important things at the top. And then on mobile, limitless space. But the thing that we were thinking is that it would be default collapse. It wouldn't be default.  
Me: That makes sense.  
Them: Be there. Because you can scroll infinitely on mobile.  
Me: That makes sense because. Yeah, that makes sense, because eventually we want to make history. Show me our money screen.  
Them: Or on a.  
Me: And right now, we're not working on that yet. So it makes sense to simplify it right now by just hiding it at the bottom.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Since we're not chiseling that use case anyway.  
Them: So from an information flow standpoint, we wanted to make sure that we were following the logic that we had before. Pertinent. You need to do this. You need to remind this client now. Up top, even above where they can look at. What do I have coming up this week? So I think that that's in the right place. We did not explore nationality of this. Only showing like one or two jobs and then having that flag that there's like 13 more or whatever.  
Me: This makes sense. This makes sense. So you know the concept of higher when it hurts.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It's the same thing with features. The less the better. Not because you can't build more, but because prove that you need it. You'll know if you need that feature when there's, like, 30 overdue invoices, that's when you know.  
Them: Right.  
Me: By then there's a deeper problem to solve.  
Them: Yeah. And I don't think through anecdotal experience. There's no one particular shot that overdue. Things at a time. We just see a bunch of overdue things because we're tracking 25 chefs, but they don't see a bunch of overdue stuff for them due to, like, one or two. And then for the chef team that has 30 clients, maybe it's like four.  
Me: One thing that I note is missing, that is the date of the upcoming stuff. I'm seeing it coming up this week, but when?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. This is supposed to be a schedule, right? And for the sake of mockup, let's also have.  
Them: But what's the actual date of it? Yes.  
Me: It mock up what next week looks like. Later, maybe. There's today, this week, there's later. Right. Like what is next week onwards?  
Them: Oh, I understand what you're saying.  
Me: Or if you want to keep things simple for now.  
Them: There's, like, a future forecast. And then there's.  
Me: You could also just do upcoming and that's it. And that's all the upcoming stuff. Yeah.  
Them: All of the upcoming stuff. But yeah. We did overlook that, chef. That the date needs to be here. Yes, that's true.  
Me: I guess you feel like a schedule. Right.  
Them: Yeah. So the date needs to be associated with each of these lines. When they are going to deliver that service.  
Me: You could just make that the outstanding X Days thing.  
Them: Yeah. Okay?  
Me: Also, it doesn't make sense in my view. I'm just being direct. I don't think it makes sense to name it outstanding because it's upcoming. So just have it say Luke Radford. Or something like that. This time and protract her in. Like, do they ever need to know what time an event is?  
Them: I mean, we could say delivers Monday at 10aM. We can do whatever we want.  
Me: Okay? Yeah.  
Them: It's going to change a billion times. We know that.  
Me: Okay? Great. So the upcoming time.  
Them: We're never going to design it. For the first time ever.  
Me: Like, basically the time, the date, just like the when in question is going to be written there. The question with that is that right now that's yellow and it's not extremely readable.  
Them: Yeah. Okay?  
Me: So would you want to make coming up this week a different color?  
Them: Right.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Sure. Delivery date. And delivery time would be great. And that's only on meal prep deliveries. So if it says meal prep, then there's a delivery date and delivery time. If it says events, there is no delivery date or delivery time.  
Me: There's no delivery day. Oh. I mean, there's date.  
Them: An event date, not a delivery date. Hard time. Or maybe there is an event timely.  
Me: Yeah. So whatever date and time information would just be there. So question.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Is it more like information Hierarchy wise. Doesn't make sense for dents to see the name. The name of the client before they see the date of the thing. In terms of what matters to them.  
Them: I think that most of the chefs orient themselves by the clients.  
Me: Great.  
Them: I think. I agree. Because seeing that client name brings forth all of those little bits of information. When they see the client name, they know what kind of service it is. They know when approximately it is. They're familiar with the client.  
Me: Okay? Perfect. Okay, so let's repeat ourselves. Scroll up. One other alignment thing is that the four items. Two items should either be always stuck to the right or it should be immediately next to the text. Right now, it is a little bit inconsistent. But that's a detail. Does that make sense? Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, I see. Yeah, I see that. It flipped around in there? Yes.  
Me: The other visual comment that I have would be the dot on the toggle. Being echoed by the dot on the individual rows. But usually the dot on individual rows like that indicate that something is unread. Or it indicates some kind of status. Like, you know how on emails, like on red emails have a little dot?  
Them: Yeah, well, that was the intent was highlighted status that it's overdue, but maybe that's redundant marked overdue at the top.  
Me: Yeah. And also, for example, you could consolidate. The ideas here are great. I'm just visually consolidating. For example, one other way for you to have the red is, say, overdue invoices without the red, and then the four items has a red background.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: For example.  
Them: The red background.  
Me: Just before items, though, like just that.  
Them: Not a fan.  
Me: Just a little number to. Oh, you don't like that? Okay?  
Them: We did that earlier. Oh, I thought you meant the four lines of the services. You mean the. Where it says four items?  
Me: Yeah, just that little tag.  
Them: In that top line. Oh, just the little tag is read. Oh, okay. All right. I thought you meant the background of the table up there being read.  
Me: No, we (Kate) that.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: But basically, the color of the dog could be the color of the tag.  
Them: That's what I was saying. No, I hated that.  
Me: Which kind of makes sense because it's like four outstanding, right? It screams at you. For outstanding. And I think that is a common pattern.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because right now, it's just not clear to me what the dot does.  
Them: Okay? I hear that.  
Me: But maybe that's just me.  
Them: Okay? The dot was. The dot was a Claude suggestion. And we saw it, it was like, oh, look, it's got a dot on it. It says it's overdue, but that's because that's what was already in our head, right?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So it immediately communicated that to us because that's what we were already thinking. Okay, I get that. I understand that. And so the dot is not necessary. At all, even in the section header, because that alerts signifier could be on the four items. These four items are overdue. These two items are upcoming.  
Me: That's just my take. Like, you can try it, and if you don't like it, that's fine. I just think right now,  
Them: Interesting, okay.  
Me: Especially if you want to keep the dot on a header. I think that's fine. I would consolidate it myself because I have a preference for removing things that don't really serve a clear purpose. But for the individual lines, it really looks like it's something that's new or something that you haven't read yet.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Because the dot on a cell, on a table cell is almost like a universal indicator for unread, and it's almost like if you click it, you can get rid of the dot.  
Them: Okay? I understand. I understand that. Ui. Yeah.  
Me: But you could make the overdue five days a little bolder so that the red is a little bit more.  
Them: That's because.  
Me: Screaming at you.  
Them: Yeah, that could be bigger.  
Me: Okay, cool. And an upcoming. You've made it yellow. There's a world where that works. I don't know if we make that a date. It could look a little bit unreadable. Imagine that Outstanding. Three days as like tomorrow. And it's like, wait, when is it? And then you're reading in yellow tomorrow. This is great. We've come such a long way. This is awesome. Yeah. This is great.  
Them: We were trying. All right, what's next?  
Me: This is the face where it's a lot of tiny details that add up into it. Feeling from this. There's some good ideas here. So this is ready to go. To go from the top. Let me just list out all the things that we talked about. Also show me my money. Where does that go right now? I don't think we were making that screen right now, right? Do we need that button?  
Them: No, I didn't.  
Me: Oh, yeah. Okay? Yeah, it's in our fiction.  
Them: It's in our fish, remember? We said this right here.  
Me: Well, that was originally thought of as, like, if we put history on a separate tab.  
Them: So it's funny.  
Me: Then something, then it would. But if it's race just down there, then we just don't need that button. Because then when time comes to actually implement the show me my money, it could very well be the case that we just have a home screen that has a toggle that says upcoming versus my company. There could be a whole different ways to represent that, okay?  
Them: Sure.  
Me: Yeah. Can you go back to the mockup?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I'm just gonna.  
Them: I get it.  
Me: Utter laundry list of the things we talked about. So remove the dot from the header, move the four items, tag directly next to the text that says overdue Invoices. I think this is an issue with the width of the text box. Technically speaking. So we got to wrap, make sure that the width of the text box where the header, the section headers. Fit the content. With fit to content. And then. The four items becomes a red background tag that represents the color of the status. So it's the four items tag that's currently a little bit white, gray. That one is red background with white. Four items. We can remove the show me my money button. The logout button goes to the top in a header. The name. The client name. And the red or the status text under it currently are a little bit not aligned. So we got to align that left, align that. Our mobile. We are going to move the button groups inside each cell to the left, aligned with the text. On desktop. We'll move them to the right of the dollar amount s. And then we're going to be coming up this week to just upcoming. Including all upcoming stuff. I'm going to change the outstanding three days. Yellow text into the date. Of the service. For now to keep it simple. It's just make it date of service. And then by default, the history section is collapsed. Is that all?  
Them: That was everything that we just talked about. Yes.  
Me: Okay? We're also going to make the edit button, the view button.  
Them: Right. Change that from edit to view, okay?  
Me: So it's view or copy. Does copy make more sense or just duplicate make more sense. Okay?  
Them: I think that copy is letters.  
Me: It doesn't matter. Great.  
Them: They've been hitting the word copies the whole time.  
Me: We can stick to it.  
Them: But I don't know. Whatever.  
Me: Okay? So now I'm going to give you. Did I ever tell you guys about Granola? I think so. Right. Yeah. Great. So I'm going to show you what I'm going to do with what I just said. So this has been transcribing, right? They just released a model picker. I'm going to do. T force on it, I'm going to say. Based on everything that. 's. Okay? So I'm just going to send this to you. Feel free to edit in whatever way makes sense. Like if there are some changes I describe that you don't want to do. Feel free to remove that. And then you can tinker with the mockup. It's looking great. As in. So you can tinker with it, and then we can continue tomorrow with the other views. And then we're off to a solid start to make this ready to be wired up next week. Good job, guys. Great job. Hopefully. What did he mean? Yeah. I sent you the bulleted list of changes that we described. Based on what we literally talked out loud. I commented on the same base camp thread as before. So you can selectively move stuff, enrich stuff, explain stuff, and then be like, hey, Claude. Can you apply these changes? Great. I just see what it does. Yeah. So that's that. So then tomorrow we can work on the details view. As well as any other changes, such as implementing the header. Cleaning up any aesthetics that you guys care about. I know that you guys did a bunch of cleanup already. I was about to say, I know that you guys spend, like, hours on this, and I just hopped on and be like, this alignment, this, this, whatever. So, like, apologies if I was being direct. Great. What was so funny? Great. Great. I'm so happy to hear that. I'm, like. I'm, like, worried about coming in and destroying your work, because this is your baby. But, yeah, this is just great. Visually, in terms of product design, I'm a very. This means. This gives me this feeling this evening. So that's why I look at something. I mean, like, that thought feels off to me, and then I'm just going to say it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, maybe what Claude meant is actually that overdue stuff should have a red dot. Because, yeah, if it's overdue, it has a red dot. And once you pay, once it's not overdue, the red dot is gone. Yeah. But there's a world where maybe the color for upcoming shouldn't be yellow at all. Maybe it should be like whatever the brand color of EPC is that you want to reinforce, it makes sense to reinforce that because I don't know. I was about to suggest coral, which is like the pinkish color, but then it would look. Yeah. It could work if your red is darker. Yeah. Or if you're not using the navy blue for every single section header. You could make the color of upcoming navy blue. By the way, like, visually, another comment that I have. And take it or leave it. Is that right now, visually, and this is subjective, visually, the headers are very heavy because of the background color. And there's a world where you can make the toggle where you know how sometimes the headers have no background. Like the header is just a header. And you can still have the toggle, so it's like a transparent background header. And then you can still have the red background and the tag signify under 4. You can still have and then you can make navy blue the color of upcoming.  
Them: Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. So the other aspect of it is that. This has been such.  
Me: All right.  
Them: A. Did you just put it in right now?  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Let's try. It's getting closer.  
Them: It's trying. It didn't.  
Me: So what is also done really helpful is if you screenshot specific things, for example, the text alignment. But between the name and the service date. You screenshot. That inshot like this is exactly what I'm talking about. It'll go and find that issue. The private event and meal prep are also currently not left aligned like the private event. Yeah. And then the upcoming.  
Them: It looks like the text is right. Justified.  
Me: It could be right. Justified. It could also be. I think. I think it's because the dot is in the same row as the name. That's why it's not aligned.  
Them: It's a weird table.  
Me: And it is filling up. It might be space between. I'm just speculating what the underlying CSS is that made it look the way it is.  
Them: I know, right? I know. I wish I could see the table grid lines.  
Me: If you remove the dot, the name will be aligned. It's up to you. Yeah. If you remove the dot, the name will be naturally aligned.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then the meal prep and whatever will fit. Whatever it wants to fit. That's not a big deal. And then it fix the text content fitting for overdue invoices but not upcoming. Because this is an HTML hard coded page and they're not actually using reusable partials for each of the sections. So changing the code. It changed the code for the style of the overdue invoices. But now let's go though. I think. I think that's what's going on. But we'll see. Cool. All right. Yeah.  
Them: Oh, my God. Cool, man. This is very.  
Me: We are going to deliver something that's viable. What I would suggest is that while I don't want to. While we're not pulling the Hail Mary card, I think there are parts of the process where I can help chisel a little bit. So I think, for example, with this view that you have now, I can spend the next 10 minutes chiseling some of the things that I talked about and showing you a suggestion. Of what I think. And then that would just kind of speed things up a little bit. I think tomorrow, the other view, we have the admin view to figure out, which is just basically a spreadsheet. And then we have the chef login and the most importantly, the payment page. Not the payment pages. Details pop up. Right? The details pop up. So those are the only two things.  
Them: Yeah. The detail.  
Me: That would 100% be necessary before we have a working interface that we can then wire up next week. So I think we're good. And then we're good. With the caveat that I think I'm going to step in with small edits.  
Them: Okay? Okay?  
Me: So, Chef, like, whenever you're done playing around with this, push it.  
Them: Okay? Okay?  
Me: And let me know.  
Them: I'll push it to the get. I got to go call Rick. So I'm done, Lee, Unless you want to keep tinkering, you're done. Okay?  
Me: All right. Push it. Push it.  
Them: Call Rick and whatnot.  
Me: Good job. Good job, guys.  
Them: Thank you. Thank you for driving today. This is freaking awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  
Me: No, don't worry about it. Push it to remote.  
Them: We're (Kate) not going to try to get rid of the damn dots.  
Me: I'll get it done. Right now, you clone the repository and this is your local copy.  
Them: What do you mean, picture to remote?  
Me: So you need this copy to be pushed to GitHub. And then also, I don't think you've added me as a collaborator on GitHub yet for your fork. Repo.  
Them: Well, let's go. Let's do all that stuff right now. I'm not trying to figure it out without you.  
Me: Yep. Add me as a collaborator, and then after that, ask CloudCo to push this to me.  
Them: All right, so what does this thing damn call Etc portal?  
Me: So both. Go to Settings under repo.  
Them: Etc total add you as a collaborator. How do I do that?  
Me: And then collaborators.  
Them: Settings on the reefer. Oh, my God. I got a 404. Error. On what?  
Me: Are you logged out?  
Them: Yeah. You want to see it? Amy was talking about.  
Me: You need to go to the chef one. You don't have access to this repo right now. I don't think. Because you cloned it. Yeah. Go to yours. Do you see on the left? It says trifastin yancey epc portal.  
Them: I'm going to go to home. Now. What?  
Me: No, you didn't clone it into elite personal chefs. You cluttered into your personal. So left down. Down. No, no. Down. If you see portal.  
Them: Here.  
Me: The second last one.  
Them: Oh, this one.  
Me: It. Collaborators on the left. The second button. I was gonna laugh every time GitHub asks for a password, it's so funny. Yes. Great. Oh, I'm ready. There. Because you forked it. Okay, great.  
Them: Guess.  
Me: So then push to a remote. So you go to cursor and you ask Claude to go ahead and push it.  
Them: I don't know if Lee has one, okay?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Push it to remote. Push this to remote. Okay, let's see if I do an.  
Me: Great.  
Them: Okay, there's. Your little dots are gone.  
Me: We'll work on the great. I am going to try removing the background of the dropdown because it's really overbearing right now.  
Them: Great. Okay. Yeah. I mean, the other side of it is that I didn't really do any creative work. We were purely doing it through Claude. So any suggestions that you have.  
Me: Yeah. Got it.  
Them: I am totally open to because for me, it doesn't feel the level of elegant that we want at all. So my intent or my thought process. Was, was that there would be an opportunity to tighten up the visual. And because right now I'm in this process of learning what we're even doing. And so the aesthetic side of my design skills.  
Me: All right. So I'm going to deconstruct to you. Why? It doesn't look as elegant as you want. Because I know exactly what you're talking about. And what is your desired vibe?  
Them: Are, like, on the back right now.  
Me: Right. Is this something closer to the front end of the code generator? Is that elegant, or do you have a different style palette that you guys have used to.  
Them: I am. I'm like I am. Clean. Modern design. Form follows function. No unnecessary adornment. And so the alignment is crazy. The headers are too heavy. And thick. There's some typography, hierarchy issues.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: There's all kinds of things that are happening from an elegance standpoint. That for me would probably take a couple of hours for me to work through visually just to get to a point where I like it.  
Me: I want to try to sell it a little bit ahead of tomorrow. Are you guys free tomorrow morning? Do we have a session for tomorrow morning? No, I don't think originally scheduled it. Are you guys around? Would you guys be okay if, before we meet tomorrow, I make some changes and I show it to you?  
Them: Share the ability.  
Me: I can show you the history of how I did that, too. Okay? Great. So I'm going to do that. I'm going to explain to you why and how it feels. It's going to feel different.  
Them: You're our teacher, man. Whatever the.  
Me: If you're on the information hierarchy, I think there's two things. There's information hierarchy from, like, a usability standpoint. And then separately. Elegance from an aesthetic standpoint. Which is caused by things like the thickness of the font spacing. Round corners versus no round corners. Cloud really lets wrong corners. It looks like kindergarten.  
Them: Agree. I am very modern, clean, aesthetic. And all of those little details add up to make your aesthetic not clean.  
Me: Yeah. It's like a restaurant design.  
Them: Or modern.  
Me: Every lamp counts. Yeah.  
Them: Right. Every little bit of it. Yeah, every little bit of it counts because it adds up to the overall thing.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: But I do want to say that I'm very proud of us for being able to spin up something from nothing so quickly. That is so close to what I would view as ideal. It's like 75% there, which is amazing to have done with no real footing.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: In how to actually build this. That we were just talking into a machine, and it built it for us. It's fucking phenomenal. Okay. All right, we've lost Chef. He needs to go and work.  
Me: Great. All right. We got this.  
Them: All right. Is it pushed? Have you confirmed that you can access it?  
Me: Give me a second. The GitHub interface has a lot of things. It's a lot. It's a lot on a page. Yeah. Where? I'm like, I've been using this for so long, and I still don't know where to find things. Oh, my God. I have it. Okay. What time are we. What time are we free tomorrow? Because I didn't originally block the time. Okay? Let's do 11 your time. Your time. So 10 my time.  
Them: 11 11.  
Me: So 11 est. It's 11 est. 10 cst.  
Them: Chef and I are in different time zones, so. You mean me? Got it. Perfect.  
Me: And then I'm going to call it. I'm going to call it flambei.  
Them: 11 est 10 my time. Which is also.  
Me: No fermenting.  
Them: Fermenting, okay? Great. Okay? Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. For the time today.  
Me: Thank both of you for being so patient.  
Them: We are learning from right now, and we're doing our best over here.  
Me: You are doing amazing. Seriously. I'm recapping everything to Neil, and he's like, I can't believe how fast this turned out.  
Them: All right. Awesome. I love it already in problem solving for other things. So if you're good.  
Me: Very good.  
Them: Okay, awesome. Shafi, do we need to handle stuff?  
Me: All right, bye.  
Them: You got this name? Chicago.
