Meeting Title: EPC commission calculation and interface design strategy
Date: Aug 19

Transcript:
 
Them: I just got a text from Oliver asking how much our EPC commission is. And I'm just confirming that we locked him in at 15 that we did not do a 20% for him. Yeah. Because he's broke. Because he broke. Okay, Got you. Okay, Cole. Thanks. I just wanted to make ciera, no, Chef. We've been doing 20 for him. Should I have done 15 for him? We can move.  
Me: Because I had been doing. Actually that. 's what we were doing. We are on because we were going to 20, but then I think that we kind of tabled that idea in general. Did we? Kind of table that. So now it feels more like we move back to a flat 15. We can afford to. Do you think? Okay. Thank you. I will let him know. Maybe he will let him know after this game. ciera For some reason, my computer is apparently lagging a little bit. I'm going to keep going because it's not really affecting. I can hear you, and it sounds like you can hear me. And I'm currently trying to shut down some unnecessary applications to make sure that it doesn't block. Our progress. But at some point, if it does so happen, That it becomes an actual blocker. I'll just leave and rejoin. Okay? Before we jump in, I wanted to check in on how you guys are feeling about the past one and a half days. It's been one and a half days since we kicked this off. Any thoughts, or is this kind of, like, on par with what you expected? What was surprising to you? Just want to hear a few thoughts before we keep going.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, it's definitely on par with what I was. With what I was expecting. So I feel really good about getting into a true design and build process, which I feel like we've been doing. So it's like a very comfortable. It's like a very comfortable atmosphere for me because this is how the majority of my career has been structured in this type of mode. It feels really good for me.  
Me: I know we haven't just gone straight to coding, so I just want to hear your feedback on how this feels. And this is making sense.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, it makes a difference on the same page and designing for it and all of that.  
Me: Cool. I think we come from a very different place than most of our brand new startup. Taking an idea to meals. We're like, saying, hey, use every day. And your team is one thing that we use every day. We want to come home.  
Them: News every day. We want to combine them and own it.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That's a little bit different than, like, oh, I have a crazy idea. Which is how I started meeting right when I first met her. I was like, I got a crazy fucking idea. And we built what we have now. That's kind of interesting. Interesting place.  
Me: It's also interesting because from this morning, we're starting to see how there are decisions that you guys have made historically. Right. That made. Makes sense. And it makes you who you are today. But those are some essential, almost essential trade offs or decisions that at some point in the future you might need to pick a path. Right. You might need to start eventually having an opinion on what does it mean to own a chef business on upc. Right. How does that business run? What is your decision versus what is their decision? Those are linen needs to start drawing as you start productized. Right. And this is almost like an entryway into thinking about that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So I want to get your gut reaction. I was thinking as I looked at the sketches that I posted. And I considered our progress a little bit more deeply. That maybe instead of aiming to get to a coded interface today, we can make that something that we start off fresh tomorrow morning. Where we launch Claudco tomorrow morning, and we're ready to run. And today I think we should.  
Them: Sure.  
Me: Really continue to discuss. It might take 30 minutes. It might take the full hour. Continue to discuss the sketches. And I think there is one, at least one more element that I realize after I sketched the service. Details pop up if you saw on a basecamp post. That I think deserves a little bit of thought. Because I think that it's a pretty essential component here. That deserves us to align on before we jump into interfacing.  
Them: Yeah. Okay, well, let me. Let me throw this by you.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So I have three sales calls and people coming over for dinner. I'm trying to juggle building this stuff and running the business and living life.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Word. I know. What are the mission critical for this meeting?  
Me: I understand. And I know that that's also what I wanted to do if I check on. Because we've actually been. Even though we haven't touched any code. We've been doing a lot.  
Them: Yeah, I have the stupid question.  
Me: Of progress.  
Them: I'm in a stupid question. I'm in cursor now working on recurring code base. Am I going to be jumping from copays to code base? How is this going to work what we already currently have?  
Me: Yeah. It's going to be basically a separate cursor window. Like you're going to open two windows, of course. So that's going to be a second thing. What I would recommend, and I know that's hard to grapple with, what I would recommend is, at least for the rest of this week, you could put that other code base on pause because it's not like there's something that is fundamentally broken about how that works today if you just couldn't. Afford to spend time on that this week.  
Them: Yeah. There's nothing broken. Well, there's nothing broken, but we keep finding issues. Yes.  
Me: Yes, understood. So I would put that a little bit on a back burner for at least, like, two days. To get started on this before you jump back into that so that you're not confused.  
Them: Okay. How do I do that?  
Me: So you can open a new window on cursor by clicking file. Window, and it'll prompt you to open a new project.  
Them: New world. Now. Okay?  
Me: Okay, to answer your question of what's absolutely mission critical, I think let's aim to wrap this in, like, 20 to 30 minutes.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Or 20 minutes, so on a dot. Mission critical. I would say we should be able to start tomorrow morning. Feeling good about creating an interface mock, like as an encoded interface mock that you can.  
Them: Yeah, I mean, I totally understand. You're trying to run nimble and not work. I'm going to do a whole bunch double work. I'm going to make a whole bunch of mistakes and have to fix stuff. That's how it's going to go, okay?  
Me: This is less about mistakes and it's more about being aligned.  
Them: It's open.  
Me: Maybe. Did you guys have a chance to look at the sketch? And how did that feel?  
Them: Generally speaking, to me, the sketch felt very close to the experience that I envision. Okay. This feels very close to what I would expect it to feel like. If I were to open this screen, be presented with the information, and then want to do something with it? Obviously, it's a fat marker sketch, so there's lots of detail to be filled in, but just generally speaking, Okay? Yeah, I see that. This stuff. And there's, like, little tweaks and whatnot. Like, I got lost in this house. I'm like, well, should it be pending or should be overdue? Which one sounds more pertinent? But regardless of that, it felt about right and the level of information being presented felt about rights.  
Me: Okay? So I think the home screen. We've thought a lot about this. We've spent a lot of time thinking about this already.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: In this case, let's not even spend the next 20 minutes. Let me just tell you what I was thinking as one other thing that I think we need to refine.  
Them: For sure.  
Me: Before. Move ahead.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And then you can put that sort of like in your back pocket. If you have time to think about it, think about it. If not, we'll think about it tomorrow.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So on the pop up for the service details,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: On the right. That's where all the money is calculated. So I was thinking about. You need to be able to present the information about what the service is about. So, Chef, I'm talking about a service. Details pop up. So on the left, like, do you need to be able to see the details of the client, what the service is about, the notes from Amy, all of that? And then there's this calculation that's almost like a line item receipt style thing. Where you see the contract value is whatever. The groceries is whatever. Therefore, the client owes whatever. That's the invoice amount. But then there's also the calculations for the reimbursements, and then, therefore, the payout. And the cash. Whatever. Right? So that's like the calculator. That's like the calculator side of the equation. We're not taking in the. All the elements, all the variables behind a calculation, but at the very least, there are some big variables that are present for every. Every single one of these. Contracts, right?  
Them: Right? Yeah.  
Me: Part. Just that part alone. Deserves something from you guys. On what is the most streamlined way to present that equation? It's almost like an elementary school math equation. Right. The chef needs to be able to look at this. And quickly comprehend the client pays this. Right. And then the client pays this, and then what? Okay, reimbursements. But then for some, the reimbursement, the groceries reimbursed. For some, the groceries added onto the client check. So then like how that information is presented. Needs some thinking. Does that make sense?  
Them: It does make sense. Yes. Should we be thinking of the presentation, meaning the chef's kind of, like, quick understanding of the information, or should we be thinking about it with that added layer of. They're also able to edit this information.  
Me: I think that because we're just talking about basically five numbers and how they relate to each other. So some of these numbers are calculated, right? The total do is calculated. The cash payout, equity payout is calculated. But as I was planning out, I'm like, I don't know the ins and outs of this math enough?  
Them: Okay? Yeah.  
Me: To confidently put pen on paper. What this is going to look like? In a sense of. Because how is the cash? KL Basically, what is the visual way to represent this equation?  
Them: Okay?  
Me: In a way that is applicable to the most cases, because you have a big variety of different contracts. If that makes sense. There needs to be basically, an information design, like a presentation, where it's like, this is the math equation. It looks almost like a dummy, like elementary school, like math does. Plus this minus this equals to the client pays this, and then somehow, in a different color with a different shade.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Like this than is the amount that you get with this amount in equity. That information. Just that alone. That equation alone needs some thought and some love from somebody who understands the equation.  
Them: Okay? Pretty damn close. Total. Yeah, I agree that it's very close, but if you want us to take a look at it, just to make sure that it's, like, buttoned. No problem. We can even Chefy. We can even pull up some of Appy's old layout. Because a lot of that information was presented just to make sure. Still tracking that we're still. You know what I mean?  
Me: Yeah, Because I was thinking about, like, okay, is the cash payout with the commission and everything calculated after the reimbursements are considered, or the reimbursements calculated after the payout is considered? Like, I don't know. The sequencing of that calculation and that needs to be presented in a way that's universally understood that the chef can look at and have no questions about. And I think that is an important element.  
Them: Understood?  
Me: You know how that chapter in Shape up is called Find the Elements. So this is the essence of the interface. Like the fat marker sketching is like, what are the elements on the screen?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Are you epc? And I think this equation is a very epc.  
Them: Equation. Yeah, I get that. Let me just throw something into the mix while. So I give myself properly oriented to think about this. So a very tactical aspect of this is that the EPC commission is taken off of the total contract value. Not the reimbursables at all.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And I'm not sure it's important for there to be some spatial relationship between that. Or not.  
Me: See what I mean?  
Them: I feel like.  
Me: You see what I mean? That's a detail that is important here. As in it becomes total due and then calculated equity calculated out of this total contract value.  
Them: Yeah. Okay?  
Me: How that is present, Ed.  
Them: Well, yeah.  
Me: Because then it's like DO is minus the deposit already, but then the EPC commission is calculated out of the total value, not the contract due. So maybe instead of having the total due in the middle, it should be the total value and then calculated the payout first, and then at the very bottom, there's client. Ozdis, you get this.  
Them: I will think about. It. Right.  
Me: Right. That's all. Companies, different organization from what I just put.  
Them: Yeah, interesting.  
Me: So that. Play around with that a little bit. It's not urgent to have this, like, right now. Right now?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But as we kiss a lot of the interface that that visual presentation. And by the way, that becomes something that you can apply, that design becomes something that's medium agnostic. Like, you could apply this on paper too, like when you present, when you like hand out a fly or do a chef, like that same equation presentation. Shows up. As well.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So that's just one thought I wanted to seed. Other than that, I think we're good to go. And, Chef, you have a lot to take care of. You guys have been doing amazing. We've made a lot of progress, and we're on track.  
Them: That's all good. Yeah. I mean, the way that it syncs up now in the spreadsheet and then the way that it syncs up on Square Up. The spreadsheet Is the chef talking to us? That they talk to us for their equity.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And then they talk to the client through square up. To square up is the payment processor. So it has line items, which is like a Mountain Dew tax, plus reimbursements. That's talking to clients. And then talking to us. Is total plus reimbursement that we just don't take the commission out of anything. The reimbursement.  
Me: I understand. Yeah. So right now you have these numbers in a lot of different places, right. And one of the struggles about is that the chef isn't. The chefs aren't educated on or aren't sufficiently educated on the whole equity thing, the whole, like, how all of those things, those pieces work together.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And there's an opportunity here to really distill that equation and to something.  
Them: I mean, honestly, (Kate) what you have here is almost perfect. I agree. And I was just talking about that one little nuance know s down to the next line underneath. Groceries down to the next line underneath. Oh, yeah, Deposit. And then groceries, reimbursements and total due plus tax. Got to add a line for the tax. Right, which is taxes and fees. And so then the equity payment and the cash payment are taken right off the total value.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So you could do that. You could move value, cash payment, equity payments, to talk. And then whatever. And we can do it however we want to, right? So we just got to pick one.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: The point of the point that (Kate) I think is making is that just picking one should be based on the logic specifically that we want to communicate. So it's not an arbitrary decision. It really is a strategic decision about what is the not getting design speak. But it's a strategic decision about how do we most clearly and effectively communicate the message that we want to communicate.  
Me: Yeah, because it seeps into their subconscious, right? Looking at?  
Them: The way you said that. So what do you think the chef wants to think first? Probably what's natural is, like, my money right now. And then I put a second. Right. So I don't think this is a long exercise, Chef. And I can take looking at this because I like it.  
Me: You can also throw our conversation right now plus the drafts right now and all your additional thoughts. Throw into ChatGPT and work with Tinker with options.  
Them: Right. Yeah. Absolutely. And then it's minus five.  
Me: You know what I mean? This is a very epc thing. Like, this is a distinctively epc element.  
Them: It is. Unique in the way that a lot of other places the commission disappears because the other platforms don't want you to see the commission because they don't want you to know how much they're taking that you never see again, Right? Whereas we're like, no, we want you to see how much because that. Has value to you, right? So, yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. This? Is this data communication?  
Them: Exactly.  
Me: We're getting so nerdy. Right. And it's funny because.  
Them: Because this is my ongoing symbiotic relations. Hip. With Chef Asin Yancy is that he's trying it right now, even though I just said, I'll take care of this, because this is what I did for 35 years, right? Information, design. No, I love it. It's a symbiotic relationship. I'm more than happy to look at this because it's like, what I do.  
Me: It's also an equation that you know very well.  
Them: Exactly.  
Me: All right.  
Them: Sephi is when he's, like, not going to be done with his fucking call until we finish. Look at him.  
Me: Should we call?  
Them: You love it. I know you love it.  
Me: Should we call it?  
Them: I got it right here.  
Me: It's great. Send out to Lee. Let's revisit this.  
Them: I'll just run them by.  
Me: Candle we're doing.  
Them: Doing it. I know exactly what. We good, baby?  
Me: Okay? Great. Okay? So I'll update.  
Them: We are good. All right, so starting tomorrow, what time? I'm going to be on the push.  
Me: What time are we meeting tomorrow? You get us that one? I said, oh, I forgot to send you invite here. I put it at 12:30 or time like 12:30 EST, because you guys said that or Chef said that you were busy in the morning. Yes. Okay? Yeah.  
Them: Now we got to check and make sure there's no flaws with our current booking situation. Okay? Fix anything if I'm not doing anything. I understand.  
Me: If it comes to chop, you can open a window, but in general keep it closed to not distract or to not.  
Them: Over there, like, this is broken. That's broken. This doesn't work. Constantly fixing shit. Yeah, well, some of the things that she says are broken are not actually broken. They just aren't working the way. Perfectly fluid. Yeah. All customers are with apps, right? If it's not broken, it's ruined. No, I. Can hook up with Amy when she's back in the shop. I'll run through morning.  
Me: And I'm like, yeah. In the morning.  
Them: That were happening earlier. You did. So it should be pretty. Something's wrong.  
Me: Know about.  
Them: I'll link up with Amy in the morning. She's back in the chair because she's off now to gbx. Right. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I will link up with her in the morning. And run through it and make sure that we don't see anything. That something decided to break overnight. Yeah. Which happens. My pair with the chef teachers working the money from the archive. There's no drop down for booked and lost. And I said books that money catches itself. So it doesn't really matter. But I have five new leads in right now. Oh, awesome. Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. And Amy's not in the chair right now. Exactly. Okay. Yeah. We've got business. We've got actual business to do. Okay. Yeah. I mean, this is actually.  
Me: Working on the business. Then you can work in the.  
Them: This is it.  
Me: Building the plane as it takes off for us. It's fine. It has been in the air. It's more like a spaceship. It's like repairing. The international space station. In the middle of a stormy ocean, and we're trying to. Right? Because every day. This is a girlfriend. Right. Thank you.  
Them: For being patient with us. Thank you to both you and Neil for even coming up with this crazy idea that you had. Just ridiculous, but it's working.  
Me: Let's keep it going. All right, I'm going to update your kitchen setup. With the stuff that we discussed today so that tomorrow we're really ready to roll.  
Them: And send us that meaning notice and.  
Me: I think I just did. All the time. Perfect. All right.  
Them: No, I didn't get it.  
Me: And Chef, I hope you're appreciating that. What Chef asked for was, I'm okay if we take forever. I'm okay if we go slow. But I want to see and understand the process from the ground up, and we're doing it. I'm not building the mock up for you. Right now. I could have just plugged this in and we could have had to interface. Right now, we're not doing that. Because I think it's valuable for you to build it from the ground up so that you can expand it. It's the nucleus, it's yours.  
Them: 's dope. And I'm glad that we are part of every second of it. Absolutely, buddy, absolutely.  
Me: You guys. I know you guys are busy.  
Them: I'm letting AI deny everything for me. Just. You're going to design it?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Thank you.  
Them: Thank you, (Kate) Thank you for the flexibility. Yeah.  
Me: Five leads in the last hour and 45 minutes. That's crazy. Wild man. It's all over. On the quote generator. They're all different. Parties.  
Them: It's awesome. Here comes the other one. It's been a world. I ended the rec center she meeting and I had 86 emails from the two meetings that I had this morning because I needed to go through.  
Me: Okay? All right? No, I have full of respect how much you guys are dropping. So go do it. I don't want to take too much of your time.  
Them: Thank you, south carolina. Lee. Oh, that's awesome. Jen and Ryan. Maybe they'll finally make some profit. Oh, my God. All right. Thanks, (Kate) We're going to end up battling forever, but thank you.  
Me: All right. I got the meeting notice. Other than looking at the equation. Chef. I know you're busy, so don't worry about it. But if you do find yourself having some time, try to do the cloning, the repo. According to the instructions. Other than that, we're good. Other than that, just focus on the things that you already have on your plate. That's good.
