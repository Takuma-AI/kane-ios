Meeting Title: EPC portal home screen mockup design session
Date: Aug 20

Transcript:
 
Them: From mindset out of the business and putting ourselves into chef mindset that it is most important for them to see what their value is.  
Me: Taking ourselves out of the Afrobeat. Self.  
Them: However, we want to continually underscore and communicate that their value includes the options. Right? So that the total number value is. And then they can see how it breaks out in capture and options.  
Me: Number.  
Them: That is ideal. Is what do I need? How do I need to edit the numbers so that they are correct now that I have fully talked with the client about the service and or executed the service? Meaning do I need to edit the contract number because the guest count changed and I need to add in my food costs? I need to add in my miscellaneous costs and whatever. It's a very rare case. I think that the chef would actually need to input or modify the deposit. That's something that's usually done.  
Me: Before it even gets. So whether or not we need to display that amount. It might be nice for them to see, but it's not something they have to edit. Us go into the population.  
Them: Although it does go into the calculation. And then at the bottom of the screen, they are seeing what the total DO is, meaning that's what's going to be charged to the client. That's the number that gets passed to square and incorporated into the invoice. And it seems like this flow, it's not really an equation. But that information flow. Feels the most natural from the chef's experience. But chef. Did I track with what we were talking about?  
Me: That makes total sense. Just so I'm clear.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Am I right that the food cost is sometimes a part of reimbursing from the payroll, and sometimes it is directly just passed on to the client, depending on if it's a private event or if.  
Them: I would modify that language just a little bit. To say that in the private exam event example that you were talking about, the food cost is included in the price. Not pass along to not pass along to the client. And in those cases,  
Me: Yes.  
Them: We don't even ask the chef for the food cost, because that's up to them. They can spend whatever they want because they're only getting the contract amount.  
Me: Okay? So for private events, you don't need the food line at all. That simplifies things.  
Them: Yeah, we don't need it. I guess I should clarify. We don't need it if the chef wants to always keep a running total of their food costs, no matter what type of job it is. They might have that number, but we don't need it for our calculations. Yes.  
Me: Yeah. It's not a great. This experience. They're not receiving that on upc. So as far as this green is concerned,  
Them: Correct.  
Me: The food cost is only there when the food cost is passed to the client. Okay? The other thing that I want to clarify here is then that there is the cash directly equivalent. The cash is calculated here directly equivalent to payroll.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Perfect. That definitely simplifies. 6. My main input is that it doesn't feel natural. For an input value to be under a separate display of it up there. So the contract field is total value.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Right.  
Them: You reverse them, essentially.  
Me: I'm saying that we can make the total value field of what you see is what you get. Editor, like as in edit in place. You update. Total value is an input field. You update it and cache and options. Is dynamically adjusted to reflect whatever is in that box.  
Them: That's not exactly correct, because total value to the chef. Includes their reimbursables. Right. So that's a calculated number.  
Me: Where are reimbursables?  
Them: The reimbursables are the food and the miscellaneous costs.  
Me: So that's why this becomes confusing, because the outcome.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Is up there. Wait.  
Them: Yeah. As opposed to. You're right. Yes. What you are describing. Is exactly the way that I laid it out. Yes. That when you input numbers below, it affects what shows above.  
Me: Also.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Wait. So total value includes reimbursables in the sense of if that value or if that cost is passed on to the client, that's a part of the total value.  
Them: That's right. Yeah. Total value of the money that the chef is receiving, but it's not the value for the equity. As only the base price. That's the equity. That's how it's calculated in the spreadsheet right now. Yeah. EPC is a column. That's the equity which is taken from the contract value. They input that and then they input their food cost, their miscellaneous. And so then the money that they get is their input times 85% plus all reimbursables. And the ETC equity is just 15% of what? They input originally.  
Me: Okay, so what I'm hearing is there are two concepts here. There's the concept of the value of the contract itself, like the value of the work, which, because in the calculation of the equity, it doesn't include the reimbursables, it. Reimbursables is not a part of total value as much as it's a part of the payroll. With which they're reimbursed.  
Them: Yeah. Okay?  
Me: So then there's a separate concept here. There's two concepts here. There's. How much value are you generating for the company? And then there's how much money are you going to get paid, including the stuff that you're going to be reimbursed for?  
Them: Yes. All right, I'm tracking with that. I am tracking with that. And my. Yes. My perspective on this is that the shop actually getting and how much we're getting in cash and how much they're getting in options. Was my perception. But I could be persuaded that that is not the right message to send. I could be persuaded that. Yes. My perception was that this total. And maybe total value just isn't the right words. But the number that they want to see is, what does this mean to me? And what does this mean to me from a chef's perspective? Is what's hitting my bank account. And what is EPC reserving for me in options?  
Me: Like maybe I'm understanding this wrong, but for reimbursables, it's kind of like. It's kind of like when you report expenses to a company. It's not that. That is net and net positive sum money that you're. It cancels out with money that you've already spent.  
Them: No. That is true.  
Me: So that's almost not a part of the contract and not a part of the value of the service. It's just separate. Just like money I'm going to be reimbursed for and my payroll. Like, if you strictly think about it, there's payroll. As in, what value have I provided to this company and what am I paying? What am I getting paid? And then there's reimbursements for money that I've already spent, which is kind of nutting out to zero.  
Them: Okay? I'm tracking with you. Chef. Just like an opinion, like putting yourself in the spot of being a chef in the company. Seeing the number, that only reflects the contract value. And then having your payroll, whatever that displayed in a different area. Does that make sense? Because your payroll, I want an all in one shot, just like the sheet is now. Right. So the sheet showed me everything. When I go, when I log on, I can see exactly everything in one screen and one shot. That's why it hasn't changed in seven years. But there's nothing wrong with it. It's just simple.  
Me: What if.  
Them: Just caveman simple.  
Me: Okay. I have something in mind. I'm going to sketch it out.  
Them: If you're talking about moving, like, one box to the bottom or whatever, that makes sense. Too.  
Me: I'm talking about. Potentially okay. Let me see.  
Them: Yeah, maybe we just need to see what your.  
Me: But you understand my concern. There's, like, a lot of duplicating. Not duplicating, but there's, like, a lot of moving pieces. In terms of the numbers. Let's see.  
Them: And we're always looking at this, assuming that the job has been done. Right. Yeah. And so then we'll have to separate what's coming up versus what's done that was in the other thing that you shared. That's a different screen. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So I've done this event. I did it on Friday. I did it for Lee and his family. It was a 1000. $200 dinner. And so the cash and options would calculate. Lee added two people. Last minute. Yeah, that's why you need to change that contract number. Yes, right. The $600 has been paid to me. But I need to put 1,000 in here. For the final. And then he asked me to get strawberries of milk on the way by. And I did. So I put that in the food cost. And miscellaneous. I don't know, travel expense, whatever. Yeah, okay. And so when I put in that money for the contract price, now the total value should change, right? The other way. That was my thought, yeah. But I understand where that's my endable skill. Does make sense. Yeah. I understand where (Kate) is saying that maybe we can collapse it and we don't need that number into places. Total value.  
Me: Because the total value is like. I'm just, like, thinking from first principles as an outsider. If I look at the word total value, that's like the value of created, that's like the value of the service. And expenses that are reimbursed are not a part of that value.  
Them: Part of the value. Hardest payout. I understand what you're saying. I do understand what you're saying.  
Me: Maybe I should picture.  
Them: Yeah, that's a nuance. I can't see because you're sharing.  
Me: Then. I think. I wish I set up, like, an iPad workflow where I just draw on a screen and just share with you guys. Someday in the future. Rolling back.  
Them: Oh, my God, that's hilarious.  
Me: I'm ciera guys. I'll have it together. I'm uploading it. Basically, like, conceptually. What I'm thinking. Or what this is. And I'm showing too. There's a contract value to edit, and your resulting cash payout and options are updated according to contract value, which feels reasonable. It's like the immediate feedback loop of like, this is what this means. This is what this contract value means for you. In terms of the value that you're getting from it, you're getting it in total. Just the options. And then there's a food, there's a miscellaneous, there's a deposit, and this is a total amount of money that the client owes you. And then it's almost like under the line is the calculation for who owes who what. So there's what the client owes you and then there's what epcos you for this part. I actually did. The food at miscellaneous are addition, like, not subtraction. That is true. They don't.  
Them: Reimbursement. Thing. Because that cost is passed along to the client, so it's reimbursement. But it's not necessarily EPC reimbursement, so that's just a confusing language.  
Me: Yeah. Maybe it shouldn't be. Like, if we're okay with it, there's a world where we don't include that amount on a screen at all because it's kind of implied.  
Them: Yeah, because they've already entered those numbers, right? It's the food in this point is.  
Me: They've already underdose. They've already entered those numbers, and it's a part of their understanding those costs are reimbursed and they are not paying.  
Them: Exactly. Yeah, I don't think it needs to appear.  
Me: And that keeps things simple because then the screen, the call to action is very clear, right? Like it's an invoice. Send invoice for that total do amount. With these algorithms. And the reimbursement is a separate thing for when eventually your dashboard also includes payroll. As a part of it.  
Them: Hey, you're right about the contract value, them needing to type it in.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yes. And that's right. The only thing that I would say is a nuance that we can just take 2 minute discussion on because I don't think it needs to be like a big long thing. Is that the deposit, usually in the vast majority of cases, 90% of the cases, the deposit is taken care of on the management side, not on the chef's side. So the vast majority of cases, that doesn't need to be an editable field.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Information.  
Me: It should still, at the very least, be there. Just so you know where the number comes from. And it's a line item on a customer's end as well.  
Them: Yeah. Exactly information. Lee's right. That number that goes in that deposit box should be Auto pull something proposal. Yeah. They will never need to change it, ever.  
Me: So I understand that in an ideal world, it will pull automatically from the proposal. In a short term, you'll have admin enter it. I don't know. It's an opinionated choice on your end whether you want to maintain that flexibility just in case there was an error and the client disputes and shows the chef a receipt of a deposit they paid, that's a different amount.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It's kind of like that. You trust the chefs to not edit it into something that's wrong. Or do you want to explicitly remove that editing edit functionality? That's an arbitrary choice. Regardless of whether it's editable or not. On the tech side, this is a form. It's just. What are we? Enable that field or not? So.  
Them: Yeah. I would say for this right now, let's make the decision that is a field that is uneditable.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Yeah, it just displays. It's just information for them only.  
Me: Yeah. So it's only.  
Them: It is subtracted. Like you said, it is calculated.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yes. So they understand why the total due is less $500 because that deposit has already been paid.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah, they need to see that. Okay, I think we have a clean.  
Them: Yes. You're right on the plus signs. The food and miss is plus and the deposits minus. And scratch that, you.  
Me: Miscellaneous just has no sign. The only thing that's minus is deposit.  
Them: Understand what you're saying.  
Me: Typical invoice line item thing. Yeah. And then for events, there's just no line items at all. It's just contract value minus deposit. All right.  
Them: No, because reimbursement.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: There could be some. There's always need to be an ad button. We need to be able to add a line item. Because sometimes. They're like. At the end of the contract, right before the event, they're like, oh, you know what? We decided we wanted ribs. Can you just pick that up? And the chef will be like, well, that wasn't in the original contract. Exactly.  
Me: So do you want? So are you saying that the food of miscellaneous are not even set categories that they could infinitely enter more line items that are custom defined?  
Them: I think that the buckets of food and miscellaneous are broad enough to cover. Unless you want to talk. Unless you want it to.  
Me: This is again the question of how much leash do you want for the shaft, I guess. And how much of their own liberty deal want to let them take, as in.  
Them: Yeah, Chefy, we might want to call out service staff. But we're related to private event. We might want to call out. Server. Things that do it this way. Things that have been added in the past are service staff rentals. Travel. So does it say food, miscellaneous rental, staff, travel, all automatically? That's five boxes of those, right? Or aren't going to get used very often.  
Me: I think just blood, people. Let's just make it a field where you literally type in whatever the hell you want, but maybe there's a drop down that allows you to select from common things.  
Them: Right.  
Me: But, like, on the back end, we're not storing a set of categories. It's not set. It's basically custom written every time. Unless it's important to you that you have a clean data set of here's how much food costs across the board.  
Them: Yeah, well, we would want that. We would want that, number one. And number two. I don't know how I mean. And I hope I'm not going too far down the rabbit hole. But when we pass information to square, we do want it lined out as to what the different costs are, because that is the best client experience.  
Me: That's okay. Even if it's fully custom defined, you could have the Square API create entirely new fields every time.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: I guess again, the trade off between flexibility and structure.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Or there could be a combination approach where you have food. You have food is like the one thing that's always there, but then other than that, it's like, custom defined.  
Them: Interesting, okay. I think food is always there, miscellaneous is always there, and then the next one is custom defined. Okay?  
Me: Or you do a category label. Like you basically have a dropdown of options and you have to choose one of the five options.  
Them: Yeah. That's it. That's what you do. Is there a little plus sign where you can add another one right?  
Me: And then. I would avoid that for now. So with basically can't decide what categories you care about. Make those the choices in the drop down. And.  
Them: Oh, I don't mean added category. If they need to have a line item for a server and a bartender, Are we expecting them to add those two numbers together and put it in one field, or will they be able to add an additional field?  
Me: For each label, you might want to limit to one. Because it would be weird on an invoice to say miscellaneous, 100, miscellaneous, 150. Like to double that up? And the mental. Yeah.  
Them: In theory. And then how would we put in the server and the bartender? Who are you asking?  
Me: You could do server as a thing. As a label.  
Them: Right. I think if you had food service staff and miscellaneous, you never need any other box, ever. Okay?  
Me: If you really, really want, you could also have the custom notes field for any.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Clarifications for what something is.  
Them: Okay, cool.  
Me: For anything not covered on the other parts of the invoice. Like you have a custom message on the invoice, right?  
Them: Yeah. And this question is purely for my understanding of the flow, not like a comment on the validity of the flow. The expectation is that if there was a server and a bartender, that we would expect the chef to add those two numbers together and put it under service staff.  
Me: Sounds. Reasonable? I don't know. To me it sounds reasonable.  
Them: I mean, yeah, I think that it's definitely a reasonable sop. It's not asking for the moon at all.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I just want to understand, just have an understanding of the experience. Because, yeah, I think that.  
Me: Because there's some amount of calculation either way.  
Them: 's.  
Me: Right? Either way, there's some amount of calculation for how many service staff and whatever. It's like if you break it down, what's the end of breaking it down? Right? Because then how many field and you have all the variables and it becomes like a super complicated calculator.  
Them: Yeah. No, I think it's dope. I think that's good. Shafi. I agree that if we have food, miscellaneous and service staff, that we should be covered. In everything except for the.001% of cases. Right. And if there's a problem, they'll call me. Later. You know what I mean? Yeah, I agree.  
Me: There's nothing that miscellaneous shouldn't cover. My last question. Is it important to the client? That on their line items. It explains what the staff cost breaks down into.  
Them: They've already got the proposal that told them that. They know they had to sign off on it before they paid the deposits. They know it's 5:30 per person. For server, and then, so if the server was on here, Or service staff was on here. I think it's a teachable moment for both client and contractor, because they're like, oh, yeah, I need to put these things in. And there's nothing under that.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Rentals and travel would be under miscellaneous.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Food and staff. So you add staff and your money.  
Me: Yeah. And if they have a question they can ask. You could always build in more specificity later and more complexly later. I like starting simple here, because epc, again, we're running into kind of detention of EPC being a platform where you want to empower chefs to eventually run their own businesses. There's a certain level of autonomy that's there. So it's a little different from the cleaner company who has a predefined set of services that have completely predefined things.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That are standard and calculated in that formulaic way.  
Them: Yeah. Okay? All right. This makes sense. To me.  
Me: It's a deliberate choice to let the chefs calculate for themselves because it's their business.  
Them: Yeah, I'm good. I do not think that that is, like, a big lift on the chef's side at all. They're already calculating a bunch of different receipts for their food cost, so I'm sure that they went to, like, 80 different stores because that's what they fucking do.  
Me: Cool. Okay. All right.  
Them: Chef's face right now. He's like, yeah, they do dumb shit like that all the time. For simplicity and for just getting here. Those are the boxes. Scratch out that EPC reimbursement thing on the bottom and how we got it. I agree.  
Me: It's cold time. It's time for you to share your screen.  
Them: You do us.  
Me: You are the one that sets up.  
Them: Me.  
Me: At the current time.  
Them: Current.  
Me: Just later. What do you mean? Save this for later.  
Them: Maker.  
Me: No, it's not. Delete it. It's always okay, good.  
Them: File. New window.  
Me: How's Claw treating you, by the way?  
Them: Odds optimist.  
Me: It's great.  
Them: I close this completely?  
Me: Sure.  
Them: Okay. Goodbye. Look at that. Oh, my God.  
Me: Right, okay. Time to do the whole WSL cloning thing again.  
Them: Yeah. Oh, because you made changes to the. Okay, understood.  
Me: No, as in, this is a new. This is a new repo altogether. If you click on repo right now, it'll clone into your Windows system, which is what we're trying to avoid.  
Them: Clone rico. Yeah, new project.  
Me: So I think last time we had a setup,  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Last time. What we did was we wanted to determine all. We cloned it, and then we opened it.  
Them: Yep, we did do that.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: We went into this terminal.  
Me: But I am curious, is there a way to directly click clone Repo but clone in the remote wso. Directly. Into wso environment. On cursor. First. Okay, Corsa does not provide that. All right, so we got to start from wsl. Wsl.  
Them: Okay. You talking to me right now?  
Me: Yep. Wsl cd squiggly.  
Them: Wslv space wiggly.  
Me: I love how our calling is squiggly. No, it's great.  
Them: I don't even know what it.  
Me: I don't know what's actually called.  
Them: 's called a tilde.  
Me: I'm too young to know the name of these things.  
Them: Hilda. Oh, my God. That's just grammar. That's not about me.  
Me: I'm not native. We all have this in Chinese.  
Them: There you go. There you go.  
Me: Actually, do not tell that because of how Siri reads things to me. Tilda. Chef austin. Okay? Get clone that repo link that I posted on Basecamp.  
Them: Get clone base camp lean.  
Me: Real progress. Naftik progress.  
Them: Okay. It's probably in the.  
Me: Day three.  
Them: There we go. You got it.  
Me: Yay. And for now let's keep this like the kately XT get repo just because this easier for me to push changes to and manage and then when the project is done you can fork it.  
Them: Is this personal access token again?  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Okay? There we go again. Now. You'll find it. Where the fuck is it?  
Me: Personal access. It's a PhD. It's a pet.  
Them: It's a pact. It's a P, A T. You're not ever going to be able to see. Which is hilarious. Repository Knockdown.  
Me: We need to accept my invite first. I think that's the problem.  
Them: Okay, what do I do now? Would he have gotten an email?  
Me: Let me give you the link. To accept it. Keeps asking for your password again and again. Again. We're thankful for it when we want it.  
Them: Yeah, right.  
Me: I think. It's in your pings.  
Them: Insignia.  
Me: At the end right here. Check out claude md here. Oh, yeah. It's okay. So go back to your terminal. Clone. Up, arrow. Key. Yeah. By the way, that goes to your. Oh, my God, again? The same thing goes to the same thing goes to your Claude prompts. You can do up arrow to get to the last one.  
Them: And I don't know if this thing is still copied or not.  
Me: It's not because you just copied a different thing.  
Them: Copied something else. Yeah, this is an up arrow. Key. What is this thing called again? Personal.  
Me: Ss token.  
Them: Pretty personal. That's going to call up, like, every email on your thing.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Not the environment. Dot divide. Lots of ciera not granted.  
Me: That is weird.  
Them: I accepted it. Here.  
Me: I see.  
Them: You now have push access.  
Me: I'm working on it.  
Them: So after the build this week, we'll set up my environment.  
Me: This is. It's up to you guys.  
Them: Yeah, I think that would be something. I can be running in tandem. Yeah, but. Working through this project, this particular project with one friend right now makes total sense and not like, derailing, trying to set up my environment right now.  
Me: When you look at. Let's see. When you look at the directory. Is it the right length, like when you click on. When you click on the code green button does give you that link. The other tab within it.  
Them: How do I know?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Local.  
Me: It tells you that there's that link. Okay? Can you copy it and try again?  
Them: Tell me exactly what to do, because now I don't know what I'm doing.  
Me: So go to. The terminal. And is it the same exact link? Right? It is.  
Them: GitHub.com (Kate) epc portal GitHub.com caitlin.  
Me: This is weird because. My access. It doesn't say that you don't have access. It doesn't say that you don't have push access. So I'm like, in theory, you should have push. You should have push access. Yeah.  
Them: Maybe we should just try again. Maybe, like, took a minute, you know what I mean? To propagate. I love that word.  
Me: Propagate. Propaganda.  
Them: Oh, boy, here we go again. Maybe. I guess. Whatever. Here we go. Right. Access to repo not granted.  
Me: I'm ciera that this is becoming a problem. Let's see.  
Them: Why would that happen? Tell me.  
Me: I want an AI all time.  
Them: These are archived ones. I haven't even seen these names. I was trying to put people who paid and to pay. Oh, this guy Sebastian. Hey, he sure did. Veronica sent you the second invoice. He hasn't paid enough. Brittany marzette. Did pay. I forgot who she belonged to. They're not la. That's dean. That scene, right? That's Dean. I want to show (Kate) Because this is accurate now. Lee got number up there? This is accurate to this. Plus all the book V's. Awesome. And so now I'm going to go in and just want to win. Yeah. I want to know who paid. Yeah, I got to show (Kate) How our work paying off. Man. It's, like, crazy. $13,000.  
Me: LinkedIn, but. He never paid that. This is extremely weird. I've never run into this issue before. And I'm thinking about what is the best way for us to troubleshoot this, because this should not be happening. You open the terminal, right? It wasn't Powershell or anything. It was a red terminal. Yes. It looked like term, though.  
Them: Are you looking at? Dance value. Yeah, I'm just going to calculate this for (Kate) That's wrong. I just want to know the price. S right. That means you got to go to each one. It might be easier to go into sheet. That's okay. $120. I don't know how much it cost.  
Me: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to remove you and I'm going to re add you. Chances are because I tried something.  
Them: We've made any votes.  
Me: Where I switched this repository. Over to takuma and then I tried to add you. But that failed because I don't have enough seats basically for orcs. If you want to add collaborator, you need the seats in your org. And so I switched back to personal. And chances are that something got stuck there in that process where it tried to add you in an. Org account, in which case there are different levels of access. Whereas for a private repository, for personal account, there is no levels of access. You're either a collaborator where you can read and write, or you're not. And so maybe in the process of switching back over to a personal account, It kind of, like, changed your permissions, and now there's no way for me to edit the permission s because that permission is not a thing I'm personal. Like, it's basically like a potentially a bug. Resense the invite. And see if it works.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: I triggered, so it should show up in your email s.  
Them: Can you resent it, Lar?  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Ry. Now you have to push access to the K EPC portal repository. What does that mean?  
Me: It means that you have the ability to push to this repo. Yep. Up arrow, up arrow.  
Them: Okay? Now we're going to try again.  
Me: Muscle, your muscle memory.  
Them: Guys. I'll never remember that. I'll remember it eventually. But it doesn't matter anymore. There we go. Does it look like? Here we go. Moment of truth again. Now I got to go back. Okay. Underside.  
Me: Pat, let's look for our pet.  
Them: Yeah, you're a pat.  
Me: That is.  
Them: Not granted. Let me just try this one more time. Okay? Last command. Use your name for GitHub. We know it's this.  
Me: Our pat.  
Them: And then we're back. Make sure it's copied. We're going to come here. We're going to make sure. We make sure you control V or hit return.  
Me: H. Age apple yard. I don't remember. Page Apleyard. Age. Maybe. There's a chance to have something to do with the personal access token permissions. But I remember you check like everything. I turned everything on, like, every box. You want to check on render. You know, you can check the logs on render. Right. Now I can see this happening on render.  
Them: Now.  
Me: Go to your the Booking app. Of the dashboard. Click into that. Click in here. Click into the web service. So not the data. Logs. So this is the equivalent of when you click Bindev. In your terminal. This is that terminal, but on render.  
Them: Now it says state completed, so maybe. No, it did not. Event 353 Loading.  
Me: Try refreshing. Yeah.  
Them: We'll refresh this. Okay? And then where do you see event? Id 316 submitted. Unprofitable, unprocessable content.  
Me: It says. And then what does it say below that?  
Them: Conflict.  
Me: What does it say below that? It says no. Go back to where that error message was.  
Them: I heard you.  
Me: And then look under that. It says active Record, which is a database management system.  
Them: Unprofitable.  
Me: The validation failed because phone can't be blank.  
Them: Phone can't be blank. Event date can't be blank. Location must be a valid zip code.  
Me: So if you go back to the event that you're looking at, did you put in the phone number?  
Them: This is a client.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Number. And I thought we made them. Phone number was supposed to be mandatory.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: It was. Wait, how old is this one chaff? 15 days ago. Maybe somebody slipped through while we were, like, fixing something. Yeah, here's another one. No phone number.  
Me: You should email these people and say that I see that you try to create something.  
Them: Here's another one. Another one. No phone number.  
Me: No. So this is also, like. Because this could also be partial.  
Them: That might have been before we made that a mandatory feel.  
Me: As in they went through part of the process, but then follow through.  
Them: S harsh. They didn't want to put in their thing and just stopped and bailed and halfway through.  
Me: So you could actually create a new status for these to be like who dropped off? And you can eventually create an automation where you're Xintong follow up emails to people who dropped off.  
Them: Interesting. Yeah. Maybe called it, like, stalled or something.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Probably what it is, Chef. It's probably watch people playing. And then they realized, oh, I need to put in my phone number, and I'm just mailed. Out.  
Me: Just of us staying on track.  
Them: Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah.  
Me: GitHub and trying to look at this personal SS token. And just check the permissions, because I know you checked a bunch of things, but this is our first time trying to pull from using that token something that you don't own. Or we could also just fork it right now.  
Them: Okay? How do I get. Don't you guys tell me what to do, man? I don't know. Which one of those I would take and why.  
Me: Okay, let's work it. Let's fork it to keep it simple.  
Them: If we fork it right now. That's great. If you want to look at the personal access token, let's do it. Whatever you want to do.  
Me: So click on.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Y.  
Them: Second floor.  
Me: Eah. Do you want it under EP Elite personal chefs, or do you want it under. Oh, it doesn't matter for now.  
Them: Create fork. Do I need to put a description? No, just create for us.  
Me: Great. Okay? Now you get clone. But not the same URL. The new URL.  
Them: All right.  
Me: No, the new URL you get under the code button. Says chef austin yansy instead of (Kate) xt.  
Them: Yeah, right. Okay? Copy. Hey, watch this. Hey, watch up, Arrow. God damn it.  
Me: Revolution. Ary. Cheval.  
Them: Oh, no. It's going to be like, hey.  
Me: There we go. Yay. Okay? Now go to cursor. And I think there's something up there. The button file something.  
Them: Okay? Go to cursor.  
Me: File remote. Let's see. Okay? Let's see. We'll start to remember this. Let me. What am I trying to do? Control shift p. Control shift key, type remote. Remote. And then. Show remote menu. Show remote menu, connect to wsl or open folder in wsl. Yes. And then you find the Linux thing. I think it's up there on the file bar. Delete everything.  
Them: Oh, God. Not just. Again. How do we do that?  
Me: And then the next. Does anything. Show up. There we go. And click into Ubuntu. Click into. Home. I think it's home. Yep. Chef a. Scroll. Projects. Or actually the EPC portal because you cloned it into the root. Okay? All right, go back one layer. Or actually, this is right. Just click Select Folder to open. Wso.  
Them: Fail to open, can't resolve windows. Something or another.  
Me: Understood? Understood. Do that again.  
Them: Can't resolve Windows file path to WSL Path path must be an absolute Windows tab.  
Me: Open fold.  
Them: Control shift P show remote menu.  
Me: Linux.  
Them: Open folder. In wfl.  
Me: Ubuntu. Home. Chef a. Scroll down. And then click on epc portal. Don't double click. Select folder to open in wso.  
Them: Same thing.  
Me: Try connect to WSL and then open. You know how there was other option. For connecting to WSL before opening the folder. So control shift p. Yeah.  
Them: Oh, I'm doing the wrong thing. ciera Show Remote menu. Connect to wsl.  
Me: Oh. There we go. Open folder. Scroll down.  
Them: Looks like we're making progress. What.  
Me: If you see portal. Okay? And a bunch of things in doclod.  
Them: Just a cloud md that you wrote.  
Me: Which I'll take you through. Can you close the cursor, Agent?  
Them: I want to read it. Hello.  
Me: Can I show you what files there are before you get into this?  
Them: That's it.  
Me: So if you click on dot, Claude, there's specs. Which is specs. Includes the fat marker sketch. Includes the sample data that you gave me, Lee. Includes the breadboard. Include some notes from our meetings the past couple days.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Commands are a bunch of things that will become interesting. And this is what I want to keep being able to iterate on, even with the repo being yours now.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Basically, these are a bunch of recipes in the sense of basically when Claude, you type slash mockup. I want to work on this. And you link it to the folder where there's all the MVP stuff.  
Them: Great.  
Me: And then it'll basically work with you on creating the mockups, and then style is a work with you on creating the CSS style sheet. For making it nice. Integrate. It'll work with you on researching and understanding how to integrate with an API. For example, integrating with square. Edge cases is it'll help you think through what are the error screens for when there's an error message, what needs to happen, that kind of stuff. Debug is helping you think through what's going on, making you articulate. What's wrong. And then working with you to make that happen. Database. So we're going to refine.  
Them: If you're fucking smart, gay. You're so. This is so dope.  
Me: This.  
Them: This is so dope. So this is you expertise, Sali. What's she doing? It's taking her expertise. And putting it in here as a helper.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Shit up. Nice.  
Me: So what we're going to use today is the mockup.  
Them: This is great.  
Me: Command.  
Them: Yeah, so smart.  
Me: And to be clear, this is. Some of these instructions were taken from my workflow. Some of these are workflows that I myself have not encoded before because I kind of just intuitively do it. So some of these commands have not been quote, unquote tested yet, and that I haven't been able to go through the whole process of what it's like from zero to work with nothing but this mockup or these. So we'll probably refine them over. But this is version zero of this kitchen.  
Them: Ly is going to be your little test bunny. Yeah, I totally understand.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So anything that happens, I'll make sure I make a note of it and shoot you in, basically, if there's something weird.  
Me: Okay? So you understand what.  
Them: Does that make sense? Leave. Is that. Are you tracking?  
Me: Okay? You can click into the sample Data enriched.  
Them: Lee. I am okay. Yeah.  
Me: CSV just so I show you what happened. Down there. So you see the little green icons? That's for CS files. So sample data. The first one up there is exactly what Lee gave me. The second one is, I asked Claude, hey, like, this is the data that I was given. I think for the sake of enriching our, like, initial mockups, we might want to add in a little bit of variety or whatever. So then the enriched version is it added slightly more stuff, such as, like, what's the actual food? Cause what was like, the deposit paid all of that stuff. Or like some things that weren't necessarily on the sheet that it added and enriched. So that basically, when we build a mockups, the cloud is going to take the real data from the CSV file and put it in the mockup.  
Them: Okay? Okay? Yeah, Chef. That was based on Alyssa's last two weeks. Yeah, run me one more through enriched.  
Me: Enriched just means that it was a different copy of the same CSV.  
Them: What does that mean?  
Me: Where I think some of the data was cleaned up or enriched in terms of added more fields, like added more data that is based off of what's real, but also has a bit more detail. I didn't have time to fully step through all the different details that it added. It's actually not that much. It's just basically. It basically looked at those sketches and decided what else was needed.  
Them: Yeah, it doesn't look like that much.  
Me: That's what it is.  
Them: Yeah. So that when we're mocking up, we can display a wider test case base, because Alyssa is pretty narrow in what she does.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. So md. Cloud md is for claw to read, and readme md is for you to read.  
Them: I get it.  
Me: Yeah. Cloud MD is basically the readme for Claude, the readme for AIs.  
Them: Yes. Oh, okay. Understood.  
Me: Okay, so let's try this out. Yeah, just click on it.  
Them: Now we got to run cloud code. Right. No, it's already here.  
Me: Now, I'm going to teach you one thing.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Which. Is yes. Proceed.  
Them: Teach me everything.  
Me: You can just click Enter.  
Them: Yes, My number lock is not on.  
Me: As well. Yes. Okay.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: So I want to show you something. When you click the backslash or, like, the slash,  
Them: Typically, you just press number one and it goes, that's all right.  
Me: Just click that. You see how all of the commands are in that folder are showing up here? In the comments folder, the database, the debug, the edge case, the mockup.  
Them: All the commands that are in the what folder Readme.  
Me: Venue of commands. Yes. So if you create want to create your own at some point, it's like, I keep doing this thing and I don't want to repeat doing this thing again.  
Them: The menu of command is accessed to the forward slash.  
Me: You can be like, hey, Claude, I want to do this thing, create a command, and all it'll do is it'll create that file under the commands folder and an it'll start showing up here. For example, let's say in a different case, where you're not coding and you're trying to make sample menus and you keep having the same prompt for Claude, this is how I want to create a sample menu based on xyz. That thought process. You can encode that in a system prompt. The same way the mockup, whatever those system prompts were encoded.  
Them: Can you give me a real world example of where I would do that?  
Me: And then you could make that a command, put that under the commands folder, and then every time you go into cloud code, you could just type sample menu, and it would just run through the same problem so you don't need to repeat yourself over and over again. Yeah.  
Them: So I might want to book a session with you to do what you just said for our sample menus. One of the first things I'm going to make is a sample menu writer with AI.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And so what is it? Help me understand what this thing right here is doing. Am I able to make it the format of the menu? Like, what would I do with this?  
Me: Anything you want. So basically, we're basically meta programming. It's like if you have an employee in front of you, this is like SOP for the employee.  
Them: Exactly.  
Me: Like this is a process. Like Claude is your new employee. And there are a set of things that you wanted to do over and over again. Right, different roles that you wanted to take on.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Different processes you wanted to go through. And those processes aren't just a simple flowchart. Sometimes it's very nuanced. Sometimes that set of instruction is like an entire document that's like 10 pages. Off. So instead of repeating yourself every time and therefore having a lower fidelity set of instructions, you basically store that in an SOP in the form of a slash command. Such that you can just open a new instance of cloud, type that command, and boom, that cloud knows what to do. And it's dynamic. Like, that's an AI's behavior. So that's dynamic based on whatever the situation is. So you can command, give it additional context and it'll do that thing. Based on the situation that you're in. So it's like a. It's the same thing as, like in the old days. You would have, like, a script that a computer runs.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: All right, but this is like an intelligent script. Yes.  
Them: So I'm just looking over here at your md files. This integrates right here. Integrate. Connect external services, squares up to your portal.  
Me: Yeah. A set of system instructions for Claude. So if you were to type in. If you were to like, I want to integrate with Square to do this thing. And you tell Claude. Claude doesn't have the pre instructions for how to work with you on something like that.  
Them: This md file.  
Me: And so it'll just do whatever it thinks is necessary. Sometimes it'll go off in just, like, implement the whole thing and push to production. Sometimes it'll, like, ask you for feedback. Sometimes it doesn't know to do that. And if you try to prompt it every single time, that's wasting a lot of your time, and you're also likely to be a lot less detailed. So if you just, like, do that once, make it a playbook, make it an SOP for AI to work with you. So that every time do this thing. It knows how to do.  
Them: So then. Answer. Interesting.  
Me: Yes. So I steered it, I gave a feedback, I read it, and then I shaped it.  
Them: You wrote this also using AI though, right?  
Me: But the reality is, you don't know how it behaves until you see how it behaves.  
Them: Yeah. So then Lee, like, eventually you would want Lee and I writing these two for things.  
Me: The same way when you hire a new person and you try to do new things. You want to write sops like standard procedures for how things are done. So this is what I mean. By.  
Them: Yeah. Okay?  
Me: Yes.  
Them: These are sops for (Kate)  
Me: Yes.  
Them: And these things that are, you know, are going to happen. Yeah. So can I. Can I ask a question around? You have a baseline sphere of knowledge that allows you to kind of look at this and from a high level. Understand whether or not this is actually doing what you intend.  
Me: So I wouldn't overthink it from the standpoint of Claude was already pre trained and post trained to behave like a human being.  
Them: So, like, we don't necessarily have that frame of reference.  
Me: As far as possible. So if you are like, let's say you are a new employee with no context to a company with no anything, you're just smart. And you look at this system of instructions, do you know what to do? Statistics start from there. If I were a blank slate person who is very intelligent but have no context on your preferences and I am given this piece of this markdown file, this document, these set of instructions. Do I know how to behave in a way that you want? If the instructions aren't clear, then the answer is no. If the instructions are clear to the answer is yes, the less amount of ambiguity, the better. But also then there's an art of how much do you want to specify exactly how it should behave? Like, should you specify quotes of exactly what it should say? Versus tell it to optimize for xyz and no reason on the spot to figure out what it should do. So depending on the task at hand, sometimes you want to give it the goal and the context and a nuance. Sometimes you want to be very specific about. No, don't think this is exactly what you should do. Right? So that's just like. It's the same thing as prompt engineering. Accepts. This is kind of like a stored prompt that you reuse over time. And you can always update it over time. And one trick to it, by the way, is to test it, interact with it. And then if it's behaving in a way that you don't like, you can steer that conversation. Because it ultimately doesn't override the session. Like, if you use the mockup and then suddenly you're like, actually fuck mockups. We're just going to go build the full app. It's still going to do it. It's very hard to override. Its desire to follow your steering and your instructions. So you can go like, hey, I want you to behave like this instead. And then at the end of the session, be like, I like how you responded to my question like that. Xyz, can you revise this command or this set of this SOP to reflect what we just did? The same way you would with, like, an employee. Example, more systematized, and it's, like, based, infinitely scalable.  
Them: Okay? Yeah, okay. Yeah. Totally. And that'll happen in time. Something will happen, or we'll see something or whatever. Always use the etc terminology. Service not job. Chef not contractor. Client not customer. Saying, you know what? Let's call them customers, not clients. We would go in and fix it here.  
Me: You could also create a meta command. I do this. I didn't want to overcomplicate things, but on my end, I do this a lot. Where I create a command. Where I'm asking Claude to study the chat history. And figure out where the desired behavior from my end seemed to diverge from the instructions that originally gave it, and then proposed a set of changes. So it's like a learning agent that studies what actually happened to, matches it to the original instructions and figure out what needs to be done. Like the hr department.  
Them: Yeah, let's do.  
Me: The Training and Development Department. But you can change. Like you have all these files. You can change it, you could delete it, you could do whatever you want.  
Them: Yeah, let's do that. Yeah, this is cool. Yeah, I totally understand that. I'll go with the file, add new what type of file MD and then make the database. And then this automatically pops up every time, right?  
Me: Because the whole doc cloud file is a folder is essentially almost like the system. There are others too, by the way. Like Claude came with, came up with a bunch of new things. For example, there's a new thing called sub agents. But I didn't want to use sub agents in your case because it's a little bit less transparent. Like, as in it kind of just like. Then runs in a background, but basically you could have a sub agent that does a specific thing. We'll cover that another time. But commands is only the simplest part of what Claude offers in this interface. But there are other things that you could do with these folders of instructions. This is really cool. All right. So do mockup.  
Them: Very cool. Okay?  
Me: So have you gone all right? In that box.  
Them: I'm ciera  
Me: Yes. And then you can hit tab.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: To assess the first thing that's highlighted.  
Them: And click mock up.  
Me: Yes. Tab is a pretty common user interaction pattern in the AI landscape for autocomplete.  
Them: That's a type of tab is. Interesting.  
Me: For completing, for accepting.  
Them: That's what I was trying to figure out at one point in time, because autocomplete is different on different interfaces.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. So autocomplete, by the way, on cursor, there's autocomplete. If you were to type in the actual code files.  
Them: Even on your phone. Yes, that's autocomplete.  
Me: And then if it. If there's, like, a faint suggestion of what should come next in a piece of code, you also accept it by tab. So that's kind of like the interaction pattern here. And then one thing that I was going to tell you is that the way to specify to it.  
Them: Cool.  
Me: What files to look at. Is to copy the path. Of that thing. So copy the file path of that thing if you want to be very specific about. Hey, Claude, look at this. So this that we want is the mvp folder. Under specs on the left. Right. So if you click on mvp, Up there. Text mvp. So, by the way, you know what this means, right? There's a Specs folder under which there's an MVP folder. It's collapsing it because MVP is currently the only folder under Specs. But let's say in the future, you want to add another feature, you want to add the sample. Menu features to the same dashboard. Right. You'll create a new folder under Specs, that sample menu. And then you can dump in all the other sketches, all the whatever in there. Okay? Right click. Copy path. Or relative path.  
Them: Interesting. Okay, right click. Copy relative path of that folder.  
Me: So paste it in. Yes. So this is the path for it. So relative path just means it's relative to where you already are. So you are already inside EPC portals that are relative path starts there and say from here Doclod specs MVP is that path. If you copy the whole path, it will have to hold like Ubuntu. Like, you know, like Chef A. Whatever. It doesn't matter. Claude understands both. But in this case, we could do the path.  
Them: Paste it here. So through the oh, my God. Through our meeting so far, everything that we've done, you have either recorded or whatever and put into this folder that is the mvp. And now, because we have sample data to put into it, we're going to fucking mock it up and make it right now, aren't we?  
Me: Yes. But you want to steer it a little bit to say, like, I want to start. And say, I want to start mocking up the home screen.  
Them: So crazy. Yeah, of course. Go ahead.  
Me: Mocking? Sure. Doesn't matter.  
Them: ciera Mocking up this. It's really a payment screen, isn't it?  
Me: Payments. Green home screen. Where the clients are. Let's start from that. Where the schedule is.  
Them: It's the home screen. I like that better. Schedule screen. Okay.  
Me: Sure I see what it does.  
Them: I like it.  
Me: Turning.  
Them: That's brilliant.  
Me: It's okay. It's okay.  
Them: Oh, we didn't switch to a different branch.  
Me: No, it's okay, because there's nothing yet.  
Them: It's okay because you're here.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay, we're not overriding anything right at the current, no. Got to get into the habits. Oh, my God.  
Me: Look at this.  
Them: This is funny. I know this is crazy. It's crazy. Ten minutes of the meeting, the magic happens. Yeah, this is how it goes, typically. Learning. Yeah. What did we figure out earlier? (Kate) Why does it not work?  
Me: Because your personal access. Oh, cool.  
Them: We didn't figure it out, we just forfeit.  
Me: All right. Yes.  
Them: Okay. Open changes in cursor up in build home. Do you want to make the edit? Yeah, sure. Bam. Boozling. You should have. Stupid thing that it says there, Lee. It started doing culinary shit for me. It was like sauteing. Really? Yeah. Mixing and all that kind of shit. All right, so built your home screen using the structure. Here's what I've implemented from your breadboard. Yep, Yep. New service, two sections. Today's jobs payment required. Recent up unpaid invoices using real data from your CSV. The structure matches your sketch. Please open the mockup HTML in your browser and check it.  
Me: Okay? You can ask it to open it for you. I think it can.  
Them: My God.  
Me: Or you can just because your file system is annoying to click through, let's ask it to open it for you.  
Them: Oh, ciera Okay? My final system is really annoying to click through recording to my engineer. Can you open that for me? That's hilarious.  
Me: Don't ask again. Yes, and don't ask again.  
Them: Yeah, I don't have to.  
Me: Symbiotic. Oh, my God. Python. It's going to. Python, it.  
Them: Them biotting.  
Me: Maybe it actually can't open it for you because of the whole WSL layer thingy, Right click on mockup HTML the file on the left.  
Them: Hi, sean. Yes.  
Me: On the left. Like where the file navigation is? Yeah.  
Them: ciera Should be ciera open with.  
Me: Open with. Yeah.  
Them: No. Yeah. Up at the top, there's an open list.  
Me: Configure.  
Them: Open width.  
Me: No, because on the Mac, there's a show and finder.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: All right, copy past of mockup HTML.  
Them: There might be.  
Me: And paste it in your browser. Not relative. Coffee to full path. Yeah.  
Them: Copy full path.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: This, so right click topic tab.  
Me: And just to set expectations.  
Them: Until here.  
Me: Anista Ubuntu thing. No, because this whole cursor window is operating from inside wsl, so it doesn't have a concept of the roots outside of wsl, you know what I mean?  
Them: Oh, it didn't copy that whole thing. Though.  
Me: Okay, Maybe we should just suck it up and open File Explorer and go. And go and find it.  
Them: And go and find it.  
Me: Under there. There's Linux. There's a little penguin down there.  
Them: Maybe you can search in File Explorer.  
Me: There's probably a way to create a shortcut from your desktop that gets you to the home. Open click on home.  
Them: There might be. Wait, hold on.  
Me: And then try to right click on Chef A. Does that allow you to add it to. The pin to quick access. And then it's just on the left. So now you can just click on that every time.  
Them: Yeah. Pin to click access.  
Me: Okay, now click on Chef. Yeah.  
Them: All right here. 's quick access right there. Oh. Pen pinned. Okay, cool.  
Me: Yeah. And then mock up.  
Them: Dpc portal. Yeah, Double click that, baby.  
Me: Okay? No.  
Them: No. What? No.  
Me: It's trying.  
Them: It doesn't (Kate) look like doesn't quite look like the mockup, but it's trying.  
Me: You can tell.  
Them: It's trying for sure.  
Me: All right.  
Them: Ready to invoice Sons. Interesting.  
Me: What did he say?  
Them: Yeah. Never mind. I'm not even. What's up, chefy? What? I think because of (Kate) Just like your experience, right? Be like role reversal. If I started showing you cooking right now. Right? For real. You're like, I want to be a chef. And I started showing you something, you would think, like, the dumbest shit ever is cool. Because you haven't seen it before. So I think this is fucking incredible. I know. I'm like, holy shit. And I would just bang on this all day long until I get it where I want it to, and that's okay with me. It's fine. But you're like, no, dummy, we got to go over here. And I'm like, I know, but I don't know what over there is yet, right? I can understand the world where if you get an output, That is. I mean, okay. I'm going to use these words, and they may not mean the same thing to you, but this is drastically different. Than the sketch that we had envisioned. Even though it's presenting the same information and we can see where it's going. So I definitely understand a world of not continuing to build on something that is already divergent.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Starting to be like, okay, you didn't understand what I wanted. Let's start from a good base. Instead of starting from the two week old fish, let's start from the fresh fish.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: I know you're right.  
Me: By the way, there is a case to be made for it to try to create multiple.  
Them: I'm just saying. It's just funny. Yeah.  
Me: So you could ask the same chat to be like, this is what I don't like about this current one. It's following. Create HTML file.  
Them: Oh, okay.  
Me: Like version.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: No. Tell Cloud what to do differently. So option three.  
Them: What I do.  
Me: Yeah. So let me tell you this.  
Them: Yeah. So three. Okay?  
Me: I actually debate it with myself yesterday about this.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: In a true full like design process, right? Traditionally, without AI. The next step after sketching will be to create a high fidelity sketch.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Literally making what the screen will look like.  
Them: What's a High fidelity sketch?  
Me: In a more digital form.  
Them: Like how we said we didn't want to do the first time before sketch, now we can do it.  
Me: Yes, exactly. However, if we had a high fidelity image,  
Them: Okay, that makes total sense.  
Me: For cloud to replicate. It would have been a lot better at replicating that one to one versus at a rough sketch that has a bunch of scribbles all over it.  
Them: A lot closer. Hold on. Thank God we have someone on our team here who knows how to do that five times longer than it would take Lee to do.  
Me: That being said, that is probably the part of the workflow. That can be rethought of in the age of AI in that because the cost of spinning up code. Is becoming close to zero. You could just directly work with HTML elements. As that design process. As opposed to work with rectangles on a design software. Because if you're good enough at describing as exactly the changes that you want. You can get the HTML to reflect the changes the same way you could push the pixels. On a graphic design interface.  
Them: We do. See how we're going to ham an egg the shit out of this dude. Yeah.  
Me: What does have mean?  
Them: I do for sure. Ham and egg means like you're doing it. Go with each other. We go together. But we both bring our specific flavor to the table to.  
Me: Exactly. So someone like Lee would probably, based on my understanding, would probably have a much easier time.  
Them: Make sandwich. Right.  
Me: Getting Claude to go from what it just produced to what you're actually envisioning. Because you know the language to basically tell that this element needs to look like this. Instead of having this be grouped together this way, I want these cards to be grouped together this way. The button should be on the right. This should be wrapped in the same div, like, basically the basic understanding of how HTML elements work. Will make that iteration process a lot faster. So there's a world. Where the workflow between you guys is that you work together. Chef works on a breadboard with lease input. You guys set the vision, set the whatever. And then the part of the process which is translating things from sketches to a higher fidelity clickable interface. And drive that, because Lee can do that probably faster. Just by saying the right words. So it's up to you guys. So I debated last night. I'm like, it will take me, like, 10 minutes to make, like, a Higher Fidelity fake my wireframe of our sketch. And I was debating whether or not I should do that, but then I was like, the whole spirit of this is that I'M not, like, doing the work for you. I want to take you guys through a process in a way that you can do. So it's up to you guys like Lee, you can choose to go on whatever design software you want and make the pixel version, like, make the design.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Of the sketch. Or you can. You guys can start chipping away at pushing CLAW towards reproducing it digitally. You could also try your hand at letting ChatGPT do it, but you just have control.  
Them: Okay, look. Let me show you this. It's funny. Look at this. Hold on.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So if we go in here and we look at the sketch, this is what it looks like. And then while you were talking, (Kate) I just said what you just said, like, redo it.  
Me: Closer.  
Them: And this is what it produced.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: It's much lesser like this over here. Right. It's much closer.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: That marker sketch that we want is the thing that you were sharing with us earlier.  
Me: Wait.  
Them: Where's that at? Wait, what do you mean? Really? Are you putting it up on the screen in this meeting? That was like. That's not the home screen, that's the edit screen.  
Me: Let's push to half the home screen. Done. Before we get to that. Because. The home screen. So. That's right.  
Them: I see what you're saying. That's this.  
Me: Another, by the way, another technique you could use.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Is you. Maybe we're learning that. I mean, it's probably true that Claude is a lot better at taking one screenshot at a time. And that marker sketch. Is both at the same time, which causes confusion and leads it to take liberties. Interpreting stuff. Right. So if you take a screenshot of just the left part of that sketch,  
Them: Oh, maybe.  
Me: And be like, what do you see on this sketch? Another way to iterate is to ask it to produce the outline in ASEI form, which is basically, you know, how when ChatGPT gives you outputs that look like code that's organized to like, look like boxes and lines.  
Them: Interesting. Yeah.  
Me: That's a way to iterate on more specific element too.  
Them: Ascii format. Yeah. Using.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Interesting. So it's like creating a wireframe for you. Awesome, too. There's just so much to this. This is so fucking. No, it's crazy. If you wanted to, of course. You could sit and just observe. A working session of Lee and I fucking with all this for, like, hours. Take notes on where we're wasting time going awry what could be change where we had a good thought where it'll be interesting for you if you're like me watching a kitchen.  
Me: You know, the cool thing is I don't need to watch it. You just need to record it. And I can throw the entire transcript and screenshot to Claude and be like, hey, Claude, code in my super. I'm going to show you, like, a peek into my super system, Claude, real quick. Later.  
Them: And just watching and just observing everything.  
Me: Basically, I can just throw it into my super system and be like, this is a live session of them working with this portal.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Set of commands that we just built. Study their interactions and suggest. Make a bunch of proposals to me for how we can improve it.  
Them: That's what I want to do. I want to record Lee and I. How we record ourselves. What's the best way? Tell me the best way to dump it in and get those results.  
Me: I'm going to share my screen. Real quick.  
Them: And what we should have after that Is someone filming all this for documentarily?  
Me: All right.  
Them: I'm trying to get this out to the world. How are we going to get this to the world?  
Me: I love it. This is takuma Os. This is like the entire existence. Of everything that I'm working on. A dot is a hyphen. It's a giant repository.  
Them: How are you going to os? Okay?  
Me: Under Bis Book, which is the consulting arm, there's a leap for snow chefs.  
Them: Yeah. Of everything. Wow.  
Me: Under which there's code generator. Including the code base of the code generator. Including all the messages that I've been chosen and Xintong out. Including seed, which includes. The trans growth from all the sessions from the few days ago. From the past few days. All the code bases. This code base that you're working with right now. This is what you call a sub module. So basically this whole thing is a git repository, but there's a sub module under the git repository which is tracked independently and commit it separately. So this is its own repository, as you can see. I can pull you. I can fetch your changes for this part.  
Them: How to work connected with each other. So you get my changes, right?  
Me: But basically, I gave you access. I shared this child module with you. Which sits in my super system that is get tracked with git separately. And then.  
Them: Wow. Okay.  
Me: Not much right now. Right now, I'm also focusing on labs. This is my product development lab, so I'm building my own products.  
Them: How many other elite personal chefs you got?  
Me: So this is my own code base. For my own stuff. Every product has its own thing. The pitches is like where all the new visions and features.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: Sit. Tools. Yeah, of course.  
Them: So your goal, though, is going to be to add more elite personal chefs to this, right? More companies.  
Me: And then under tool. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then under tool, there's tools that I'm working on, which includes a Basecamp MCP server that allows me to basically have my Claude be able to create to do lists on Basecamp.  
Them: So we've ground zero. No way. That's awesome.  
Me: So basically, there's also a knowledge base.  
Them: Oh, wow. Cool.  
Me: Which has all the books. Like 37 Signals books. I'll shape up. Learning to build auto books that Neil is about. A bunch of blog posts and podcasts that I listen to. You put that in there? It's all in there. And they've all been transformed into AI friendly format. Broke it down. Broken down by the chapter. With like index.  
Them: I want to learn how to do.  
Me: Yep. So you'd want to draw from that. You'd want to draw from that. It's the same pieces as what you're coding with.  
Them: Yeah. Because I have a book that I don't have books from Color Dairy that I want to put in here the same way.  
Me: You just want to draw from that. Yeah. Like you'd want to basically have those books, have Claude write the chapters. Or reformat the chapters and then be able to draw from that. Right, because then other instances of Claude can then go into your knowledge. Base and create new content and new folder structures based on that. The first time I had an entire book transcribed like that. I was like, is this legal? But, like, it's my own computer system.  
Them: Yeah, I was just thinking that. What are the copyright issues around that?  
Me: It's not like I'm sharing this on the Internet. It's not like I'm publishing this. But it does feel like. Yes, well.  
Them: We are, though. We're trying to publish a culinary curriculum. And we're not focusing in it. It's just AI. It's just open source, right? It's on our website, but it's content written by AI, taken from previous content, so it's not copyright.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: It is. In theory, it's a derivative work. Which. Is. It's a hairy thing that bigger minds than us are going to have to deal with, because we're not the only ones in this fuzzy space right now.  
Me: Yeah. It is very fuzzy. Because if you replace that entire process with a human brain rather than AI, it will be 100% legal.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So why is it legal for an AI to go read a bunch of content and interpret it and transform? And rewrite it in a way that is serving a new purpose.  
Them: Interpret it and rewrite it down, right? Yeah. Lee. That's where we get into law and precedence. Yeah. In theory, it's derivative work, so it should be fine. But there is a pretty tight definition, legally, for what derivative work means. Like the percent that it needs to be changed, it needs to be changed for a specific purpose. You know what I mean? There's a whole bunch that goes into what that is.  
Me: Yeah. And you'd also just need to have guardrails and have. You need to personally read the output and make sure that nothing is really directly.  
Them: Yeah. Just full up playlist, right? Yeah. I think that there are guardrails in ChatGPT already. That'll tell you. I can't just repeat this back to you because.  
Me: Okay, don't do all the research on the Internet or what is a derivative work. It makes sure to apply that. We're not an index file, all right? So how are we feeling about. So we've just opened a whole Pandora's box of like. I'm just giving you a peek into how the same tools, the same commands that you're working with, the same. The same structure of how things worked on our wired up. Can be used in much more powerful ways than just coding. And to be clear,  
Them: I think what you just said there, (Kate)  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: All you need to do is give us a peek.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And we'll go from there. We're smart enough to go figure all this. Yeah. We don't know. And so when you're like, hey, guys.  
Me: This is why yesterday I made you from the or, like the day before I made you start from the terminal, from ground zero. Create a file so that you understand the first principles, so you have the mental model of. Oh, all this is just a bunch of files in my computer that an AI can go read and write.  
Them: Check this out. We're like, oh, we want that. We want that, right?  
Me: Sometimes that's code, sometimes that's in Rails app, sometimes that like meta commands that help other AI do the same thing faster and have SOPs.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Sometimes. It's a whole book.  
Them: Right. I am very encouraged by seeing how spending the time upfront, really thinking through the interface. Pays off because Claude built that in five minutes. Right. And we can iterate on that and whatever. And we always have the cleaned up thought process that we spent the time on to use as a baseline.  
Me: You know what? If on day one, we could have gone to Chatgpt and just be like, here's what I want. Build this for me.  
Them: We know what we want. I think that's great. We have 127 mockups of our app from EPI the other day. Let's put them all in there right now.  
Me: Yeah. So here's the thing. If you went to chat GPT on day one and just went like, hey, I want to build a portal that does this and does this, it will make a bunch of decisions for you on things that you don't know are questions. Yeah.  
Them: Right? It will guide us. Yeah, it will guide us instead of us guiding it. But the thing that Chef is alluding to right now is that we went through a lot of the design process. Of this. I think that what we are building now is not the same as what we designed with EPI, but there are features of what we designed with Appi that are 100% applicable. You know what I mean? I don't think we should totally get lost in the sauce. By just saying. Because we are designing something a little bit different now. But the point being that some of those high fidelity things. Probably exist really close.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That is awesome. But the other thing that I would say is that I think that. It might be time to at least talk through, strategically how we get my environment also set up. And what does that mean? Does that mean I'm logging in with Chef's credentials?  
Me: Environment.  
Them: What does that actually mean?  
Me: As well. Let me check on one fact real quick, because I do agree that if we can get Lee in there right now,  
Them: Tactically me in the environment.  
Me: Lee will be a lot faster. At getting that interface clickable mockup to exactly I know the three of us have in our shared imagination. Based on our sketches, right? Once we get there, then we get to the next command. Either tomorrow. Or. I mean, today's Wednesday. Either tomorrow, the day after, or next week, gets to the next part of the command, which is to wire everything up. So I think the goal right now is how do we get from where we are now? To having the interface mocked up in a way that we are happy with. So it's either you go build like the traditional way, do a pixel by pixel rectangle. Visual design and then ask Cloud to reproduce it. Or you're just prompting Claude until it looks good, or you're doing a mixture of both, where you're doing just enough blocking, basically doing just put rectangles together to make it at least look cleaned up. So. And then prompting Claude to refine it further. Right. Like a combination of those approaches. But what's the best way for us to get from that to that? And probably it'll be faster if Lee has access.  
Them: Yeah. I think that both of us having access and I think that we're at that inflection point right now because we could just continue running it, you know what I mean? But that means that Chef is gaining all of the experience and knowledge.  
Me: I understand.  
Them: Way than I am. Right. And so he's going to continue to get further and further ahead of me, which isn't bad. It's just that we could be.  
Me: Right now where we can at least talk about strategically. How do we set up to it? And what is that going to mean? I want to do work in it for ciera just going to my non, take what we already paid at before and try to use some of it. Question. So my response to that would be that some of that process, it depends on, I don't know, the process that you guys went through and how long ago it was and all of that stuff. Yeah. And that was what I was saying.  
Them: Saying.  
Me: The business. Model of the business, the way that we think about the business. Has evolved. Since we were happy in 2019. So you need to go back and look at all of those. Also.  
Them: What we are building now is only a small feature of what we were working on with Appi. And because I went this morning and looked at the screens that were specifically around this money thing. There's more information and more things that are important to us now in2025. Than we're in2019 and showed on the screen. So it's a starting point, but we definitely need to look at them and make sure that they match up with us today.  
Me: Yeah. I know that you guys went through a lot of processes to get to that point with those designs. But also the extreme. It's almost like on one spectrum, they're starting from scratch.  
Them: Yeah, for sure. Yeah.  
Me: And then there's on the other side of the spectrum, the extreme other side of the spectrum. It's the AI generated, like, whatever that we talked about. That is whatever. And what you're talking about somewhere in the middle, where it did come from, you guys. But it's, like, detached enough. We're. Looking at the designs today and going directly to be like, hey, here, implement. This is a little bit on the lines of you're not really sort of like building in from first principles. Where does it fit in the current state?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So I would just be careful about that, like, yes. Draw from the essence of what that was, but don't literally go like, here we design a screen already. Just go implement a screen. Because as we've shown in the past two days, there are details that matter, that decisions you've made in the past might. Make a mock. Up.  
Them: But one thing is leaders need to go minimize.  
Me: Sure? Yeah. Now we finally get to actually use this.  
Them: Something.  
Me: I'm going to go pull up those. Are those edited profiles? Are those like fema? She did everything in sketch, so I have xd, okay? All of those. You might want to play with them a bit. You can probably just go look at the gun system out of them. Yes, absolutely. The language, like the design language, are you going to pick up. Load, like, a whole folder of those screenshots and visuals. Into a God folder and then as cloud code to heavily study the styling. Language and all of that, and create terms of copywriting, brand voice, and in terms of. Hand expresses the way that we want to express the brand. And the only thing that I want to look at is do those screens. That. The screens that we designed in 2019actually represent the way the level of information that we want to communicate in2025. Yeah, and the answer could be yes, but the answer could also be no, and we need to find out. Okay? So how do you want me to help here? So I guess I'm asking this from the perspective of right now. The question we're trying to answer is how to get Lee set up. Past that point. So let's say Lee is set up. Do you want me to. Work. How do you want me? I know that the ethos eaters for you to be in a driver's seat, right? For you guys to be able to do this and yourselves. So tell me what will be the most helpful to you? As far as getting us to the point where we have an interface mock we feel good about. On one hand on the spectrum. It's like, all right, children, go off and do your homework and come back to me when you have an interface you're happy with. Ask me questions along the way if you run into trouble. On the other end of the spectrum. Is I iterate with you? So it's up to you. On the other hand. Okay?  
Them: Or the customer, and you're the provider. Right? So you're telling us what to do. We're paying you to do it. And so we are relying on you and your guidance because we don't know, but we're also very excited and ready to jump in and run around and all that. So it's your call. Let's look at it from a product. What were we buying?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: What are we doing? And you're like, you're buying your chef's kitchen that you can then cook. In. Now I need to make an agent to do stuff for me. You're like, well, that's what those MD files are, kind of. Right? Like, I'm trying to wrap my. What that is.  
Me: Yes. Those are basically a lightweight version of defining an agent that will do a specific thing for you. Or do we hear all of this?  
Them: Okay? And then from there.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Our customers. And our customers are actually the chef that's our customer. Our customer is paying us a percentage of their money. We're giving them cool shit. And so for me, Because I am the top level of our customer. I know what they want.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Now I want to go and I want to build the things that they want.  
Me: We have a very concrete next milestone, right? Look, if we're, like, saying one foot in front of the other, we're climbing a staircase. The next step on a staircase is we have an interface.  
Them: Okay. All right.  
Me: We have basically an HTML mock of that home screen that we feel really good about. That is basically that sketch that we have for the home screen. That exactly what we envision in a coded form. That is the next milestone. Because once that is together, wiring everything up logically is, like, the easiest part. Of everything. As in the buttons actually do things.  
Them: When you say wire it up, logically, what do you mean? Okay? So the thing that we just made, are we going to pick up, drop the thing that Josh failed and the first quote generator into it?  
Me: Yes and no. Yes, in the conceptual sense of. Eventually you'd want those systems to be a part of one greater whole. Know, in a sense of it won't work if you literally just copy paste the entire code in here. Because you need to basically design a system to work together. Especially in the age of AI, you'd be better off basically, quote, unquote, rebuilding everything, because you could just ask Claude Code to rebuild everything. But working with the new system that you're going to build. Does that make sense? Like you're better off building what we're building right now from scratch. And then building in the quote generator. On top of it. Basically, quote, unquote, rebuilding the same functionality on top of this new app. In this clean way. But asking the. Agent. Given the agent access to the old code base so it knows what to replicate.  
Them: Okay, so.  
Me: So if you launch Claude code, you remember how cloud code can be launched at multiple levels.  
Them: Right. And how would you do that? How do you give it access to it?  
Me: So if you launch it at the level of Chef A instead of launch it at a level of EPC portal, Then basically both of those code bases. Will be visible to the same Claude. And the cloud can basically go read the code generator. And then make a plan with you and our architect that very carefully, like I would ask it, to make a plan, review the plan, all of that. Not one shot. It. And then it would propose a plan for how to build that system on top of this new app. But it could basically go study how the existing code generator works and then build a better version on top of this new thing. Because having two apps work together. Has a lot more micro decisions than you might imagine at first. Around, like how data connects and all of that. Is it the same admin panel? All of that.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: The clients on that, like are they auto match to client profiles that are already in the system? There's just all sorts of decisions that will need to be made along the way for those two things to be unified. But the cost of that is pretty low relative to the cost of deciding and refining what is even built. So I would focus right now on just, like, getting basically that HTML mockup the clock just created, getting that to the point of something that you're really proud of.  
Them: I just said. I mean, it makes sense. It makes sense. The iteration building, quote, unquote, bulletproof, beautiful pieces of functionality, and then linking those functionalities together. And linking is a very loose term, right?  
Me: There.  
Them: Not necessarily taking this thing over here and this thing over here and building a link between them, but maybe you build out these two pieces of functionality, and they're both beautiful and amazing, and then you decide which building is going to be your base of operations, and then you rebuild this beautiful functionality. In that same thing. Right. But there's also time pressure of, like, right now, today, this morning, Amy has a client situation. Live in the real world with real clients and real chefs.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: There's still occurring from the thing that we. Which is why we both need to be developing so that one of us can be working as usual estate and one of us can be working on existing issues.  
Me: Treated.  
Them: Look how we're world going to change. Lee, what are we working on this week? This is future, this is right now. What's most important. It's all going to go to the top.  
Me: Okay, I would think about it this way. For the code generator. The goal at the time, like the way we architect our project, was very different from how we architected this one. Where at the time, it was just like, let's spin up basically a prototype of something that will prove business value and just get it working. So you can treat that as a version of one iteration prototype. Of something.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Right. And the nature of prototypes. If you work at a more fully tech startup. Denoter prototypes. A lot of prototypes are thrown away. Right. So the point of that prototype was to prove the business value, prove what works and what doesn't. The point of that prototype was not necessarily to make it the everlasting code base. That is the de facto way in which EPC will work forever.  
Them: Understanding the value of the money spent. Is not that individual product. It's the fact that we went through and learned experientially. How to build that product.  
Me: Yeah. So that's one part of it. The other part of it was a proof of concept on the chef's, chef's intuition that if you show the client the money earlier,  
Them: So we already have the value from that $5,000, because we could replicate that right now.  
Me: Yeah. So that was. The anchor point was like, let's just get more clients to book. Now, the anchor for this project is let's make sure that this is a well built nucleus.  
Them: Then people will, but yeah.  
Me: That you feel really good about, that you can build on top of infinitely and this will be epc. This becomes a different thing. So those two are very different things to optimize for. And there are architectural decisions that you will now be empowered. Not architecture. That sounds crazy, but as in now, because we're focusing on just a nucleus of how chefs get paid.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Which is a much simpler, I would say, thing to manage than a code generator that has a bunch of variables and all of that stuff. You are now enabled to focus your time on making this and making the micro decisions that we've been making the past two days. Because last time also, we weren't ready to make all those decisions together. I made, like, 10 of those decisions on my own. Without even having as much of the luxury of time and understanding. Of soda nuances, and we retroactively corrected a lot of things as well. Which was not ideal. For a design process. So it's almost like it would be better for us to not obsess over, like, it's okay for some things to be, quote, unquote, broken.  
Them: Right.  
Me: If a client can get through and book and pay, it's not broken. If there are feature requests. Not every feature request needs to be entertained. Right. Yeah. Exactly. So it's okay if it works today. Unless, like, the square API changes or, like, there's some major change that makes it actually broken, you discover an actual problem where it literally can't work.  
Them: Right. And not every feature request is a bug.  
Me: Where Amy would rather go back to the old way than continue to work with the code generator. Right. It's actually okay to leave it the way it is. There's no tech company.  
Them: If there's something that isn't happening, we didn't build it or whatever, you just go back and send them a service agreement.  
Me: And then over time, Yeah. Over time, you can let those pile up so that you can make a more rational and more strategic decision on what actually makes sense to be built.  
Them: We already discussed.  
Me: There's no tech company in the world, no product company in the world that can take in every single piece of feedback. And bug report and build every single one of them. Not just because it's practically impossible, but also because oftentimes not the good thing to do. Because sometimes you can solve 10 problems with one change in perspective and one change in design.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: So it's okay to let the bugs pile up is what I'm trying to say. Unless it's actually the trade off is actually worth it. To the point where it's like, oh, if I don't fix this thing tomorrow, we're going to lose business.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, totally.  
Me: Yeah. The concept you wanted to prove with the code generator is already proven.  
Them: Right. Which we are not in that. We're not in that position. Right now. Right? And we have. We have. We have a lot of. I mean, I wouldn't even say a lot. We have a handful of nice to haves that we are really kind of hungry for. But none of them are critical to the point of it's broken if we don't have that. But we have a lot of, again, not a lot. A handful of nice to haves that we're, like, on our punch list, and they're big ideas.  
Me: But letting them sit and letting them marinate and letting them work with each other. And then with the context of the news super system, then you're empowered to actually solve the problem rather than bolt on, oh, this will make it nicer. Oh, this will make it nicer. And then you get like a Frankenstein of an. Because it's like a thousand ideas patched together.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, I totally get it. To also develop our way.  
Them: Develop our way of working with, hopefully learning practices that we could pick up from you and from. You know what I mean?  
Me: Yeah. Read Shape Up. There's a lot there. Where literally, for a company like Basecamp that is making so many millions of dollars, They talk about how if they can't ship something in six weeks, it's too much. And that's pretty AI. Yeah. Because now you're in it.  
Them: Yeah, we both read Shape up back in2019, but I need to read it again.  
Me: From a new level of depth. Right. So then you understand how not every request needs to be built.  
Them: Be completely honest. Yeah. Okay, so let's go back to some basic questions. Then yes, Lee, let's get you set up immediately. And let's find out if you can be on the Claude account or the Cursor account or if that out instantly.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: And then back to (Kate) question. Let's do exactly what you mapped out. Let's take this week to ship this thing. Which we're building with you. And then next week, Lee and I are going to build the other little screen.  
Me: Wait. What's the other screen?  
Them: That's the actual thing that we did.  
Me: Okay? All right.  
Them: And show it to you. The main thing was we talked about this morning in design.  
Me: I would put a slightly differently. I think the idea of. I think I was a little overly excited and vicious earlier this week when I was like, we can just ship something that works this week and then just enhance it next week.  
Them: Isn't that what you wanted to do? Okay?  
Me: I think right now, at our current pace, which is actually good, and we're making a lot of good progress, we should be proud. We are closer to the original laid out timeline, which is this week. We're not building anything that actually works this week. We're just getting the interface right. Which means that the goal of today to tomorrow. Is to get this today, hopefully, is to get this home screen right. And tomorrow we get the other edit screen, right? And also the associated things like login and admin. And there are a lot more screens, but I think this is the hardest episoder and once you have this right, the rest becomes a lot easier. To hone because the AI already has a starting point to work with with regards to styles and everything. It would be incredible. And by the end of this week, we have to interface mocks for all the screens that are needed. Where you can literally click on the HTML files and you feel that. Okay. I can see this thing coming together. The thing that doesn't work is that it's still using mock data. There's no database behind it. When you click on a submit button, it doesn't actually create a new entry like that. Like, that's the kind of stuff that doesn't work behind the scenes. But the interface. Is as is something that's satisfactory. So if you work backwards from that, I would say that the goal for today is to get the home screen right. I think you can do it. Yes. As in what we were envisioning on the sketch is now an HTML file.  
Them: And when you say right, you mean right visually. Understood?  
Me: We can make that briefing. And I'm telling you that. What the interface is the hardest part.  
Them: And then wiring it up to the back end and whatever logic needs to happen is in next week thing.  
Me: Traditionally. Yeah. Because the rest is, like, just logical for AI. It's just like, yeah, this database, this data field needs to happen. You need to run this migration.  
Them: I would believe that. Yeah, I would definitely believe that.  
Me: And this thing needs to connect to this thing, this data needs. That's such an easy task for Claude. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, okay. All right, so taking this one step at a time. All good. All good. Today we are focused on this one main page. Tomorrow we're focused on the. And getting that and then the other subsequent pages that might go along with that. And then we're concerned about wiring it up.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: So that it's actually functional.  
Me: Exactly. So that's the goal.  
Them: Next week. And that still means that our beta is ready by the first week of September, which was the original schedule.  
Me: And so it's going to start from. So the way I built the mockup prompt is that it's going to start from the raw HTML file, as you've seen. At some point when you're happy with it, it's going to tell you to go Rails new, which means that you're still working with mockups, but you're working with mockups inside of Rails template. So that it gets closer to something that's ready to be wired up. So basically the HTML exists in a slightly different format inside of Rails app, but it's pretty translatable. And once you have the HTML ready, AI is pretty good at turning that into erb, which is the format for Rails views. Yes. So I'm just flagging that if it mentions frails, that's okay. We will get to Rails by the end of the week. You will get some basic logic. Such as if I click on this button, it should pass this data to that. But that data is a pre hard coded data, not a database. Okay?  
Them: Okay? I get so lost in the sauce in this. So how. Explain to me how.  
Me: What?  
Them: Or maybe we haven't gotten there yet. Are you asking the question or answering it? Before you speak. I don't even know how to ask it. I'll ask it in a stupid way. Just deploying to render to the Internet.  
Me: What did he do the other day?  
Them: Right now. It's not right. It's not connected to render.  
Me: First answer, we pushed it to GitHub and then we created a new web service on Render that is connected to that repository on GitHub that auto deploys whenever there's a commit to (Kate)  
Them: Right now. We went and said, I have no idea. What?  
Me: Hello, Shafi. So it's the exact same thing, except this time it's not a static page. It's a web service.  
Them: We did that.  
Me: That has a database connected to it. So that's why. Remember when we redeployed that? The code generator? We had to create a web service and a database. Because those are two different.  
Them: It's a web story. Get all that together. So you're going to do all that with us for this? Because I don't remember anyone.  
Me: That's next week thing. That's easy.  
Them: Okay? And then we still got to do the NV files and keys and make keys and all that kind of stuff, right?  
Me: All you need for this is square. No AI key is needed. You already have the sandbox and production keys for square. All of that is called wiring things up. Which is just computer logic, which is just when you click this button, this data gets sent to this database.  
Them: Okay? I legitimately get, like, fucking overload, brain overload with this.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Because it's so. But it goes so deep.  
Me: So it's like if you start from the end, if you start from build me a whole functional app, it's going to start by doing all the database and all this stuff, and then all of a sudden, only after you've created adapt based do you realize, oh, I actually don't want these category labels.  
Them: And so high at the same time. Yeah.  
Me: I actually want this instead of that. Right. This is why we're starting from the interface. Because then the AI goes and figures out what that means. That maps to what we already know we want. Yeah, exactly. So that's why this week is just Interface. All right? I just did my research. Technically, you might be able to claude account. Claude officially does not allow that in their terms. So they might guardrails set up. That will detect something like that's not normal. The two logins being from different ips. Whatever and potentially cause problems. Technically, you could run multiple instances. Like, technically, if Chef had a second computer right now, that second computer could log into the same cloud account. What I would recommend is because you're not looking to do something crazy right now. If Lee just creates a $20 cloud code account and just works with that to just do the interface. And then you can see. Yeah. That's what I would recommend. Start with a 20.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And then if you run into limits, they reset in, like, a few hours. They don't reset in a whole month.  
Them: I mean, that makes sense to me. That doesn't feel. Like some huge barrier.  
Me: Then you guys can strategize in the future. Whether you want to or if you want to. Start by trying to log into the same account first. It's up to you, too. And waiting for.  
Them: Right. Yeah. My assumption is that anthropic would have forecasted this type of situation and put guardrails in place.  
Me: And they're already. By the way, this is already like a money losing thing. This is a tension that's an AI coding world right now, because, like, usage is directly proportionate to their cost. It's a variable cost.  
Them: That would be my assumption.  
Me: Right. But then the world is used to a subscription model where the cost is on a demand side. Price is static. So in all cases, like, they're running into issues where the power users of Claude are using tens of thousands of dollars worth of tokens off of a $200 subscription.  
Them: Right. Yeah. Yeah, right. Okay. So what about the other end of it? We're about the GitHub end of it. Is that something where I should be operating under Chef Austin's account, or should I have an account that is invited to those repositories?  
Me: It will cost less to use Job's account. This is for the reason why you would want it to be separate. Eventually is for version histories. And for collaboration in a way where you can see that this quest came from who?  
Them: Okay? Yeah. Like, for instance, Lee. Now on the other one. I was going to work on that email thing, right? Yeah.  
Me: Logged in as we were just.  
Them: Right. Share that with (Kate)  
Me: Yeah. Right now, it will be practical to just log in with Chef's credentials.  
Them: That it was you working on doing it. Exactly. We could figure that out later. We can figure that out later.  
Me: For GitHub. But then applaud. Code front. You might just want to pay for one.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Or you try and see what happens. See if they actually have guardrails up.  
Them: Try and see what happens.  
Me: And even when it does, you can always just pay. It's never going to stop you from paying. That being said, the thing that. Would happen in that case is this small inconvenience is that you would have discontinued the history. Because if you log in to Claude through a different account, you wouldn't be able to resume with the same conversations. Yeah. So it's up to you. Okay? So we have on the book. We have the meeting scheduled in two hours. Is that still a good time for us to check back in? Or do you guys have a bunch of. Yeah.  
Them: We don't know. Probably just say, like, where are you guys at? What happens? But Lee's also got the whole company. I have to call.  
Me: Also, if you just want to keep chiseling at the mockups that you already have Cloud make, you could too. Yeah. But just a heads up. If Lee wants to work on it together, then you should push.  
Them: Yeah, exactly.  
Me: So that he can pull what you already have. Or not. Or he just pulls what's already live on GitHub and just works off of there and then you guys can merge later. Once you have multiple people working on the same code base, you're running into the actual need for branching.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Okay? The roadblock right now is that I don't actually have a working environment. Okay. And also, I don't have sketch. Lead. So you can't send me anything that I can see that he did anything. Get a minute ago.  
Me: But I think that is. I can see why predefined.  
Them: Yeah. I would have to go through the process of outputting screens.  
Me: Preexisting.  
Them: From sketch.  
Me: High fidelity screens could be helpful.  
Them: Which would be time to think.  
Me: In the long run. As of right now, if you put in of high fidelity sketch of something that isn't exactly the screen. You might end up just confusing Claude, and it'll just mix up the both things.  
Them: Yeah. I don't think.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, it'd probably be. The smartest lead is to take what we have, you put it on your computer, manipulate it locally, and then send it to me, and I'll upload it and we'll look at it together.  
Me: So Lee handles the producing the Higher Fidelity mockup for Claude to work with Part. And then Chef handles the putting that muck up into Cloud.  
Them: That probably makes the most sense. Yeah. And then just trying to get it right. Yeah, I'm trying to get a rant. Yeah, that makes sense.  
Me: Basically, Lee is the designer and Chef is the engineer.  
Them: That makes complete sense. Obviously, for this exercise, we'll fix all the other issues and get you in the cloud and all that shit.  
Me: But because it's AI, you don't need to go full in on making it, like, pixel perfect.  
Them: Engine ering. Yeah, that makes complete sense.  
Me: It's like a clear visual communication of what exactly we're looking for. And that's it.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Okay, One other option is that Lee works with something like literally chatgpt.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: To create the HTML file because chatgpt can go too. It can make an xtml file. Too. You don't need a Claude code environment to produce an HTML file. Yeah. Because then you can just download the HTML file, send it to Chef, and have Chef feed it to Cloud.  
Them: Also true. Interesting, okay. Actually, I like this idea, Lee. You intentionally designing everything? Right? Because. The stuff. We go in there and play with it and whatnot. It's kind of fun. It's kind of interesting. And there is a finite line where I no longer do that either. We make enough money to have an actual engineer. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: They can do that. So for now, we just assume those rolls until we can fill them with professionals. We need a treat, right? If (Kate) was just in here running around and doing all this, our company would be. But trying to make me Kate is just a temporary thing. I need to be the head of the chef Globally, right? Yeah, right. Okay, cool. So practically. Practically right now. I need access to that latest iteration of that visual, but currently that exists on your computer.  
Me: Do you need that? Because that wasn't even good.  
Them: But.  
Me: Yeah. Not the time, but a visual.  
Them: The second one was better. Reference.  
Me: The wireframe that we've seen with understanding. Where I need to take it for it to come closer to what we want. To mean by that? Chef can just upload that HTML file somewhere and send it to email it to you. And you could just literally have five ChatGPT threads open to iterate. It's up to you. Yeah. It's just what ever next level of fidelity of guidance that would be helpful for chef to throw into cloth produce the interface. Understood? Understood. It's just that.  
Them: My memory of what? The second thing. Looked like is fuzzy. Of course I have the sketch, the actual sketch that my iterations. On that stuff as well. But like I said, I do kind of want to see what it produced so that I have a better understanding of.  
Me: Yeah, understood. Okay?  
Them: What to communicate to it so that it'll get closer to what we want.  
Me: Cool. So we'll check in into ours. It's just a progress check. That's what the meeting was called.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Lee, I would suggest time blocking it because you're also busy with a bunch of other things. So I don't let it exceed a certain amount of time. Because it doesn't need to be perfect for it to be helpful. Does that make sense? Because you can easily very like, you could very easily go into a rabbit hole where it just takes up the next 10 hours.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: So don't do that. And we'll progress track at 4pm and just move from there. We'll just do what we got to do. From here, the timeline is just. We'll do what we got to do. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, okay. All right.  
Me: Great.  
Them: I'm good. I do need to call James so that I can get him set up with this invoice that he needs, but that's the only.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: And I should probably eat something before I pass out. But that's the only things that I have on my plate to do. And I did not get 85 emails this time, which is amazing.  
Me: Great. The reason why I said it's up to you guys. It's because there's a rescue option of if I did this right now. And then we'll just have the interface.  
Them: I love that for me.  
Me: But I think you guys want it. The experience of going through it from the ground up yourselves, and I think that's worth it.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Just half k do it.  
Them: I think that having the Hail Mary option of Colin, (Kate) and. Screaming into the void is awesome.  
Me: Let's say by tomorrow. Bye. Bye. Tomorrow end of day. If we don't have roughly something.  
Them: But, yeah, if we don't have to pull the film, then.  
Me: That feels ready for being wired up. At least to a certain extent. At least like a subset of it being ready to be wired up. Then we can pull some of the Hail Mary, where basically I go hands on on a (Kate) of myself.  
Them: Yeah. I think that that makes sense. I think that makes sense. I doubt if we will need that option.  
Me: All right, great. Let's do it.  
Them: But knowing that it is available. Gives a sense of comfort. All right. Good deal. Shafi, I don't know if you still have your File Explorer up where you see that mockup.  
Me: You created the chef a shortcut. So you find the HTML file and you just drag and drop it into email and just email it.  
Them: I don't. So I got to figure out how to do that. I don't. Oh, you don't have it? How do I. There you go. Yeah. There you go. You pull up your file explorer. Oh, yeah. On the left side, on the 10 as Chef A. Yeah. And then inside of that, you have to go into the EPC portal, I think. Yeah, and then mock updates. Right here. Yes. And you drag that file email and send it to me just so that I have it as reference. Take it as a link. You can take it as a file. Right. File. Yeah, because it only lists file because it lives on my computer.  
Me: Can I drop?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Should I drop?  
Them: Let me see if I can do this.  
Me: All right, bye.  
Them: File. I would love to send you this file.  
Me: No.  
Them: No, you're good.  
Me: As in, should I drop out of the meeting? Are we good?  
Them: What drag and drop. Yeah, we're good. I thought you said. Did I drop? That's what I thought she said, too.  
Me: All right. I don't think so.  
Them: Oh, that's what I thought. Yeah. If you drop, I think it closes the meeting, which is also fine. Try it.
