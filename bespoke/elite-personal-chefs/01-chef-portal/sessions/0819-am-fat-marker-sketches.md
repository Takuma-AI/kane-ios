Meeting Title: UPC my clients screen design strategy session
Date: Aug 19

Transcript:
 
Them: What's up? Dog.  
Me: You hear me?  
Them: What's up? John.  
Me: Not the sun. It's a gloomy day. I'm not used to this. No, I am. Not.  
Them: All right.  
Me: Hello. Lee. Kind of lowered his desk. All right, here we go. Oh, look. There's two of us. How are we feeling? Good. Always can spend. I'm always concerned that I get two granular too quickly because that's just my process. Understood? It's a good balance. I told Neil yesterday, I'm like, There's a perfect balance between Chef and Lee that we can strike here. Where we create, like, this dynamic duo. Because I think the granularity is actually important in a certain it's not about not being granular, it's about being granular in the right way. S. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So we're basically going to chisel that and channel the energy in the right way. Did you guys? Do we want to start? I don't think I saw your sketches. You didn't post.  
Them: I just posted just a couple of minutes ago.  
Me: Perfect.  
Them: So they should have just uploaded in that message. Hopefully I put them in the right space.  
Me: Okay, I see it.  
Them: You'll see.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Chef did get a chance to do some sketching.  
Them: Y ep.  
Me: Do you want to upload it?  
Them: I will.  
Me: Perfect.  
Them: I am sketching my little sketcher off right now. Oh, my God. I love it. I love it. Artie. Chef. I need one more. All right. My three pages does become four pages. This is like a little inbox. I got to pop up. ciera I got to draw a pop up. Go ahead, go ahead. Lee talk to leave.  
Me: Yes. Okay, I see what's going on here. What were some thoughts that you had as you were doing this?  
Them: The thoughts that I had as I was doing this is I kept kind of battling back and forth. As to what do the chefs actually need to see on this, my client screen. What information do they really need? What's core? And what is just kind of like additional background information that we need for the calculations, but they don't necessarily need to see, in this view. And so that's where I was kind of having this back and forth in my mind. Of do we show them everything that they see now? Because we know that that is a good level of information for them to have. Or do we whittle it down to something that is very scannable, that gives them exactly to still down to the core information of what they need? And so as I started thinking about it, For whatever reason, I couldn't let go of letting them see a little bit more information, but I can definitely be swayed. So anyway. All of that to say that I think that the core things that they really, really need to see in the client listing. Would be the data, the service, the status of that service. The name of the client. And the money that they are going to be taking home. From that service. And that is just in the my client list. Ordered from this week. Pending, meaning the services happened and it's pending some other action, either deposit or not deposit, either invoice being sent or invoice needing to be paid or whatever. And then past historical services, completed services. And so that's the way I was thinking. Like the page would be broken up to see what's upcoming. What is pending as far as services have been rendered and something needs to happen. And then completed services. And then from there, okay?  
Me: No, I just used.  
Them: And then from there, I wanted to look a little bit at a new service. Look like. And I guess I should say that on that my client listing. I thought that it would be best to have the new service button right up at the top of the screen. Above all of the listings of like this week, pending and completed services. And so when they do click that new service button, and I really think that it's about new service on that page. When they click that button. Then they get to a screen where they can enter the date. They can select from existing clients. Likely in some type of a drop down selectable field. And next to that field is a button to add a new client, so that's not necessarily on the screen. But they're selecting from existing clients or have the option to add a new one. And then. An option to select what the service is. And our services are pretty well defined, so I think that that could also be a drop down. That they're choosing from meal prep. Or meal prep, groceries included, meal prep plus groceries, private event, whatever that we have a pretty defined list of services that they could select from. And then they have an open field to enter the contract amount, an open field to enter their food cost, and open field to enter a miscellaneous cost. And then I was thinking that it might be nice to have an if, then about whether a deposit needs to be sent. If the deposit doesn't need to be sent. They click the no, and they just save this. And they've entered this new service for an existing client. If a deposit does need to be sent. Then that would open up a window to send a deposit invoice. And I didn't get into designing that screen necessarily. And then I thought about so backing that up just a little bit to what if they're not picking from an existing client, but they're adding a new client? Lets the information that they actually need to add a new client, and it's not a lot, because the clients can be separate from the services, right? So we're just adding their name, their email, their phone number, and likely address so that that kind of travels along with a client. And that is a brand new client. Which can, you know, then be added to any new service. That they might select going forward. So that's kind of like where my thinking. Was. Anyway, for those.  
Me: Okay. This is a great start because. And this is a good thing, not a bad thing, I think we're going to take the full 90 minutes to work on discussing potentially even just as green. I think there's a lot that's very interesting here.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But before we jump into all of that, Chef.  
Them: Ready. Are you going to share your screen and share mine? Share my screen?  
Me: I'm going to share my screen. Is going on my journey. No, right there. The circle. There's your home page. Sign in, sign up. Welcome, Chef. Glad you're here. So I can click on FAQs and whatnot that brings it to our website and you'll read about our company log in. Sign up, log in. Boom. Order by date, with a next one up being the top. And information. Add new send invoice. Pop up. So the money and the message. What message you want. What's the money? Are you sure? You want to send this? Good to go. Confirm. Whatever. Control C. And you got the chef's corner. So what am I learned? Recipe Database. Menu. Database concept. Database. Company minutes from the past meeting minutes. KPIs like a black channel. This is all a great start. I think that. I guess I didn't mention that for each of my listings. When you're on the My client page, there was next to each one there is an edit button. As well. As send invoice. Next to each listing. Yes, that's obvious. Format that we have now. Yeah, okay. Whatever it is. Okay? I see that this is a great starting point. I want us to zoom in on Justin, my clients page, because, as I suspected, This is the page where we need the most amount of chiseling right now. I want us to. I think it's very hard for us to divorce our idea of. What a spreadsheet looks like right now. With regards to. Here's all the data about all these services and all this whatever. And I want us to take a step back. And think so answer a question here. When a chef guessed it is Page. What is he trying to do?  
Them: I believe that a chef, once it gets to this page, is trying to see number one. What they have coming up, although they probably already know that the status of their various jobs. And the money that they are going to be making from that job. And then have the option to either compel client to pay or make edits. Right. So I'm going to throw Devil's Advocate in here, (Kate)  
Me: Yes.  
Them: What we've even the last seven years, we haven't changed.  
Me: I understand. Yes.  
Them: Once. All we know what we use now works and essentially, Chef's ability to go in and see what Lee just said. The client's information. The traffic light was the status. That was all I could come up with at the time. Right? And I wanted to be simple. And then from there they go and they open up, square up. And they make the edits to the money and then send it to the client. And then Lee is the same way.  
Me: Opens up the status. Really annoying.  
Them: And sees that the status.  
Me: Correct money. And the speech matches the correct money from invoice.  
Them: Money.  
Me: Because we can't have equity types of company. Was the status. And the client information was the box. Telling us the correct information on the invoice. And then running that. Gathering all that information once a week at running it now becomes a numbersome thing. Or at least. Standpoint of the functionality. We did a good job with a spreadsheet wearable, so. Okay, so I hear what you're saying. What I'm trying to push on is not the functionality of this. Like, the functionality all makes sense. I'm thinking from the perspective of the whole point of sketching. Is for us to think from the first principles of what is trying to be done, like what needs to get done here. Because that changes some of the questions that Leo is asking about, well, what information needs to be on the table versus being in the details page when you open up a job? Right. So, for example. Let's start with a simplest example of how something might be shown differently. Right. And this could be completely wrong. But for example, right now, I don't know why this is showing like that. In this sketch of the dates, right? We're looking at full dates. We're looking at the whole date, like 08. Right. One simple detail is for it to say today. In two days. Next Monday. Right. That's actually a pretty simple plugin. That from a human perspective. If I look at my upcoming jobs, it might make sense for me to see what are my jobs today. What are my jobs in the next week? Right in a human language. And this might sound like minute detail, but this is the kind of thing that we would think about when we start to sketch out what we want distinct to feel like. So there's some functionality of. Yes, this page needs to do everything that happens on the Reshi today. But then there's also the foundations of okay, what should it feel like? To be on this page should I feel like, especially if I'm going to be able to access this on my phone. Nobody wants to open up a spreadsheet on their phone. Right. Of course, like, okay, your chefs have been working on computers this whole time. That they're going to be fine. If we just did that, it will be fine. But I think there's thinking about simplicity from the standpoint of conceptual simplicity in terms of what's the simplest for us to literally take and copy. Paste and under simplicity from a true experience standpoint of like I open this page, I know what to do.  
Them: Right.  
Me: For example, like the information that you need to see.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: For a job that has been done already? Is that the same as the information for a job that hasn't been done already? And doesn't even make sense for those two to be on the same view?  
Them: Yeah. That is a good question. So. If we separate. The. Yeah. Okay, so it's like distilling this down, right? Because if we suffer,  
Me: Great.  
Them: What we have that's completely combined right now.  
Me: Specifically. To ensure they are equities. Like that day. Do they need to see their overall value? No. Do they need to see anything about what happened in the previous weeks? The only thing I need to see. More day. Whatever. How friendly that is. Services for likely don't even need to see what. And then probably would want to see the pandemic.  
Them: Pending amount of money that they might be making from that service, but they're not positive of that. I think that that's probably important. Because the whole reason is.  
Me: Is to make money. For them to be able to see back consistently wherever they are.  
Them: Likely.  
Me: And then the functionality side of it, but they have to be. To edit an entry. I think that it would be nice. That if they were looking at an entry and it looks solid, that they would be able to. Screen as well so that they land on this client. They just perform. Just drop the food off that they put in on that listing. I feel like that level of experience, we're all. Day of service. The client the money that they are potentially making from it. And then an option to edit or send an invoice I think is likely distilling down what they would want to do from that page. So yes. I've never actually done meal prep. So maybe we should ask a chef. Yeah. So then the next question. So I know the chef probably has his input on this, too, but I'm going to push on what Lee just said. What you said makes sense to me. But of course, Chef is the one here who has cooked the most and done this the most. So could be completely off base. But to me, what that sounds like is there's two reasons why I'm landing on the screen. There's one which is literally to see my upcoming jobs and be able to get paid. Right to take action. Not to view information to take action. Right. Of course, the action involves double checking or editing information in order to take the right action to collect the right amount of money. There's a different job that you guys are describing, which is viewing information, viewing my history of how much money I've spent or how much money I've made. How much money I'm pending. To be paid? Like, how much money can I expect to be paid next week? That kind of stuff. So it's almost like there's a version of reality. And again, like, I'm throwing this out there. But there's almost a version of reality where there's almost like a two tabs. To the screen, right? Like, there's the first tab, which is just your upcoming jobs. You can just take action on these upcoming jobs. And then there's my company, which is more of. It's less important to be immediately able to see. Probably each job could take up less space than on the first screen. And here it's more about seeing your total. Like, how much money have you made? How much money is pending. It's almost like a dashboard. Right. So that's one way to imagine this. Now, one step further. When does a chef actually edit this thing? Like, how does this. Because it's one thing to think about from an operations person perspective of the nice thing about spreadsheets is that you see all the information all the time, and you can edit everything, whatever you want. That on the spreadsheet, but in reality, in practice.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Is it like, do I just random. Does a chef just randomly come to this dashboard and just decide to edit something? Or is it more of they come here like this is like working on the dashboard is not their main job. Their main job is cooking. So they see the job for the first time. They may or may not touch it. They may may rise some notes. They come back after they're done cooking, they come get. Come back to this dashboard, and now they're just going through the process of editing it, finalizing it, and getting the payment. So will they ever click on Send invoice without going through the editing step?  
Them: Yes. Perhaps because every chef is different. So we do have an opportunity. To prescribe. A flow.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That we initiate as a standard. And so that's like a caveat. But some chefs. Will make the updates. To the job. After they purchase the groceries because it's fresh in their mind.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: At that point, how much they have spent. But then they go and cook and deliver the service, and they only send the invoice after they've actually delivered the service. But some chefs will do everything, deliver everything, and then edit. And send the shock.  
Me: I'm practically speaking, would a chef send an invoice without looking at the invoice again, looking at the information of the job just to make sure it's right again? In a perfect world. No. Okay, I would say that. No.  
Them: Practice because they want to get paid. They want to make sure.  
Me: General practice is that. Because it's their money. And we've made it very clear that we pay you what you indicates the client. So if you screw up the invoice, that's what you're getting paid, Yeah. This is why, to be clear. I made some edits to the breadboard after session yesterday based on what I think was best off of what we discussed. And this is kind of like part of what I was starting to assume or starting to put in here. And I'm curious to hear your thoughts. So what you just described, right? You look at my clients, which is like the list of everything. You can click into any of the services. And then that page where you see the details is also directly the page where you get to edit the details. And this is kind of like you finalize the details, you can present the service details in a way that feels almost like an invoice, right? So then you click finalize Invoice. Maybe you can skip the step of confirmation where it says finalize invoice here. Maybe here directly. You already have the button that says send invoice. But the question is, does the chef ever need to be able to directly send invoice. From the client's page. Or does it make sense for them to always at least have to look at everything before they click on send invoice. So that's like a. It's not always the obvious answer of, oh, of course you want to be able to directly do things from the home page. Maybe. Right? Like, maybe it depends on, like, you know, if. If the Dashboard is more of like a. Like a spreadsheet style, like 10 columns. You know, you'd see everything on one page and you're just, like, clicking send, send, send, sense and send. You're Xintong 10 jobs at a time. Maybe if you're dropping off 10 meals in a single day, maybe that makes sense in bulk. But if this is more of, like, a high end bespoke experience where the chef is not cooking for, like, 20 people at a time, this is less of a bulk processing. And it's more of a. I'm looking at this job. I just cooked for this thing. Let me collect my money. Then it might make sense for them to have to click into it to then finalize and send the invoice.  
Them: Yeah. It's interesting because, as per usual, We have many examples of both. Right. We have many chefs who have two or three clients. And they cook for them on separate days. So it is a very individual process where they're not doing a lot of this. Administrative processing. But then we have chef teams who cook for 30 clients and deliver to those 30 clients all on the same day and send out all of those invoices at the same time. So there's both scenarios. That.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Get pretty significant traction inside of the company.  
Me: Understood. That's important to note. Interesting. Other community, which I was not even going to really say.  
Them: And then the other caveat, which I was assuming that at this point, ones that are Xintong out, like, 30 invoices.  
Me: Invoices in a day. Are the chef teams. That are splitting the proceeds. As well as reimbursable cost because all of them are put in different amounts of money. Towards. So I know that that's not something that would necessarily addressing in this first round, but it's just like energy that you're already thinking. The understanding that eventually we have to factor in team aspect of things. Yeah, for now, we're just going to treat the team as one, chef. So, Chef, let me ask you this from your perspective, when you imagine how the culture that you want to breed here, the platform that you want to create for these jobs, to own their businesses, And the behavior that you want to encourage. Do you imagine that the chef that cooks for 30 people. Is going to. Individually, think about each invoice and care about. Versus more like a bulk. Action of. Individual. Every single one of them is different. So it's not like they're cooking for 30 people, but they're all different. Things. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: A weekly.  
Them: You're talking about the weeklies. Like, not a 30% dinner party, but a weekly.  
Me: So it is an individual service. So in that case, you would want them to. In a sense, confirm or at least look at the details of each one. Before Xintong the invoice.  
Them: 1 3, 25. 1 2, 65. Tree. This one's no groceries. Like. It's all fucking different. They're all different. With this interaction of this thing. It's to keep all that information in one place and then be able to go through and just invoice them. Because technically, what actually happens in reality. I'll give you some reality here. Let's say I had 30 clients and I go spend $1,000 on groceries. They don't put 121, 137, 141, 151. They just divide 1000 by 30 and send it out.  
Me: Very systematically. And I mean, it might just be Eric finally do that. But Eric and put different numbers. $26.73. Each individual under that.  
Them: Each clients, so it's not like they just split it by four and put it in.  
Me: Client.  
Them: No, I understand that. I'm saying if you client.  
Me: John. 3:25 and his groceries are 1:72. That's not actually real. That's not actually accurate. All that shit up. Way too much. I would argue that Eric spends a lot of time, actually, because I see in there the numbers are reliable. They're never clean. Really? I agree. Blow my brains out. When I see the numbers, I don't even bother adding them up. Because it would be insane amounts of math for me to add the numbers. Up. Yeah, it's confirmed. Of all four, add up what they actually build, exactly why I do it. I was like, Sam puts in 1722 and Riley, but Johnny puts in 80. That got to add up to what we built. Message at him that it doesn't add up. Let's say, add that up and every week there's $7,008 that is off. Right. Seriously. John Dean in LA could be like, oh, 37 extra dollars. You never notice. We never know. Automation that we do next week. Where basically, you know how you're still going to manually do that? Part of you can do, like a constraint where you'll flag if the total amount of. Just as. I don't think I say. That the service that they just split evenly across. But Eric put in $23.46 groceries, rightly put in $35.40 groceries, Sam put in $11.39 groceries, and Dan. And my understanding. Is. 23.46. 35.40. Nine. And 38.98. So 109. 23. Right. It was a contract. 25 times 4. Okay? How the game. 10923 off of a receipt. For 30 people. How much of the olive oil that they put in. There's no way. It's, like, wild to me, not round numbers. Eventually, you might want to add here for uploading. Maybe. I'm trying to figure out why. 48%, probably, which is way over what it should be. Right. 30 or 33%. We don't have to derail this meeting. No, but I just wanted to let you know that they're not simplifying. At least Eric's team is not simplifying in the way that a lot of our Hirdash has to do. A lot of the other chefs do simplify in that way. And also with the rise of food costs, I've noticed that we are creeping up more in the realm. I don't know. That we need to do. And again, like you said, let's not derail this meeting. ciera How much action? From the home. Page, because as you're starting to see, it's actually more complicated. Right? Because. The columns. If you want to make it circumcised, edit where it feels like a spreadsheet, where a chef can just go in and edit the groceries in bulk. What I'm hearing is that it might be important. For you, that is to be able to see all their clients for that day. And be able to directly edit all of the groceries. All the grocery costs, for example. That is what they are able to do right now. With the spreadsheet? I don't know. Shifting that paradigm. Is a negative as long as it is a relatively frictionless flow. My gut tells me that if they were to have to click in and click out and click back in, 30 times. Times4 would be too much friction. No. This is what's important for us to hear. Because I think if you're talking about the more sort of one on one relationship where they're cooking for one client at a time and they're caring about one service at a time, it's obvious to me that the clicking into and confirming is the right way to go, especially if you think about the potential of this being a phone based experience. The potential of it being a more thought through experience. It's obvious to me that that would be the case. However, you do have significant business coming in from this completely different case. Right. And this is part of the challenge. In sort of trying to productize a business that already has a lot of variety in it. All right. So we need to kind of be opinionated about what is the behavior that we want to encourage and what is the type of business that you want to continue to encourage? Is it more of the one on one thing or is it more of the being? Is it more important for these jeff teams to be able to do the bulk processing because there is a different world where we decide that this portal specifically is not for the Chef teams, and we have them continue to use spreadsheets. Right? There's that world. Too, you could decide eventually that there are two different experiences depending on what type of chef or what type of team they are. Because fundamentally, if you think about this at scale, EPC as basically cooperative of different chefs running their businesses, Those are very. Two very different types of businesses. Right. Yeah. Today. Maybe we got to strike a balance.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The question is. Okay, let's say we want to maximize flexibility.  
Them: They are.  
Me: In terms of being able to edit. 100 clients at a time. Where were you looking at all the clients? And you're just able to quickly edit from the same view? Just.  
Them: Hold on. Let's not get lost. Let's not get lost in the sauce, okay? So I don't give a shit what Eric does with his crew and how they do all their bills. They're doing it crazily. So Eric just needs to go down and get one credit card and give all three of his people the same credit card, and then all the money just go on Eric's tab. The fact they split it all out for people is insanity.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: We would never tell someone to do that. So I don't want to derail the app because we're worried about what these four people are going to do.  
Me: That's true. I was going to say that. It sounds like you should either way, from EPC's perspective. I know we talked about them being us treating the teams as one chef, basically.  
Them: I don't care what they do.  
Me: But even from a spend perspective, their payroll should be treated as one. Too, because they're one business, basically, right? Like thing about UBC as a network of businesses, they're one business.  
Them: Y.  
Me: How their business, how they manage their money inside their business is their problem.  
Them: Eah.  
Me: At scale. At least.  
Them: It's their fault. Exactly 100%.  
Me: What you just said when you send Ryan offering.  
Them: So if they want to do it this way.  
Me: Shop, right. Gender is all available.  
Them: They should do exactly what you just said. Same way. And already that's how bills. She's the one spreadsheet. Ryan is just his piece of it, and she manages it all.  
Me: This is a collective of businesses. The businesses manage their own money. The businesses have an account on this portal right through you.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But what I was saying earlier is still true in that a chef or like a culinary business.  
Them: Exactly correct. Yes.  
Me: That does this one on one private chef experience, where they're thinking about one client at a time is fundamentally like, have very different needs. From a culinary business that is serving 30 people per day. Too much. Yeah.  
Them: Because even if it's only one time, clicking in and clicking out of 30.  
Me: So one way we could do this. By the way, and I think this might make sense already, Is that? Regardless of how we want to scope this right now. We can make the mobile experience like click in and click out because it's way too much information to squeeze on a phone or a smaller screen. But the desktop experience can feel more spreadsheet. Like even in that case, in a desktop, we would need to be opinionated about what is editable. From the master view. Because I don't think it's possible to make every single line item editable. Because also your line items aren't unified. Like, not every. Like, not every service type even has the same type of columns. Yeah. And then.  
Them: Yeah. You just say it's either an event or it have a category of the column.  
Me: And then it's a total, and then it's the reimbursement. Like there's a positive and there's a negative and then there's a deposit. Are those monies? It depends on what we're talking about. We're talking about the back end as far as population s. All different if we're talking about.  
Them: Right now, historically, we have never really given a chef whether or not a deposit has been paid, because that's not really important to them performing service.  
Me: Providing. To get paid. Doesn't actually total invoice amount, though.  
Them: Burden to me and understand what needs to be.  
Me: Yeah, I guess it does change.  
Them: That is true, but again, that's something that can be calculated on the back end.  
Me: Okay, so here's the thing, right?  
Them: Interesting. Okay, yes. But, yes, you're right. That does change the final invoice amount. Yeah, you're right.  
Me: There's the difference between showing information and allowing the child to edit it. Information. If you want the chef to be able to edit the grocery directly from the dashboard. Right. That's a very different. Okay, so if they can edit a grocery amount, is that the only thing they can edit?  
Them: Yeah. Right.  
Me: If no. And they. They have to be able to edit headcount, and then they have to be able to edit. Like all of the other things. That go into calculating the final invoice. So is it just a grocery as an outlier of, like, the one thing that they should edit, which is, like, a very, like.  
Them: It is distilling it down. All of the nuanced information of headcount and blah, blah, blah is all wrapped up in the contract number. So those counties happen outside of the spreadsheet and the final number of whatever, how many guests it is,  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Or how many people they're cooking for for weekly prep or whatever is already calculated in the number that they put in for the contract amount for 25. They've already determined that. That three. 25. Because they're cooking five meals for two people.  
Me: Great. Just to give you transparency to how I'm thinking about this. To be clear. In my ideal world.  
Them: They already know that in that number.  
Me: It's literally as simple. As today. Client information. What is the money? And then it. Click into it. And then they can look at the detailed line items and send the invoice, right? The composition we're talking about. Is the fact that they need to be able to edit grocery amounts. And especially for chef teams that are operating, like 30 contracts at a time,  
Them: I feel that.  
Me: It could feel like a lot for them to have to click in and click out. So then what do they need to be able to edit in bulk? So everything that you're saying about that, not like the, the nuances to, like, how many people, like how many, how much cost per person, how many bartenders, all of that logic being behind the scenes true.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Yes. All you do want to show on a dashboard is to total contract value. But to what extent? What can they edit? Wouldn't it? Are we settled? Are we happy with the solution? Of a desktop experience where you see the contract, you see the total contract value, and then out of nowhere, the one field that you can edit is the grocery amount.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: See what it means.  
Them: Speaking experientially. Experientially the client. Okay. The chef. Is the only number that the chef. Well, okay, there are three numbers that the shaft enters on a regular basis. The total contract amount, which means that all of those calculations around headcount and all of that stuff have already been done, and they have a number that they're putting in. Then they would enter grocery cost, and then they would enter any miscellaneous cost that has been prenegotiated that they're going to be reimbursed for. And those are the only numbers that they ever enter.  
Me: So. For the total. Right, like the total contract amount.  
Them: Yeah, that could change. It might take $20 off or something than the original contract.  
Me: Are negotiating that.  
Them: But like Amy with the client bodybuild menu and whatever before the chef. When the contract final menu gets determined between the chef and the client, they already have an understanding of what the total contract number is going to be because they've already discussed how many people are going to be there, the price point per head or the price point per meals that they're cooking for, meal prep or whatever.  
Me: 's.  
Them: And then if that changes between the final.  
Me: Decide a couple of days. For people to the dinner party. Then they would up that charge. They're only. $100 just for simple math. They already know that the number is 650. And then when they get ready to send the final invoice based, they need to say they just put the number in. So what I'm hearing is that we don't want to build in that any form of that calculation into the system at all. We want the flexibility of them being able to just edit the contract value to whatever it is. And whatever explanation for how that number was arrived to could just be supplemented as notes. And that calculation doesn't happen on here. We don't need line items. To be a thing on a platform. Basically. Serves as a reminder, right? They have 37 clients, remember what all their contract. It's not a reminder for them the week before. They don't have to think about it. Eric's client contact. He has to go research. But yeah. You were alluding to (Kate) And do the couple even of what the total contract should be. Our expectation. Either, because it's a new project. That teacher piece to that. Because.  
Them: Because contract is repeatable. From week to week. That they already have a sense that's total number is, and it doesn't need to be recalculated for them every time.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: If.  
Me: Okay, here's the fundamental tension we're speaking to right.  
Them: That was even close to what you were asking.  
Me: Productizing and technology has always been about. Turning things into systems. Like turning things from one off tasks into a system that's designed for the task. And it's always so tension between or attention or question of how much do you systematize? The long term, where you want UPC to be like the scale of all thing that you want, right? It might make sense, fundamentally, to turn this into more of a calculator logic. Where ver money you take off, you need to enter a discount amount. You need to have that logic recorded somewhere, and there are a lot of reasons why that might be desired. In the short term. I can see why that is. That wouldn't serve you, and that would just make this thing harder to ship. Because of existing practices. And there's a case where you to build in right now the flexibility of whatever it is, whatever reasoning for why this contract is the way it is. Doesn't matter. That that would just be, like, free form entered in, like, a text box, and it's just a contract value that you can freely edit. But then there becomes a source of truth. Problem of, like, wherever else that contract is being calculated right now on whatever spreadsheet that exists. That number could change or that number could diverge from this, from this data. Right. So then, like, what keeps that in check? What keeps? You might end up with a messier source of truth in regards to why numbers are the way they are. So then it's a trade off, right? You just need to be aware that if we build in that flexibility, it's tech depth for the future. That being said, practically speaking, that might make sense right now. Does that make sense? You understand why it might make sense in a long term to do calculator logic?  
Them: Yeah, I do understand. Because I do. I do get it. As we scale. Yes, I do understand that. It definitely makes. What we're talking about as far as what the chefs are entering and manipulating, it definitely adds a level of complexity that I wasn't necessarily factoring in.  
Me: Yeah. For sure. But I'm just saying, the whole point of this. The whole idea of getting you out of the spreadsheet and whatever. Part of that is requires a level of data cleanliness or like a level of systemization around, like, you make a decision that this is how things are going to be calculated and there's a source of truth. There's a trade off. There's, like, a spectrum of how this book and how messy the numbers are. Versus how clean and how calculated and logical the numbers are. And we need to pick a point on that spectrum. And if we go down the structured route, You lose some of the flexibility. But you can automate the most. If you go down the less structured route, you can automate less. There's almost like a relatively fundamental trade off there. So okay if we don't want to, it's okay for us to keep things messy. We just need to know that it's messy for a reason. And then gradually work towards eliminating that mess. Wouldn't it make sense? Too.  
Them: Yeah. I really feel like I need to lean into chef and the experience of actually having done this.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Because I'm speaking very much from a corporate administrative perspective, not from a chef's experience. Because my assumption is that. You know how much, you know how many people you're cooking for and you know what you're charging them, so just put the number in. Right, but that might not be the chef's perspective.  
Me: This is a huge part to do with the long term vision too. When you say that you want to let epc, you want to have EPC be like a platform for chefs to own and run their own businesses. Right. Basically means that in a long term. There's a world where there's so much liberty on their end that you don't even care why they're charging that number. They charge whatever they want to charge. So then we don't need line items at all. We don't need calculators at all. So much I'm talking to extreme. But there's between EPC defines the set of services that these trucks provide, and clients sign up for them, and they are calculated according to EPC's pricing logic. And there's a whole other extreme of their is no pricing logic. The chefs who run their businesses decide how much to charge. And they can put in whatever number they want.  
Them: Yeah. Like, the middle ground is that the pricing logic is in our coach under there, and that spits out the number. And they just plug that number in here or it's pulled from the quote generator or whatever.  
Me: But the code generator has the pricing logic. So what's the case? So then why wouldn't we have pricing logic here?  
Them: That's what I'm saying.  
Me: It's not why we need to do duplicate it. It's if we want this to be editable. And yet it came from the code generator. Then it becomes a Divergent. Like what is, what is true.  
Them: I guess. Why would we need to duplicate it?  
Me: This number then becomes like, if you're going to lock this in with whatever the code generator comes up with, then that loses the flexibility that you inherently have in the process right now. Which. Yeah.  
Them: It's what you said. Whatever fucking number in there you want. Doesn't matter.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: We're only going to pay you what got paid. The actual client. I don't care if you put $7 bajillion in there, you're getting paid 225, because that's what the client. We can do whatever you want.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But the invoice, that number that you put in there is going to go on the invoice and get sent to the client.  
Me: So what I'm hearing is they need to be able to edit the total contract number. Which they can turn into seven bajillion dollars. Yes. So there's that field.  
Them: If you have a client, we'll get an invoice for seven bajillion dollars. And so I would never do that. And they will never pay it.  
Me: There's the field. For. There's the field for the reimbursement, so that's the amount that is added to their literal.  
Them: Labeled. There should be a label of that groceries. Or it could be containers or miscellaneous.  
Me: What if there are multiple.  
Them: I don't know. Right now. Right now. The experience right now. Is they have the opportunity to split between food costs and miscellaneous costs. And some of them do and some of them don't. Some of them put it all in food costs. Nobody puts it all in miscellaneous. But some of them just add it all up and put it into food costs. But some of them do break out food costs, and then anything else that has been negotiated to be reimbursable gets added together and put in miscellaneous cost.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Which I think is an appropriate thing on an experiential level. I don't think that we need to break out containers or whatever else. I think that miscellaneous can be a bucket and food costs can be a bucket.  
Me: No. Okay? So three columns that must be editable from the dashboard. The total contract value, the food cost and miscellaneous costs.  
Them: And they figure out what miscellaneous is.  
Me: And then there's the value display of how much money in total that this contract is. Well, like the miscellaneous cost and whatever. Impacts their payroll, it doesn't impact the contract.  
Them: No. So there would be a number that is not editable, that is a calculation. And that number would be the contract amount. Minus the epc commission. Of whatever that is.  
Me: So you would have. So there's the date, so it could say today, and then the client name.  
Them: Plus the reimbursables. So that is what the contract value is to the chef. That's what the shop is.  
Me: Let's say that there's a client card that has to name any address or whatever, like the client and the client contact information, whatever. And then there's the total contract value. And then two smaller numbers. That's like the reimbursables. And then there's the expected payout.  
Them: Sure.  
Me: Okay? Yes.  
Them: I think that. And then if I lightly put my design hat on for a second, I think that the most important things are the date, the client name, and the expected payout. As far as visual hierarchy and then the other editable fields. Are lower individual hierarchy, because I think that from a chef's perspective, they want to know when they have to serve who and how much they're going to get from it.  
Me: So I understand the expected payout importance from the standpoint of a contract that is already delivered and done. From the perspective of looking at, practically speaking, what's my upcoming job? Is that still the case? Okay?  
Them: Let me put my chef head on. I mean, kind of. Because I want to know what my effort is worth.  
Me: So if I'm looking at my upcoming services,  
Them: But maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. Chef, what do you think?  
Me: On a dashboard.  
Them: For what, specifically?  
Me: I see the client name. I see one it is. I see the total contract value.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: And then I get to enter the grocery amounts, whatever, and then I get to see the total, the expected payout with the commission and everything.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Is it more important for me to. Just practically look at the details. Like when I'm looking at this dashboard and I'm trying to see what's next, as in, like, who's this client? And how much am I cooking? Whatever. And how much are my groceries would be able to enter that? Or am I already thinking about the expected payout? Great.  
Them: You would be looking at that because you're planning something in your life and you want to know your schedule. That's how you'll be looking at that. If you didn't just do it and you want your money.  
Me: Okay? So that means that the date and the client information, address, et cetera, becomes a lot more important.  
Them: The only reason you're looking at that is to be like, hey, can I go to the movies on Friday, or do I have an event?  
Me: That's your schedule. So there's a very action oriented job to be on of that page.  
Them: Yes. From a logistic standpoint, yes.  
Me: Versus the what am I worth Page, which is more money oriented. But then we also want them to be able to edit grocery amounts and everything in bulk on that same page.  
Them: What are my worth is like a motivator. Yeah. That feels like the least amount of friction. Yes.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So you just click on the drop. You just edit it, and it would be like a check mark.  
Me: Maybe there's like a. There's a. There's like an edit mode.  
Them: And it gives you, like, an update all boxes button at the top.  
Me: Like maybe by default, you're looking at your schedule. Because I'm just like, if I'm looking at this as my logistical schedule, I don't want to see the fields. Like, as in, I don't. I don't need to click around and accidentally edit something.  
Them: Yeah, I feel that. So that there is an edit button, and then you're able to do all the things. That's kind of where I was envisioning. That the information on this initial display. Is quote, unquote static, and to manipulate it, you would have to hit the edit button. Is the way I was envisioning it. But then when we started talking about this use case of somebody having 30 clients that they deliver to all in the same day,  
Me: Mode. Like, as in, on a normal basis. For the chefs that cook for one person at a time, they never need to use the bulk edit mode. They can click into one client, edit it, Xintong invoice, whatever. For this, but there's a bulk mode from the dashboard where they can edit everything at the same time.  
Them: No, they. Exactly.  
Me: How about let's make bulk mode? So you know how we said we wanted to ship something this week and then add things next week? What about. Let's. Let's scope out the bulk mode this week and make that a next week thing. Just because it.  
Them: Yeah, I understand. Yeah. I would assume that we would be beta testing this with selected people from different scenarios and we can time that out as we ship different features. I listen.  
Me: Exactly. Okay? So do we agree that there's a view that's like the upcoming schedule type situation, and then there's a view that's the money I've made in my history. Chef.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Or do I need to be able to see all my jobs? Just on the same view.  
Them: Okay? Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: No. But once you're done, don't give a shit about him anymore at all. Yeah. I think that the only thing that. The only caveat that I would say is that once a job is completed and it's been paid, Whatever. It can be an archive, it can be in completed, it can be in whatever. If there is an upcoming service that I have not rendered yet. I want to know that so I can forecast my schedule. And then if there is a service that I have rendered but I haven't gotten paid for it yet, I want to be able to see that so I know what the status is. So I want to see if the client has paid their invoice for it or if the invoice is still pending out there and the client hasn't paid it yet. Well, currently, the chef could go into square up and manually kick off a reminder. To that client. If they see, oh, I render the service and pay the invoice, they could manually go into and kick off a reminder. So you think that it is important to see what's coming up? And then also to see what is in the current state of invoice that's been sent.  
Me: We can, by the way, make that annoying.  
Them: But the client has not paid yet. I think that that is important to the chefs.  
Me: By putting the invoice sense, but plan hasn't paid yet. On the screen of the schedule.  
Them: But anything that has been completed and paid.  
Me: So that it blocks at the top. Like, as in. As in, you look at your schedule, you're trying to see what's upcoming, but you don't get to scroll. You need to scroll past what has been in the past but hasn't been paid yet in order to get to what's upcoming. Like, something that could be, like, by choice, like, design it. 's an option. It depends on expected volume, right? If you're talking about, like, 30 clients that hasn't paid yet, then no.  
Them: Oh, my God. No. I don't know. Wow. I don't know if it needs to be that.  
Me: But if you performed services. Because in my mind. It's like there's a screen of things that I need to be reminded that I need to do, and there's a screen of the things that I've already done.  
Them: No.  
Me: And I've already done. But the client hasn't paid yet. Well, it's not in my money yet. So why would it go into my money screen? Right. This is an opinion that you need to have, right? It's either. Well, why has an opine pay is your responsibility to go bug decline and make them pay. So just like that on that screen, right? It's something that is still pending action.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Or you take a more laid back approach. Your opinion is that, well, if the client owes them that money, then it's kind of their money already. It's just future money.  
Them: Yeah. And that is my perspective. Is that if this were on mobile. That on the front screen, I'm seeing what's coming up. And below the fold is the pending stuff, because at the end of the day,  
Me: We're not going to budget clients to pay you. And you're not going to get paid. Yes, but you see, what I mean by that's actually not to be taken for granted. There's a solid case for why it might be the other way. I wanted to show you base camp. This is an example of a product decision that they made. Where if you click on my assignments, And you click on my assignment with dates. You have to scroll through all the overview stuff. Before you get to the upcoming. And I think there's a good reason for that. Because it's not your money if your client hasn't paid yet. But that's just kind of annoying. Having it paid yet other time. I think it's healthy to keep it at the top of the chef's mind. That. Hey. The client hasn't paid yet, therefore, this is not done. Yet. That's very interesting. Was something where it was limited. Yeah.  
Them: There is no underneath that says and 16 other pending, right?  
Me: That's interesting. Yeah. I like that, actually.  
Them: Or something like that, so that they're alert to, hey, there's a lot of shit up here, but it doesn't take up the entire screen.  
Me: I don't know about you, chef, but we're discussing. We're pending statuses should go. And I'm like, it shouldn't go in your history. It's not your money yet. If they haven't paid you on your money yet. So it should be at the top of your schedule, like, overdue. Yeah.  
Them: Correct.  
Me: You want to look at tomorrow's job? Well, you haven't gotten paid for your yesterday's job yet.  
Them: That's right. Yeah, like in your face. Like red, like hello. Yeah. That's interesting. That is very. Yeah. Okay? Tracking with where this is with where this is going.  
Me: So just to level set a little bit, because we've discussed a lot. And we have, like, 20 minutes before you guys need to hop to your weekly meeting. I don't think we're going to finalize this within 20 minutes. But I think focusing on Justice Green once again, like just a screen. I want us to be able to get this screen, a version of this screen. Encode interface by the end of today. So I think right now. Or at least like one version of it. Right. So this we can have feedback on it. So right now. What do you say we each take 10 minutes?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: To go on a piece of paper and sketch out how we are envisioning what we just said. Like one screen with your upcoming schedule. How does that upcoming schedule show up? On your screen. Right, like, where does each information go? That pending annoying stuff at the top? What does that look like? For history. What I'm proposing right now is that we have that on a different screen. As in. Or like a different tab of sorts. We don't over design it for the what's my worth Screen just yet. And we wait till we've finished making the part about taking upcoming jobs and getting paid for it functional and shipped that. Before we go and design, what should it feel like to look at the money I've already made? So now we can just keep it simple. It's just rows in a table. We don't care. So let's take. I mean, it's. This one's green, and I just want us to get on paper what we. What we're envisioning, each in our head. When we think about what we just discussed.  
Them: Okay? Understood?  
Me: Let's actually give it five minutes. Let's check in in five minutes. Post. We'll post a sketch on a thread. And then as you guys go off to your meeting, I'm going to go unify our three sketches into something that feels more comprehensible. And then we can have asynchronous feedback on that. We can check in after your meeting. We can hop on a quick call. To do that, and then I can onboard you guys to the neoclodcode repository, where we can turn that sketch into something real. Five minutes. Now let's check back in at 46. And that's just sketch out with this one screen. Like my client screen. What does that look like? According to our imagination of what we just discussed.  
Them: Okay? Okay?  
Me: No, like the homepage. Like, where your upcoming jobs is. Like, basically your upcoming schedule of jobs.  
Them: I was doing the wrong one. We're doing a my client screen.  
Me: Including what that schedule looks like. Where the pending payments.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: How they show up. And then where the bulk editing thing is. Actually, let's go about the book editing. We can add that in later. But I think the information we decided on including is the contract amount, grocery miscellaneous. And the expected payout. And client information and date. Okay?  
Them: Okay? Okay. Hey, tammy.  
Me: Very good.  
Them: That's that. Okay? Yeah. Oh, my God. This new iPhone update keeps. Lowering the brightness, which is horrible, because every single time I open my phone back up, I have to increase the brightness again. And we cannot find setting. To fix that super irritating. Profits.  
Me: Yep. As well as your unpaid, overdue work.  
Them: Confirming. That we have just drawn what it looks like when I log into the portal and see my work, my upcoming work.  
Me: That we are going to shove into people's faces.  
Them: That triggers it. Triggers highlight. Okay?  
Me: I think we're going to need to add an afternoon session.  
Them: Thank you.  
Me: If you guys are available. If not, we still have plenty. Lupus.  
Them: We had something scheduled for started that meeting.  
Me: Yeah, okay. I'll come with that meeting with a proposal for what I think the sketches would look like based on everything that we've discussed.  
Them: Back an hour to, like, three or something. That should be all good.  
Me: Just so that we can move a little bit faster. Move added enough speed for us to. Okay, maybe I was over the ambitious earlier. We can't have the interface mock today, but we can get to that tomorrow morning.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Today. At the very least, let's finish the. Let's finish those sketches. It's important to get this right. You see why?  
Them: Yeah, I feel you. I understand.  
Me: Absolutely.  
Them: The sketches. Yeah, I get it.  
Me: Strategic.  
Them: Yeah, I told it. We get it.  
Me: When it kind of goes.  
Them: Yeah, absolutely. Because this is a lot.  
Me: Sometimes I have to faster than my practice design. And I get very. Frustrated with myself. When I forecast that I've made. Had I had more time. That's just building bad on top of bed, and that is, like, the worst place for me to be. I understand. My main thinking as I was doing this, and I'm ciera that this is, like, rotated. My main thinking was that as I was trying to sketch this out. So I think this is very similar to what you had. I wanted to look almost like a little schedule. Of today, this kind of thing. Like today, later this week. As Jeff described, I want to know. Next week. Next Friday. I can come to our school for next week. End. Friday. This is. And then for the actual information. I think there are way too many dollar signs. There's, like, four different. Values. For money. And I don't really know where to look. If the use case is. I want to know what our current jobs are. ciera I feel like my Internet is. I want to know what my upcoming jobs are. Been stuff like. That as well. Do we need to actually see what the grocery has and whatnot is. On particular screen. To see what the payout number is for anything that's overdue. The only thing that you need to see is the payout number. Information has already been entered. Thanks. So, as a chef, do you think in terms of, you know, how. There are people. And before tax. Right. So, as a chef, do you think about your payout or do you think about the total contract value? Because somebody was even like 100k salary from a big tech company is not going to tax salary. You got a contract from your company. What do you think it's about? The number that I'm going to get paid, I don't think about. Very different.  
Them: Celebration.  
Me: Is. A repeatable significant. But food costs are added, right? If you do a private event. And let's say that, I don't know, the event is like $4,000. And you get, like, 3,500. Do you think in terms of this party or support Alcala party or do you think in terms of this party is. Uncharted territory that no AI Is going to outsmart. A song that's never been done before in the world. So at our company, you get a $4,000 dinner. You get $3,400. In cash. Company. Which doesn't work, exactly. Love the idea of seeing. We have no and give a shit. And also the other thing is when you look at a contract, you might have a psychological. You know how most people, when they look at price. You're good at. People feel like it's. So, like, why would you show the lower contract? There's an argument for this to always like the top line amount. Because they are going to mentally factor it. This is what you receive. It should be right on there. Calculation there and in a dream world. Calculation. Number. Doesn't have to always. We will be eventually. Yeah. Because if I go to 10% or 5% or 20 finances that allow to do that. You're actively making an investment in the company through a deferred compensation. Program. So I think. If you have to choose one, I think it's more important to show the total value. That's mine opinion. I agree. And I think you can show what you'll get very quickly. It shows you this is a contract value, what you'll get. Plus reimbursements or whatever is like, obviously. We can show reimbursements into details screen, and we can also show it in a history screen, like, where you have the total of, like, your expected cash and everything. But I think on this screen where you're just looking at your upcoming job and the role of the price tag is there to let you know and have a valuation on how much worth of work am I doing? Next Friday. I think having one number is better than having two. On the screen. Do you think that that changes for overdue versus coming? Because, number two, you want to know how much money is coming to you that's overdue. Well, in chef's logic, like, $4,000 is coming to you. It's just 600 of those are in form of equity, which you don't care. A lot more education to do with the chefs at any of the contractors. Well, one way for that education to happen is through design. What am I working here is to drive home. This is where convenience and intuition is now. Less traditionally intuitive. Is not always the same as what from an opinionated standpoint, want to show up into people's face? So maybe it would make sense to show. What this means. Tie in the bonus feature of the screen where you see how much money you're expecting and all of that stuff. You see the pie chart that you're illustrating up there? Trying to do that or trying to educate everybody through. This. I think it would do a disservice to Division. If you're now reinforcing the idea that this contract is worth $3,400. Was. I was a little bit tunnel vision on this being functional as opposed to a hybrid of function and. You'd want to take advantage of this. You don't want to tell them that this contract is worth $3,400. Exactly. And every day. And they're like, oh, that's what education standpoint.  
Them: Every day.  
Me: Really? That's definitely our job. We will continue to do that. I want a person who never met us ever. Hey, check this out.  
Them: I want a person to never. Be meeting.  
Me: Yeah. One last thought. As before, you guys hop. I'm ciera I'm holding you guys to the last minute.  
Them: Teacher. It shows me every week how much the contract is and how much I get in cash and equity are going to go to this pie graph. They're like, whoa, that's cool. How do I get in that pie graph?  
Me: I think it's increasingly clear that the job of this green is different from the bulk edit. And what think could happen is that we make this green happen. And then you know how we need an admin interface where admin could do stuff? Where it's like the job there isn't is none of these things, but literally administratively to work on it like a spreadsheet.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: For bulk use case. Eventually we can just like, give chefs access. To their version of the admin view, which is a different thing. Like, if they want to do bulk. Administration. They could use that. But there's a different screen and a different experience from this, for which the job is, Can I go bowling next Friday?  
Them: Totally.  
Me: Admin. Yeah. Which is, like, we don't need to think as much about design for admin because it's pretty standard. Like, it's a table.  
Them: Yeah. And that's what I drew. What you just described is that screen.  
Me: It's not about pretty as much as it's about design for an admin page, it's more about, like, the nuances of workflow in terms of what needs to be aware.  
Them: Yeah, because it's not for the public. It's just for you. But then it's got to be a little bit user. It's got to be kind of pretty.  
Me: But that's about this kind of more emotional. What information do I need to see in order to feel good about my business?  
Them: Yeah. Right.  
Me: Okay? All right, I think we have solid ground s for this. I'm going to make, like, a higher, like, a more clear sketch of this green, and then we can align in the afternoon.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And very quickly. Can we move that up? By 30 minutes. Okay? And we'll make it.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Yeah. Okay? Perfect.  
Them: I have no problem with.  
Me: I will send an update to the sketch and then it will be great.  
Them: Or I guess it'd be 3:30 or 10.  
Me: If you have time before then to either refine it or think through some of the other sketches that would need to happen.  
Them: We had need to have done by then.  
Me: Which I don't think is a lot. I think this is the epicenter. Like, this is 80% of the thing. All right. Bye. Bye. It's 11.  
Them: Okay? Awesome.  
Me: All right. Here's my prompt for you. As a piece of work. That I want you to work on. That will actually be helpful. All right, here's one thing that will actually be extremely helpful if you could get ready. Either by yourself or by delegating to leave. As we move towards. Chiseling out and refining this one interface. It's going to be really important for us to have a realistic sense. Of what the data that come in will actually look like. So I want your help. To curate one set of sample schedule. For one of your chefs. It could be like I would just take a real example. Of one of your chefs that you feel is the most representative of the type of chef and the type of business that you want to continue to encourage more of. And then I want you to help me put together a spreadsheet. Or whatever format that makes sense to you. Where all the information for their upcoming clients are seen. So all the information that we would need for this page, including the dates of service, including the client information. Including the event type. The total contract value and all the things that will need to go into their invoice in order for the final invoice to be set. Actually, I take that back. Instead of using a future looking like the upcoming week. Use a history. So give me a history of. Let's just say two weeks of one chef. And all of the contracts that happened over the course of those two weeks. Including an all in one place, include the contract value, include their grocery costs, miscellaneous cost, as well as any other detail that we would need for this whole screen. To work. Basically the data that you would imagine being in a mock up of this flow. Does that make sense?
