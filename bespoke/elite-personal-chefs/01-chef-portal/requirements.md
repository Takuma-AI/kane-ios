# Chef Portal Requirements

## Core Problem
Lee spends 10+ hours weekly managing spreadsheets for chef payments and client relationships. This manual process creates bottlenecks and prevents scaling.

## Primary Workflows

### Weekly Payroll Pipeline
Transform the four-stage payment process from manual spreadsheet updates to visual pipeline:

1. **Unbilled** (red) - Job completed, awaiting invoice
2. **Billed** (yellow) - Invoice sent to client
3. **Client Paid** (green) - Payment received from client
4. **Chef Paid** - Payroll processed

Key capabilities:
- Visual kanban board for payment status
- One-click payroll calculation
- Bulk status updates
- Automatic commission calculations

### Client Health Monitoring
Prevent churn by tracking engagement:
- Dashboard showing last order date per client
- Automatic flagging of inactive clients (2+ weeks)
- Chef-client relationship mapping
- Proactive intervention triggers

### Business Intelligence
Real-time metrics replacing scattered spreadsheet data:
- Revenue rollups (weekly/monthly)
- Chef performance rankings
- Client lifetime value
- Commission tracking

## Technical Foundation

### Core Calculations
- Chef Payout = (Revenue - Food Cost - Misc Cost) × 0.8
- EPC Commission = Revenue × 0.2
- Chef Net = Chef Payout + Gratuity

### Success Metrics
- Reduce payroll processing from 10+ hours to <1 hour
- Eliminate manual calculation errors
- Enable real-time business visibility
- Create foundation for growth tools

## Future Vision
This portal becomes the platform for:
- Chef recruiting ("What's my life at EPC?")
- Client self-booking
- Automated invoicing
- Chef equity tracking
- Mobile earnings visibility

Transform spreadsheet management into strategic growth platform.
