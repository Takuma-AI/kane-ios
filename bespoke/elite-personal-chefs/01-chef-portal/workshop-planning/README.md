# Spreadsheet Automation Workshop

## Thursday, Week 2 - 2 Hours with Lee

### Purpose
Eliminate 10+ hours of weekly manual spreadsheet work by automating the Square → Spreadsheet payment pipeline.

### The Decision: Make.com
After evaluating options, Make.com provides the best balance:
- **$9/month** vs Zapier's $50+
- **Visual builder** Lee can understand and modify
- **Native Square + Sheets integration**
- **Room to grow** into other automations

### Current Pain (From Transcripts)
Lee's weekly process involves:
1. Reading payment emails from Square
2. Manual lookups across 55+ chef sheets
3. Checking for missed payments from previous weeks
4. Color coding (yellow = unpaid, green = paid)
5. Monday payroll calculations across all sheets
6. High error risk from manual data entry

### Workshop Plan

**Hour 1: Understand & Design**
- Map current workflow with real examples
- Design the automation flow visually
- Define business rules (commissions, splits, edges)

**Hour 2: Build & Test**
- Create Make.com workflow together
- Test with real payment scenarios
- Document for future modifications

### Deliverables
1. Working automation (Square → Sheets)
2. Lee can modify it independently
3. Payroll time: 10 hours → <1 hour
4. Foundation for future automations
