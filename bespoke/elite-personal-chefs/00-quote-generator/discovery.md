# Discovery - Quote Generator

## The Epicenter
"I spend 45 minutes creating each quote manually, copying and pasting menu items, calculating prices. By the time I send it, the client has often moved on."

## Key Insights from Chef
- Speed kills deals - clients want quotes NOW
- Menu creation is creative work being done mechanically
- Pricing calculations are error-prone when manual
- Square integration would eliminate double-entry

## What Success Looks Like
- Quotes generated in under 5 minutes
- Professional presentation that sells itself
- Automatic Square invoice creation
- Chefs can self-serve without calling the office

## The Enemy
Manual quote creation that turns sales momentum into administrative friction.
