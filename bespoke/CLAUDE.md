# Bespoke - Consulting Services

Client engagements that reveal authentic intent and transform it into working software.

## Core Behaviors

### When Client Presents a Problem
1. **Don't solve it yet** - Ask "What has the most energy for you about this?"
2. **Find the epicenter** - Keep asking until you hit the real struggle
3. **Check for existing solutions** - Search their current systems first
4. **Ship something today** - Even a small win creates momentum

### When Creating Documents
- **Seed folder first** - Dump raw context in `seed/` (gitignored)
- **Synthesize to permanence** - Extract patterns into committed docs
- **Make it executable** - Every document should enable action
- **Track the evolution** - Number engagements chronologically (00, 01, etc.)

## Engagement Structure

Each client has multiple engagements over time, numbered chronologically:

```
client-name/
├── 00-initial-project/      # First engagement
│   ├── seed/                # GITIGNORED - raw context dump
│   ├── discovery.md         # Refined insights from seed
│   ├── requirements.md      # What we're building
│   ├── service-agreement.md # Commercial terms
│   └── invoice.md           # Payment record
├── 01-next-project/         # Second engagement
│   └── [same structure]
└── client-os-placeholder/   # Vision for their future OS
    └── sketch.md
```

Each engagement operates as its own complete cycle, inheriting learnings from previous work.

## Discovery Workflow

### Step 1: Collect Raw Context
```bash
mkdir 01-project-name/seed
# Add meeting transcripts, voice notes, screenshots
# Don't clean or organize - just dump everything
```

### Step 2: Find the Epicenter
Ask these questions in order:
1. "What has the most energy for you right now?"
2. "What would create relief if it were solved?"
3. "Tell me about the last time this frustrated you."
4. "Who else feels this? Can you name them?"

### Step 3: Synthesize to Documents
- `discovery.md` - The refined insights
- `requirements.md` - What we're actually building
- `service-agreement.md` - Scope, timeline, investment
- Delete or archive seed folder when done

## Delivery Philosophy

### Teach, Don't Do
We're not hired hands. We're capability builders:
- Show the thinking, not just the output
- Document the process, not just the result
- Enable independence, not dependence
- Build their confidence alongside their product

### Progress Over Perfection
Ship understanding when it crystallizes:
- Small insights compound
- Quick wins build momentum
- Real feedback beats speculation
- Movement reveals direction

### Documentation as Product
Every artifact is executable:
- Strategies that can be implemented
- Frameworks that can be reused
- Patterns that can be recognized
- Decisions that can be referenced

## Working Rules

### Always Ship Something Today
- Even if it's just a cleaned spreadsheet
- Even if it's a single working button
- Momentum beats perfection
- Real usage reveals real needs

### Teach Through Doing
- Don't build for them, build with them
- Show your screen, explain your thinking
- Leave them capable of continuing alone
- Success = they don't need us anymore

### Document for Action
Every document must answer "So what?":
- Bad: "The system uses Rails"
- Good: "Run `rails server` to start the app"
- Bad: "Consider user experience"
- Good: "Test with 3 real users before shipping"

## Quality Checklist

✓ Client can explain what we built to others
✓ They made at least one change themselves
✓ Something shipped within first week
✓ They know how to continue without us
✓ Energy increased rather than depleted

✗ We're the only ones who understand it
✗ It's impressive but not useful
✗ They need us for every change
✗ Complexity increased without value
✗ They feel overwhelmed, not empowered

## The Engagement Arc

### Discovery Phase
**Raw → Refined → Ready**

1. **Seed Collection** (in `seed/` folder - gitignored)
   - Meeting transcripts, voice notes, screenshots
   - Spreadsheet exports, existing documentation
   - Stream of consciousness, whiteboard photos
   
2. **Synthesis** (creates permanent artifacts)
   - Extract patterns from the mess
   - Find the epicenter of energy
   - Crystallize requirements
   - Document the authentic struggle

3. **Shaping** (defines the work)
   - Service agreement with clear scope
   - Technical requirements
   - Success metrics
   - Timeline and investment

### Building Phase
Ship first progress. Real usage teaches what theory cannot.

### Evolution Phase
Systematic refinement based on reality, not speculation.

## Remember

We don't have clients. We have partners whose vision we're privileged to polish.

Every engagement is an opportunity to help someone discover what they're truly capable of creating.

The work already exists within them. We just help it emerge.

Be the whetstone. Apply pressure with patience. Reveal what's already there.
