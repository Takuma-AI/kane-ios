# What Made 37signals' Early Consulting Click: A Distillation

## The Core Formula (2002)

### They Led with Proof, Not Promise
- **40% Sales Increase** - Achieved for an e-tailer
- **$1MM More Ad Revenue** - For a service provider  
- **66% Faster Load Time** - Delivered for a tech e-tailer

Before philosophy, before process - results. Named clients, specific metrics, undeniable outcomes.

### They Were Deliberately Small
"We're a small, honest, agile team of experts with tons of experience"

Not "we scale." Not "we have resources." They made smallness their strength:
- Personal attention to every client
- 100% client references (everyone would vouch)
- Direct access to the experts doing the work

### They Had One Obsession
"Our obsession with simplicity and clarity in interface design"

Not full service. Not comprehensive solutions. One thing done exceptionally:
- Simplicity
- Clarity  
- Usability

Everything else was noise they deliberately ignored.

## The Client Filter (Sharp and Unapologetic)

### Who They Wanted
"Smart clients who understand that it's the customer, not org-charts or office politics, who matters most"

They pre-qualified through language:
- If you care about internal politics, we're not for you
- If you don't understand customer focus, move on
- If this sounds good, "get in touch"

### The Confidence Play
"These clients are hard to find, so when we get them we treat them well"

They positioned good clients as scarce, making prospects feel special for qualifying. Classic positioning: we don't need you, but if you're right for us, you'll get exceptional treatment.

## The Credibility Stack

### Named Validation
- "Masters par excellence of HTMLinimalism" - Fresh Styles for Web Designers author
- Jakob Nielsen linking from usability.com
- Yahoo's Pick of the Year

Not testimonials - third-party recognition from authorities their prospects already respected.

### Media Proof
"New York Times, Washington Post, Times of London, FOX news"

They didn't say "featured in" - they just listed where. Let prospects assume the best.

### Concrete Capabilities

Three clear offerings, each with tangible outcomes:

1. **Redesign Your Site** - "Make customers happy"
2. **Analyze Usability** - "Use right away"  
3. **Workshop Training** - "Register now" ($295 before Oct 11)

Not "we provide web services" but specific interventions with clear next steps.

## What They Didn't Do (Equally Important)

### No Process Porn
No methodology diagrams, no framework explanations, no "our unique 7-step process." They showed results and let those speak.

### No Team Page
"Elite team of experts" was enough. No bios, no headshots, no "meet the team." The work was the credential.

### No Service Packages
No bronze/silver/gold. No retainers. Project work with clear outcomes.

### No Technology Focus
They barely mentioned technical capability. It was assumed. They sold business outcomes, not technical expertise.

## The Voice That Cut Through

### Short, Punchy, Memorable
- "We deliver results"
- "We can redesign your site"
- "Join us for a workshop"

Subject-verb-object. No subordinate clauses. No hedging.

### Educational Without Lecturing
- "Top 10 reasons to hire 37signals" 
- "The buzz about 37signals"
- White papers (Contingency Design, Design Not Found)

They taught through showing, not preaching.

### Personality Without Performance
- Honest about being small
- Clear about what they didn't do
- Confident without arrogance

## The Translation to Exordi: Amplification, Not Automation

Where 37signals obsessed over simplicity in web design, Exordi could obsess over:

**Human amplification through AI** - Not replacing Carlo, but creating 10x Carlo

The parallel positioning:
- Small team of AI integration experts
- Obsessed with preserving human agency while amplifying capacity
- Working with leaders who understand AI is a tool, not a replacement
- Proving it through specific amplification metrics:
  - "10x faster research synthesis"
  - "5x more strategic options explored"
  - "100% human decision ownership"

### The Anti-Pattern They Avoid
Just as 37signals rejected "full service," Exordi rejects "full automation":
- No agent armies
- No human replacement
- No decision delegation

Instead: Systematic amplification of human judgment through AI partnership.

### The Client Filter
"We work with leaders who want to be 10x more capable, not leaders who want to delegate thinking to machines."

### The Proof Structure
Before/After amplification metrics:
- Research that took days → now hours
- Decisions based on 3 options → now 30
- One person's bandwidth → small team's output

## The Essence

37signals succeeded because they:
1. **Picked one hill** (simplicity) and owned it completely
2. **Pre-filtered clients** through sharp positioning  
3. **Led with proof**, not philosophy
4. **Made their constraints** (size) into advantages
5. **Spoke plainly** about complex things

They didn't try to be everything. They were exactly one thing, done exceptionally well, for exactly the right people.

That clarity is what clicked.
