# Exordi × Takuma

## The Vision You've Mapped

You want Exordi to become the leading content production platform in the world — where every single content requirement flows through your ecosystem.

Your growth plan laid it out clearly: You need passionate creators in every key city who create content the Exordi way. And you need revenue to flow without your personal involvement in every deal.

You've proven the model works. The demand is there. But right now, scaling means replicating yourself — your eye for matching creators to brands, your ability to spot when a brief will fail, your instinct for which passion fits which purpose. 

This isn't just about automating busywork. It's about translating what makes you special into the product experience itself. Real progress means the platform embodies your DNA.

## What's Actually Blocking Scale

You've mapped out Project Chimera with every feature the platform needs. City search, expense fields, better templates. All necessary. All buildable.

But the platform doesn't know what you know. It can't recognize when a creator's passion aligns with a brand's need. It can't make the judgment calls that turn commercial requirements into human connection.

Right now you're writing feature specs like you're briefing a dev shop. But the difference between a platform that processes orders and one that creates magic isn't in the feature list. It's in whether the product carries your DNA.

You can't spec your way into that — even when you bring engineering in-house. You have to learn to be a product leader, driving from vision not requirements.

## What We Build Together

This is a transformation project, not an outsourced dev engagement. We're not here to be your engineering team. We're here to empower you to amplify your judgment into the product experience. 

Together we'll:
- Build a working foundation you can ship and learn from immediately
- Distill your manual oversight into repeatable product experiences
- Move you from spec-writing to product leadership
- Translate your nuance and direction into something others can build on

A future CTO might rebuild everything we create. That's fine. The value isn't in the code — it's in unblocking your progress now and learning to embody yourself in product form.

## Why Us, Why Now

We just transformed Chef Austin from drowning in manual operations to automated revenue in two weeks. He'd failed with technical teams for years, thinking in features not experiences. We taught him to see his product as an embodiment of his expertise. Now he drives his own development with clarity.

We understand your business — Neal is already an investor in Exordi. We see what you're building and why it matters.

Our incentives align with yours: we only succeed when you ship and when agencies generate revenue without you. No long contracts, no ongoing dependency. Just transformation and results.

## The Investment

$15,000 total, tied to real progress:
$5,000 to begin  
$5,000 when working MVP ships (target: 4 weeks)  
$5,000 when first agency generates revenue without you

The 4-week target keeps us focused on what ships and what transforms, not what could be perfect.

## Ready to Drive

Hiring can multiply your impact. Fundraising can accelerate your growth. But neither is required for the progress you're seeking.

You could wait for the perfect engineer, hoping they extract what makes you special. You could raise funds to hire a team, still facing the same translation challenge.

Or you could spend 4 weeks learning to embody yourself in the product while shipping real progress.

The platform processes orders. What it needs is your soul.

Let's translate that together.
