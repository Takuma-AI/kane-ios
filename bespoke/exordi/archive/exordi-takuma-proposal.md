# Exordi × Takuma

## Your Vision

Every single content requirement will flow through your platform — not because you built infrastructure, but because passionate creators produce content that actually connects. You've already proven this with your clients. Time to make it repeatable.

## The Problem We're Hearing

The current product stops working the moment reality gets complex. Morocco deal lost because of a login issue. Melbourne deal lost because you can't search by city. Clients brief incorrectly because there's no expense field, no template, no guidance.

Some of this is mechanical — missing features you've already identified. But underneath: clients don't know what makes a good brief. Without you translating their needs, outputs fail and they blame Exordi. You recognize when Charysse's artistic sense fits Cambridge Satchel. You prevent failures before they happen.

The platform handles the basics. Your judgment handles everything that matters. Neither is in the product yet.

## Make Real Progress Without Waiting on Anyone

Yes, the right hire can transform a startup. But it's not a silver bullet. Even the best hire needs a foundation to build on — systems that embody your judgment, processes that encode your approach. Without this, they're guessing at what you would do instead of amplifying what you've proven works.

Morocco went off-platform. Melbourne couldn't find creators. Clients brief incorrectly. Not because the platform lacks features — because it lacks you. Build this foundation now. Then anyone you hire can truly scale your vision.

## What We Build Together

Your Chimera specs have the mechanics mapped. We can build those. But we'll also discover the magic you haven't captured yet — the subtle patterns in how you match creators, the questions that reveal what clients really need, the judgment calls that prevent failures.

Together we take your vision from sketches to working product. All for a clear outcome: An agency onboards and generates stable revenue without your involvement.

## The Investment

$15,000 total, tied to real progress:
$5,000 to begin  
$5,000 when working MVP ships (target: 4 weeks)  
$5,000 when first agency generates revenue without you  
We succeed only when you succeed. The 4-week target keeps us focused on what actually ships, not what could be perfect.

## Why This Works Now

You have the infrastructure. You've proven the model. You know what good looks like.

The only step left: teaching the product to see what you see.

No hiring required. No fundraising needed.  
Just your judgment, amplified.
