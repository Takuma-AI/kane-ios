Subject: Week 29: Good revenue + marginal pivot
Date: July 26, 2025 at 10:28:08 PDT

This week was defined by a single, overriding theme: a good influx of high-value enterprise leads and a number of small tech businesses. The system was stress-tested, and while it generated significant wins, it also exposed critical failures.
Key Updates & Wins:

Fortune 500 Tech company: This is now our #1 priority lead. Successfully navigated the initial 2 calls and have deployed a professional, high-value, tiered proposal. We have moved from a cold contact to an active pilot program negotiation with a senior director.
Pipeline Saturation: We successfully executed meetings with three other high-potential targets that I acquired during Cannes Lions: Movers+Shakers, DNY Agency, and Joseph Ribkoff. 
Strategic Clarity: I have made a final, decisive slight pivot on our product strategy. The "Managed Marketplace" model is confirmed. I previously tried to skip this step and go to full automation immediately but it surfaced a few issues, mentioned below. 
Secured 4 new clients and 1 return client this month, driving $26k in new revenue. With our two monthly recurring clients, this month we achieved a total of $37k.
Two clients have signed up for a monthly subscription and they’ve collectively spent $11.3k in campaign value. The remainder has come from pay-as-you-go clients. 

Critical System Failures Identified:

The Morocco Deal: Last week I took a beak and went to Morocco. During that week, I got an in-bound deal and told the client to use the platform. Everything went smoothly except when we had a log in issue so the creator and client took negotiations off platform. Rightly so, the creator and client got on a call to discuss the project, the creator realised a higher budget was necessary and proposed his quote. The client accepted which is all great. However, this negotiation means I cannot take our usual platform fees. Therefore, before architecting a new solution, I will operate a managed marketplace. 

The Spin Brands Failure: An agency called Spin Brands, to whom I demoed the platform, had an immediate need; they required a creator in Melbourne. However, the platform is not equipped to handle city specific locations. As a result we couldn’t cater to this. The inability to source a creator in Perth exposed a critical weakness in our supply chain. This validates our new mission to build a scalable Creator Acquisition Engine through the partnership with a new creator community called "Escapism".

The weekly updates fell through for a bit, apologise, we back in business. 

Best, 

Carlo

Hi everyone, 

Sorry for my poor attendance to the calls but this week and some of the next are filled with events. 

Anyways, I wanted to share with you this month's edit of The Exordian. It's our curated newsletter where we talk about interesting things we've seen in the industry but also include our company updates. It's something we send to current investors, potential ones and other interested people. Then we also send a version without company updates to all our clients. 

Have a great weekend, 

Thanks!

Hi everyone, 

I hope you all had a great week! 

It is the end of the week but this week also marked the end of Q1 and the start of Q2. As the month as also come to an end, I'm sending over our monthly edition of The Exordian which includes company updates. 

We closed Q1 with $56k in revenue and $69k in expenses, bringing us to -$14k in EBITDA. The drop was due to two primary reasons: 
We've put into development the new platform so we've had to pay for extra workforce. This is a clear investment for us since it will automate a lot of the manual process we are currently doing and will directly impact how quickly we can scale 
Lawyer + accountants. We had some difficulties with an an agency that was trying to get the best of us, incorrectly. It's now getting sorted but it annoyingly resulted in some pretty high legal expenses. 
I look forward to catching up with each of you for more in depth chats so we can smash through Q2. 

Thank you! 
Best.

Subject: Good stuff, but it needs to be more
Date: August 29, 2025 at 07:52:56 PDT
To: neal.sales@techstars.com

Hi everyone, 

Hope you all had a great week! 

Things are going well with Exordi: 
At the Cannes Lions event I met with the founder of Movers + Shakers, an agency owned by the large group called Stagwell. We just confirmed a project together with another 2 being planned 
Back in May (I think) I got asked to apply for a pitch competition held by Raw Ventures. I told them I wasn't interested in raising but they insisted I applied; so I did and turns out I 'got selected'. Apparently, 8 out of 400 applicants get in (ok bragging rights) and you can win €10k for best pitch and also raise money there. It's cool because they pay for flights and hotel. Anyways, I need to figure out what story to tell. 
On the 'bad side': 
I had a client ask a creator if they could “invoice directly”. I’m not sure if they did it trying to cheeky or just wanting to be more efficient. On the good side, the creator told me. Also it was to add a few more things to the brief, and this is a feature I’ve put in development so it’ll be solved 

When I say things are good but they could be better, this is what I mean: 

Exordi has been quietly powering agencies to cater to some of the world’s biggest brands. Willingness to pay is very clear. However, Exordi has operated in the shadows for a long time and it's this good supplier of content creators... 

While it still needs to do operate covertly until the platform is autonomous, I believe it needs to move on to be the leading content production figure in the world. I’d use a potential raise (or figure out other financing tools) to create:
•⁠  ⁠World class content creation course (creator acquisition and visibility)
•⁠  ⁠Most elite creator network in the world like RedBull (status and performance)
•⁠  ⁠A powerful campaign creation and management platform for any business (operational and revenue efficiency) - improving on the current one 


I don't have particular asks, just want to keep you updated with the motion but I'm always more than happy to chat so feel free to find a slot here :) 

Thank you and have a great weekend! 
Best.

Hello hello

I hope you had a great month :) 

April has flown by for me, perhaps it's because I got to spend two weeks in Mexico City which I reset my US visa. It's such an incredible city, the food, the people, the colours, the culture, all of it is just amazing. Naturally I made my list of favourite spots, you can see them here if you ever need to go. 

Anyways, about Exordi, I kept it quite light since you all got the weekly updates throughout the month so I had less to say. April was mainly geared to outbound sales and it looks like we're reaping some rewards this month, so fingers crossed. 

As always, the document is attached below. Hope you enjoy! 

Thank you, 
All the best.

Hi everyone, 

Hope you've been having a great summer! I'm back home in Italy but working from here which is a pretty solid blend. Anyways, here's some thrilling updates to end your week: 

The good stuff: 
2025 Revenue to date $138k from 9 clients, 90% of which have returned multiple times 
Since launching the new platform in June, exordi has processed 14 campaigns which have highlighted some key improvements to pursue that I'm very excited about. 
Super close to starting a paid pilot with a Fortune 500 tech company - just navigating the contractual bureaucracy, as soon as it's signed I will let you know who it is. 

The learnings: 
Expenses are $190k so I'm down around $50k why? There was a $30k investment in the new platform and SF living costs during the three months of Techstars tallied up pretty high. I've since cut a lot of costs so I should recover these $50k soon. 
A client got upset because they briefed the creator incorrectly so the output wasn't what they wanted - well actually, the user got in trouble with their boss because they presented the wrong video and passed the blame over to us. I have all the conversations showing that the briefing process was incorrect on their part but it of course feels a bit crap that a client got upset. This has shown that I need to implement a brief template in our platform that clients can download and fill out if they're unsure
Whilst learning that there improvements to make to the platform before it can go to market and scale is great, it's also annoying because it's a delay. The capex isn't a problem, I can repay the investment within 3 months through current clients, it's more so that I was so sure the platform was ready to launch fully but nope, back to the lab. 

Asks: 
I've been structuring an idea for growth, it's a curved ball, but I'm pretty certain it can work if pulled off correctly. Think Masterclass but for content creation. 

There's no great course out there to become a really good content creator and yet content is dominating our ecosystem and everyone wants to do it. Yes there's university courses but they're dated and there's famous filmmakers that have their own courses but it's a single person teaching it. 

I've taken inspiration from Augment MBA to create a world class creator course that will: 
give me a constant funnel of new creators 
give me a new revenue stream 
provide great marketing firepower 
So the ask is, has anyone got experience in education content production or would be open to have chat about this idea? 

Thank you, ciaooo 
Best.

Hi everyone, 

Here we go - first weekly updated coming your way. 

However, we did it with the Exordi twist, so you're getting a PDF rather than an email stacked with text. With this being the first one, I wanted to lay out my approach to future weekly updates. As a 'thinker,' I work best with blocks and dividing big goals into small, actionable steps; therefore, I focus on three key areas to drive progress and hit our OKRs. After those, I go into what's going well, what could be better and asks + gives (always super receptive for feedback!!) 

Before diving into it, there's an endless list of shoutouts for people I'm so thankful for. Of course the core Techstars team: Neal, Chloe, Sylvia and George because without them none of this would be possible. I'm living in a start-up dream because of you guys so thank you. Also a massive thank you to my cohort and to the speakers this week, especially Mert, you guys are pushing me to be the best version of myself and that's worth everything. 

Below is the structure of my updates and attached is the PDF. 

Structure: 
1. Intro: summary of key points
2. Overarching OKRs:
   • Clients: Exordi's primary focus and most valuable resource
   • Product: Progress in development
   • Growth: Insights into increasing deal flow
3. What we're excited about
4. What's been challenging
5. Asks

Thank you all so much, 
All the best.

Hi everyone, 

I hope you all had a great week! 

I sure did, we kicked off the first week of Mentor Madness and it was crazy. Huge thank you to the Techstars team, especially Chloe, and all the mentors for giving us your precious time! It's massively appreciated. 

I also want to give a particular thank you to Ankur for helping me find my focus on the product once more and Sanjeev for some incredible insights into platform design. 

From a client point of view (the real sauce) as lot less has happened other than a new brief in by Ford. The decline in customers is definitely a constant nag but I understand the work I need to do to refine my ICP so I can grow faster afterwards - the famous slow down to sleep up (although I don't really like slow). 

Anyways, please see the PDF below (much shorter than last week). I'm always available to answer or go through anything and especially to help out on anything I can. 

Have a great weekend, 
Appreciate you all x

Hi hi, happy Friday! 

So, I'm changing up the style of the weekly updates and I've condensed into this 1 minute video. 

I would like to give a massive thank you to Liana Habitch who spent 40 minutes me on a call for the third time throughout this program. Her help has been of incredible value and has allowed me to understand a lot more the overarching approach that I have towards Exordi and everything that stems from it (content, outbound sales, how we structure our creator meet-ups). Thanks to our chat, I clearly identified how thoughtfulness, curation and connection are key elements of Exordi and how I can always weave these 3 key words in any piece of content I do. 

At a deeper level, it means that I take the time to carefully plan before taking action. Yes, it means I might be slower towards action but it means that when I do start, I move fast and with precision. A style that I resonate with a lot. 

Anyways, I hope you've all had a great week and enjoy your weekend! 

Thank you, 
Best.

Ciao, 

It's been a solid week! Before I dig in, massive appreciation to Alex Nativelle for sitting down with me for 1h to work on Exordi's storyline, blending passion into the mix. Also to Neal SG for taking the time to get on multiple calls with me and refine various approaches! 

Anyways, attached is the nice PDF but in short: 
3 new clients this month 
Currently averaging $21k a month in revenue 
Stuck on scaling - going IRL 
I'm reaching out to some of you individually for things but if you have any thoughts/idea, please ping me I'm always around! 


Thank you and have a great weekend :)

Date: April 11, 2025 at 16:17:07 PDT

Hi everyone, 

We're a full month into Techstars which is pretty insane considering that not long ago I applied to the program with absolutely zero expectations of getting in but hey ho. 

Anyways, big thanks to Ferrona this week she's been of incredible help. I've also reached out to a few of you personally for intros and I thank each and everyone of you a lot!! 

It's been a good week, establishing a lot of clarity on who feels the problem we're solving the most. This has had a positive domino effect, allowing me to get an immediate start on sales and start thinking about GTM. 

I've been playing with the idea of creating content for LinkedIn but I'm not sure where to start (how ironic) mainly because I cringe at the idea of making content about myself so I'll work on a solution. 

Anyways, please see the updates below - creativity was lacking apologise. 

Have a great weekend everyone ♥️

Thank you, 
Best.
