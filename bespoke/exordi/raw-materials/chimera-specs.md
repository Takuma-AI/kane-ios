Project Chimera 

Project Chimara is our working document to refine the briefing phase from start to finish. These changes are based on feedback and observations from clients over the most recent jobs. 





Core changes

Revised brief creation and approval process
Brief Management that includes Guest Invites and Change Order Requests
Mobile responsive chat function that clients and guests can log into.



1: Briefing Phase

Client has a clear budget and brief 

Client comes to exordi 
They navigate to ‘Create A Brief’ 
Everything remains as is, except for: 
Above the Brief Name we place a field for ‘add collaborators’ so the relevant parties can be notified. 
Below the Budget Field we insert a link to the price menu e.g. “Unsure? Check out our pricing guide” 
‘Describe Your Brief’ changes to ‘Upload Your Brief’. NB link to “Need help? Try our template brief”
Remove the ‘Add Attachments’ later in the brief 
Move ‘Deadline’ to front page 
Location search -> we add city specification
The brief becomes a 3 screen process 
Below the budget tab, there needs to be an ‘expense’ tab e.g. “budget for expenses?” -> if yes, tab opens up and client specifies expenses threshold. If not, tab remains black. N.B link “Unsure? Check out this guide”
Client inserts budget and continues with briefing. Selects creators and sends them the brief. 






Providing ‘enough’ information -> we provide our template brief 

At the very least, this is providing content examples of what the client is after so the creator can get an idea. For example, the Workmate job; brief featured example of walking interview with teleprompter. Ideal scenarios include: 
About the company: target audience, brand guidelines, competitors etc… -> things that should only be specified once or need to be in the brand profile so creators can see the visual references. 
Supporting PDF attached with script with shotlist 
Basics: deliverables, duration, format, destination of the content, captions or no captions. Does the content have to fit multiple channels? 
Content examples with moodboards, colour tones and visual references 
Location inspiration/references, if necessary 
Is there a need for talent? If so, is there a preference for how they look? 
Key objective of the content 


By the end of the briefing phase, the client selects desired creators and sends them the brief. Each creator receives a: 
Fully formed brief with enough information to perfectly understand what the shoot entails 
A budget that shows 60% of what the client specified. 
Clear understanding if there’s extra budget for expenses or not

End of Briefing Phase: Creator to respond
View updated briefing design here - ignore minor differences such as arrows and text, focus instead on the fields shown e.g. “Budget For Expenses”



2: Response Phase 
THIS PHASE REMAINS AS IS WITH THE ONLY EXCEPTION THAT THE CREATOR SEES THE BUDGET FOR THE SHOOT + THE BUDGET FOR EXPENSES IS APPLICABLE 

Situation: creator has received a clear brief with a clear budget and potential expense coverage. NB if the client has selected 5 creators, the budget 

The Creator needs to assess the brief and decide if they want to: 
Accept the brief as is 
Decline the brief entirely 

By the end of the Response Phase, the creator has assessed the brief, the budget (of which they see 60%) and expenses. The Creator can accept the brief as is or decline it.

End of Response Phase: Client to select creator


3: Creator Confirmation
Situation: the client has now received acceptance from the creators they sent the brief to and selects their favourites - this remains as it. However, as soon as the client chooses the creator(s), 4 core events are triggered:

To confirm the brief, we provide a ‘Checkout’ for 50% of the total sum. This can be paid either by card or by triggering an invoice (https://stripe.com/gb/invoicing) where the client inputs all their necessary information. This updates the brief automatically to Brief Confirmed
A brief ID is created. This is fundamental as it’s the identifier for the info stored in this brief. It will allow invited guests to log into this brief and see the details and chat with the creator
The chat function specific to that brief (stays as is)
A ledger that stores any changes to the brief and the revised fees (see Change Order Request below) 


By the end of this process: the job is confirmed, the client has paid 50% of the job upfront, and the ‘management’ part of the brief is created = chat, ledger and possibility for Change Order Requests 



4: Brief Management
Situation: the job is active, the brief is stored under ‘My Briefs’ and it has a unique ID number. Within the brief page, clients can: 

Invite collaborators
Simple ‘add email’ input field at the top, similar to how Notion does it. Client inputs guest email and the guest: 
Receives an email notifying them about the invite 
The email includes the Brief ID and a link to join
Clicks on the link and is prompted to ‘log in’ to the brief 
Can access brief details and the chat
Receives the same notifications as the ‘main client’ (the one who created the brief) such as: new chat messages, updates to brief progress, any changes in deliverables (see below) etc…


Change Order Requests
Client wants to modify the deliverables. Usually asking for more content, asking for RAWs or asking for a different format. 
Within the Brief Page, the client can click on a button called ‘Change Order Request’ 
The button opens a form that allows the client to request a change/addition in deliverables. If it’s a multi creator job, then the client needs to pick which creator to send this to
Form is sent to the creator(s) where they see 60% of the total proposed. The creator can accept the COR or reject it. 
All approved changes are noted in the Ledger for the brief. 

Updates
Currently, only clients can handle the updates in the brief, we need to extend this to creators. They will go as follows: 
Team created - as is
Brief confirmed - when the client pays the 50% upfront invoice 
Content Shot - as is
Content Edited - as it 
Content approved - triggers payment link for remaining 50% + any fees from CORs.
Payment sent - once the final payment is made 

N.B. notifications via email must be sent for each step. 


Please view the Guest Invited and COR management here from a client POV. 
See the COR management from a creator POV here - note the button “update brief progress”, this serves as a ‘reminder’ for the creators to navigate to the brief progress and update it. So if they click on it, it needs to take them to the brief updates.
