# How Exordi Currently Operates (Evidence-Based)

## Client Acquisition

**How clients come in**:
- Through Carlo's personal network ("all my clients I've personally met through events, referrals")
- Occasional inbound deals (Morocco example)
- Demo to agencies who have immediate needs (Spin Brands example)

## The Brief Process (What Actually Happens)

### 1. Client Has a Need
**Evidence**: Clients approach with vague requirements like "content for our new product"

### 2. Carlo's Manual Intervention
**Evidence**: "The current platform requires my personal oversight to ensure good outcomes"

**What this oversight includes** (from failures when absent):
- Ensuring brief has correct information (client brief failure)
- Matching creator location availability (Melbourne failure)  
- Keeping negotiation on platform (Morocco failure)

### 3. Information Required for Brief
**From Chimera specs showing what's needed**:
- Company context: target audience, brand guidelines, competitors
- Content specifics: deliverables, duration, format, destination
- Creative direction: moodboards, color tones, visual references
- Logistics: location, talent needs, timeline
- Budget: creative fee plus expenses

### 4. Creator Selection
**Current process**:
- Platform shows creators to client
- Client selects who to brief
- Creators see 60% of client budget
- Creators accept or decline

### 5. Payment Structure
**Current**:
- 40% platform fee
- Manual payment processing (being automated in Chimera)
- Issues with payment timing (50% upfront being added)

## Current Platform Capabilities

**What it CAN do**:
- Show creator portfolios
- Basic brief creation
- Connect clients and creators

**What it CAN'T do** (from Chimera additions):
- Handle city-specific search
- Manage multiple stakeholders
- Process change orders
- Track expenses separately
- Automate payments
- Enable creator status updates

## Operational Challenges

**Daily firefighting**:
- Clients briefing incorrectly
- Creators and clients going off-platform
- Scope changes mid-project
- Budget negotiations
- Location matching

**Resource constraints**:
- Outsourced dev team too expensive
- 95% creator rejection rate
- Every transaction needs Carlo's time

## Revenue Flow

**Current metrics** (from updates):
- ~$30-50k monthly revenue
- ~20% margins when operational  
- 40% platform fees on successful transactions
- Lost fees when deals go off-platform

## Creator Management

**Vetting process**:
- Manual review by Carlo
- 95% rejection rate
- No systematic onboarding
- Limited to Carlo's network reach

**Active management**:
- Carlo knows who's available
- Carlo knows who's where
- Carlo matches style to brief
- No systematic tracking

## What's Being Done Manually

**From Q1 update**: "automate a lot of the manual process we are currently doing"

**Specific manual tasks** (inferred from Chimera fixes):
1. Coordinating between multiple client stakeholders
2. Calculating and tracking expenses
3. Managing change requests
4. Processing payments
5. Updating project status
6. Providing brief templates/guidance

## The Core Operating Reality

Every successful transaction flows through Carlo personally. The platform provides infrastructure but Carlo provides:
- Trust that keeps deals on platform
- Judgment that prevents brief failures
- Knowledge of creator availability/location
- Relationships that generate clients

Without Carlo's active involvement, deals either fail (Melbourne), go off-platform (Morocco), or produce wrong outputs (client brief failure).
