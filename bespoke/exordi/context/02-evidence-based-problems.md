# Evidence-Based Problems (No Inference)

## Brief Creation Problems

**Evidence**: "A client got upset because they briefed the creator incorrectly so the output wasn't what they wanted" - August Update

**What's Missing** (from Chimera specs showing gaps):
- Brief templates for clients who don't know how to brief
- Collaborator management across client teams
- Expense budget specification
- City-specific location search
- Change order request system
- Creator status updates

## Platform Limitations

**Evidence from Failures**:
1. **Location Matching**: "The platform is not equipped to handle city specific locations" - Melbourne deal lost
2. **Login Issues**: Platform login failure caused Morocco deal to go off-platform
3. **Direct Circumvention**: "I had a client ask a creator if they could 'invoice directly'" - August Update

## Operational Dependencies

**Evidence**: 
- "We've had to pay for extra workforce... to automate a lot of the manual process we are currently doing" - Q1 Update
- "I've outgrown the outsourced team. They are quoting me the most expensive solutions" - Growth Plan
- "I need to hire internal tech talent to oversee this" - Growth Plan

## Scale Blockers

**Direct Quotes**:
- "The current platform requires my personal oversight to ensure good outcomes. This is not a scalable model." - Growth Plan
- "All my clients I've personally met through events, referrals etc..." - Growth Plan
- "95% rejection rate" for creators - Implied from Academy solution

- Change order request forms
- 50% upfront payment automation
- Brief ID system for tracking
- Chat function for communication

**But None Address**: How to ensure clients provide correct information in the first place
