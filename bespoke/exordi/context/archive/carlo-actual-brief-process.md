# Carlo's Actual Brief Process - From Evidence

Based on concrete evidence from documents, here's what Carlo actually does in the manual brief process:

## Before the Brief - Personal Network

**Evidence**: "All my clients I've personally met through events, referrals etc..."

**What Carlo Does**:
- Meets clients at events personally
- Builds trust through face-to-face interaction
- Gets referrals from existing network
- Understands their real needs through conversation

## Brief Creation - Translation Layer

**Evidence**: "A client got upset because they briefed the creator incorrectly so the output wasn't what they wanted"

**What Carlo Does**:
1. Takes vague client input
2. Asks clarifying questions (not documented but implied)
3. Translates into creator-readable requirements
4. Adds missing context from experience

**Evidence of What's Missing Without Carlo**:
- Target audience clarity
- Brand guidelines
- Specific deliverables format
- Location requirements
- Talent preferences
- Budget for expenses

## Creator Selection - Context Knowledge

**Evidence**: "An agency called Spin Brands had an immediate need; they required a creator in Melbourne. However, the platform is not equipped to handle city specific locations."

**What Carlo Does**:
- Knows which creators are in which cities
- Knows who's currently available
- Knows who fits the brief style
- Matches personality to client needs

## Budget Negotiation - Making It Work

**Evidence**: "The creator realised a higher budget was necessary and proposed his quote. The client accepted which is all great. However, this negotiation means I cannot take our usual platform fees."

**What Carlo Does**:
- Mediates between client budget and creator needs
- Finds creative solutions to gaps
- Adjusts scope to fit budget
- Handles expense discussions

## During Production - Active Management

**Evidence**: "Currently, only clients can handle the updates in the brief, we need to extend this to creators"

**What Carlo Does**:
- Tracks progress manually
- Communicates updates between parties
- Handles change requests
- Manages scope creep

## Quality Control - Prevention

**Evidence**: "This has shown that I need to implement a brief template in our platform that clients can download and fill out if they're unsure"

**What Carlo Does**:
- Reviews briefs before they go to creators
- Catches missing information
- Prevents mismatched expectations
- Ensures deliverable clarity

## The Invisible Work

Based on the problems being solved by Chimera, Carlo also:

### Manages Multiple Stakeholders
**Evidence**: "Above the Brief Name we place a field for 'add collaborators'"
- Currently coordinates between multiple client team members manually

### Handles Financial Complexity
**Evidence**: "Below the budget tab, there needs to be an 'expense' tab"
- Negotiates expense coverage separately from creative fees

### Prevents Platform Circumvention
**Evidence**: "I had a client ask a creator if they could 'invoice directly'"
- Maintains trust that keeps transactions on platform

## The Core Reality

**Direct Quote**: "The current platform requires my personal oversight to ensure good outcomes. This is not a scalable model."

Carlo isn't managing a platform. He IS the platform:
- The trust layer
- The translation service
- The quality control
- The relationship manager
- The exception handler
- The context holder

## What This Means

The brief process works not because of forms and workflows, but because Carlo:
1. **Understands** what clients really want (not what they say)
2. **Knows** which creators can deliver (not just portfolios)
3. **Negotiates** between incompatible realities
4. **Prevents** failures before they happen
5. **Maintains** relationships that create trust

Every successful brief goes through Carlo's judgment. Every failed brief (Morocco, Melbourne) happened when his judgment wasn't available.

The platform handles transactions. Carlo handles translation.
