# Evidence: Carlo's Manual Brief Intervention Requirements

## Direct Evidence from Documents

### 1. Carlo States His Manual Oversight is Required

**From Growth Plan PDF**:
> "The Problem: The current platform requires my personal oversight to ensure good outcomes. This is not a scalable model."

This directly states Carlo must personally oversee every transaction to ensure success.

### 2. Platform Needs Carlo to Prevent Brief Failures

**From August Email Update**:
> "A client got upset because they briefed the creator incorrectly so the output wasn't what they wanted - well actually, the user got in trouble with their boss because they presented the wrong video and passed the blame over to us. I have all the conversations showing that the briefing process was incorrect on their part but it of course feels a bit crap that a client got upset. This has shown that I need to implement a brief template in our platform that clients can download and fill out if they're unsure"

Evidence that without Carlo's intervention, clients create incorrect briefs leading to wrong outputs.

### 3. Manual Process Blocks Scaling

**From Q1 Investor Update**:
> "We've put into development the new platform so we've had to pay for extra workforce. This is a clear investment for us since it will automate a lot of the manual process we are currently doing and will directly impact how quickly we can scale"

Acknowledges current operations are manual and prevent scaling.

### 4. Deals Fail Without Carlo's Manual Coordination

**Morocco Failure**:
> "The Morocco Deal: Last week I took a beak and went to Morocco. During that week, I got an in-bound deal and told the client to use the platform. Everything went smoothly except when we had a log in issue so the creator and client took negotiations off platform. Rightly so, the creator and client got on a call to discuss the project, the creator realised a higher budget was necessary and proposed his quote. The client accepted which is all great. However, this negotiation means I cannot take our usual platform fees."

When Carlo wasn't available to manually coordinate, the deal went off-platform and lost fees.

### 5. Location Matching Requires Manual Knowledge

**Melbourne Failure**:
> "The Spin Brands Failure: An agency called Spin Brands, to whom I demoed the platform, had an immediate need; they required a creator in Melbourne. However, the platform is not equipped to handle city specific locations. As a result we couldn't cater to this."

The platform couldn't handle location-specific matching that Carlo would know manually.

### 6. Clients Need Help Creating Briefs

**From Chimera Specs**:
> "'Describe Your Brief' changes to 'Upload Your Brief'. NB link to 'Need help? Try our template brief'"

> "Providing 'enough' information -> we provide our template brief"

Shows clients struggle to create briefs without assistance.

### 7. Complex Brief Requirements Listed

**From Chimera Specs - What "Ideal" Briefs Should Include**:
> "At the very least, this is providing content examples of what the client is after so the creator can get an idea. For example, the Workmate job; brief featured example of walking interview with teleprompter. Ideal scenarios include:
> - About the company: target audience, brand guidelines, competitors etc
> - Supporting PDF attached with script with shotlist
> - Basics: deliverables, duration, format, destination of the content, captions or no captions
> - Content examples with moodboards, colour tones and visual references
> - Location inspiration/references, if necessary
> - Is there a need for talent? If so, is there a preference for how they look?
> - Key objective of the content"

This extensive list shows briefs require many elements clients don't naturally provide.

### 8. Platform Updates Reveal Missing Manual Functions

**From Chimera Specs - Changes Being Made**:
- "Above the Brief Name we place a field for 'add collaborators'" (wasn't there before)
- "Below the budget tab, there needs to be an 'expense' tab" (missing expense handling)
- "Location search -> we add city specification" (couldn't specify cities)
- "Change Order Requests" (entire system for scope changes missing)
- "Currently, only clients can handle the updates in the brief, we need to extend this to creators" (creators couldn't update status)

### 9. Growth Depends on Personal Connections

**From Growth Plan**:
> "The Problem: The current growth is organic but lacks a systematic approach - all my clients I've personally met through events, referrals etc..."

All clients come through Carlo's personal relationships, not the platform.

### 10. Direct Client Circumvention

**From August Email**:
> "I had a client ask a creator if they could 'invoice directly'. I'm not sure if they did it trying to cheeky or just wanting to be more efficient."

When platform creates friction, clients try to bypass it entirely.

## What This Evidence Shows

The evidence reveals Carlo performs these manual functions:

1. **Brief Translation** - Clients can't articulate needs correctly without help
2. **Location Matching** - Knows which creators are where and available
3. **Budget Negotiation** - Manually handles when budgets need adjustment
4. **Quality Control** - Prevents incorrect briefs from causing failed outputs
5. **Relationship Management** - All growth through personal connections
6. **Exception Handling** - When platform fails, Carlo manually intervenes
7. **Scope Management** - No system for changes, Carlo handles manually

## The Core Pattern

Carlo isn't just running a platform. He IS the platform - manually performing all the judgment-based functions that make briefs actually work. The mechanical platform handles payments and tracking, but Carlo handles everything that requires understanding context, translating needs, and matching realities.
