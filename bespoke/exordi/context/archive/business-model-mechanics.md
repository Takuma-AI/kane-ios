# Exordi Business Model: The Exact Mechanics

## Who Pays (The Money Flow)

### Primary Revenue Source: Medium-Sized Agencies (90% of revenue)
**The Big 4 Agencies**:
1. **Spin Brands** (UK) - Servicing brands like Porta Pizza
2. **Lippe Taylor** (US) - Healthcare/pharma focus likely
3. **Born Social** (UK) - Servicing Smirnoff, Guinness, Ford
4. **Whalar** (US, UK, DACH) - Creator agency

**How they pay**:
- Per-project basis (most common)
- Monthly retainers (emerging model)
- Platform fees on each transaction (when platform works)

### Secondary Revenue: Direct Brand Clients (10% of revenue)
**Named brands**:
- Onefinestay (luxury AirBnB) - Yearly retainer
- Cambridge Satchel - Project basis
- Skyscanner - Monthly retainer
- Ford (through agency)
- Smirnoff/Guinness (through Born Social)

## The Transaction Mechanics

### How Money Flows Through Exordi

**Standard Transaction**:
1. Client needs content for campaign
2. Client briefs Exordi on requirements
3. Exordi sources creators from network
4. Client selects creator
5. Creator produces content
6. Client pays Exordi full amount
7. Exordi pays creator (keeping ~40% margin)

**Actual Numbers from Updates**:
- Born Social February: $2,000 project
- Born Social March: $14,000 (2 projects combined)
- Monthly average: $21,000
- July spike: $37,000 ($26k new + $11k recurring)
- Margins: 40% retained by Exordi

### The Pricing Model Evolution

**Current Model** (Managed Marketplace):
- Exordi charges client full project cost
- Takes 30-40% platform fee
- Pays creator 60-70%
- Example: $10k project → $4k to Exordi, $6k to creator

**Attempted SaaS Model**:
- $200/month per "seat" (user at agency)
- Plus transaction fees
- Agencies willing to pay but limits scale
- Not fully implemented due to platform issues

**Failed Automation Model**:
- Client pays through platform automatically
- 50% upfront, 50% on delivery
- Lost fees when transactions went off-platform (Morocco)

## Who Is the Actual Customer?

### The Real Buyer: Producers at Agencies
**Their title**: Producer, Head of Production, Creative Director
**Their problem**: 
- Need external creators for 90% of jobs
- Don't have creators on staff
- Existing networks are slow/unreliable
- Can't use Fiverr/Upwork (quality issues)

**Quote from JTBD interviews**:
"If we don't find the right talent, we can't service an existing client or we can't win a pitch"

### Why Agencies, Not Brands?
**Agencies feel acute pain**:
- Revenue directly tied to production capability
- Lose pitches without good creators
- Reputation risk if production fails

**Brands feel less pain**:
- "Content quotas to meet" but not urgent
- Use content for awareness, not direct revenue
- Have other options (in-house teams)

## What Exactly Is Being Sold?

### The Surface Product: Creators
**Creator types in network**:
- Photographers (location-specific)
- Videographers (especially scarce)
- Content creators (UGC style)
- Specialists (underwater, aerial, etc.)

**Geographic coverage attempting**: Global
**Reality**: Need city-specific (Melbourne fail)

### The Actual Product: Trust & Curation

**What clients really buy**:
1. **Vetted Quality**: "Not Fiverr creators"
2. **Speed**: Creators already on location
3. **Reliability**: Exordi handles coordination
4. **Creative Match**: Carlo's eye for fit
5. **Risk Mitigation**: One throat to choke

**Evidence**: Clients pay 40% premium over going direct to creators

### The Emerging Product: Creative Services

**Onefinestay Model**:
- Creator as "Creative Director" for full year
- Not just execution but strategy
- Expanding beyond single projects

**Agency Support Model**:
- Help agencies win pitches (Spin Brands)
- Create content for proposals
- Enable campaigns they couldn't do otherwise

## The Supply Side: Where Creators Come From

### Current Creator Acquisition:
- Organic applications (rejected 95%)
- Referrals from existing creators
- Found at events and meetups
- Already creating content for passion

### Creator Economics:
- Get 60-70% of project value
- Example: $10k project → $6-7k to creator
- No exclusivity required
- Work when they want

### The Quality Filter:
**What makes a creator "Exordi-worthy"**:
- Already passionate about their domain
- Creating content anyway (not just for money)
- Local expertise (surfer who knows Hawaii)
- Artistic eye beyond technical skill

## Revenue Concentration Risk

### The Vulnerability:
- 90% revenue from 4 agencies
- Each agency = 2-3 teams internally
- Lose one agency = major hit

### The Opportunity:
- Born Social: $2k → $14k growth trajectory
- Clients increase spend once trust built
- 90% retention rate
- Word of mouth between producers

## Why The Model Works (And Doesn't Scale)

### Works Because:
- Producers desperately need quality creators
- No good alternatives (networks too slow, platforms too cheap)
- Trust worth paying premium for
- Relationships create stickiness

### Doesn't Scale Because:
- Carlo personally vets creators
- Manual coordination required
- Trust doesn't automate
- Geography more important than expected

## The Fundamental Transaction

**Client pays for**: Certainty that production won't fail
**Creator provides**: Quality content from authentic expertise  
**Exordi provides**: The trust layer between them

The 40% margin isn't for technology - it's for reducing risk through human curation and coordination.
