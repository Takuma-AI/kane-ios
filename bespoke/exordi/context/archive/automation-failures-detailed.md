# Exordi's Automation Attempts: What Failed and Why

## Specific Automation Attempts and Their Failures

### 1. The Morocco Deal Failure (July 2025)
**What Carlo automated**: Platform login and communication system
**What happened**: 
- Client had login issues during Carlo's vacation
- Creator and client immediately moved to direct phone call
- They negotiated the deal off-platform
- Carlo lost ALL platform fees on the transaction

**Why it failed**: The platform was a barrier, not an enabler. The moment it had friction, humans routed around it naturally.

### 2. The Spin Brands Melbourne Failure (July 2025)
**What Carlo automated**: Creator discovery/search system
**What happened**:
- Spin Brands needed a creator specifically in Melbourne
- Platform had no city-specific location search
- Couldn't find anyone despite having creators there
- Lost the entire deal

**Why it failed**: Carlo built for global scale but production is hyperlocal. The automation assumed geography didn't matter.

### 3. The Briefing Process Breakdown (Multiple incidents)
**What Carlo automated**: Brief submission and creator matching
**What happened**:
- Clients would submit incomplete briefs
- Platform would suggest creators who weren't actually available
- Clients would get frustrated and email Carlo directly
- Carlo would end up manually coordinating anyway

**Why it failed**: The platform couldn't handle the nuance of creative briefs - budget flexibility, timeline negotiations, stylistic preferences.

### 4. The Payment System Rigidity (August 2025)
**What Carlo automated**: Fixed payment structure (50% upfront, 50% on delivery)
**What happened**:
- Clients needed expense budgets separate from creative fees
- Creators needed flexibility for additional work (change orders)
- Platform couldn't handle variations
- Carlo processing payments manually outside system

**Why it failed**: Every creative project is unique. The automation enforced uniformity that didn't match reality.

### 5. The Chat System That Nobody Used (March-May 2025)
**What Carlo built**: In-platform messaging between clients and creators
**What happened**:
- Even paying clients avoided the platform chat
- Preferred WhatsApp, email, phone calls
- Important context got lost across channels
- Carlo became the human router for all communication

**Why it failed**: The platform chat was isolated from where people naturally communicate. It added a channel rather than consolidating them.

## The Pattern of Automation Failure

Each automation attempt failed for the same core reason: **Carlo automated the mechanics but not the judgment**.

### What Carlo Keeps Trying to Automate:
- Brief intake → But briefs need interpretation
- Creator matching → But matching requires understanding nuance
- Communication → But creative discussions need flexibility
- Payments → But every deal structure is different
- Quality control → But quality is subjective and contextual

### What Actually Happens:
1. Platform enforces rigid process
2. Real situation needs flexibility
3. Users bypass platform
4. Carlo intervenes manually
5. Platform becomes overhead, not infrastructure

## The Managed Marketplace Revelation (July 2025)

Carlo's own words: "I previously tried to skip this step and go to full automation immediately but it surfaced a few issues... Therefore, before architecting a new solution, I will operate a managed marketplace."

This was the moment he admitted that removing human coordination wasn't possible - at least not yet.

## Why Manual Coordination Persists

From the updates, Carlo is manually handling:
- **Brief interpretation**: "Is this actually doable?"
- **Creator vetting**: "Is this person right for this specific job?"
- **Negotiation**: "Can we make these numbers work?"
- **Quality assurance**: "Does this meet the unstated expectations?"
- **Relationship management**: "How do we keep this client happy?"
- **Exception handling**: "This doesn't fit our normal process"

Every one of these requires judgment, context, and relationship understanding that his automations couldn't capture.

## The Techstars Influence

In March, Mentor Madness pushed Carlo toward traditional metrics:
- Platform adoption rates
- Time on site
- SaaS revenue
- User engagement

But this pushed him away from what was actually working:
- High-touch service
- Relationship building
- Custom solutions
- Human curation

The updates show his frustration: "I'm now reworking all my goals and objectives. So I guess last week's update can just go out the window."
