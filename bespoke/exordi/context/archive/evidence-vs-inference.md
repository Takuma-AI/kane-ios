# Evidence vs Inference in Carlo's Brief Process

## What We Have Direct Evidence For

### 1. Brief Creation Problems
**Direct Quote**: "A client got upset because they briefed the creator incorrectly so the output wasn't what they wanted"
**Evidence**: Clients create incorrect briefs without assistance

### 2. Carlo's Oversight Required
**Direct Quote**: "The current platform requires my personal oversight to ensure good outcomes"
**Evidence**: Platform doesn't work without Carlo's involvement

### 3. Manual Process Exists
**Direct Quote**: "automate a lot of the manual process we are currently doing"
**Evidence**: Current operations involve manual work

### 4. Information Requirements
**Direct Evidence from Chimera Specs**:
- Clients need brief templates
- Extensive list of required information documented
- "Need help? Try our template brief" link being added

### 5. Specific Failures
**Morocco**: Deal went off-platform when Carlo unavailable
**Melbourne**: Couldn't match location-specific needs
**Client Brief**: Incorrect brief led to wrong output

## What We're Inferring (Not Direct Evidence)

### 1. "Translation" Work
**Inference**: Carlo translates between client and creator languages
**Based on**: 
- Clients brief incorrectly
- Creators need specific information
- Carlo's oversight prevents failures
**But**: No direct quote saying Carlo "translates"

### 2. Judgment Calls
**Inference**: Carlo makes complex judgment decisions
**Based on**: 
- Platform needs his "personal oversight"
- Failures when he's not involved
**But**: No specific description of what oversight entails

### 3. Relationship Management
**Inference**: Carlo manages relationships actively
**Based on**: 
- "All my clients I've personally met"
- Client tried to circumvent platform
**But**: No detail on what relationship management involves

## The Honest Gap

We can prove:
- Clients can't brief correctly alone
- Carlo's involvement prevents failures
- Manual work exists that needs automation
- Specific information is required but not provided

We cannot prove exactly:
- HOW Carlo fixes incorrect briefs
- WHAT specific actions his "oversight" includes
- WHY his presence prevents failures

## The Most Honest Statement

Based solely on evidence:
"Carlo manually oversees every transaction to ensure good outcomes. Without his oversight, clients create incorrect briefs that lead to wrong outputs. The platform cannot currently handle location-specific matching, expense negotiation, or change requests. Chimera aims to automate these manual processes."

The "translation" metaphor is useful but not directly evidenced in the documents.
