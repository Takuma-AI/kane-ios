# Carlo's Philosophy & Approach

## The Passion Principle

**What He Says**: 
- "Creators create and brands are inspired" - August Update
- Emphasizes "thoughtfulness, curation and connection" as Exordi's key elements
- "I take the time to carefully plan before taking action"

**Concrete Decisions Showing Philosophy**:
- Rejected "build a marketplace" advice in week 7
- Turned down Raw Ventures initially ("I wasn't interested in raising")
- Chose direct client interaction over traditional sales: "What I learn through events is infinitely more valuable"

## Creator-First Mindset

**Evidence from Creator Academy Vision**:
- Wants creators "formed by us" not just found
- Plans to teach business skills alongside creative skills
- "Exordi-certified creators" as differentiator
- Creators would pay to learn, then best join platform

**Why This Matters**: Sees creators as craftspeople to develop, not commodities to trade

## Quality Over Speed

**His Words**: 
- "Yes, it means I might be slower towards action but it means that when I do start, I move fast and with precision"
- "The famous slow down to speed up (although I don't really like slow)"

**Contradiction**: Wants careful quality but frustrated by slow growth

## Personal Touch at Scale

**The Problem He Faces**:
- Knows personal oversight ensures quality
- Knows personal oversight prevents scaling
- Trying to codify judgment into systems (Chimera)
- But mechanical solutions keep failing

## Vision for Content

**Not Stated Directly But Shown Through**:
- Focus on craft and training (Academy levels)
- Emphasis on relationships over transactions
- Building community not just marketplace
- Teaching interpretation not just execution

## The Core Tension

Wants to scale what may be inherently unscalable: personal judgment, taste, and relationship-based trust.
