# Week 9: Return to Passion Core (May 9, 2025)

## Context
Week 9 of Techstars, back in San Francisco. Major strategic reconsideration about growth approach and return to founding vision.

## Revenue Performance
- **3 new clients**: 1 new brand, 1 return agency, 1 return client with 2 projects
- **Monthly revenue**: Averaging $21k/month
- **Using Exordi for demo day video**: Dogfooding the platform

## Key Wins
- **Cambridge Satchel**: Leather goods brand
  - 10 photos + 1 video in Mexico
  - Chose creator Charysse for artistic sense
  - Enabled campaign launch that wouldn't happen without Exordi
  
- **Spin Brands**: UK agency
  - Creating UGC for Porta Pizza NYC pitch
  - Providing competitive edge through global reach
  
- **Onefinestay**: Luxury AirBnB alternative
  - Expanding beyond retainer to interview series
  - Event capture
  - Shows clients discovering new use cases

## Platform Progress
- Staging version with new functionalities ready
- Chat function for direct client-creator communication
- Integrated contracts and payments
- Creator lists for favorites

## Core Struggle: Scaling
"So many conflicting ideas - do ads, don't do ads, keep doing cold outreach or not, switch to something else..."

## Strategic Pivot: Return to Roots
**Original vision resurfaces**: Exordi isn't just a marketplace - it's the definitive space for passion.

Key insight: "Passion is what connects us and inspires action. Deeply passionate people create authentic content from incredible expertise. They're already in the right locations. We're not faster or cheaper because of AI - we are because of our unremitting focus on passion."

## New Growth Strategy
Moving from digital hiding to real-world presence:
- Creator meetups
- Workshops and masterclasses
- Industry panels
- "Show the world our community is real"

## Lost Opportunity
Lost Kyoto job because creator didn't speak English - timing killed the deal.

## The Paradox
"None of what we have planned follows start-up protocol. It isn't scrappy, it's not scalable, it's hard to predict ROI and it's somewhat expensive. However... why ought we keep playing on the sidelines?"

Bold declaration: "Exordi is the only way for brands to create content that connects."
