## Platform Development Progress
**UI/UX designs completed** for major platform updates (development finishing June):

1. **Request for Participation (RFP)**
   - Clients send briefs to selected creators
   - Creators mark interest
   - Client picks from available creators
   - Ensures availability and commitment

2. **SaaS Paywall Implementation**
   - Single subscription price (discounted yearly)
   - Pay-as-you-go option for <3 briefs/month
   - Currently handling ~5 briefs per client monthly

3. **Brief-Specific Chat System**
   - Direct client-creator communication
   - Eliminates manual relay overhead
   - Each brief gets dedicated chat

## Strategic Insights

### The Manual Overhead Problem
Carlo spending significant time relaying information between clients and creators. Platform updates directly address this by enabling autonomous communication.

### Broken Flow Issues
Current platform assumes creators are:
- Always available
- Always accepting jobs
This creates workflow breaks requiring manual intervention.

### Demo Day Goals (June)
- Fully automated platform
- Existing clients onboarded
- 5+ new clients on platform
- Clear roadmap for "Agentic Creative Director"

## Pain Points Revealed
1. **Manual relay work** - Acting as middleman between clients/creators
2. **Availability assumptions** - Platform doesn't handle creator scheduling
3. **Legal issues** - High legal expenses from agency dispute
4. **Platform investment** - Development costs creating temporary negative EBITDA

## Market Validation
- Clients averaging 5 briefs/month
- Successful upsell from single campaign to year-long contracts
- Agency network effects (one agency leading to group opportunities)

## Operational Challenges
- Platform development expenses
- Legal/accounting costs from agency dispute
- Need to transition from manual to automated before June
- Balancing Techstars program with ongoing operations

## Forward Looking
Positioning for transformation from "mostly manual company to fully automated platform set to revolutionise content advertising" within 3 months.
