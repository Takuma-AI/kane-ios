## Meta-Patterns Across Timeline

### The Automation Trap
Consistent pattern of attempting to automate too early, then being forced back to manual/managed approaches when reality hits.

### The Trust Paradox
Producers desperately need the service but don't trust any platform - they resort to slow manual networks because automated solutions have failed them.

### The Timing Problem
Exordi only becomes essential at the moment of acute need - no way to predict or create demand, only to be ready when it arrives.

### The Passion Thread
Every time Carlo drifts toward conventional startup wisdom, the business suffers. When he returns to passion and authenticity, momentum returns.

### The Scale Struggle
Consistent tension between:
- What works (high-touch, curated, manual)
- What scales (automated, platform, self-serve)
- What's fundable (SaaS metrics, predictable growth)

### The Creator Economy Reality
- Content is becoming commoditized (prices dropping)
- Quality creators are scarce (especially video)
- Location matters more than expected
- Trust cannot be automated
