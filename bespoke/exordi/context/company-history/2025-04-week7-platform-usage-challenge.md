# Week 7: Platform Usage Challenge (April 25, 2025)

## Context
Week 7 of Techstars, Carlo operating from Mexico City. Sales funnel beginning to yield results but facing fundamental challenge about platform engagement.

## Key Progress
- **Sales momentum**: 2 new client calls with high conversion potential
- **Inbound from TikTok**: Major platform showing interest
- **Content creation started**: 3 LinkedIn posts in 3 days
- **JTBD insights crystallizing**: 5 more producer interviews conducted
  - 90% of producers need external creatives
  - Producers avoid Fiverr/Upwork due to quality concerns
  - Speed and reliability are paramount (one shot at production)
  - Currently using personal networks (slow, tedious process)

## Critical Challenge Identified
**The engagement paradox**: Producers love Exordi but only convert to paying when they have active campaigns. No predictable conversion timeline.

## Struggles
- **Founding engineer loss**: AI engineer friend pulled out for robotics passion
- **Platform usage beyond briefs**: How to drive engagement when not actively producing?

## Business Metrics
- **3 active enquiries**:
  - Heaven Media: Kyoto shoot
  - Cambridge Satchel: Venice Beach shoot  
  - Spin Brands: Hawaii shoot
- **Cold outreach performance**:
  - Weeks 1-2: 90 outreaches → 3 calls (4% conversion)
  - Week 3: 33 outreaches → 2 calls (6% conversion)
- **Referral conversion**: 55% from intro to booked call

## Strategic Insight
All enquiries are exploratory - producers preparing for potential green lights. They ask:
1. Who do you have there?
2. Can we see their profile?
3. What's the cost to shoot X?

This reveals the core struggle: Exordi becomes essential only at the moment of need, making growth unpredictable.
