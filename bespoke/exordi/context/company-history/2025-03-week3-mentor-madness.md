# Week 3: Mentor Madness Impact (March 28, 2025)

## Context
Week 3 of Techstars San Francisco program. Mentor Madness sessions creating both clarity and chaos - forcing complete reconsideration of goals and objectives.

## Revenue Activity
- **Ford Europe campaign**: Large car brand via agency
  - Content production across 5 countries
  - Portugal, Czech Republic, France, Poland, Belgium
- **Skyscanner**: Monthly retainer delivery continuing
- **Onefinestay**: Contracted creator as yearly Creative Director
  - Interesting new model emerging

## Platform Development
- **Progress**: 40% automated, finishing chat function
- **Target**: 20 active clients with 80% weekly usage by June
- **Full automation**: Targeted for June 2025

## Strategic Pivot: ICP Clarity
Mentor sessions revealed critical insight about customer segments:

### Medium-Sized Agencies (Primary Focus)
- "If we don't find talent, we can't service clients or win pitches"
- Direct revenue impact from talent shortage
- 90% of Exordi revenue from 4 agencies:
  - Spin Brands (UK)
  - Lippe Taylor (US)
  - Born Social (UK)
  - Whalar (US, UK, DACH)

### Brands (Secondary)
- "Content quotas to meet" but less urgent
- Use content for awareness, not direct revenue
- Less acute pain point

## Mentor Insights
- **Ankur**: Helped refocus platform priorities
- **Sanjeev**: Platform design insights
- Warning about "becoming victim of the AI trap without clear justification"

## New OKRs
1. **Platform Launch**: 
   - 15-20 active clients needed for results
   - Implement Mixpanel for analytics
   - Free seat-based system initially

2. **Client Growth**:
   - Target: 30 seats (2 per agency)
   - Each seat running $2k+ briefs monthly
   - 20% MoM revenue growth

## Key Learning
"I'm happy the experience has caused a significant mental shift: focusing on launching, scaling and iterating really fast. I've approached this business slowly, in a curated way like an artisan. Mostly driven from fear of failure."

New philosophy: **"Sacrificial Pancake"** - launch imperfect, iterate quickly.

## Struggles
- **Bandwidth**: Brain "like an Apple Macintosh 128K" after mentor sessions
- **Pricing approach**: SaaS vs commission model debate
  - Agencies would pay $200/month
  - But paywall might limit scale of commission revenue
