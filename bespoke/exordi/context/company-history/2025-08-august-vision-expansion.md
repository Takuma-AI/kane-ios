Post-Techstars, working from Italy, navigating enterprise bureaucracy and forming vision for Creator Academy.

## Key Metrics

- **2025 Revenue**: $138k from 9 clients
- **Client Retention**: 90% have returned multiple times
- **Expenses**: $190k (down $50k)
- **Loss Reason**: $30k platform investment + SF living costs during Techstars

- **Status**: Highlighting key improvements needed

## Major Developments

### Fortune 500 Pilot
- "Super close" to paid pilot start
- Navigating contractual bureaucracy
- Will reveal company name once signed

- **Raw Ventures Pitch Competition**: Selected (8 out of 400 applicants)
  - Can win â‚¬10k for best pitch
  - Flights and hotel paid
  - Opportunity to raise funding

### Client Issues
- **Cheeky Client**: Asked creator to "invoice directly" to bypass platform
- **Good**: Creator reported it to Carlo
- **Solution**: Building Change Order Request feature

## The Creator Academy Vision

### The Big Idea
"Think Masterclass but for content creation"

### Market Insight
- No great courses for content creators exist
- University courses are dated
- Famous filmmaker courses are single-person perspective
- Content dominating ecosystem, everyone wants to create

### Inspiration
Taking cues from Augment MBA model to create world-class creator course

### Strategic Benefits
1. **Constant funnel** of new creators
2. **New revenue stream**
3. **Marketing firepower**
4. **Status positioning** (like RedBull with athletes)

### Three-Level Structure (from Growth Plan)
- **Level 1**: Phone + CapCut basics
- **Level 2**: DSLR, DaVinci, business management, brief interpretation
- **Level 3**: Professional production, color grading, VFX, industry expertise

## Platform Learnings

### User Behavior Problems
1. **Briefing Failures**: Client briefed creator incorrectly, blamed Exordi when output wrong
2. **Trust Boundaries**: Clients trying to circumvent platform for direct deals
3. **Attribution Games**: Users passing blame when their boss unhappy

### Platform Improvements Needed
- **Brief templates** for uncertain clients
- **Change Order Requests** for mid-project modifications
- **Better containment** of client-creator relationships

## Strategic Positioning

### The Quiet Power Play
"Exordi has been quietly powering agencies to cater to some of the world's biggest brands"

### The Vision Evolution
Moving from shadow supplier to industry leader:
- World-class content creation course (creator acquisition and visibility)
- Most elite creator network like RedBull (status and performance)
- Powerful campaign platform (operational and revenue efficiency)

## Operational Insights

### Cost Cutting
Successfully reduced expenses to recover the $50k loss "soon"

### Platform Delay Frustration
"Learning that there are improvements to make to the platform before it can go to market and scale is great, it's also annoying because it's a delay"

### Capital Confidence
"The capex isn't a problem, I can repay the investment within 3 months through current clients"

## Market Observations

### Platform Reality vs Expectation
"I was so sure the platform was ready to launch fully but nope, back to the lab"

This shows Carlo's pattern:
1. Overconfidence in automation readiness
2. Reality check through actual usage
3. Forced return to development

## Key Learnings

### The Education Play
The Creator Academy isn't just about education - it's a complete ecosystem play:
- **Supply generation** (creators)
- **Demand generation** (visibility)
- **Quality control** (certification)
- **Network effects** (community)

### The Status Game
Positioning shift from utility to aspiration:
- Not just "we provide creators"
- But "we have the elite creators"
- Academy creates exclusivity through education

### The Platform Truth
14 campaigns have revealed the platform isn't ready for autonomous operation. Each campaign surfaces new edge cases and user behaviors that break the intended flow.

## Forward Looking

### Immediate Needs
- Figure out story for Raw Ventures pitch
- Implement brief templates
- Build Change Order Request system
- Find education content production expertise

### The Transformation Vision
From "good supplier of content creators" to "leading content production figure in the world"

This represents a fundamental shift from service provider to industry shaper - using education as the wedge to build a defensible moat around creator supply.
