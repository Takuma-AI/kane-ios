# Week 2 Techstars - March 21, 2025 - OKRs & Early Momentum

## Date
March 21, 2025 (Week 2 of Techstars)

## Context
First official weekly update from Techstars. Carlo establishing ambitious OKRs and discovering the solopreneurship struggle.

## Three Core OKRs

### OKR 1: Enterprise Client Acquisition
- **Target**: 3 enterprise clients, same industry, $50k+ contracts each
- **Progress**: 1 client signed - $67k annual contract at 40% margin ($27k margin)
- **Pipeline**: 1 lead expected to close end of April (potentially $200k)
- **Method**: Conducting 10 Jobs-To-Be-Done interviews by April 10 (3 done, 4 scheduled)

### OKR 2: Platform Development  
- **Target**: Launch scalable platform by June, cut production time from 3 weeks to 5 days
- **Current State**: Platform 30-50% automated
- **Completed**: Stripe integration, SaaS paywall, subscription packages
- **Next**: Chat function, automated contracts, campaign tracking
- **Problem**: Platform stops after brief sent - no way to track acceptance, communicate, or manage

### OKR 3: Scale/Waitlist
- **Target**: 60 pre-paid waitlist signups
- **Strategy**: Weekly LinkedIn content, personalized outreach to 400 ICPs
- **Leverage**: Use existing client brands for social proof
- **Innovation**: Pre-pay first month at discount to validate demand

## Current Operations

### Delivery Success
- 3 campaigns delivered (LA, Sydney, Boston) - all first-time approvals
- Skyscanner monthly contract: 10 videos from 10 locations in 1 week
  - Locations: Corfu, Bruges, Athens, Cyprus, Istanbul, Pompeii, Grenada, Medellin, Portland, Miami Beach
- This has been the "stress test" - delivering every month successfully

### Platform Reality Check
**The Manual Bridge Problem:**
- Platform hosts creators and clients
- Clients can source creators
- BUT interaction stops after brief sent
- Carlo manually bridges: finding creators on platform, then moving to email for coordination
- This is THE core bottleneck preventing scale

## Key Struggles Identified

### Struggle 1: Solopreneurship Weight
"It's not just a matter of bandwidth... it's a matter of sharing the weight"
- Need for idea bouncing, arguing, non-work chat
- Working toward bringing in known, trusted person with talent
- Recognition that solo isn't viable long-term

### Struggle 2: Lead Conversion Timeline
- January-February: 14 potential clients approached
- Only 3 of 8 converted so far
- Learning: Timing is critical - need right client at right moment
- Decision: Slow down sales to focus on JTBD and refine ICP

## Strategic Insights

### The 5-Day Promise
Industry standard is 3 weeks for campaign production. Exordi targeting 5 days - this is the key differentiator but requires full automation to achieve at scale.

### The Vision Beyond Production
"Our goal isn't to just build production teams. Our goal is to provide brands with all the tools to own their entire content campaigns, as if they're creating small, hyper specialized internal agencies."

Future capabilities mentioned:
- Creative direction coverage
- Performance scoring before content creation
- Complete campaign ownership tools

## Asks & Needs

### Immediate Ask
Anyone skilled with:
- Words, GTM, and positioning
- Marketing/content/advertising background
- Patience for deep sparring on positioning

## Techstars Environment Impact

"The team is amazing, the other 9 companies are made up of killers, I wake up everyday with a view of the Golden Gate bridge... I'm struggling to keep up but it's giving me a drive that I haven't had in a while and I love it (got a big damn smile on my face as I write this)."

## Key Takeaway

Week 2 shows Carlo in discovery mode - setting ambitious goals while confronting fundamental challenges. The platform is half-built, manual coordination is eating time, and he's realizing solo founder limitations. But there's momentum: successful deliveries, enterprise pipeline, and Techstars energy driving forward.

The gap between current reality (50% automated, manual coordination) and June goal (fully automated, 5-day delivery) is massive. This tension drives the entire narrative forward.
