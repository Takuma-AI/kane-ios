# Week 5 Techstars - April 11, 2025 - ICP Discovery

## Date
April 11, 2025 (Week 5 of Techstars)

## Major Breakthrough: ICP Clarity

### The Epicenter Discovery
**Producers at medium-sized independent agencies (50-200 employees) feel the pain most acutely**

This is THE key insight - Carlo has found his ideal customer profile after 20+ calls with producers.

## The Problem Articulation

### Market Dynamics Shift
- TV Spot productions declining (no longer consuming through TVs)
- **200% increase in content campaigns** last year
- Brands expecting more content for multiple digital channels
- Total ad budgets increasing (33% CAGR - $1.2tn by 2030)
- BUT price per asset dropping - "more for same price"

### Producer Pain Points
Producers rely on outsourced teams, creating operational nightmares:
1. **Time sink** - searching and vetting people, assuming availability
2. **Budget negotiations** - causing significant delays
3. **Paperwork hell** - contracts and onboarding for each creator
4. **Invoice chaos** - multiple invoices, multiple currencies
5. **Reputation risk** - their credibility on the line with each job

Result: **Producers under significant stress to deliver quickly and well to secure revenue**

## Exordi's Solution Clarity

### What Exordi Provides
1. **Global vetted network** - instant access to elite creators
2. **Predefined budgets** - no negotiations per content type
3. **Single contract/payment** - regardless of creator count

### Current Blockers
1. **Trust** - Young company, producers risk reputation
2. **Discovery** - Zero marketing, limited visibility

## Sales Progress

### Outreach Campaign (3 days in)
- **Hit list**: 120 producers identified
- **Outreached**: 90 producers
- **Opens**: 60 emails
- **Calls booked**: 6
- **Approach issue**: Too cautious, asking for advice vs selling

### Referral System (Just Started)
- **Referrals asked**: 4
- **Calls booked**: 4 (100% conversion!)
- Proving "much easier and faster"

### Pipeline Building
- **Terrane Group** - pitched, interested
- **AKQA** - pitched, interested, potential projects

## Strategic Insights

### The Real Struggle
Agencies can't keep up with the content velocity demanded by brands. The traditional production model (big crews, long timelines, high budgets) doesn't work for rapid, multi-channel content.

### Market Timing
Perfect storm:
- Content demand exploding
- Budgets per asset shrinking  
- Producers drowning in operational complexity
- Traditional production models breaking

### Sales Learning
- Referrals vastly outperforming cold outreach
- Need more direct sales approach (stop asking for advice)
- Friday outreach doesn't work

## Forward Looking

### Concerns
- May historically low revenue month approaching
- Sales cycles longer than one month
- Fear of revenue dip

### Asks
Needs intros to:
- Producers at medium independent agencies (NYC/LA/Chicago)
- Same at large global agencies (Ogilvy, WPP, Droga5)
- Brand marketers (content, brand management, social, CMOs)

## Key Takeaway
This is the pivot moment - Carlo has found product-market fit with a specific persona (agency producers) facing a specific pain (content velocity vs operational complexity). The solution is clear, the ICP is defined, now it's about trust-building and discovery.
