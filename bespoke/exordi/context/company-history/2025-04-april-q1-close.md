## Industry Observations (from The Exordian)

### Declining ROAS Crisis
- Apple iOS changes and GDPR destroying targeting
- 8 US states implementing privacy laws in 2025
- ROAS declining from 7-10x norm to lucky if 4x
- Brands pulling money from agencies, building own tech stacks

### AI Advertising Uncertainty
- Meta beating expectations with AI revenue
- But AI-enhanced ads not showing better performance
- "Experimentation phase" revenue may not sustain
- Apple facing lawsuit for false AI advertising claims

### Shift to IRL/Analog
- Brands focusing on "owning" their advertising
- Move from URL to IRL strategies
- Community, events, collaborations becoming "future-proof"
- "Antisocial" marketing strategies gaining traction

## Key Learnings

This update reveals Exordi is perfectly positioned for the market shift:
- As ROAS declines, brands need authentic content
- As digital saturates, IRL experiences matter more
- As brands leave agencies, they need flexible solutions
- Exordi's creator network provides the authentic, flexible content solution

The legal expenses and platform investment are temporary drags on an otherwise healthy business model with strong margins and geographic scalability.
