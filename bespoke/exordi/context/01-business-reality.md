# Exordi Business Reality

## What Exordi Is

**Business Model**: Managed marketplace connecting brands/agencies with vetted creators for content production
- **Who pays**: Agencies and brands (B2B)
- **What they buy**: Content production services (photo, video, creative)
- **Revenue model**: 40% platform fee on transactions
- **Current scale**: ~$30-50k monthly revenue, ~20% margins when operational

## The Bottleneck

**Direct Quote**: "The current platform requires my personal oversight to ensure good outcomes. This is not a scalable model." - Growth Plan

**What Carlo Does Manually**:
1. Sources all clients through personal network ("all my clients I've personally met")
2. Reviews and fixes briefs before creators see them
3. Matches creators to briefs based on location/availability/style
4. Negotiates budget adjustments and expenses
5. Manages change requests and scope creep
6. Maintains trust that keeps transactions on platform

## Why Automation Has Failed

**Documented Failures**:
- **Morocco Deal**: Platform login issue → negotiation went off-platform → lost fees
- **Melbourne Deal**: Platform couldn't match city-specific creator needs → lost deal
- **Client Brief Failure**: Client briefed incorrectly → wrong output → client blamed Exordi

**Root Cause**: Platform handles transactions but can't handle context, judgment, or exception cases

## Current Growth Constraints

1. **Geographic**: Can't serve clients outside Carlo's physical presence
2. **Creator Supply**: 95% rejection rate, manual vetting, no pipeline
3. **Client Acquisition**: Depends entirely on Carlo's personal relationships
4. **Operational**: Every transaction needs Carlo's oversight

## Financial Reality

- Burn rate when fully operational
- $30k invested in platform improvements that haven't solved core issues
- Legal expenses from agency disputes
- Need for technical talent but using expensive outsourced teams

## The Strategic Vision

**Three-Phase Plan**:
1. **Chimera**: Automate operations to free Carlo
2. **Creator Academy**: Build talent pipeline and brand
3. **Geographic Conquest**: Dominate key cities (LA, NYC, London, Milan)

**End Goal**: "Total market domination where every single content requirement flows through exordi"
