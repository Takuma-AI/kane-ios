# Chapter 6: The Founders' Agreement

This is our agreement as co-founders of Shokuna. Plain language, real commitments.

## We Own This Together

**Ownership**: We each own 50% of Shokuna LLC.

**Titles**: Neal Sales-Griffin is CEO. Liliana Robinson is COO.

**Decision Making**: When we disagree on company-wide issues, CEO makes the final call. For area-specific decisions, the Area Lead decides (with CEO veto only for legal/existential issues).

**External Facing**: We both present as co-founders. Period.

## Money Flows From Work

**No Salaries**: We eat what we kill. No work, no pay. Even for us.

**Project Splits**: Lead gets 40-60%, Company keeps 10%, Team gets the rest. We decide splits upfront based on contribution.

**Work Assignment**: We plan quarterly based on financial needs. If one of us needs money more urgently, they get priority on project selection.

**Company Profits**: The 10% covers operations. Excess stays in company unless we both agree to distribute.

## Changes Require Both

**Bringing in Partners**: Both must agree unanimously. No exceptions.

**Major Decisions**: Strategy pivots, taking on debt, selling the companyâ€”both must agree.

**Leaving**: After one year, if either leaves voluntarily, the other can buy their half at fair market value. We'll agree on valuation method when needed.

**Client Protection**: For 12 months after leaving, no taking Shokuna clients.

## We Commit To

**Transparency**: Share real financial needs. No hiding struggles.

**Direct Communication**: Say what we mean. Address problems immediately.

**The Work**: Lead projects, not just assign them. Stay close to the craft.

**Each Other**: Your success is my success. We rise together.

## What's Ours

**Work Product**: What we create for Shokuna belongs to Shokuna.

**Prior Work**: What we brought in (from Techstars, past projects) stays ours to use.

## Simple Rules

- Trust below 30%? We talk that day.
- Can't meet a commitment? Say so immediately.
- Life happens? We adjust temporarily, then reassess.
- Something's not working? We change it.

## The Bottom Line

We're building a calm company that does excellent work. We share the risks, the work, and the rewards. We treat each other as we'd want to be treated.

This is a living agreement. When reality changes, we update it together.
