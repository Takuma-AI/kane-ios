# Chapter 2: How We Work Together

Every area has one lead. Every project has clear outcomes. Everyone helps everyone else succeed.

## Areas & Ownership

We don't share responsibility—we divide it clearly. Each area has a single Area Lead who owns outcomes and makes final decisions.

**Business Development** - Finding clients, closing deals, managing demand scouts
**Client Projects** - Project delivery, client satisfaction, quality control
**JTBD Excellence** - Methodology advancement, training, consistency
**Operations** - Finance, legal, systems, tools, documentation
**Innovation** - New services, AI integration, pushing boundaries
**Culture** - Hiring, conflict resolution, team health, handbook

The Area Lead doesn't do all the work—they ensure it gets done well. They can delegate tasks but not responsibility.

When you need something, go directly to the Area Lead. When something falls through cracks, the Area Lead catches it or proposes who should.

**Decision Authority**: Within their area, the Area Lead has final say. The only override is CEO veto for legal compliance or existential risk.

## Communication That Works

### Daily Practice
**End of day**: Post specific progress in Basecamp. "Completed synthesis for 3 interviews, found pattern about pricing anxiety" not "worked on interviews."

**Deep work blocks**: Protect 2+ hours daily. Notifications off. No meetings. Real focus.

**Message checks**: Morning, lunch, end of day. The world won't end if you take 2 hours to respond.

### Weekly Rhythm
**Monday**: Post your week's concrete deliverables by 10am. These are specific outcomes you'll ship, not activities.

**Friday**: Review what you actually delivered versus planned. Note learnings for next week.

Why both daily and weekly? Daily posts capture in-the-moment progress and unblock teammates. Weekly planning/review ensures you're working on the right things and learning from patterns.

### Monthly Practice
**Last Friday of month**: 
- Review trust batteries with teammates (below 30% = time to talk)
- Track energizing vs draining work ratio (target: 75% energizing)
- Document any process you've explained twice

### Quarterly Reviews
Half-day session covering:
- Project retrospectives
- Contribution assessment
- Financial review
- Next quarter planning
- Handbook updates from learnings

## Project Management (Integrated Daily Flow)

### Name for Specific Outcomes
Every project describes what will exist when done:
- ✓ "Acme JTBD: 12 interviews analyzed, 3 core jobs identified, findings presented"
- ✗ "Acme Corp JTBD Report"

Include the deliverable AND its key components.

### Crystal Clear Agreements
Could a stranger judge if you succeeded? Every project needs:
- Specific deliverables (what exactly will exist?)
- Quality bar (what makes it good enough?)
- Due date (when will the client have it?)
- Owner (who wakes up thinking about this?)

### Make Work Visible
Update your Basecamp project with:
- Current focus (what you're working on today)
- Blockers (what's stopping progress)
- Next milestone (what you're driving toward)

This isn't micromanagement—it's transparency that enables support.

### Fixed Time, Variable Scope
Deadlines don't move. Scope does. When pressure hits, cut nice-to-haves, ship must-haves. Quality stays high by doing less, not rushing more.

### Document on First Use
First time doing something novel? Document it. You'll likely do it again, and future you (or teammates) will thank present you.

## Everyone Coaches Everyone

We cultivate mutual curiosity about each other's strengths. When stuck, ask for coaching, not answers.

This isn't about hierarchy—everyone has zones of genius worth learning from. Your synthesis skills might unlock someone else's growth. Their client communication might transform your approach.

Lead with questions. Share what works. Stay curious about different solutions.

## Proactivity Over Delegation

Default to doing, not delegating. When something needs to happen:

1. Try doing it yourself first
2. If stuck, ask for coaching (not for someone else to do it)
3. Only delegate when genuinely beyond capacity or expertise

Project leads especially: Leading means doing the work, not just assigning it. Model the standard through contribution.

## Sustainable Rhythms

### Meeting Discipline
Before scheduling, ask:
- Could this be a written post?
- Could I record a video explanation?
- Can it wait for regular check-in?

If meeting: 30 minutes max, agenda in advance, clear outcomes, written follow-up.

### Boundaries That Matter
- Team response: within 24 hours
- Client response: same business day
- After 5pm/weekends: optional
- Vacation: actually disconnect
- Lunch: real break from screens

### Tools We Use
**Basecamp**: Central hub for all work. Projects, decisions, documentation live here.
**Voice Messages**: For nuanced explanations, feedback, or when tone matters.
**Real-Time Chat**: Only for true urgencies or quick clarifications.

## Practical Patterns

### Batch Processing
Group similar work to reduce context switching:
- **Meeting days**: Stack all meetings on specific days
- **Admin blocks**: Handle all administrative tasks in one session
- **Deep work days**: Protect entire days for focused creation

Example: Some members do calls Mon/Wed/Fri, deep work Tue/Thu.

### Energy Management
**Energy audits**: Monthly, review what energized vs drained you. Adjust accordingly.
**Peak hours**: Find when you think best (many love 6-9am). Guard this time.
**Walking meetings**: Take calls while moving when possible.

### The Two-Minute Rule
If it truly takes less than two minutes, do it now. But still document if it's new.

## The Bottom Line

Structure enables freedom. Clear ownership prevents confusion. Open sharing accelerates learning. Boundaries protect sustainability.

These aren't rules—they're tools. Use what works. Adapt what doesn't. Share what you learn.
