# Chapter 1: What We Do & Why

Most products fail because they chase wants, not struggles. We help companies stop guessing and start knowing what their customers actually need.

## What Shokuna Does

We're JTBD consultants who help companies understand why customers switch. Through 10-12 forensic conversations with people who actually bought, we uncover the real job they hired your product to do.

No surveys. No focus groups. Just deep, structured interviews that reveal:
- What pushed them to look for something new
- What pulled them toward your solution
- What anxieties almost stopped them
- What habits they had to overcome

We turn these insights into clear direction for your product, marketing, and strategy. Six weeks from start to finish. Your team learns the method while we do the work together.

## Why This Matters

The world doesn't need more features. It needs products that help people make progress.

Every day, talented teams ship things nobody asked for. They chase competitor features, loud customer requests, and industry trends. Meanwhile, the real struggles that drive purchasing decisions stay hidden.

We exist to change this. One company at a time, we're building a world where products are built on understanding, not assumptions.

## How We Work (Core Beliefs)

These principles guide how we operate internally as a team:

**Work doesn't have to be crazy.** 30 focused hours of real work beats 80 hours of busywork. We use AI to amplify thinking, not create more tasks. If you can't fit your work into a reasonable week, we need to choose better, not work longer.

**Contribution is everything.** You're valued for what you ship, not hours logged. When the company grows, everyone benefits. We all get better when any of us gets better. Everyone coaches everyone.

**Trust runs on batteries.** Every relationship has a charge level (0-100%). Delivering on commitments charges it. Breaking promises drains it. When trust drops below 30%, we talk about it directly.

**Say what you mean.** No politics, no subtext, no reading between lines. If you're confused, say so. If something's broken, name it. Clarity before action, always.

**Feedback is fuel.** We use "I like/I wish that" to keep feedback specific and constructive. Share what works and what could work better. No personal attacks, just clear observations.

**Sustainable excellence.** We're building careers, not burning out. Track what energizes you versus what drains you (aim for 75% energizing work). Protect deep work time. Ship good work today over perfect work never. Rest is required, not optional.

## How We're Different

**AI-Amplified**: We use AI to raise our quality bar. Faster iteration and refinement means higher standards for everything we deliver. AI augments our thinking—it doesn't replace it.

**Practitioner-Led**: Everyone masters JTBD. When you hire us, you work directly with experienced practitioners who are deeply invested in your success.

**Selective Service**: We carefully choose projects that align with our values and where we can create real impact.

**Living the Method**: We're not just consultants. We're building our own products, facing the same struggles our clients face. We teach what we practice.

## Our Three-Horizon Plan

**Now (0-12 months)**: Excel at JTBD consulting. Build reputation through exceptional client outcomes. Develop our core team of practitioners.

**Next (1-3 years)**: Create the JTBD dojo—workshops, certifications, and communities for entrepreneurs. Scale our impact through education.

**Later (3-5 years)**: Launch our own products using JTBD principles. Prove the method by building successful businesses ourselves.

We're building to be the sharpest tool in the toolkit—the consultancy companies turn to when understanding their customers becomes critical to survival.
