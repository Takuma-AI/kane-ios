# Chapter 3: Contributors, Members & Partners

Three ways to work with Shokuna. Where you start depends on experience. Where you end up depends on contribution.

## Contributors: Project-Based Specialists

Project-specific work. Project-specific pay. No promises beyond that.

**What you do**: Demand scouting, interview support, workshop facilitation, implementation
**What you get**: 5-15% of project revenue
**What you don't get**: Profit sharing, voting rights, guaranteed future work

Most start here. Low risk both ways. Some become Members within months. Others prefer staying Contributors for flexibility. Both work.

## Members: Regular Team

Part of ongoing work. Share in profits. Help shape operations.

**What you do**: Lead projects, own areas, train others, build methods
**What you get**: 40-60% as project lead, profit sharing, voice in planning
**What you don't get**: Guaranteed income, control over project assignments, equity

Income matches contribution. You lead projects and own areas based on capability and availability.

Invitation based on: consistent quality work, cultural fit, mutual commitment.

## Partners: Co-Founders

Co-own the business. Shape strategy. Carry the biggest risks and rewards.

**What you do**: Set strategy, assign projects, hold ultimate responsibility
**What you get**: Equity ownership, priority on projects, major decision votes
**What you carry**: Personal liability, reputation risk, partner obligations

No guaranteed income—even for Partners. But Partners collectively plan project assignments, prioritizing based on individual financial needs.

Partnership requires: exceptional value creation, mission alignment, unanimous partner agreement.

Currently just founders. May expand selectively.

## Internal Governance

Clear decision-making prevents confusion:

**CEO Authority**: When Partners disagree on company-wide issues, CEO has final say. 

**Area Lead Authority**: Within their specific area, the Area Lead decides—no override except for legal/existential issues.

**Project Assignment**: Partners collectively plan quarterly project allocation, transparently balancing individual financial needs with client requirements and team capabilities.

**Path to Partnership**: Exceptional Members may be offered equity. Terms: 1-year cliff, 3-year vesting. Requires unanimous Partner approval. We prioritize profit sharing over equity dilution.

## When Performance Drops

We address problems early and directly.

### First Signs
Notice something off? Speak up within a week. "I noticed X. Here's the impact. What's going on?"

Anyone can raise concerns. Partners decide responses. Early conversations prevent bigger problems.

### Performance Improvement Plan
For persistent issues, we create a written plan:
- Specific gaps identified
- Clear success metrics
- 30-60 day timeline
- Weekly check-ins
- Documented progress

### No Improvement
Transition time. Members might become Contributors. Contributors get no new projects. We part ways professionally.

## Trust & Accountability

Trust batteries charge and drain through patterns:

**Charging**: Deliver promises. Communicate early. Help others. Own mistakes.
**Draining**: Miss commitments silently. Make excuses. Hide problems. Blame others.

When trust drops below 30%, immediate conversation required. Address it early or watch it poison everything.

## The Human Side

Life happens. Illness, family crises, mental health struggles. We adjust expectations temporarily, provide support, reassess when stable. 

Standards remain, but humanity comes first. Never weaponize someone's life challenges.

## What We Don't Do

- No politics or hidden agendas
- No surprise demotions
- No keeping culture-poisoners
- No ignoring problems
- No arbitrary hierarchies

## Role Clarity

To be explicit about terminology:
- **Lead a project**: You're the primary owner driving client outcomes
- **Own an area**: You have ongoing responsibility and decision authority
- **Assigned to support**: You're contributing specific expertise to someone else's project

Everyone can lead projects (based on readiness). Only Members and Partners own areas.

## The Bottom Line

Three levels. Clear expectations. Direct feedback. Human approach.

Most people want to do great work. We create conditions for it. When that fails despite real effort, we adjust roles or part ways professionally.

Simple system. No BS.
