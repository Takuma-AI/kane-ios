# Chapter 5: Evolution & Growth

Everything in this handbook is a 3-month experiment. What works, we keep. What doesn't, we change.

## Growing Smart, Not Big

Our default answer to hiring is no. Before adding anyone:

1. Can we eliminate this work entirely?
2. Can AI handle it instead?
3. Can we redesign the process?
4. Can existing team handle it with better tools?

Only if all four are "no" do we consider adding people.

Why? Three excellent people outperform ten good ones. Less coordination, clearer ownership, faster decisions, better work.

## AI as Team Member

We use AI for three specific things:

**1. Quality amplification**  
Draft → AI refinement → human judgment → repeat. More iterations = higher standards.

**2. Knowledge gaps**  
Hit something we don't know? AI helps us understand quickly, connect dots, explore options.

**3. Energy drain automation**  
Scheduling, formatting, initial research—tasks that drain but don't require our expertise.

AI augments thinking, doesn't replace it. We still do the synthesis, make the calls, own the outcomes.

## How This Handbook Evolves

### Quarterly Reviews
Every quarter:
- What friction did we hit?
- What experiments did we run?
- What should we keep/change/drop?

### Anyone Can Propose Changes
Notice something broken? Document:
- Specific problem
- Proposed fix
- Expected impact

Bring to quarterly review for discussion.

### 3-Month Experiments
All changes start as experiments:
- Small change
- Clear success metric
- 3-month trial
- Keep or revert based on results

No sacred cows. If something consistently fails, we change it.

## What Never Changes

Methods evolve. These principles don't:
- JTBD excellence
- Direct communication
- Pay matches contribution
- Trust through transparency
- Sustainable pace
- Continuous learning

## Our Ripple Effect

Every client who learns JTBD thinking becomes an advocate for customer understanding. Every product built on real struggles instead of assumptions makes the market smarter. Every team member who grows here carries these methods forward.

We grow through impact multiplication, not headcount.

## Using This Handbook

This is a tool, not scripture. It should enable work, not create bureaucracy.

When something doesn't match reality, change it. When process adds friction without value, eliminate it. When new challenges arise, experiment with solutions.

Stay curious. Challenge what's not working. Share what you learn.

We're building a dojo that creates better builders. That's how real change happens—one practitioner at a time.
