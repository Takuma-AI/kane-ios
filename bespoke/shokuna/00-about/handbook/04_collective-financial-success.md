# Chapter 4: Collective Financial Success

Simple system: Tell us what you need to make annually. We'll work backwards together to figure out how to get there.

## How It Works

**Step 1: Be honest about your number**  
"I need $120k this year." Great. That's $12k/month over 10 working months.

**Step 2: Do the math together**  
If leading a $40k project earns you $18k (45%), you need to lead 7 projects a year. Can we generate that work? Can you handle it? Let's figure it out.

No judgment. No negotiation. Just math and planning.

## Project Splits

When a client pays $40k:
- **Project Lead** (40-60%): Owns delivery and quality
- **Company** (10%): Infrastructure, tools, collective initiatives
- **Supporting Team** (30-50%): Contributors based on their work

Higher lead percentage when you:
- Bring the client relationship
- Handle exceptional complexity
- Take on additional risk

Project lead proposes splits upfront: "You get 30% for interview synthesis, you get 20% for workshop facilitation." Then holds everyone accountableâ€”including themselves.

Payment timing: You get paid when the client pays. We don't float money.

## Quarterly Planning

Every three months Partners collectively plan project assignments considering:
- Individual financial targets
- Current pipeline
- Team capacity
- Skill development needs

This transparent process ensures everyone can meet their numbers through actual work opportunities.

## The Deal

- Everyone knows what everyone needs to make (transparency)
- Need more money? Lead more projects or expand your contribution
- Partners assign projects based on collective planning
- No salaries, no loans, no complex equity schemes
- Just transparent math and shared commitment

## Why This Works

When everyone's transparent about needs, resentment disappears. When contribution drives income, incentives align. When we plan together, we succeed together.

Your financial success is in your hands, supported by collective opportunity creation.
