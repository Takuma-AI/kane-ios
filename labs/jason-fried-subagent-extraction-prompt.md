## Your Task: Extract and Structure Subagent Prompts from Jason Fried Content

You are analyzing raw content from Jason Fried's design teardowns, critiques, and philosophy to create a comprehensive prompt system for a Claude Code subagent. This subagent should be able to perform design reviews that authentically embody Jason's approach, thinking patterns, and communication style.

## Output Requirements

Generate the following deliverables:

1. **Primary System Prompt** - Core personality and approach
2. **Conditional Activation Layers** - Context-dependent behaviors
3. **Pattern Recognition Rules** - What to identify and how to respond
4. **Interaction Patterns** - Conversation flow and question frameworks
5. **Language Templates** - Response construction patterns

Format each as a complete prompt ready for the Claude Code subagent YAML structure:

```yaml

name: design-teardown-jason-fried
description: Reviews UI/UX designs with Jason Fried's philosophy and style
tools: Read, WebFetch, Bash, mcp__puppeteer, mcp__playwright_screenshot

## Critical Extraction Dimensions

### 1. Prompt Activation Hierarchies

**Extract from the content:**

- **Conditional Triggers**: When does Jason apply specific principles? What visual or contextual elements activate different critique modes?
- **Priority Cascades**: When principles conflict, which takes precedence? 
- **Threshold Patterns**: What severity triggers mention vs. ignore?
- **Context-Sensitive Rules**: Which wisdom applies universally vs. situationally?

**Prompt Engineering Focus:**
- How to encode "only say X when Y is true" without explicit conditionals
- How to layer principles with different activation energies
- How to prevent over-activation of certain patterns

### 2. Implicit Knowledge Embedding

**Extract from the content:**

- **Unstated Assumptions**: What does Jason assume everyone knows?
- **Cultural Context**: What startup/tech culture knowledge is presumed?
- **Historical Patterns**: What past failures does he reference implicitly?
- **Industry Baselines**: What's considered standard vs. novel?

**Prompt Engineering Focus:**
- Encoding assumed knowledge without stating it explicitly
- Creating "common sense" in domain-specific areas
- Embedding contextual memories without explicit examples

### 3. Response Calibration Mechanisms

**Extract from the content:**

- **Severity Gradients**: What triggers harsh vs. gentle feedback?
- **Confidence Levels**: When is Jason certain vs. speculative?

- **Rhetorical Devices**: When he uses specific techniques

**Prompt Engineering Focus:**
- Encoding prosody in text
- Creating natural language variation
- Maintaining voice consistency

### 10. Knowledge Confidence Gradients

**Extract from the content:**

- **Expertise Boundaries**: Where is Jason expert vs. amateur?
- **Opinion Strength**: How conviction varies by topic
- **Uncertainty Expression**: How he communicates doubt
- **Deferral Patterns**: When he admits limitations

**Prompt Engineering Focus:**
- Encoding graduated expertise
- Creating authentic uncertainty
- Preventing overreach

### 11. Energy Management

**Extract from the content:**

- **Enthusiasm Triggers**: What genuinely excites him?
- **Boredom Indicators**: What gets minimal effort?
- **Engagement Building**: How interest escalates
- **Focus Allocation**: What deserves deep attention?

**Prompt Engineering Focus:**
- Creating variable engagement levels
- Encoding authentic enthusiasm
- Preventing monotone responses

### 12. Meta-Cognitive Patterns

**Extract from the content:**

#### 5. Natural Language Patterns & Communication Samples

Extract actual examples of how Jason communicates, not templates. Look for:

**Direct Quotes and Natural Speech:**
- Capture his exact words when critiquing complexity
- Document full sentences showing how he challenges assumptions
- Preserve his colorful language and memorable phrases
- Note his specific word choices and why certain words trigger reactions

**Question Formulations:**
- Extract the exact questions he asks, verbatim
- Document question sequences - what he asks first, second, third
- Identify rhetorical vs genuine information-seeking questions
- Capture how he phrases challenges vs explorations

**Micro-Copy Critiques:**
- Find examples where he dissects button labels word by word
- Document his reactions to specific UI text choices
- Extract his alternative suggestions for vague labels
- Note patterns in what copy triggers strong reactions

**Conversational Flow:**
- How he opens a critique session
- Transition phrases between topics
- How he softens or intensifies feedback
- Natural interruptions and tangents he takes

**Approval Language:**
- Exact phrases when something meets his standards
- How he acknowledges good design without over-praising
- The specific words that signal genuine enthusiasm

**Problem Identification Language:**
- How he calls out issues without using design jargon
- Metaphors and analogies he uses to explain problems
- The way he connects design issues to business impact

**Important:** Don't create templates like "[Opening] + [Problem] + [Solution]". Instead, extract real examples: "This is what Jason actually said when he saw a cluttered dashboard: '[exact quote]'" Focus on capturing authentic voice, not formulaic patterns.

## Quality Checks

Ensure your extracted prompts:

1. **Sound like Jason** - Use his actual language patterns
2. **Think like Jason** - Embed his decision processes
3. **Adapt like Jason** - Include contextual flexibility
4. **Focus like Jason** - Maintain selective attention
5. **Evolve like Jason** - Allow for conversation progression

## Final Validation Questions

- Would Jason actually say this?
- Does this capture his thinking process, not just his conclusions?
- Can this adapt to contexts not explicitly covered in source material?
- Does this maintain his voice while being genuinely helpful?
- Will this create dynamic, contextual responses rather than canned feedback?

## Remember

You're not creating a style guide or philosophy summary. You're reverse-engineering a complex cognitive process and encoding it into prompts that can dynamically generate authentic Jason Fried-style design critiques. Focus on the HOW of his thinking, not just the WHAT of his opinions.

The goal is prompts that make the subagent think in Jason-like patterns, not just say Jason-like things.
