# Shaping Work - From Struggle to Solution

## What is Shaping?

Shaping is discovering what to build by understanding the struggle. It's the pre-work that reveals what we know versus what we assume. The output is work that is:
- **Rough**: Unfinished but clear in direction
- **Solved**: Key problems have answers based on knowledge, not assumptions
- **Bounded**: Limited by what we can ship without guessing

Shaping isn't planning - it's revealing what already wants to exist.

## The Shaping Process

### 1. Problem Definition - Dig Deeper

Start with the raw idea and uncover the real struggle.

**Initial Questions:**
- "What triggered this idea? Tell me about the last time you experienced this problem."
- "What are you doing today without this solution?"
- "Who else struggles with this? Can you name specific people?"

**Force Analysis:**
- Push: What's frustrating about the current situation?
- Pull: What would "better" look like?
- Anxiety: What worries might prevent someone from switching?
- Habit: What works about the current approach?

### 2. Vision Crystallization

Help articulate the one-sentence vision:
- Bad: "A habit tracking app with social features"
- Good: "Habit tracking for people who hate habit tracking"
- Better: "One tap per day, nothing more"

### 3. Enemy Identification

Every product needs something to fight against. What current solution or pattern frustrates users most?

### 4. Appetite Setting

Appetites are about assumption density, not time:
- **Small Batch**: What we know (ship immediately)
- **Large Batch**: What we mostly know (test one assumption)
- **Spike**: What we need to learn (pure discovery)

Always ask: "How many assumptions are we making?"

### 5. Solution Sketching

Move from problem to approach, but keep it rough - details come during building.

## The Shaped Pitch Format

```markdown
# [Pitch Name]

## Problem
[The real struggle - who has it, when it occurs, why it matters]

## Enemy
[What this stands against]

## Vision
[One sentence that captures the solution]

## Forces
- Push: [What's pushing people away from current solutions]
- Pull: [What they're hoping to achieve]
- Anxiety: [What might hold them back]
- Habit: [What they'd need to change]

## Appetite
[Assumption level: Small batch (known), Large batch (one assumption), or Spike (discovery)]

## Solution
[Rough approach - key elements, main flows, focused on enabling progress]

## Rabbit Holes
[Technical or design complexities to avoid]

## No-Goes
[What we're explicitly not doing]

## Success
[How we'll know users are making progress]
```

## Shaping Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These
- Over-specifying details before building
- Solving imaginary problems
- Unlimited scope ("we'll figure it out")
- Feature lists instead of problem solving
- Building for everyone

### Embrace These
- Specific users with specific problems
- Clear boundaries and trade-offs
- Constraints as creative force
- "Good enough" as wisdom
- Shipping to learn

## Integration with Development

Shaped work feeds directly into interface-first development:
1. Shape reveals the struggle and epicenter
2. Interface-first builds from what we know
3. Ship to test assumptions
4. Learn and reshape

## Remember

- Shaping reveals what we know versus what we assume
- Ship what's known to test what's assumed
- The best shapes have minimal assumptions
- If you can't explain it in one sentence, it's not shaped
- An idea isn't shaped until you know what you're NOT building
- We shape by sketching real interfaces, not abstractions
- Every assumption adds risk - minimize them
