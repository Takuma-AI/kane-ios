# Subagent Architecture

## Rough Idea
Break the single mega-prompt into specialized subagents that can flesh out different aspects of tasks. Enable even more nuance and progress in the task descriptions.

## Examples
- For some tasks: Create thoughtful AI prompts the user can paste into ChatGPT
- Eventually: Spawn actual subagents users can talk to
- Task detailing: Make steps more specific for different contexts
- Context enrichment: Add background for unfamiliar users

## Why
Single prompt doing everything limits depth. Specialized agents could provide richer elaboration where needed.

## Future Vision
HASHI evolves into a full progress management space, but for now using Basecamp as test container to focus on unique value prop.

## Open Questions
- Which elaborations most urgent? (More detail? Better prompts? Different contexts?)
- Automatic or user-triggered?
- How to maintain coherence across subagents?

## Appetite
