# Kane Vision

A money app that helps you feel good about spending by understanding it from the inside out - then grows into a system uniquely yours.

## The One-Page Version

### What Kane Is
Kane helps you understand your spending from the inside out. Not through categories and budgets, but through understanding why you spend and what it reveals about who you're becoming. Users save $300-500/month not through restriction but through clarity.

### How It Works
Start with two questions: "What purchase are you proud of?" and "What do you regret?" This shifts the conversation from shame to understanding. Through weekly conversations about your actual spending, Kane helps you see patterns you couldn't see alone.

### What Makes It Different
Traditional apps impose categories and limits. Kane grows from your actual behavior. As patterns emerge from your spending, the system develops capabilities in areas where you're investing. Your Kane literally becomes different from everyone else's.

### The Bigger Vision
Kane represents what consumer software becomes in the AI age - not apps with AI features, but systems that grow from your life to amplify your capability. Money is just the starting point. Understanding who you're becoming is the destination.

## Key Insights

### For Users
- Finally feel good about your spending
- Understand where to cut with hope, not shame  
- See your money patterns reveal who you're becoming
- Save money through understanding, not restriction

### For the Market
- Not another budgeting app but a new category
- AI that amplifies human agency rather than replacing it
- Software that grows from use rather than configuration
- Personal development through financial understanding

### For Us
- Start manual to understand what to build
- Money is the lens, transformation is the product
- Systems grow from behavior, not configuration
- Preserve agency while amplifying capability

## The Journey

**Manual Phase (Now):** Be the system for 5-10 people, learn what matters
**MVP Phase:** Build core understanding engine with basic domain emergence
**Growth Phase:** Enable full system evolution and generative interfaces
**Vision Phase:** Platform for human development that starts with money

## Core Principles

1. **Understanding over categorization** - Why matters more than where
2. **Growth over configuration** - Systems emerge from behavior
3. **Agency over automation** - Amplify don't replace human capability
4. **Progress over perfection** - Small changes compound
5. **Truth over aspiration** - Ground everything in actual behavior

## Next Steps

1. Begin manual prototype with close friends (See [`manual-prototype.md`](manual-prototype.md))
2. Document all patterns and insights
3. Build MVP based on manual learnings
4. Test system evolution with small user group
5. Iterate toward the full vision

## Remember

Kane isn't just a money app. It's the first example of software that grows from your actual life to help you become who you want to be. We start with money because money reveals truth. We end with transformation because transformation is the point.
