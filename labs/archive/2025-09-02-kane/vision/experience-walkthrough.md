# Kane Experience Walkthrough

## The Core Experience

Kane teaches you to understand your spending from the inside out by walking you through your own purchases before you sort them.

## Flow

### 1. Opening Questions (Before Bank Connection)

User lands on Kane for the first time.

**Screen 1:** "What's a recent purchase you're really proud of?"
- Open text field
- User types something like "My new climbing shoes" or "$300 cooking class"

**Screen 2:** "What's one you regret?"
- Open text field  
- User types something like "Another online course I won't finish" or "That expensive dinner that wasn't worth it"

**Screen 3:** "Connect your bank to see what your spending reveals"
- Single button to connect via Plaid
- User connects their accounts

### 2. The Teaching Phase (Learning Through Examples)

After bank connection, instead of immediately sorting, Kane picks 3-4 ambiguous transactions to teach the framework.

**Teaching Example 1 - Coffee Shop**

Shows: Blue Bottle Coffee - $31.73 - Tuesday, June 13

Kane: "Let's start with this Blue Bottle purchase. This could be a Want or a Kill depending on context."

Three options appear:
- "This was a meeting with a founder I'm mentoring" 
- "I was avoiding work at home"
- "This is my Tuesday ritual that helps me focus"

User clicks one. 

Kane responds based on choice:
- If meeting: "That's a Want - investing in relationships and work"
- If avoiding: "That's a Kill - buying the feeling of productivity"  
- If ritual: "That's actually a Need - it sustains your routine"

**Teaching Example 2 - Big Restaurant**

Shows: Haisous Vietnamese - $307.31 - Thursday, June 13

Kane: "This dinner could go different ways. What was this about?"

Options:
- "Team dinner I had to host for work"
- "Celebrating a big win with friends"
- "Easier than cooking for the group I invited over"

Based on selection:
- If work obligation: "Sounds like a Need for your role, even if you'd prefer hosting at home"
- If celebration: "Clear Want - intentional investment in joy and connection"
- If convenience: "That's a Kill - you chose easy over meaningful"

**Teaching Example 3 - Subscription**

Shows: Masterclass - $180 - Recurring

Kane: "Subscriptions are tricky. The question is usage."

Options:
- "I watched 3 classes this month"
- "I keep meaning to use it"
- "I forgot this existed"

Response:
- If active: "Want - you're actively learning"
- If aspirational: "Kill - you're paying for the fantasy"
- If forgotten: "Definitely Kill - cancel today"

### 3. The Framework Crystallizes

**Summary Screen:**

"You're getting it! Here's what you've learned:

**Need:** Sustains your life and work (not just survival)
**Want:** Intentional investments in growth, joy, relationships  
**Kill:** Convenience, escape, aspirational purchases you don't use

The same purchase can be different categories based on context. Your Tuesday coffee might be a Need, but Thursday's might be a Kill.

Ready to sort the rest with this framework?"

### 4. Independent Sorting (With Context)

Now the regular sorting interface, but with subtle hints based on patterns.

Shows: Starbucks - $22.50

Hint appears: "Coffee again - ritual or escape?"

User taps: Need / Want / Kill

Transaction fades, next appears.

The hints get less frequent as user builds confidence.

### 5. Insights After First Session

After sorting 20-30 transactions:

"Here's what your money shows:

**You're investing $847/month in climbing and it's working.** 
Tuesday gym, Saturday trips, gear that gets used. You show up consistently. This spending is aligned - you're getting stronger and building community.

**You spent $660 at Costco to host dinner parties, then spent $600 at restaurants instead.**
The groceries probably went bad. You want to cook for people but keep choosing the easier path. That gap is costing you $600/month.

**Your coffee shop spending splits two ways:**
$90 on real meetings where work happened
$93 on avoiding work at home
You already know which ones were worth it.

**The pattern:** Your Wants are clear and consistent - climbing, cooking, meaningful meetings. Your Kills are all the same story - choosing convenience over what you actually want to do.

Tomorrow we'll see if you close that gap."

## Key Design Principles

1. **Teaching through examples, not explanation** - Users learn by categorizing their own ambiguous purchases with guidance

2. **Context is everything** - The same merchant can be Need, Want, or Kill depending on the story

3. **No shame, just clarity** - Kills aren't "bad," they're just misaligned with intention

4. **Patterns emerge from behavior** - After enough sorting, users see their own patterns

5. **The system learns** - Over time, Kane recognizes which coffee shops are for meetings vs escape

## What Makes This Different

Traditional budgeting apps: "You spent $X on restaurants" (category)
Kane: "That restaurant was either celebration (Want) or convenience (Kill) - which was it?" (context)

The user learns to ask themselves these questions BEFORE purchases, not just after.

## Success Metric

Users start pausing before purchases to ask: "Is this a Want or a Kill?" The framework becomes part of their decision-making.
