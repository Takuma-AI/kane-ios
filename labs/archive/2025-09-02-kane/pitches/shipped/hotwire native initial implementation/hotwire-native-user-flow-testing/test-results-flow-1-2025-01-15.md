# Flow 1 Test Results - New User Anonymous Sorting

## Test Session - January 15, 2025

### Environment
- **Device**: iOS Simulator 
- **Rails Server**: localhost:3000
- **App Version**: Fresh rebuild
- **Account Status**: Anonymous/new user

### Actual Flow Results

#### Step 1: App Launch ‚úÖ MOSTLY WORKING
**What I did**: Opened freshly rebuilt KANE app
**What happened**: App launched directly to `/connect` screen (correct behavior)
**Issues Identified**:
- **MINOR UI**: Invisible/transparent navigation bar at top showing "Connect" title
- **IMPACT**: Pushes all content down from center to below center
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Hotwire Native default behavior showing page meta title as native header

#### Step 2: Connect Screen ‚úÖ WORKING
**What I did**: Observed connect screen
**What happened**: Single "Connect" button displayed with proper KANE styling
**Issues**: Only the navigation bar positioning issue noted above

#### Step 3: Initiate Bank Connection ‚úÖ WORKING
**What I did**: Tapped "Connect" button
**What happened**: 
- Button showed active state
- Plaid modal opened properly within app
- Visual styling matched web version (JavaScript-driven)

#### Step 4: Plaid OAuth Flow ‚úÖ WORKING INITIALLY
**What I did**: Went through Plaid flow (Continue as Guest ‚Üí Citibank ‚Üí Continue to Log In)
**What happened**:
- Standard Plaid interface appeared
- OAuth launched in native iOS in-app browser modal (correct)
- Sandbox mode showed Plaid test bank data (First Platypus Bank)
- Completed account selection and OAuth process

#### Step 5: OAuth Completion ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURE
**What I did**: Completed bank OAuth process successfully
**What happened**: 
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Instead of closing in-app browser and returning to app, OAuth redirected to KANE within the in-app browser
- **SESSION PROBLEM**: The KANE session within in-app browser appeared logged out (showing "Connect" instead of logged in state)
- **EXPECTED**: In-app browser should close, return to main app, navigate to `/loading`

#### Step 6: Manual Recovery Attempt ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL RECOVERY
**What I did**: Manually closed in-app browser by tapping "Done"
**What happened**:
- Returned to original Plaid modal (still open)
- Modal showed "Almost done - Select continue to complete connecting to KANE"
- Tapped "Continue" ‚Üí Plaid modal finally closed

#### Step 7: Post-OAuth Navigation ‚ùå WRONG DESTINATION
**What I did**: Nothing (automatic after Plaid modal closed)
**What happened**:
- **WRONG NAVIGATION**: Redirected to account creation screen (save progress)
- **EXPECTED**: Should navigate to `/loading` then transactions
- **INDICATES**: System thinks no transactions exist (but they do exist on web)

#### Step 8: Account Creation Bypass Test ‚ö†Ô∏è REVEALS DATA ISSUE
**What I did**: Clicked "Skip for now" on account creation
**What happened**:
- Navigated to transactions screen
- **NO TRANSACTIONS DISPLAYED**: Empty state despite successful Plaid connection
- **CONFIRMS**: Plaid access token not properly exchanged/stored

### Critical Issues Identified

#### Issue 1: Navigation Headers (Minor)
- **Problem**: Transparent navigation bar showing page titles
- **Impact**: Content positioning slightly off-center
- **Severity**: Minor UI polish
- **Root Cause**: Hotwire Native default behavior

#### Issue 2: OAuth Redirect Handling (Critical)
- **Problem**: OAuth completion redirects to KANE within in-app browser instead of closing browser
- **Impact**: Breaks entire OAuth flow and user experience
- **Severity**: Critical - blocks core functionality
- **Root Cause**: Redirect logic doesn't account for in-app browser context

#### Issue 3: Session Isolation (Critical)
- **Problem**: In-app browser has separate session from main app
- **Impact**: OAuth completion happens in wrong session context
- **Severity**: Critical - prevents proper authentication flow
- **Root Cause**: Cookie/session sharing not configured between app and in-app browser

#### Issue 4: Plaid Token Exchange Failure (Critical)
- **Problem**: Plaid public token not properly exchanged for access token
- **Impact**: No transactions loaded despite successful OAuth
- **Severity**: Critical - blocks core app functionality
- **Root Cause**: Token exchange API call failing or not happening

#### Issue 5: Navigation Flow Logic (Major)
- **Problem**: App navigates to account creation instead of transactions after OAuth
- **Impact**: Confusing user experience, suggests connection failed when it succeeded
- **Severity**: Major - misleading user experience
- **Root Cause**: Logic assumes no transactions = need account creation, but real issue is token exchange

### Flow Assessment - Updated After Navigation Fix

- **Flow Completion**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED** - Cannot complete core functionality
- **User Experience**: 3/5 - Navigation improved, but session and transaction issues remain
- **Fixed Issues**: 
  ‚úÖ Navigation header properly hidden
- **Critical Blockers**: 
  1. OAuth redirect handling in in-app browser (session isolation confirmed)
  2. Plaid transaction sync API failure (new issue found)
  3. Session management between app and browser
  
### Updated Session Isolation Analysis

Server logs confirm the root cause:
- **Main App Session**: `ea165df0457b166ef7a81d1c838e90e9` (Native App: true)
- **In-App Browser Session**: `b0a0cfd2b402103a69c28ea606a39065` (Native App: false)

The SFSafariViewController creates a completely separate session context.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Issues:
1. **In-App Browser Integration**: OAuth redirects not properly handled
2. **Session Management**: App and browser sessions are isolated
3. **Plaid API Integration**: Token exchange not working in native context

#### Secondary Issues:
1. **Navigation Logic**: Incorrect assumptions about user state
2. **UI Configuration**: Default Hotwire Native headers showing

### Immediate Priorities - Updated

#### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Hide navigation headers** - Fixed in SceneDelegate.swift ‚úÖ

#### üîß In Progress  
2. **Fix Plaid transaction sync** - Fixed API parameter structure ‚úÖ  
3. **Fix session isolation** - Need to bridge sessions between WKWebView and SFSafariViewController

#### üîç Next Steps - Updated from Latest Test
4. **Test transaction sync fix** - API fix successful, transactions issue resolved ‚úÖ
5. **Implement OAuth deep linking** - Use custom URL scheme to close in-app browser properly
6. **Fix flash message design** - Current messages overlay poorly, need native toast design
7. **Add sign out button** - Missing from complete screen

#### ‚ùå New Issues Identified
- **OAuth Modal Closing**: In-app browser doesn't close after successful OAuth, stays open
- **Flash Message UX**: Current flash messages are poorly positioned overlays
- **Navigation Gap**: No sign out option on complete screen

This test reveals that while the initial setup works well, the core OAuth and data integration is fundamentally broken in the native context. The issues are technical integration problems rather than design or flow problems.
