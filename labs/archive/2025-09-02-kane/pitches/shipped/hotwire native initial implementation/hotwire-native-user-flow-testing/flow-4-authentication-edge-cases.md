# Flow 4: Authentication Edge Cases

## Test Scenario
**Goal**: Validate various authentication scenarios and edge cases that can break user experience
**User Type**: Various authentication states
**Expected Duration**: Variable depending on specific test case

## Authentication Scenarios to Test

### Scenario A: Session Expiry During Use
**Context**: User is actively sorting when session expires
**Expected Challenge**: Graceful handling without losing progress

#### Expected Flow:
1. **Active Sorting**: User is mid-way through sorting transactions
2. **Session Expires**: Backend session times out during sorting
3. **Detection**: Next transaction sort attempt fails with auth error
4. **Handling**: Graceful re-authentication without losing progress
5. **Recovery**: Resume sorting where user left off

### Scenario B: App Backgrounding/Foregrounding
**Context**: User backgrounds app and returns later (session may expire)
**Expected Challenge**: Seamless re-entry experience

#### Expected Flow:
1. **Background App**: User switches to another app mid-sorting
2. **Time Passes**: Sufficient time for potential session expiry
3. **Foreground App**: User returns to KANE app
4. **Session Check**: App checks authentication status
5. **Appropriate Action**: Continue OR re-authenticate smoothly

### Scenario C: Fresh Install/First Launch
**Context**: User installs app for first time or after deletion
**Expected Challenge**: Clean onboarding without confusing states

#### Expected Flow:
1. **First Launch**: App opens with no previous session/data
2. **Authentication State**: No stored credentials or session
3. **Entry Point**: Clear path to either sign in or create account
4. **Progressive Flow**: Guide to connection and sorting

### Scenario D: Network Connectivity Issues
**Context**: Authentication attempts with poor or no network
**Expected Challenge**: Graceful degradation and retry mechanisms

#### Expected Flow:
1. **Auth Attempt**: User tries to sign in with poor connectivity
2. **Network Failure**: Request fails or times out
3. **Error Handling**: Clear messaging about connectivity issue
4. **Retry Mechanism**: Easy way to retry when connection returns
5. **Offline Handling**: Appropriate behavior if completely offline

### Scenario E: Invalid Credentials
**Context**: User enters wrong email/password
**Expected Challenge**: Clear error messaging and recovery path

#### Expected Flow:
1. **Sign In Attempt**: User enters incorrect credentials
2. **Validation Failure**: Backend rejects credentials
3. **Error Display**: Clear, helpful error messaging
4. **Form State**: Maintain form state, clear password field only
5. **Recovery Options**: Password reset, account creation links

### Scenario F: Account Creation Edge Cases
**Context**: Various account creation scenarios
**Expected Challenge**: Smooth onboarding for various user states

#### Expected Flows:
- **Email Already Exists**: Clear messaging and sign-in redirect
- **Invalid Email Format**: Client-side validation with helpful feedback
- **Password Requirements**: Clear requirements and validation
- **Network Issues During Creation**: Proper error handling and retry

### Scenario G: Sign Out and Re-Authentication
**Context**: User signs out intentionally and signs back in
**Expected Challenge**: Clean state reset and smooth re-entry

#### Expected Flow:
1. **Sign Out**: User triggers sign out from app
2. **State Cleanup**: Clear all user data and session
3. **Entry State**: Return to appropriate entry screen
4. **Re-Authentication**: Smooth sign in process
5. **Data Restoration**: Proper restoration of user's transaction data

### Scenario H: Multiple Account Switching
**Context**: User has multiple KANE accounts (if supported)
**Expected Challenge**: Proper account isolation and switching

#### Expected Flow:
1. **Account A**: User signed in with first account
2. **Sign Out**: Clean logout from Account A
3. **Account B**: Sign in with different account
4. **Data Isolation**: No data bleed between accounts
5. **State Management**: Proper transaction state for Account B

## Technical Edge Cases

### Session Token Management
**Expected Behaviors**:
- Proper token storage and retrieval
- Automatic token refresh when possible
- Graceful handling of invalid/expired tokens
- Secure token cleanup on sign out

### Cookie/Session Persistence
**Expected Behaviors**:
- Persistent sessions across app launches
- Proper cookie management in WebView
- Secure storage of authentication state
- Clean session cleanup when needed

### Background App Refresh
**Expected Behaviors**:
- Appropriate session validation on app foreground
- Background refresh of authentication status
- Proper handling of expired background sessions
- No unnecessary authentication prompts

- Rails Server: [localhost:3000 / app.kane.money]
- Network Condition: [Good / Poor / Offline / Variable]
- Starting Account State: [Clean / Existing / Multiple]

### Pre-Test Setup
**Authentication State**: [Describe starting condition]
**Account Details**: [Email, previous data, etc.]
**Expected Scenario**: [What edge case you're testing]

### Actual Flow Results

#### Scenario Setup
**What I did**: [How you created the edge case condition]
**System state**: [Describe resulting system state]
**User perspective**: [What user would see at this point]

#### Edge Case Trigger
**What happened**: [How the edge case manifested]
**System response**: [How app/Rails responded]
**User experience**: [What user saw/experienced]

#### Recovery Process
**What I did**: [How you attempted to recover]
**System handling**: [How well system handled recovery]
**Final state**: [Where you ended up]

### Authentication Edge Case Issues
- [ ] **Error messaging**: Clear and helpful error messages?
- [ ] **Recovery path**: Easy way to recover from errors?
- [ ] **State preservation**: Does app maintain context during auth issues?
- [ ] **Security**: Proper handling of sensitive authentication data?

### User Experience Issues
- [ ] **Confusion**: Any confusing states or unclear messaging?
- [ ] **Friction**: Unnecessary barriers to completing auth?
- [ ] **Progress loss**: Does user lose work due to auth issues?
- [ ] **Trust**: Does error handling maintain user confidence?

### Technical Issues
- [ ] **Session management**: Proper handling of session lifecycle?
- [ ] **Network resilience**: Graceful handling of network issues?
- [ ] **Data consistency**: Consistent state across auth changes?
- [ ] **Performance**: No blocking or slow auth operations?

### Overall Assessment

## Key Areas for Attention

### Security Considerations
1. **Token Security**: Proper storage and handling of auth tokens
2. **Session Management**: Secure session lifecycle management
3. **Data Protection**: No sensitive data leakage between states
4. **Credential Handling**: Secure input and validation of credentials

### User Experience Quality
1. **Error Communication**: Clear, helpful error messages
2. **Recovery Paths**: Easy ways to recover from auth problems
3. **State Preservation**: Maintain user context during auth flows
4. **Confidence Building**: Maintain user trust through reliable auth

### Technical Robustness
1. **Network Resilience**: Handle poor connectivity gracefully
2. **State Consistency**: Maintain consistent app state across auth changes
3. **Performance**: Fast and responsive authentication operations
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Handle all possible authentication states

### Integration Testing
1. **Rails Integration**: Proper communication with authentication endpoints
2. **WebView Coordination**: Correct session sharing between native and web
3. **Platform Integration**: Use iOS authentication patterns appropriately
4. **Cross-Session Behavior**: Proper handling of multiple app launches

These edge cases represent the real-world scenarios that can break user trust and adoption. Authentication must be rock-solid reliable while remaining invisible to users when everything works properly. Poor authentication experience can instantly kill user engagement with KANE.
