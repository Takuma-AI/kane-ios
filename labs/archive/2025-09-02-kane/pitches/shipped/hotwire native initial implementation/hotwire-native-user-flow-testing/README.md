# KANE Hotwire Native User Flow Testing

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive documentation for testing and fixing user flows in the KANE Hotwire Native iOS app. The goal is to systematically identify and resolve issues across all user journeys.

## Documentation Structure

### Planning Documents
- **[initial-plan.md](initial-plan.md)** - Original implementation plan and current status
- **[flow-testing-framework.md](flow-testing-framework.md)** - Testing methodology and analysis framework

### Flow Testing Guides
- **[flow-1-new-user-anonymous.md](flow-1-new-user-anonymous.md)** - First-time user experience without account
- **[flow-2-returning-user-authenticated.md](flow-2-returning-user-authenticated.md)** - Existing user sorting new transactions  
- **[flow-3-refresh-new-transactions.md](flow-3-refresh-new-transactions.md)** - Checking for and sorting new transactions
- **[flow-4-authentication-edge-cases.md](flow-4-authentication-edge-cases.md)** - Various authentication scenarios and edge cases

### Test Results (To be created during testing)
- **test-results-[date].md** - Actual test results and issue documentation
- **issue-analysis.md** - Pattern analysis across all flows
- **solution-plan.md** - Holistic solution strategy

## Testing Approach

### Phase 1: Systematic Flow Testing
1. Test each flow thoroughly using provided templates
2. Document expected vs actual behavior
3. Classify issues by severity and scope
4. Identify patterns across multiple flows

### Phase 2: Issue Analysis
1. Analyze patterns in identified issues
2. Identify root causes affecting multiple flows
3. Prioritize fixes by impact and effort
4. Create holistic solution strategy

### Phase 3: Solution Implementation
1. Implement fixes addressing root causes first
2. Validate fixes across all affected flows
3. Ensure no regression in working flows
4. Polish and optimize user experience

## Current Known Issues

### Confirmed Working
- ✅ App builds and launches successfully
- ✅ Environment-based URL switching (localhost vs production)
- ✅ Basic navigation between screens
- ✅ CSS styling (black background, hidden navigation bars)
- ✅ Native app detection in Rails

### Known Problems
- ❌ Plaid OAuth modal may not dismiss properly
- ❌ Navigation flow disruptions and wrong redirects
- ❌ UI elements appearing web-like instead of native
- ❌ Authentication persistence issues
- ❌ Unclear refresh mechanisms

### Areas Needing Investigation
- ⚠️ Performance during transitions
- ⚠️ Error handling and recovery
- ⚠️ Session management across app launches
- ⚠️ Memory usage and optimization

## Quick Start Testing

1. **Choose a flow** from the four main flows
2. **Read the expected behavior** in the corresponding flow document
3. **Follow the test steps** on your device/simulator
4. **Document actual behavior** using the provided template
5. **Note all issues** regardless of severity
6. **Move to next flow** until all are tested

## Success Criteria

### User Experience Goals
- Smooth, native-feeling interactions throughout
- No white flashes or navigation disruptions
- Proper modal behavior (especially Plaid OAuth)
- Consistent KANE visual design and branding
- Fast, responsive performance

### Technical Requirements
- All flows complete without critical errors
- Authentication persists properly across sessions
- Navigation follows expected patterns
- Error handling is graceful and helpful
- Performance matches or exceeds PWA version

## Contributing to Testing

When testing flows:
1. **Be descriptive** - Document exactly what you see, not what you think should happen
2. **Note everything** - Even small UI issues can indicate larger problems
3. **Test edge cases** - Try to break things intentionally
4. **Consider user perspective** - How would a real user react to this?
5. **Document context** - Device, iOS version, network conditions, etc.

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues during testing:
1. Check existing flow documentation for similar issues
2. Document the specific problem thoroughly
3. Note any error messages or unusual behavior
4. Try to reproduce the issue consistently
5. Consider if this is a pattern affecting multiple flows

The goal is to create a comprehensive picture of all issues so we can address root causes rather than symptoms, resulting in a truly polished native KANE experience.
