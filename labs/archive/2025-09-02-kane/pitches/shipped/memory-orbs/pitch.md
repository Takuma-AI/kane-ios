# Memory Orbs

## Problem

"BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE $14.50" tells us nothing. Was it your morning ritual? Meeting someone? Two coffees means what - treating a friend or double-caffeinating? We can't learn from spending we can't remember.

## Enemy

Bank statements that show WHERE but not WHY.

## Vision

Transform transactions into memories by building context around each purchase.

## Forces

**Push:** Merchant codes feel meaningless  
**Pull:** We want to understand why we spend  
**Anxiety:** Will context feel invasive?  
**Habit:** Quick fraud checks, no reflection  

## Appetite

One week.

## Solution

### The Core Insight: Context Accumulates

Transactions don't need to be "matched" - they need context to accumulate around them. Like memories forming in our minds, each transaction gathers meaning from the signals around it.

**A transaction arrives:** "Amazon $176.38"

**Context begins to build:**
- An order confirmation email from yesterday  
- The item ships today, triggering the charge
- A shipping notification tomorrow with tracking

**After one hour, a memory forms:** "Netflix 4K projector for apartment"

### The Architecture

Your receipts forward to KANE (one-time setup, 60 seconds). Then:

1. **Context pools** - Every email becomes searchable context
2. **Transactions wait** - One hour for context to gather
3. **Memories crystallize** - The best available context transforms the transaction

Not forced matching. Not manual entry. Just context naturally accumulating around each transaction, like dust around a star forming a planet.

### What This Looks Like

**Morning coffee:**
- "BLUE BOTTLE $14.50" → "Morning coffee meeting" 
- (Context: Calendar had "Coffee with David", time was 9am)

**Amazon chaos:**
- Three charges over three days → "Japanese curtains, throw pillows, tension rod"
- (Context: Order email listed all three, shipping emails confirmed dates)

**Hidden purchases:**
- "PAYPAL *PAY IN 4" → "Etsy: Handmade art from ArtByPtichka"
- (Context: Etsy receipt forwarded, PayPal is just the processor)

### Why One Hour Matters

Immediate matching fails because context hasn't arrived yet. An hour gives breathing room:
- Receipts land in your inbox and forward
- Shipping confirmations arrive
- The transaction settles from pending

Like developing a photograph - the image needs time to emerge.

## Success

We remember why we bought things. Each transaction becomes a moment we can revisit, not a merchant code to decode.

## Technical Truth

**Works beautifully (80%):**
- Email receipts with clear order details
- Recurring subscriptions  
- Local merchants at consistent times

**Works sometimes (50%):**
- Amazon's split shipments
- PayPal hiding real merchants
- Delayed email receipts

**Doesn't work (yet):**
- Cash transactions
- Venmo/Zelle descriptions
- International purchases

But even 70% context is transformative. The story emerges: "I spent $800 setting up my apartment" not "$125.62 + $176.38 + $49.51..."

## Why It Matters

Show me the money reveals values, but only with context. Memory Orbs doesn't add data - it reveals the story already hidden in your transactions. 

Money becomes memory. Memory enables wisdom.
