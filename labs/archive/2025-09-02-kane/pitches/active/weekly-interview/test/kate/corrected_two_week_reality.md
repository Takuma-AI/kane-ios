# Your Corrected Two-Week Spending Reality - August 12-25, 2025

## Cleaning Up the Duplicates

Looking at the raw data, there are clear duplicates (like Costco showing up on both Aug 17 and 18 for the same amount). Let me identify the ACTUAL unique purchases:

## Week 1 (Aug 12-18) - Actual Spending

**AI/Development Tools:**
- OpenAI: $83.47 (multiple API charges)
- N8n Cloud: $24.00 (automation tool)
- Jotlabs: $39.88 + $43.00 = $82.88 (note-taking app)
- Descript: $53.28 (video editing, duplicated Aug 13-14)
- Calendly: $12.00
**Total: ~$255**

**Infrastructure/Home:**
- Amazon: $19.36 + $98.75 + $128.93 = $247.04
- Costco: $105.27 (only once, not twice)
- Rugs: $146.63 (duplicated Aug 13-14, actual once)
**Total: ~$499**

**Daily Life/Food:**
- Trader Joe's: $45.02 (duplicated, actual once)
- Sweet Bean: $7.37 + $12.85 + $6.70 = $26.92
- Coffee shops: $20.74 total
- Mariano's: $9.30 (duplicated, actual once)
**Total: ~$102**

**Services/Transport:**
- Lyft: $24.99 (duplicated, actual once) 
- FedEx: $11.01 (duplicated, actual once)
- Nails: $18.00 + $15.00 = $33.00
- PayPal/Google: $49.65
**Total: ~$118**

## Corrected Week 1 Total: ~$974 (not $1,064)
## Week 2 Total: $1,001
## **Actual Two-Week Total: ~$1,975**

## The Real Burn Rate

**Daily average: $152** (not $158)
**Monthly projection: $4,560** (not $5,000)

Still substantial, but more manageable. You need ~$7-8k/month income to feel comfortable (not $10k).

## The Pattern Still Holds

- You're in a major setup phase
- Heavy AI tool investment ($255 + $284 = $539 over two weeks)
- Infrastructure building (apartment, workspace)
- Daily living costs are actually reasonable (~$200 total for food/transport over two weeks)

**The pressure is real but not as intense.** Still, $4,560/month burn rate requires serious income momentum soon.

**Key question:** How do you turn that $539 in AI tools into revenue generation?
