# Should I Buy This? - Your Purchase Decision Partner

## The Core Struggle

You're standing in a store or browsing online, debating a purchase. The internal dialogue: "Do I need this? Can I afford it? Will I regret it? Is this me being impulsive or intentional?"

Currently, you either guess, ask a friend who doesn't know your finances, or buy it and hope for the best.

## The Solution

Ask KANE. Based on weeks of understanding your spending patterns, what you mark as wants vs kills, and what you've told it about your goals, KANE can help you decide.

Not by telling you yes or no, but by asking the right questions:
- "This is similar to [past purchase] that you marked as a kill. Same situation?"
- "You've been doing great avoiding [pattern]. What's different about this?"
- "Last time you bought [similar item], you said [reason]. Does that apply here?"

## The Interface

Dead simple. Three ways to engage:

1. **Quick Check**: "Should I buy [thing] for [$amount]?"
2. **Photo + Price**: Snap a photo, add price, get guidance
3. **Talk It Through**: Voice note about what you're considering

KANE responds with:
- Pattern recognition: "This fits/doesn't fit your usual wants"
- gentle coaching: Questions that help you decide for yourself
- Historical context: "Last time you faced this choice..."

## Why This Works

- **Real-time intervention** - Catches you at the moment of decision
- **Pattern-based** - Uses your actual history, not generic advice
- **Non-judgmental** - Helps you think, doesn't shame
- **Gets smarter** - Every decision teaches KANE more about your values

## The Bigger Vision

This becomes the bridge between weekly reviews and daily life. The weekly interview teaches KANE your patterns. Daily purchase decisions reinforce or evolve those patterns. It's a living system that helps you become who you want to be, one purchase at a time.

## Success Metrics

- Users ask about purchases before making them
- Users report feeling more confident in decisions
- Decrease in kills week over week
- Users naturally explain their reasoning (sign of clarity)

## Technical Notes

- Requires solid pattern recognition from sorting history
- Need at least 2-3 weeks of data for meaningful guidance
- Should feel conversational, not algorithmic
- Privacy crucial - these are vulnerable moments
