Me: And are you good with sustenance? Like you don't need food or anything? No, I had a fish. And pop chips, okay? Do you need? Substitute. Going to the best tonight with the Japanese, okay? So. That's that. So earlier, the basecamp mcp stuff. I tracked with this. So there's a few cards that I've already moved to done. That was that. So I'm just letting you know what this is. Yeah, when you have real projects to complete. There's a value to having it as the card table. As opposed to do list. Yeah. And then what I was thinking. The main thing that I wanted to share was the to do list. So if you had over to the Progress. So basically my idea, and I'm open to this changing. But also, we could ignore the kanji if we want to remove it. Basically, it's like the five elements. And I thought about. It's in the order of the five elements, the way they're usually put. So the gold is kind of wood is the more operational. Like talking about OS stuff like how we work. And then water is consulting. Fire is identity. And brand like the stuff that you've been waiting for. The crests. Oh, yeah. Not, I'd be wanting to work on that with you. Yeah. It's like fire for soul. What is the soul of this thing? And then Earth is for operations. Like expenses. Bank account setup, that kind of stuff. Like boring legal stuff. So then my thing green and this red. Then shouldn't this be red? And this week green it is supposed to be. Go look at Cardview. I'm not sure how that color gets. Wrong. It's probably when you choose to add it to the hill chart. It might be. Oh, if you click on update, does it change? Think so. It might just be what it is. Okay? Maybe they don't let you change that. Yeah. Okay? Doesn't matter. So that was my thinking, was that I would be okay with. It being less of we constantly add a bunch more new lists type of situation and more of a no. Here are the top line goals. For. Let's try it out. Yeah. And if it doesn't work, we'll change it. Yeah. Because I'm like, there should be relatively. Especially at this stage where we're figuring things out. Where it's not like we're working, quote, unquote, in the business as much as we're working on the business. There should be a set of milestones that is relatively fixed until they're done. And whatever we do and whatever to dos that we change is like we need to. It's almost like a good strategic exercise to think through. Well, which goal does it fall under? What is the milestone? What new assumptions have we made about the milestone? That needs to be adjusted. And so if you look at that, The list. Click on. Let's see. Click on (Kate) like the first one. Like the utter groups just half the scope it out. To do. And then if you click into them, It, like, has the context for, like, why this becomes relevant, what are some nuances to it, like, when does this. When this becomes active, that kind of stuff. That's like sculpt us out later. But here's the thinking around why this milestone matters, which could change. Type of thing. So now, because we can access basically hashi like capabilities through something like pod code, it doesn't have to be like you make a list once. And that's it. And it's less of like, let's have an infinite sea of a bunch of to do lists. And it's more like, let's stick to and keep refining what the goals are. And create pieces that will lead up to that. Goal. Okay? So now you can open cursor. So go back to cursor. And you've already cloned it before, so you just need to update it. So, like, if you open, if you close, or like, new window. There should already be talk models. Yeah. Yeah, this isn't rated a new one. So then you just need to. You do. One thing, one shortcut that I set up was. Command T to just pull up a terminal, but that's, like, a custom thing. So if you want to set up. Net shortcut. No. I made it such that it would pull it up even if I originally closed everything. It would pull it up in the main window instead of down there. On a command panel. Got it. Because I need to do this or something. Right? Yeah. So say, pull the latest from Main. Great. Now. Hit, slash, see what comes up. Okay. It doesn't come up here yet. So you got to control C, Control C, trl, and then hit Cloud again so that it reloads. I did off. So now hit the slash. Command. So you see how I made a few new tools? There's setup. So go to setup. Click on knowledge. Just ask, like, something I wanted to show you. Click. What? Open knowledge. Pieces. I have the whole sequoia capital AI ascent. Wow. We'll figure it out. Oh, I know why. Because it's referencing Chef's Repository, which you don't have access to. Because he forked it. Yeah. So it organized all of. The content into the insights with quotes. Jtbd. And then that Bellaji tech versus media was the thing that you sent me. That was like a few hours up there. That was like a few hours long. And you were like, this is the kind of thing that I wanted summary on. And basically the few hours of podcast was broken down into the chapters. Interesting. Go ahead. You see how I made the custom status line? Yeah. Go to a new start, a new terminal. Start our new cloud. Like click on a Claude logo. We (Kate) wait for this. This one. The reason why I say that is that we gotta wait for this one to be done in order to be able to switch the output style. But now type out slash output style. Hit enter. And then tts status. There we go. Yes, and don't ask again. I think now it's going to start talking to you. Let's see. I'm trying to. Did I now commit those. I'm ciera What? The only tool I care about making sure that you 100% have right now is basecamp. Yet. I wanna show you Well, this is figuring it out. Here, So this Kane vision folder Let me close this This you see this Kanye vision folder? Wait. What? It's not. Mirroring anymore. No. Six That happened so far. The Internet here is bad. Like, I'm gonna swap the modem in this weekend. Mean, the router. Sorry. And if that doesn't fix it, then I'm gonna cancel. And just have them reinstall because I'm not gonna pay them until the Internet actually works. Yeah. The only way to do it. And you can save money by staying starting a new plan anyway. Yeah. Make sense. Missions.  
Them: Cane vision files all committed.  
Me: Why are they not talking to you? Yet? I guess it's not done yet, so there's nothing to update. You wanna look at the prompt for that? Let's see. Outfit styles. TTS status. After every response, you must execute on a TTS command to announce your current status or what action is needed from the user. And then it, like, puts this like, audio thing and then immediately execute the bash command. Say, the message. I guess. Is this that's, like, the most, like, wait. To do this. Like, there's a bunch of complicated things online that people have done. Yes. It's good enough. It's fine. I'm like, I really don't like the that voice. But I don't whatever. Yes. I just care about face cam. Yeah. It keeps running into the EPC. That's a edge case oh, there's a that's a case I didn't design for. It's like, what happens to some module that you don't have access to? It's okay. It's good to know. These are all good things. Like, whenever we have a setback, with stuff like this, it's like, helpful data. Yeah. Like, when I was doing programming, code academy stuff, it was always, like, I had to work with everybody to embrace errors. And things that are, oh, that wasn't supposed to happen that way. I thought, okay. Cool. Let's fix it. Like, that's part of the game. Yeah. Open a new new card. Because the thing with the MCP servers is that it could test it directly, but it won't connect to cloud until you quote, unquote, restart Cloud by quitting and restarting or starting a new session.  
Them: Found uncommitted changes in all servers.  
Me: Okay. That might be part of the problem. Are we just gonna wait? Till this is done? Or Well, it's testing, but, like, we can also see for ourselves. The status of things by hitting slash m c p. Why shouldn't we use a wait? Because it's, like, two different things. So it still says no MCP servers configured. Because it's setting it up right here. It says testing. It says running MCP server setup. Yes. But the thing above it said, now let me test one of the servers to make sure it works. So it's like, it's not connected to Claude yet. You just gotta be patient. Those are two different things. Basically, the the main call it epiphany or whatever. I feel like it's a continuation of a lot of things that we've talked about. But the main epiphany is that, like, essentially, what we're saying is that if we understand the way you spend and why. Then we also understand it becomes a very natural form factor for personal agents. It it's it's a floodgate. It's the it's the the the first door and the floodgate of the whole set of doors. Yes. But it's also, like, fundamentally, there's a big paradigm shift in this idea of no, letting people build their own agents have to mean they literally go to an a blank page or a prompt box and go like, here. I want you to do this for me. Because it's like there's value in discovering what is even needed. Or what is what is what actually matters. Well, I think there's something to be said about also having opinionated software. Yes. Like, we this is how we choose to live and be treated and interact with this technology. Yeah. And whoever fucks with this way Yeah. Of approaching their life Yeah. Yeah. This is gonna help you a lot. Yes. Right? It's, like, it's not for everybody. Needs to be polarizing. Needs to be almost, no. This is for people who wanna live the way we wanna live. Yeah. With their budget and with their whatever. Like, that's, like, the key. It's like using the using what you spend on and what you care about studying. Why is it talking about cloud desktop? Okay. Alright. We're just we're just No. It's not We're just we're just let let's see what it does. Let's just see what it does. No. It's saying the it's saying the wrong thing. When it's off track. Say it wrong. Pping. No. Let's just see where it stops. Let's just see where it stops. You're so impatient. It's not about patience. See? It was like, got mad at you. Why don't you just wait? Why can't you just let it run? What's wrong with letting it run? Because if it's in the middle of something, it will go ahead and finish that before it reads this. Setup complete. Restart quad desktop. You're absolutely right. Gas is is. Stop telling she's right. Tell her she's racist. That's what I'm gonna say. Instead. I'm gonna have it come up with an insult. Every time. This screen doesn't work. So I have to get on the comfy couch. It's the Oh, hell yeah. What? You aren't showing me how to do anything. That's all you wanted. I need to fix the setup prop so that it always knows what to do. There's a fifth one called ImageGen, but it was buggy, so I didn't I removed it. Yearby. MCP servers MCP servers connected to Cloud Code. Hey. The voice is a little different. You'd upgraded the thing. What? I upgraded what? Mac OS. I'm saying let's set up the base camp, but So we can test the MCP server. I know how excited you are. No. I know how excited you are about the base game of CP. Account is now set up. You haven't logged in yet. What is it talking about? Yep. Reconnect. Okay. I'll go do it. You'll go do what? I'll get the off tone thing. There we go. What? Did I seriously not set up this is so infuriating. I have to do that. Right? Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Visit Hashi for tokens. So look at this. Did it not did the copy button not work? So now this is this is using the Hashi app, which already connected to your account. Oh my god. What? I think it's What? That's you. Yeah. Base camp setup complete. That's annoying. Isn't that your stuff and not mine? Yeah. So why don't I just go get mine? This was supposed to show you yours. I know. But it's not. But, like, it you can't go to base camp and do it? No. It doesn't exist. Not at all. Like, you basically need an app to get it. Okay. Let's troubleshoot it. I am can I do we wanna spend the rest of our time doing this, or do we wanna You don't need to look at the screen. I can You can use it in the computer. So I was just thinking about, like, what this is. Like, just from the ground up, I was like, Yeah. Not because I care about the onboarding, but because I think it shapes the It's just like making the landing page. Exactly. Exactly. Let's see. I made a simulations folder with, like, different sample transactions, and there's yours, but where did your data go? Your data is somewhere. I pulled your data from when we first exported it from Monarch. And then there's this. So I guess, like, what I was thinking about is, like, you you Open his app, and it's almost like it's trying to it immediately shifts your mindset into not oh, what's my budget? How much money do I have left? Like, yes, that that will all come, but if first helps you understand hey. Nobody can force you to spend less. In order to spend less, you gotta spend right. Which means, like, investing in the right places. So case in point, what's one thing that you spent on that this week that you actually felt like was well worth as well? Well, before that question is posed, I think we need to get buy in. Like, for even you and me, if we're the only use of this. We need this system to basically give us a reason to care. Yeah. To give it the truth. Yeah. And that reason would be meeting us where we are and being reasonable about it. So we're about I'm gonna ask you a few questions. And the purpose of these questions very similar to the jobs to be done in a new setup, it's like, we're just trying to figure out how we can best help you. And we need to understand what actually matters to you, what motivates you, and a little bit about how you think how you think we got here. Yeah. Where you're using you're downloading this app, setting it up, and trying to and you're open to at least getting help from us. To figure out your money and your choice Yeah. And our promise our commitment is, you know, whatever. We we need to make that clear too. The promise and commitment in terms of there's the in terms of trust thing that you'd emphasized last week, but then there's also in terms of value of, like, a promise and commitment is that will help you gain clarity on and help you use, like, spend in the right places. Yeah. So that, like it's like it's like you're meeting someone for the first time, and you're trying to make sure that the first impression is like, we're this is good. Yeah. Good first impression. Yeah. It's like you're trying to, like, choosing a therapist or something like that. Whatever. Like, I downloaded Rocket Money, and I went through the onboarding. Mhmm. And the first screen was I I posted it. I posted just screenshots, and the first thing was, like, why are you here? And then it's like five options. Track my net worth. Save money, cancel my subscriptions. Yeah. Saw all those. Yeah. Which is, like, already it's already missing the mark. Yeah. And it's almost like I I was thinking about it where there's a way for this, like, first conversation, this, like, meet and greet to exude that care where it's like, I'm gonna explain like, I'm gonna here's why. You know? Like, here's our commitment. And our promise and and why we're asking these questions. And then it's like, it listens. And that once you've answered the question of what's a purchase that was good, when it then goes on to very naturally also use this opportunity to explain what a want is Mhmm. Versus, like, a kill. Right? Because then you could infer an example of oh, maybe, like, this was a good purchase, but for someone else, it could have been a kill. Or, like, you know, all of that. That explanation could be adapted dynamically to whatever you say. So it's like this isn't just asking you for information. It listens. Yes. And this is what the AI first money app is capable of doing that others wouldn't be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, like, the whole value of talking to a or having a human, the reason why you're willing to pay a lot of money for somebody to be your, like, coach and therapist is that there's value in that two way direction, two way relationship. Right? So, like, that happens. So that's onboarded. So by the time you ask them for the bank's connection, they've already invested some emotional energy and explaining what matters to them, even if it's just in an instance of a single purchase. So then you're like, now let's, you know, look at your most recent purchases to understand more to get, like, so we can understand a little bit more of the picture. And then you connect your bank account, maybe your email too. And then I was thinking And then I was thinking about whether it makes sense for this first experience to go purely chronological where it feels like you're just sorting through your past week of transactions versus because you're looking at the past seven days, you can cluster it. You could be like the narration could continue where if still feels like it's almost like a handholded onboarding process to sorting. Where it's like, for example, here's like all the food you just you bought the past week. Which ones are kills? Which ones are ones? And it it it guides you through thinking about that, and you reflect upon that. Here are all the other things that you bought. This thing seemed to be, like, especially important you. You spent $222 on Claude. And then, like, ask you about that. So then, like, if you do it the right way, the user would open up, and they would actually, you know, talk about that. But then, like, within this the span of sorting those seven days or, like, thinking through those seven days of spending, they already get the quote, unquote mirror. So immediately after that, they get the mirror of basically your current money story. What are the clusters of things that you are that are well spent to you, and what are the things you're spending on that aren't serving those clusters. For example, on my sample purchase from last week, there was a $82 Paris baguette purchase. And upon clarification, that was me showing up for my friend who is having a little bit of a difficult time. Mentally. And I know that her having a birthday cake would have meant a lot to her. So that's, you know, what I would say. Or something like that. That's why I spent that money. So then that money story, my current money story would show up as, like, you care about investing in x y z, but then there's also all these other money that wasn't well spent that you didn't actually feel like know, it was, like, kind of, like, an impulse buy of, like, you know what? I need a food scale, and I'm gonna buy it from Amazon. And it's like, did I actually use that food scale a week later? Not really. It wasn't well spent. That kind of thing. You know? So it was showing me that money story, but then what I was thinking or the epiphany that I had this week is that by having an evolving money story, you basically can have a dynamically or, like, a fluid experience where it feels like the app is a living representation of the areas of life that you care about that you're investing in. And it's a very natural point to then in each of those areas, have agents that help you save money slash spend better in those areas. Yep. So then the next time I'm like, I need to buy a coffee table. It has all the context to ask me not the most questions, but, like, the three questions that together with all of those contexts will go off and be my agent to find the perfect couch that serves my job to be done. All of a sudden, it becomes what's that company, Bob? Start it. The the card Swizzle. Swizzle. It it becomes like a swizzle, but, like Mhmm. Centered on the consumer to help them save money. Right. Because if you understand your job and you buy the thing for the job, you end up spending less you throw less spaghetti on the wall, which is why you waste money. It's like you're focused in your investment and spending on the right things. And what have you given thought to what you think the visual representation of that is? Yeah. So I played with some HTML prototypes, and I could pull those up. Of visual representation. But none of them have impressed me yet or, like Well, let's talk about it. Yeah. So because we should work backwards from an end state that is a progressive looking environment. Yeah. So what do you mean by the end state? Do you mean End state meaning, like, I wanna work back backwards from progress. Yes. So I've made progress with my money and budget. The question you've asked and the things you have to say, and you understand me better, and What are you doing? Where is home base for me in Kanye once I've become acclimated and done the initial onboarding and data submission. Mhmm. So I thought money apps have, like, a dashboard. Yeah. So I thought about this for a while. Like, I think in Santa's land, I was thinking about, like, oh, fuck dashboards. But then I think, like, at the end of the day, you need some kind of you need some kind of a current state of affairs look to be like, I'm good. Yeah. But what if it's how a place feels? Rather than a dashboard that's like you're in a room Yeah. And the room feels like it's not messy anymore. I love that. I love that as a design principle for us, especially because we're living in a day and age wherein a couple years to form factor for quote unquote apps. Yeah. Could very well look very different. So it's like, the form factor of a screen on a phone and an interface that looks like that almost, like, is fluid at this point. Like, it's one way in which it takes shape, but, like, who knows? I can, like, like, the center vision cannot be the screen itself, but the feeling, as you said. And I think okay. What questions does that screen need to or that room need to answer? What do I want out of looking at that? I think the way I thought about it I was almost thinking about it like it's the, the room where what's her name is in severance? The therapy late year Audi. Gemma? Yeah. Gemma. Yeah. Yep. It's like I think, like, the the spirit of the we don't like the boilerplate dash but the spirit of the dashboard beneath what it typically is which it typically just shows, like, very, very meaningless data. But the spirit of it is, like, I want to look at it and nowhere track and feel good about progress or see progress. Like, feel like it's kind of like you've done Mise en Place on Base Camp and you look at all your projects or you look at your upcoming to dos and you're like, I'm good. Kind of situation? Yes. And I think for us, We'll need to discover what is the most meaningful piece of information to prioritize. As the home base that will give people that feeling. Because it could I don't think we can just conceptualize the answer. I think we'll discover it in that I agree. You could show it as your recent good investments in the areas that you care about. You could show it as reminder of your kill list. You know? Like, we could have different opinions on that, and and I think we need to discover that. It could also be I thought about it it felt a little cringe, but there's, like, things you could conceptually think of as like, your alignment like, health your, like, your spending health with regards to how clear you are on why you're spending on something or how mindful you are of it. Which is basically just like your want to kill ratio. But there could be some visualization of how many wants you have, right, or have you been spending on versus your kill. And then there's also the question of at the end of the day, it becomes important to also be aware of how much money is coming in. So that you know how much how much of the want you can afford. Right? Yep. So some visualization on hey. You're spending this much, and for a lot of people, for most people probably, the amount you're spending is more than what you, quote, unquote, should. But it's helpful to see that out of the money you're, quote, unquote, overspending, there's only this much is actually a want and this much is a kill. And if you have clarity on, well, the things that I'm overspending on are actually not serving me, you're a lot less stressed about reducing your spending. Because you realize that you're not cutting down on things that actually matter to you. Versus if you just look at a pure budget, you're like, oh my god. I can't spend on this. I can't spend on that. Maybe that's not true. Maybe if you actually think about which of those things you're talking about matters to you, you don't need to spend on all those things, and you don't you'll be happier, not less. So some visualization related to that is helpful. But for that reason, I was thinking if it will be viable for us instead of, like, we can prototype as far as interface goes discover what the right form factor is. But could it make sense for us to literally go find some close friends and be like, hey. You know, like, manually do basically us manually be the kane for a few close friends. Yep. Look at their past seven days of transactions. Do jobs we've done questioning. On what matters to them, and basically prototype on the fly what that kind of dashboard would even be. Would even be helpful to foster the kind of progress we're looking at. We just need people who trust us personally. We have Yeah. So I was thinking, like, maybe our approach to this should be to do that. While we also prototype some of the ideas that we have. But because we're basically inventing a form factor, it's less let's sit down and decide on an interface and you know, know what I mean? I do. Yeah. It's a blank picture in my head still. But I think we'll figure it out. Yeah. Here's the So I said Curious to know what a sample output or report would be. Even if what? You know? I don't like this. Okay. I know. But These numbers are also wrong, but this was kind of, like, a contrast of for this domain, here's what is serving you and what isn't serving you. There are some even out of AI tools. There were some tools that I wasn't using anymore. Recently. So I killed those. And it actually was helpful. Like, I actually went and killed them. So that that's that. Taking care of yourself. Some things are needed. Something was just vibe. Vibes. Right? Yeah. Is, like, one one of those examples. Oh, you spent on CVS, Uber Eats to get a laxative because you were constipated? Could have planned for that. You could have just taken get better care of yourself. Let's work on that. Yeah. So this was, like, I was I just talked out loud to, like, what I was imagining, and this is what I came up with. I think it makes sense to think of it as like, there's merit to the more traditional like, idea of a dashboard showing you your burn rate, except those areas you're spending on are not, like, here's your burn rate for groceries, but it's like the different areas of life that you care about that you're investing in. Yes. So it's almost like it is a dashboard, but it's a dashboard that is anchored around not top down categories, but rather causalities and what you actually care about. Because that also becomes the garden for all the help down the line becomes. But I'm just like, when it clicked in my mind that, oh, for each of these domains, the product that would dynamically that would like, this is the the Wild West dream of generative UI that everyone is, like, dreaming of but nobody has pinned down or there's no, like, concrete example. Of as of yet But it's like this becomes like, the example I was giving earlier of the onboarding, listening to you and not just not just taking your input. That's one example of that already. But how this dashboard is divided up could also be basically generated by agent by an agent in the app that listens to you over time. And shapes the dashboard after you. So then you have the there's some basic atoms in the app that the agent uses so that there's some opi that's that's our opinion on how things should be conceptualized and thought of. But, ultimately, you get what you put in in a sense of, like, the more nuanced you give to the agent, the more the agent has to work with in shaping your dashboard. Yep. And The more honest and open you get, the better this gets for you. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And then in those domains of life, the adaptive experience that helps you make the progress with the KPI of how much of your spend in those areas are actually serving you. The product that adapts to helping you in those areas essentially becomes very inevitably the all serving consumer agent. You look like a reverend. Or a priest. It becomes it's no consumer agent. Praise me. But, like, it's To takuma. Isn't that isn't that like, it's like I'm in, sister. I'm in. The agent that helps you figure out, oh, you care about making your house nice because you wanna host people. Mhmm. So it starts to it starts to morph It starts to morph, and then there's a tab in the app that morphs after that. That shows you, yes, at the top, the progress in terms of, like, a basic anatomical unit of kane progress. Progress management. But then down there, it starts to suggest or, like, ask you questions to dig deeper. Or then you automatically want to go to it to be like, I wanna buy I need to buy a new couch for this room. And then they get aren't static. Meaning, like, we can choose a current version now. Yeah. That's good enough. And then we can obviously completely change it. Yeah. Yeah. But, like, conceptually, it's that feeling of you're guarding, you're cocreating Yeah. With the AI to basically build your own app. But the app is the quote, unquote build your own app is coming from an a deeply opinionated and reality grounded place, not a, hey. Try gbt. Build me at x y z. So, like, it's AI that uses jobs to be done to understand you and therefore co creates your life management system with you. So, ultimately, it's almost like this is a no code platform. Yes. That's just not called that. It's not just no It's not just no code because it's not assuming that you even understand what would need to be done with or without code. To the progress. Yeah. Just jump into the progress. Mhmm. Mhmm. And, like, it's a I'm just saying that as in, like, if you break it down that way, to the full extent, it's like an app builder. Yes. I understand. But the philosophy around the app builder is that the app is, like, almost the wrong anatomical unit to think of when you think of, oh, everyone can build their own app. Apps. Yeah. I'm just like from first principles, this can't be wrong. Okay. We'll see. I know. I'm like, no. Like, what I'm what I mean as in this can't be wrong is, like, if you think about how a product developer will do a much better job if they understand your job. Mhmm. Then, of course, an agent is gonna serve you better if it understands your job. Exactly. Yeah. We just we'd like we can be completely wrong in our imagination of the form factor. But the underlying it's just like something will have to like, yeah. I'm just like the underlying physics of it. You know? I feel listening to my TED Talk. I mean, you recorded it. I know. It's great. So that's what's been on my head in my Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. I get it. I think that mock up you provided is a good start. I think we need I think we need to I think progress means what I talked about, which is minimal progress for close friends. Yes. Like, you should do this with your sister or something. I agree. And No. Well, we need the disclaimer of your data is your data. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I think that's super important for this to be possible. In order to do this, we still need to do the content design. Like, we need to take everything that we said and everything that has already been conceptualized in the vision docs and turn it into almost, like, JTBD opening script of this is why we're like, you know, this is how the think about it. X y z, like, that whole shit ship. It's like in a different form factor, not an app, but us, but we need to be products. I'm just thinking about the number of friends I have I'm less loud about it generally, but the amount of friends I have who keep saying that actually, I've been more loud about it recently. But the amount number of friends I have won't shut up about, oh my god. It's so expensive. Oh my god. I'm running out of money, and yet you keep spending and, like, you don't even know what you're talking about with regards to what is the money you can afford versus can't afford. Because, like, being able to afford something is like a Yep. Contact thing. Unless you're like you actually have $0. Okay. So we gotta come up with that. Come up with? That script thingy. Oh, the disclaimer? Of the disclaimer of, like, basically how we're gonna do the at least a starting point for how we're gonna do the manual thing. The playbook for that. Even though it's not set in stone, and we're gonna adapt. The manual Like, we're gonna go interview our friends and go be, like, let's get your past seven days of spend Yep. We can make that a task we work on async, like, coming up with the playbook or we that that's it this weekend. But it would be in the air. Fair phase. No. Like, I think there's something about us literally sitting down with a person. They're not gonna wanna do it. Well, we need to learn how to make them be okay with it. Human. Okay. That's the whole theory that I have about it. Okay. It's like very much less likely to show a person your vulnerable choices. I just think that if we can master the right language to pull that out of somebody even if it's a real person, it makes the AI even better. And there's a degree of pre encoding and pre assumption that will need to already be in place if we're doing it through an AI. AI that won't be nearly as adaptive and sensitive as if we were there to make the judgment But I agree with you that that's why I'm saying, like, even if it's just one or two people that we already have established trust with, that at least gives us a starting point for how to encode that AI. Because right now, if we encode that AI and prompt AI immediately, that's completely theoretical. It's not based on an actual study of somebody's spending. Does that make sense? Yes. So in your view, what do we how do we treat Let me show you this. I asked it to like not that I actually think that this kind of stuff can be fully simulated, but I attempted to, like, simulate, like, five profiles of what theoretically somebody what they're spending patterns could be and how that could be and then had it, like, generate a sample one week transaction data. According to it. And I think this is interesting. But because it's generated from our vision already, are definitely scenarios it's supposing that is, like, created just because it knows of our vision. So I'm like, if we just create an AI experience, it will be based on assumptions like this. And the second We could try it. I just think nothing that's gonna be as intimate as if we can, of course. Like, it's not we're not gonna be able to do this with, like, 50 people. But or maybe we can and once we know what we're doing. But if we can, I don't see any downside and only upside? To being able to intimately do this human to human. So we'd know what we're doing. It's weird going through people's money. I understand. So it sounds like we gotta try both. Is it working for you yet? Because that's the actual test. I can't tell. Because it is as far as making me think about whether something I spent money on was actually well spent after I've spent it. Like, making me reflect on it in a way that I wouldn't have. And I tried doing some mock interviews by loading the data up here. And I do find it helpful in a sense of it's given me clarity on okay. I don't need to feel bad about all of my house spending, home goods spending on Amazon. Some of them are bad when I buy it, not for reasons that are actually important to me. And I think whatever test I've run needs to still gain more fidelity around what makes something a good purchase versus not. But I can see I can definitely start feeling how there's a layer of dust there that simply seeing home goods x amount of dollars won't fulfill. But I think there's something fundamentally like, yes, we need to build for ourselves. But also we want it to work. So am I clicking on Kanye and on my transactions? Because I want Kanye to be good, and I want it to be a good idea, or am I doing it because it actually works? What's the most useful thing so far been for you? I hate to say it, but telling me about subscriptions that I forgot I had. Yeah. Which is why all the other apps are targeting that. I mean, Rocket does a great job of that. Yeah. Mean, I of Yeah. That is, like, the most tangible thing. Because outside of that, it's just I mean, like, as of right now, it's just sorting. You don't even get anything after the sorting. Yeah. So out of the sorting experience itself, I like, I'd say that it's forced me to make a discretion on what are something was a kill or a want. For the types of purchases that I could have made the case for either, which I think is helpful. Like, I bought some candles the other day. Was that a killer or what? So I'll get you, like, every transaction. There's, like, a little helper. That's, like, help me decide. I think it has to be more like, you can have we need to figure out the form factor where it's a middle ground between your sorting and it's a conversation. Sorting is only one way in which the conversation shows. It's almost like when you're talking to a person, we use, like, hand gestures to communicate certain things. Like, buttons are the equivalent of the gestures with a machine. Then when we go, like, left or right? Like, it's it's basically the equivalent of that, but it needs to feel more fluid. Yeah. I was thinking about, like, design ideas for, like, conversation. As well. And one idea was to have basically, like, a sound a sound bar at the bottom that you could, like it's almost like it's a string. And then you can basically almost, like, activate it by, like, hitting it like a guitar string. So then it's, like, nonintrusive. Like, it's always there. Not taking up, like, a button space, but you can always activate it to, like, start talking. Just have to think First. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's that's from a mobile first. Because then you're not worried about screen real estate as much when you're thinking on desktop. But on mobile is, like, so I constantly have a microphone button down there limits a lot of what you can do. Above it. But if it's, like, just a string that you know is there, just a line. It's almost like thinking at the level of operating systems, like how the Siri show up. You know? It's like the Siri inside the app. Interesting. So what's the next like, hurdle? I think I know who I would wanna interview. Or, like, to unpack their money. Like, I think I have a couple of friends that I I could be completely wrong, but I feel like it wouldn't be easy. I would have to do a lot of thinking in order to show up in a way that I feel like I'm actually respecting their energy and time and privacy. But I think they wouldn't necessarily say no. Because I'm, like, asking for one week of what you spent money Like, the opening up part is more of about conversation art, and that's the part that we need to figure out even with AI. So I wanna do that. But I hear you on us also needing the same way we prototype the phone booth. Situation with, like, the AI prompt. We can spin up an alternate version. Of the Kane code base where it's a deployed app but it's more conversation first. But we can the reason why it still needs to be an app is that we need that in order to directly fetch the plaid data. If not, then like, in my manual case, I could literally just have them export there. Spending through their bank statement. But in the case of intermediating with AI, it would make sense for us to need to set up the interface in a way where they connect their bank on there. Makes sense? We could spin that up. What if would you feel okay with me coming over this weekend? And I know you wanna do house stuff, but I think even just if I were here and I show you progress and we'd, like, jam on it idea wise, even as you do house stuff, We can make progress on that and spin up something that the goal of spinning up something that you could send to close ones. We could send to close ones for testing, for getting that interview. Interesting. I'm just thinking about, like, the even more light weight version would be exactly what we did for the AISS which is, like, give people a prompt template and make them export their own. Data. A prompt template to export their own data. Like, give them a prompt template and then ask them to go to their bank app and screenshot their own data. Or something and then, like, supply that with the prompt and then basically basically, like, what you're saying as in, like, mediating it through an AI? Like, have people go to chat GBT and do that. I so here's let me let me explain, like, I believe doing is to intimidating and overbearing for most people. Right. And it's very sad. I understand. You and I are open to that level of scrutiny. Yeah. I don't know anyone who else would be. But Or here's to change that. If it works on us, we can we'll come up with the right way to make that more accessible to other people. Does that make sense? Trying to say is, like, what's gonna get I understand what you're saying, I'm just saying that for me, as I started devoting more time to thinking about this, and trying to imagine, like, the that exact question of, like, what I would need for me to use this all the time. I find myself driving myself crazy thinking of, like, a bunch of things that I'm, like, theorizing about, like, whether I would use or not or whether I I will find valid for or not, and I could, like, kind of debate things both ways in my head. And then I could, like, try it and make it happen, and then I'm like, well, even the app today it doesn't have much. I'm using it I'm clicking on it all the time, but that's because I made it. And, like, even receiving a push notification is cool to me. Which it won't be to anyone else. Because so I'm like, I don't know I don't know how focused and and I'm speaking for myself. Like, I don't know how focused on the right things I could be if I'm coming from a place of what would I use? what would I use. Also, I think, like, Yeah. So it's like the way in which I've been trying to I'm starting to make a little more progress, basically, to close the iteration loop. With AI, we're already able to iterate much faster, but to make that even more lightweight and even more adjustable, I think for us too, we should play with prompts in Claude. And play with what kind of progress we need to emerge for it. Because I'm like, I'm thinking about I'm like, I'm not beyond the point of sorting things and, like, seeing their totals of kills and totals of wants and totals of whatever, which feels quote, unquote obvious. I don't know that I have the right vectors to have actually thoughtful answers to how those numbers should show up. You don't need to. So what do I do? You need to you need to be honest with yourself about what's actually helpful. About this to you. Yeah. I really don't think anyone will be open to having a conversation with about what they've spent money on? Way for us to delay the nap. Which is that it needs to be viable to us. What was the last thing you said? It's not for anybody else. It can be later. But right now, it's not. Why not? Because they don't know what they want and they don't even know we don't even know what they need. We just know that we have an opportunity to take an approach with how we think about and manage our money. That's opinionated in a way that we know we don't have access to elsewhere. We know the way we're talking and thinking about this. Isn't really accessible to us anymore. And we wanna see where that goes because our hunch and our instincts our instincts are telling us that there's something here. I think that's enough to go off of. I think the irony for me is that I have no money to manage. Well, you do a little bit. Right? You have these choices. I have these choices, but, like, if we're going off of like, like, the the premise for understanding your wants and kills being enough being the best way to budget, or being the best way to, like, manage your money is that there's there is a room there is room for once. And I'm, like, at negative. Yes. But you also have a health thing. What do you mean? Like, you want progress with health. Yeah. And part of that progress starts with what you're investing in. Yes. Yes. Yes. Where where does that fit in business? That fits into this where my baseline for even if I'm just gonna need to rely on my dad's credit card which I there's my baseline for how much I need to be okay with spending needs to be higher than just the absolute minimum. Like, I can't just be eating ramen every day. And I'm not eating ramen at all. I'm eating, like, far from the most affordable thing I could eat. But like, I guess what I'm saying is, like, I don't have I think, like, wants and kills are more relevant to discretionary income in a way that I don't have. Which I guess should still be helpful. Right? Like, I should still be getting value if this if we are right. I should be able to build an experience for myself where I'm where I'm managing how I'm investing the things that I am investing in. And there's more of, like, there are parts of what will need to be there that are less relevant to where I'm at. But there will also need to be like, there are parts there are parts of the experience we're describing that will still need to be relevant to me. And yes, there's more development in insight that we could draw from there, but I'm thinking, like, fundamentally, like, yeah. If we're being real right now, I should be the the actual thing that I need to do is I need to, like, pen to paper, write down based on what you said? Earlier? Like, exactly that, like, I also have health goals I need to optimize for? So, basically, write down the minimum or the optimize the best configuration of money that I can spend that optimizes for that house. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Like, what you what I heard you describe Connelly is doing Yeah. Is getting to know you well enough to know that shit's important to you. Yeah. And there's a part of how you invest your dollars Yeah. That's gonna help you get to that part. Yeah. Yeah. Then kill everything else and like, then that's where my whole, like, oh, this actually becomes, like, an emergent agent. Comes in where, like, oh, like, I need an agent AI agent that helps me basically optimize. My grocery spend around health. Yes. In a way that yeah, you can prompt attributes to go do, but it's not, like, a continuous Exactly. It's not for integrated experience. After you and enforcing the behavior, reminding things you said. Checking back in if you make transactions. Yeah. Are you still in alignment with what you said you wanted to be? Like, hey. Hey. No. No. This is where I was also thinking about, like, sorting might not be it it's one of the interaction paradigms, but, like, there's a part of it that's, like, it should flag based on my my inklings. My interest or my known interests of, like, hey. You spend this much money at Trader Joe's? What was that? Like, what did you buy? And, like, basically, drill deeper on some transactions versus others. Like, I should I care that I spent $6 on batteries at CVS? No. Like, maybe. Not as much as the $70 at Trader Joe's. If I'm if I'm flagging AI subscriptions as once, then it should, like, drill me into, like, oh, were all of these ones? Was your rep Was your replet subscription that you forgot to cancel also a what? No. It's a goddamn kill. So, like, how do you wanna how do you want to work on this? I want to design the experience that solves for an important challenge for you. First. But I wanna almost, like, selfishly orient this to solve for that. Before we do anything else. Because then it gives us evidence that it can actually do something good. Like, everything about all of this has to be grounded in reality of progress. Yeah. So make real progress for yourself. Because then we become great advocates for this because we can basically point to ourselves and say, it it did this. I mean, I agree with that. And then at the same time, I'm like, it did what? I still have no money. Like, it feels very recursive to Well, it should work? Even at your clinic in your your state. To a certain extent, yes. But it's kind of like it feels very, like, weirdly recursive to and, like, there's parts of that that I agree with, and that's like, I I see how I have ideas in my head of, like, what we could work on. Or what that experience could feel like and what we could figure out there. But at the same time, it's like, spending all day figuring out the experience that would help me optimize my spend using the money that I actually kind of don't have. I like, I'm happy to like, I'm willing and I know how even that would make a lot of progress. What's the alternative? What are you proposing instead? I'm basically pushing back hard and interviewing other people or talking to other people. Because I don't think it's about the Yeah. I think I know. Why isn't it about them? I mean, you make a mistake with the system if we trusted inputs about it people. We actually built something that helped our show. Before there's make things that people want, there's make things that we want. It be better to bill for you versus bill for me? No. No. You what I'm hearing you is that you're almost saying, like, you don't have the problem. But you don't you're not struggling with this. I'm not not struggling with this. It's feel like my But what if I gave $2,000? Never would she say. As of right now, that money needs to go to rent. But let's just say in a vacuum where, like, that's not Well, didn't I I I still have to see twenty 500. Right? Yeah. From Chef? And then and then next week, Chef owes me money. But yeah. But, like, I'm not gonna like, we're we don't know that we're gonna have any money at all coming in the next few months. So, like, whatever money I have now should theoretically just be in the in the bank for rent. I understand. All I'm trying to say is, like, my big bet on progress here. Is that if it solves for Kate, then we can figure out how it solves for neal, and then we can figure out how it solves for everyone But I don't know what solving for me means when It's not even mine. Yeah. Like, can I can I see progress in other ways in a sense of for the same amount of spend, I'm getting more personal progress out of it? Yes. And that's ultimately what matters. But it's just not there's nothing about before we're able to make money through this or elsewhere, there's nothing about the situation even at its most optimal that is actual progress or that is actual, like, Okay. Good end state. I'm saying, like, money wise. There's no optimized money state for me without making money. That isn't negative. That's why you're worried about other people. Yeah. We can optimize progress all we want on you know, based on this hypothetical total budget, how how much personal progress am I getting and, like, how much healthier I'm getting. Yes. We could build for that. I'm just saying, like, even then, it's like, what is the success story? The success story is I still have negative money. What if we solved him? Fuck. Do you need a budget? Sounds like you might. Yeah. Like, basically, I could give myself a hypothetical paycheck. Down to pitch in to alleviate the pressure here in the left make it clear so that you aren't really using this in the way that it's meant to be thought about. Like, that's that seems like the most powerful way for us to make progress. Like, maybe this maybe this is a this is my own mental block or two, but it's like it so feels like, unless we conceptualize this as a oh, this is a vacuum period where we know that we're investing in x y z, whatever. It feels so instinctively off to me. For me to not be making money and then spending spending all day on building a product experience to help myself optimize my own spend that I am not making. I completely get it. Like, I think it's gonna, like, and maybe I just need to get over it too. Like, I I think it also will bring about the negative parts of my feelings. Yeah. What do you think would feel good? Like, I think it's gonna drive me crazy to spend all day thinking about how how I know What do you feel? How young Oh, like, maybe this is why I like the idea of even if it not making money, to work on this in a way where it's applied to So people that is are making money. Not building for somebody who don't have money. Who doesn't have money. Or maybe the other way to solve for this is to be okay with us splitting time where were spending, like, 50% of takuma, 60% of takuma on this, and then we still tried to spend half of our time elsewhere where we are. Exactly. Where we are making money. In some ways. Well, that's not mean, isn't there a place to pick up projects pretty quickly? Yeah. I don't know. Is it Like, go on Fiverr and just, pick up jobs. Just, like, work on churning them out without much thought because we're just doing, like, a wear it it's basically my equivalent of, like, Super. Yeah. It's like an AI hooper. Yeah. If that's gonna give really case now. To be there for Therefore, I can use. That makes sense. It's that, or we have a more thoughtful takuma relevant way to keep doing some form of consulting gig. Because that is time that's gonna be spent either way. So are we burning that s right off for having money, which is not bad? Because also, like, with all of that work, that's use cases for AI too. Where we can tinker and and whatever. It's like, if we treat our money as if our if we treat our time as money, what is the best use of that outside of just getting money and getting paid? Yes. Thinking this Yeah. I'm sorry. Where's it going? What's that? It's a good over. It's it doesn't last forever. What's the first question for the onboarding What's the reason What's a recent purchase that you're proud of? What's that from you? I think I did well at Trader Joe's last week. Spent, like, see, this is, like, proud of in a different dimension, but I'm proud of in a sense of spent, like, $70 and they were all super nutrient dense and low cost per nutrient. Purchases, And that was, like, Sunday, and I still have stuff left. So, essentially, that was, like, enough to carry me through the whole week. Where I didn't eat out for a single day. A single meal. Not even coffee. Not even a snack. Nothing. So I felt like that was money well spent. Which, like, $70 for a week is not the lowest one could go. Right? Like, if there's plenty of room to go low on, But I did that while also eating a pretty expensive diet from the standpoint of it's just protein and fats with veggies. It's just protein and veggies. Like, I'm not selling myself with, like, bunch of rice and whatever, which is how you would reach budget. So I think that was well spent. But So you Yeah. Just don't like thinking about my plan. We're gonna solve that, and it that gonna change me? I don't like to deal with Yeah. Oh my Oh my god. I need everything in the world. I need every new thing in the world type of person. But I do need some sense of I need to work towards having some sense of confidence. I can spend on things that I actually want to spend on. Versus now I feel like I'm feeling guilty for putting like, a meat thermometer in my cart on Amazon that costs, like, $10. Because I feel like I've been spending too much more than I could afford And then telling myself that things add up. And, like, and I'm like, I wanna know if my salmon is cooked or not. Yeah. But I just wanna be clear, Kate. Like, I've been through all of that before, and I didn't have any support or external safety net or anybody offering to help me. Understand. It lasted a long time. I understand that I'm already very, very fortunate. But you can get through this. You will get through this. There's no value in you feeling bad at it. It's just pushing through. Yeah. So we need to work on like, yeah. See that the faith in myself that The road map for having money will reveal itself if I just keep showing up. Because right now, it's not there. Don't let this defeat you, Kate. What do think about that? That Instagram is from you sent me? Which one? Gifted and broke. But it doesn't last. You ought to believe that. Yeah. But it really doesn't. If I do the right things and if I invest the right energy and it make the right bets and do the make the right decisions, then, yeah, it does last. The that I have to It's the choice but to make the right decisions and the right Like, now I'm starting to feel bad about, like, deciding to move there versus, like, fighting the cheapest possible studio. Oh my god. Woah. Absolutely not. We're gonna be fine. Like, I told you, you have my support. I'm in. We're gonna make it. We're gonna have to be there and cover all the expenses until we actually break through with what next or consulting projects or whatever. So, like, don't fret about that. Your burn is my burn. Okay? I've said all that before, and I'm eating it. You're not gonna be laid on rent. Okay? I understand. But and I really appreciate you for that, and I feel Let's do it. Fortunate about that. I'm just I'm missing him. I want to clear your head to focus on doing this right. For us and for you. Because if we do, I believe it's going to work. K. Sorry. No. You need to get ready soon. So I guess What would progress be in the coming week? Onboarding. TTV short term tangible outcome experience. I What is onboarding TTV? So it's three different things. So onboarding, is one thing. TTB is the other thing. And the third thing is, like, short term. What's TTV? Oh, talk to about it. Yeah. So, like, onboarding is smooth. Like, we can have a new or separate email and sign up for a campaign to just all just kinda work. Yeah. That's one. Like, that that initial experience and the setup needs to be, like, snappy. Yeah. And locked in. And the value means that after you've coded transactions or while you're coding your first set of transactions, like you were saying, there's something beneficial that already comes from this. Yeah. And then three, three. That end state conversation that you've designed after your transactions have been coded and what next steps you need to take. Yeah. That's, like, divine. Yeah. So the those would be my three buckets. Okay. Like, thinking is to I think the time to value and the third bucket is related. Yes. In that the time to value is almost like a work in progress version of the final bucket. Like, before you've done all of it, you get a teaser of the final bucket. That's time to value. So, like, we need, like, we want of a form factor for the final bucket. Yep. What is progress? How does progress show up? In that job Jobs based. Dashboard. Basically. Like, yeah. Said that in order for that to happen, it can't probably can't just be pure sorting. You also need some version of that conversation. To happen. Right. In order to have the story of what you actually care about. So I will work backwards from that success outcome into the conversation. That needs to happen in order for that success outcome to be possible. And then the onboarding is some version of that. I was starting to dish the HTML for Figma. And and had sketches today. I was like I was starting to think about imagining, like, punchy starting Nice to meet you. Narratives. Yeah. It's almost like the screen speaks to you. And that would be the goal. Well, Not the bullshit. Welcome to karate. Why are you here? I kinda think. Okay. Sounds great. Okay. Well, What gives you the most energy? Respects to this? The A creative space to Really think about something from the ground up. Where there are no constraints to what an experience could feel like. Which is both energizing and depending on what hour of the day you ask me, Training because there's a not training. It's the wrong word. But There is a lot of this that's very unknown. It's not necessary, like, there's an obvious answer to something, and you just gotta go do it. Which I think is what makes us cool. And I think that gives me energy because the whole point is you're doing something that has obvious answers, then it's not that vowel. You know what I mean? And I think there's something to that There's There's something to that. That vision of the experience that I was being preacher about earlier. The I think if we figure out and get through the ambiguity for. Means both breakthrough insights, breakthrough design that hasn't been done before or isn't done in the world, that leads to setting a bar for what using technology can feel like. Or using an app could do to a human being. In a way that's super grounded on the types of progress that we're talking about for the human being. Like, I think it's a super dope possibility. So I need to important to me is to feel comfortable focusing on solving this puzzle. So what's gonna help? With that? I think Transfer the 20 the 2,500 from chef. And then together with next week's money. I think could just about pay re like, reset my super off credit card balance right now plus deal with the rent. Let's do it. And then You want me to do that right now? I don't need it right now. It's not a right now thing. Whatever. Like, basically, that together with next week, together I think, like, resetting all of that and then, like, basically, me thinking of everything as a clean reset. Starting fresh where Should I feel the same way with this fucking booty stuff? I I need to, like, start fresh and then, like, start applying both with this and also independently. As a person of, like, new principles and new discipline. The same way often applying a new discipline to wake up at a certain time and then go walk and exercise every day, like, that kind of stuff. Apply the same discipline to spend so that I feel less stressed about money. Where I'm like, this is the exact amount that I feel like, I it's not this is all I have. It's this is the exact amount that I need. Or that I will invest each month in becoming the person that I wanna be and everything outside of that is a co. But that's basically what a budget is. Right? In a corporate context, a budget isn't necessarily like, this is all we have as much as it's like, this is the amount that we're deciding to invest in this thing. It's not because you can't afford anything more. It's because you've decided that this thing was only worth that much. Yeah. So I think I have to admit to you that this is still helpful to you. Yeah. It needs to be selfishly beneficial is my point. No. But I'm saying that I I want it to be selfishly beneficial too. I just know right now that my math does not check out in any way that would allow for anyone. That's interesting. And I'll also go research or go try to see what it would take to actually run the gigs. Weird. Like, I don't know. Like, going to Fiverr or going like, whatever that is. Or give AI your constraint. I mean, I do I do just need a way to make money. I can't legally go a Starbucks barista because, like, I'm not allowed to do that on my own PT, but, like, I I need my version of that. What I'm saying is that spend another month boxing on this. And I'll invest in that month. For you to not worry about it. I I appreciate that. Let's let's try that for for let let let me try let me try that for a couple weeks. Okay. But then what I'm sensing is that I'm gonna drive myself insane. Okay. Okay. I get it. But I get what my what I said. Like, I don't like, the way the way that you drive yourself and say you're worried about money, is the opposite of the my intent and the point. What I was trying to say to you about support. I I really appreciate that. Sorry. I've got stronger. Stronger with what? I told her with all this. K. You don't great. Stop being so hard, and you sell. I'm just trying to hold myself together. Like, it feels like absence the the Absent the military routine that I'm trying to put myself into, which I think is what I needed is healthy, I feel like absence of that, I'm just, like, all over the place. Like, I'm, like, I'm, like, pieces in a trash can. Do you think that this? I'm trying to make myself not feel that way, and I know how toxic that could be. As of even a thought or it I could remind myself of all the ways in which I know I'm capable It all the ways in which I know I can become valuable. And worth something. But it doesn't like, at the baseline, the thought that I have would all the noise and all the busyness is gone, and I'm like, laying in bed at night. The feeling that I have is that, like, I'm like Absolutely don't think. The feeling that I have when it, like, lay in bed at night and all the busyness is gone, and I'm not, like, occupying myself with, like, 10 agents. And all Claud is talking me. It's like, I'm like, a completely worthless piece of shit. Why? Because you could argue that's literally true. I'm just here. I was supposed to feel No. No. But, like, do you get to inflict that on yourself with this? Because I up till this point in life, For, like, the past I don't feel like I've Actually done anything at all. The past few years that actually amounted to any kind of real progress. I feel like I've just been running around in circles. In my own head, and I don't feel like I've it's like like, apart from me needing to just, like, buckle up and just, make myself believe in myself because as the only choice at this point. And, also, because if my brain is making any sense to me at all, which it should, and look at my own capabilities, I should believe in myself. Like, outside of me forcing myself. So just, like, only focus on that. It's like, I have no evidence to believe in myself. I have no reason to believe in myself because I haven't done anything that eventually Fine. You are. Evident. Might be my only evidence. Which means the world. You gotta push through this part. Okay? It sucks. It is what it is. This is life. You look back on this time one day, and you're gonna smile. Unfortunately, right now, that's not how you get to feel. But I just need to keep reminding. You of how temporary, how you feel be. You just have to have a little bit of faith. And you have to also start by look. Loving yourself. Like, this whole thing. We're at right now, it's all about like, Kate needs to love herself first and foremost. So whatever pieces of trash can that you you are, we gotta bring all that shit back together and actually turn it into supercating it. That's what I keep telling myself. That's why show up, and that's why I wake up. I'm trying. It's just Sometimes you'll hit these down on and you'll you'll be in these phases at some point. On a Friday afternoon this week, that's just where you're at. That's how you're gonna feel. But you're gonna feel better again. In in the next day or two or the next week, whatever. We reset the finances. Things will hopefully be a little bit clearer. What we need to do for the next few weeks. Let's do it. Okay? I'm sorry I made this whole thing you and McAllister. I'm sure it's just been I'm good. This is what we're here for. I'm here for all of it. I have no problems. You got this, super Kate. What's up? What? You so silly. Oh, there it is. That's right. I'll go throw on some clothes. And then I can uber myself to my barber and then also have to drop you off. Does that work? Yeah. Hey. Peer is probably COVID. Call you? My peer is probably coming. That's fine. Oh. If it's not, it's trying to come. I wouldn't be surprised if my period decides to skip.
