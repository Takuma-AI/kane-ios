# Kane Native: Component Implementation Order

## Implementation Sequence

This order is designed to build from the foundation up, allowing us to refine aesthetics and interactions at each step before moving to the next component.

### 1. ElectricStrand Component
**Why first**: This is the persistent, always-visible interface element that defines the core interaction pattern.

**Key aspects to refine**:
- Idle state visual (gradient, lens flare intensity)
- Swipe gesture sensitivity and feedback
- Vibration animation (Death Stranding strands)
- Long press detection and emphasis feedback
- Opacity transitions during view changes

**States**: idle, hovering, vibrating, expanding, hidden

---

### 2. OnboardingView
**Why second**: Sets the tone and aesthetic for the entire app experience. This is the user's first impression.

**Key aspects to refine**:
- Typography and text animation timing
- Background treatment (pure black vs subtle gradients)
- Text entry/exit choreography
- Transition to first voice prompt
- Philosophy messaging presentation
- Final transition to HomeView

**Timeline checkpoints**: intro → philosophy → strand introduction → first question → bank connection → transition out

---

### 3. ConversationOverlay
**Why third**: Core utility interface that will be used throughout the app lifetime.

**Key aspects to refine**:
- Slide-up animation curve and timing
- Liquid glass blur amount and tint
- Text size and spacing (lyrics-style display)
- Real-time transcription appearance
- Dismiss gesture and animation
- Relationship with ElectricStrand underneath

**States**: hidden, expanding, expanded, collapsing

---

### 4. SortingOverlay
**Why fourth**: The primary transaction interaction, needs to feel perfect.

**Key aspects to refine**:
- Liquid glass orb design and animation
- Memory-form text presentation
- Swipe up (evaporate) animation and feedback
- Swipe down (collect/ground) animation and feedback
- Queue management between transactions
- Overlay background blur style

**Gestures**: swipe up (kill), swipe down (want), tap (skip)

---

### 5. SunCircle Component
**Why fifth**: The main dashboard visualization, needs careful aesthetic refinement.

**Key aspects to refine**:
- Visual representation of rising vs drowning
- Color treatment for wants vs kills sections
- Animation when proportions change
- Size and positioning on screen
- Interaction with scrolling (does it shrink/move?)

**Note**: The rising/grounding metaphor will be revisited here. The up/down sorting gestures are locked in, but the dashboard representation can evolve.

---

### 6. BudgetBar Component
**Why sixth**: Interactive element that needs to feel intuitive and informative.

**Key aspects to refine**:
- Visual design of bar segments
- Draggable threshold interaction
- Animation when values change
- Labels and value display
- Relationship to SunCircle above
- Color coding system

**Interactions**: drag threshold, tap segments for details

---

### 7. HomeView Container
**Why seventh**: Brings everything together into the main experience.

**Key aspects to refine**:
- Layout relationship between components
- Transition from onboarding
- ElectricStrand integration
- Overlay triggering logic
- State management between overlays

---

### 8. Overlay State Management System
**Why eighth**: The orchestration layer that manages all overlay interactions.

**Key aspects to refine**:
- Transition timing between overlays
- Prevention of multiple overlays
- State preservation
- Memory management
- Animation coordination

---

## Working Method

For each component, we will:

1. **Create the basic structure** - Get the component rendering with placeholder content
2. **Refine the visuals** - Iterate on colors, sizes, spacing, effects
3. **Add animations** - Implement state transitions and micro-interactions
4. **Polish interactions** - Fine-tune gesture recognition and feedback
5. **Test in context** - See how it feels with other components

## Design Decisions to Make

As we implement each component, we'll need to decide:

- Exact color palette (shades of gray, accent colors)
- Animation timing standards (fast: 0.2s, normal: 0.3s, slow: 0.6s?)
- Blur intensities for liquid glass effects
- Typography scale and weights
- Sound feedback (haptics? audio cues?)
- Gesture sensitivity thresholds

## Success Criteria

Each component is "done" when:
- It feels natural and responsive
- Animations feel purposeful, not decorative
- Visual style is cohesive with other components
- Interactions are intuitive without instruction
- Performance is smooth even on older devices

## Next Step

Begin with **ElectricStrand** component. This will establish our base interaction pattern and visual language that everything else builds upon.
