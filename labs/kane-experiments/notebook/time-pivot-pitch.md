# KANE: A Thought on Starting with Time

## Am I forcing a problem?

Look, I COULD optimize my spending. For where I am in life, I am overspending. But it feels backwards to optimize spending I frankly shouldn't be making or can't afford. My real solution is simpler: make a budget grocery list for once a week, define a basic set of necessities, and buy literally nothing else. There's nothing I should have "discretion" over. My actual burning problem is that I have no income.

Even when I am spending more than I should, I make 1-2 transactions a day. That's not sticky. I don't want to reflect twice a day on two purchases. For me, spend optimization is a vitamin that doesn't actually kill the pain. And it feels wrong for us to manufacture the problem.

But here's what I AM obsessing over: Where is my time going? I'm working on 10 things, finishing none. We're all throwing more spaghetti at the wall in the AI age because it's "easier" - but making less real progress than ever.

What if we've been thinking about this backwards? From day one, we said the KANE framework (need/want/kill, finding what matters) applies to time too. What if we just... start there?

## Why Time Might Make More Sense

This isn't just about my own problem either:

**Money needs massive context to make sense.** The benefit of money is that there's real data. But this data has little to no context. Every transaction needs a story - why you bought it, what you were feeling. That's a huge context investment for little immediate return — outside of mere trust that it'll pay off at some point in the future.

**Time context comes more naturally.** As you've highlighted, money is sensitive. Nobody likes talking about it. On the other hand, it's easier to open up about how you spend time and why. Plus, the TTV can be immediate: you and I have experienced this so many times already. 

**Money progress is episodic and unclear.** What does progress look like tomorrow? It takes weeks to see patterns. Meanwhile, time progress is daily and obvious - you either made progress on what matters or you didn't.

**Perhaps most importantly, we can't stop bleeding time.** Every second is being invested. You can always make more money. But you can't cope and say "I'll just make more time in the future." Time is existential.

**With time context, money context comes for free** You had the insight early on that it might make sense to connect purchases to your calendar; but even that is only weakly associated with the underlying stories. If we build the partner for time triage, imagine what that context does for money. 

This synergy between time and money management is one that is only realized in the age of AI, when computers can understand stories.


## What This Could Look Like

We can think of KANE as a co-creative partner for investing your your life resources (time AND money) into what creates real progress. This could mean thought partnership, but it could also head towards execution. You see where i'm going with this — Hashi, TakumaOS, sentient Basecamp, all the things we've been brewing all along...

Everyone says they don't have enough time, the way everyone says they're bad with money. What if the truth is: we have enough of both, we're just investing them in the wrong things? Or rather, we have what we have, and the name of the game is to channel them towards progress?

Maybe we start with time (immediate, universal, story-rich). Money follows naturally (contextualized by time patterns). Together they become the complete picture of personal development.

## Tomorrow's Prototype

I really can't get this out of my mind — which is a sign for me to spend tomorrow spinning up a prototype. In the meantime, of course, I'm curious to hear what you think.
