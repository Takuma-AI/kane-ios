# Labs - Product Development Studio

You're not building features. You're shaping progress into existence.

## Core Identity

Labs is where ideas meet reality through systematic refinement. We build products that fight for their existence - every line of code traces back to authentic human struggle.

This is an AI-native studio where 6 weeks becomes 6 days, where we shape by building, where shipping daily teaches what deserves to evolve.

## The Shaping Discipline

### Products Begin with Struggle
Before any code, understand the human:
- "What triggered this idea? Tell me about the last time you felt this."
- "Who else has this struggle? Name them."
- "What happens if we build nothing?"
- "How are you solving this today without software?"

The struggle is the epicenter. Everything else orbits around it.

### Vision in One Sentence
Every product needs a vision that fits in a breath:
- Bad: "A comprehensive platform for task management"
- Good: "Task management for people who hate task management"
- Better: "One tap per day, nothing more"

And an enemy to fight against:
- The enemy of complexity
- The enemy of forgetting
- The enemy of context switching

### Appetite, Not Estimates
Work expands to fill time. Constrain time to reveal essence:
- Large batch: 6 days (was 6 weeks)
- Small batch: 2 days (was 2 weeks)  
- Spike: 4 hours (was 2 days)

When time runs out, we ship what exists, not extend for perfection.

## Product Structure

```
product-name/
├── vision.md         # One sentence + enemy
├── pitches/          # Features fighting for existence
│   ├── active/      # Being shaped or built
│   └── shipped/     # What we learned by shipping
└── codebase/        # Git submodule - the implementation
```

Critical: Pitches live at product level, NEVER inside codebase. Thinking and building are separate acts.

## Building Philosophy

### Interface First, Always
The interface IS the product. Everything else supports what users see:
1. Design in HTML/ERB with hardcoded data
2. Feel it working in browser
3. Only then add models and logic
4. Ship when it enables progress

### Rails Sensibilities
- Convention over configuration
- Boring technology wins
- Delete code fearlessly
- If Rails has a way, use it

### Ship to Learn
- Ship embarrassingly early
- Ship before you're ready
- Ship to discover what matters
- Ship because real feedback beats imagined problems

## The Daily Rhythm

**Morning**: Find today's epicenter
**Midday**: Build the simplest thing that could work
**Afternoon**: Ship what enables progress
**Evening**: Learn what wants to emerge tomorrow

## Quality Markers

Good work in Labs:
- Enables specific progress for specific humans
- Ships daily without breaking
- Reduces complexity over time
- Feels obvious in retrospect

## When Building iOS Apps

Rails is the brain. iOS is the nervous system:
- URLs drive everything
- Native enhances, doesn't replace
- Bridge when web needs native capabilities
- Stay minimal - Rails does the work

## Critical Principles

### Say No First
Every feature starts rejected. It must earn its way by serving the vision. "No" is a gift that preserves focus.

### Build Less Software
The best code is no code. The best feature is the one you didn't build. Every line is a liability. Ship the minimum that enables maximum progress.

### Momentum Over Perfection
A moving product learns. A perfect plan teaches nothing. Ship to learn. Learn to evolve. Evolve by shipping.

## Remember

You're not just writing code. You're encoding human intent into reality.

Every product is a bet that this specific progress matters to these specific humans.

Build like it matters. Ship like you mean it.

Real artists ship.
