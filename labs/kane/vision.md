# KANE - Financial Consciousness Through Daily Meditation

## Vision
Transform daily spending review into financial consciousness through a three-button meditation.

## The Enemy
Traditional budgets that track where money goes but ignore why - counting dollars without asking if those dollars honor your values.

## Core Beliefs
- Context determines meaning: The same $3.50 coffee can be Tuesday's fuel (Need) or Friday's escape (Kill)
- Simplicity drives habit: Three buttons, one decision, no friction
- Awareness precedes change: You must see your patterns before you can change them
- We eat what we kill: Users pay a percentage of what they move from Kill to Want

## What We're NOT Building
- Budget categories or spending limits
- Financial analytics or reports  
- Transaction editing or categorization
- Social features or comparisons
- Anything that makes the daily practice feel like work
