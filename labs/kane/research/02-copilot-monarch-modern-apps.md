# Copilot Money vs Monarch Money (2024–2025)

**Feature Sets & Differentiators:** Both apps aggregate all accounts (bank, cards, loans, crypto, investments) into one place with budgets and net worth tracking. Copilot (iOS/Mac only) offers spending tracking, budgets, goals (new Savings Goals tab), recurring payments, investments and net worth ([copilot.money](https://copilot.money/?ref=blog.finotion.app#:~:text=The%20best%20money%20tracker%20appNavigate,spending%2C%20budgets%2C%20investments%2C%20net%20worth)). It distinguishes itself with heavy AI/ML features: a "Copilot Intelligence" system that uses machine learning to predict transaction categories from user-reviewed data ([changelog.copilot.money](https://changelog.copilot.money/#:~:text=Not%20sure%20where%20to%20begin%3F,to%20save%20to%20get%20there)) ([thecollegeinvestor.com](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/41976/copilot-review/#:~:text=They%20recently%20launched%20their%20Transaction,We%27re%20excited%20for%20this)). Copilot also supports crypto tracking and has direct integration (e.g. Public.com) for near-real-time portfolio updates ([changelog.copilot.money](https://changelog.copilot.money/log/cash-flow#:~:text=Image)). Unique design touches (custom emoji for categories, personalized dashboards={34†L80-L88， ([9to5mac.com](https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/31/copilot-money-review-ipad-cash-flow-tags/#:~:text=Tags))) and behavioral nudges (alerts on trends ([designli.co](https://designli.co/blog/how-the-app-copilot-is-designed-to-help-users-keep-track-of-their-money/#:~:text=Alerts%20to%20Keep%20You%20on,Track))) are hallmarks.

Monarch (iOS, Android, Web) markets itself as an *"all-in-one money platform"* for budgeting, net worth, goals, and collaboration ([www.monarchmoney.com](https://www.monarchmoney.com/landing/monarch-budgeting-tools-dashboards#:~:text=The%20all)). It automatically syncs multiple data sources (banks, cards, loans, real estate, crypto, etc.) and provides customizable dashboards/widgets for net worth, spending trends, investments and more ([partners.monarchmoney.com](https://partners.monarchmoney.com/features/tracking#:~:text=Customize%20your%20dashboard%20so%20the,stuff%20is%20front%20and%20center)) ([partners.monarchmoney.com](https://partners.monarchmoney.com/#:~:text=Connect%20all%20your%20bank%20accounts%2C,stay%20aligned%20and%20plan%20together)). Monarch's standout features include *built-in multi-user support*: you can invite a partner or financial advisor for joint access at no extra cost ([www.monarchmoney.com](https://www.monarchmoney.com/landing/monarch-budgeting-tools-dashboards#:~:text=Monarch%20brings%20together%20everything%20you,on%20web%2C%20iOS%2C%20and%20Android)). It also offers extensive budgeting tools (rules, calendar, cash-flow views) and investment tracking (allocation charts, top movers) ([partners.monarchmoney.com](https://partners.monarchmoney.com/features/tracking#:~:text=Including%20individual%20stocks%2C%20mutual%20funds%2C,401ks%2C%20ETFs%2C%20crypto%2C%20and%20more)) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/monarch-budget-app-review/#:~:text=,to%20your%20account%20for%20free)). In short, Copilot is an AI-driven, Apple-ecosystem tool focusing on a sleek single-user experience with powerful visuals and automation, whereas Monarch emphasizes a comprehensive, multi-platform "Mint++" experience, including explicit spouse/advisor collaboration and broad reporting.

**UI Design & Visualization:** Copilot's UI is polished by Apple's standards: a native Swift app (iPhone/iPad/Mac) with clear, consise charts. It won an Apple Design Award nomination for its **"clear, beautiful, trusted"** interface ([www.macstories.net](https://www.macstories.net/sponsored/copilot-money-the-apple-editors-choice-award-app-for-tracking-your-money-start-your-free-trial-today-sponsor/#:~:text=Their%20native%20iPhone%2C%20iPad%20and,sight%20of%20the%20big%20picture)) ([designli.co](https://designli.co/blog/how-the-app-copilot-is-designed-to-help-users-keep-track-of-their-money/#:~:text=Copilot%20aims%20to%20attract%20users,app%E2%80%99s%20graphs%20and%20charts%20useful)). Copilot uses simple color cues (green/up, red/down arrows) and tooltips so users "don't have to have a master's in finance" to understand the graphs ([designli.co](https://designli.co/blog/how-the-app-copilot-is-designed-to-help-users-keep-track-of-their-money/#:~:text=Copilot%20accomplishes%20this%20in%20two,graphs%20are%20a%20quick%20study)). The home screen is customizable: users can rearrange tabs (Transactions, Cash Flow, Budgets, etc.) and widgets so key info (net worth, budgets, transactions) is front and center ([designli.co](https://designli.co/blog/how-the-app-copilot-is-designed-to-help-users-keep-track-of-their-money/#:~:text=Copilot%20describes%20itself%20as%20%E2%80%9Can,when%20they%20open%20the%20app)) ([partners.monarchmoney.com](https://partners.monarchmoney.com/features/tracking#:~:text=Customize%20your%20dashboard%20so%20the,stuff%20is%20front%20and%20center)). Designli's analysis notes Copilot's **behavioral design** – e.g. a "demo mode" with dummy data to build trust, swipeable sections on iPad, and push notifications to alert overspending ([designli.co](https://designli.co/blog/how-the-app-copilot-is-designed-to-help-users-keep-track-of-their-money/#:~:text=Demo%20Mode)) ([designli.co](https://designli.co/blog/how-the-app-copilot-is-designed-to-help-users-keep-track-of-their-money/#:~:text=Alerts%20to%20Keep%20You%20on,Track)). The result is a gamified, frictionless feel that motivates repeat use.

Monarch's design also emphasizes clarity and customization. Its customizable web/mobile dashboard lets you drag-and-drop cards (net worth, budgets, goals progress, spending trends) ([partners.monarchmoney.com](https://partners.monarchmoney.com/features/tracking#:~:text=Customize%20your%20dashboard%20so%20the,stuff%20is%20front%20and%20center)). Forbes praises Monarch's dashboard as a "clear, concise view of a user's accounts…offering different views for cash flow, planning, and [budgets]" ([partners.monarchmoney.com](https://partners.monarchmoney.com/#:~:text=,for%20cash%20flow%2C%20planning%2C%20and)). The mobile app similarly shows daily spending/budget insights and upcoming bills in a clean list. Unlike Copilot's iOS-tuned design, Monarch uses a cross-platform framework (React Native) so the interface is uniform across iPhone, Android, and web. User reviews frequently laud Monarch's intuitiveness and few syncing issues ([www.monarchmoney.com](https://www.monarchmoney.com/landing/monarch-budgeting-tools-dashboards#:~:text=,Love%20this%20tool%21%E2%80%9D)) ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842#:~:text=Best%20finance%20app%20period)), though some note a learning curve in setting up categories or goals.

**AI/ML Capabilities & Categorization:** Copilot heavily leverages AI. Its **transaction "Copilot Intelligence"** uses personal-machine-learning to auto-categorize spend (learning from each user's corrections) ([changelog.copilot.money](https://changelog.copilot.money/#:~:text=Not%20sure%20where%20to%20begin%3F,to%20save%20to%20get%20there)) ([copilot.money](https://copilot.money/series-a/#:~:text=We%27re%20also%20doubling%20down%20on,Now%2C%20we%20have%20the)). This reportedly cuts manual recategorization by about half ([copilot.money](https://copilot.money/series-a/#:~:text=We%27re%20also%20doubling%20down%20on,Now%2C%20we%20have%20the)). Copilot also uses AI to suggest **personalized savings goals** based on your historical cash flow and recurring bills ([changelog.copilot.money](https://changelog.copilot.money/#:~:text=Not%20sure%20where%20to%20begin%3F,to%20save%20to%20get%20there)). In sum, Copilot's ML makes categorization adaptive (via NLP rules) and delivers smart tips (e.g. warning of overspending patterns). Notifications (customizable by user preference) call out anomalies or low balances ([designli.co](https://designli.co/blog/how-the-app-copilot-is-designed-to-help-users-keep-track-of-their-money/#:~:text=Alerts%20to%20Keep%20You%20on,Track)). 

Monarch's categorization is more manual/rule-based. It auto-syncs transactions from banks and applies existing categories, and it offers a robust "rules" system (if X, then categorize as Y) that users can configure (as praised in reviews ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842#:~:text=my%20Fidelity%20account%20but%20it,friend%20come%20as%20well%20to))). Forbes notes Monarch "automatically categorizes your transactions" as part of its sync ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/monarch-budget-app-review/#:~:text=match%20at%20L198%20add%20to,be%20when%20categorizing%20your%20transactions)). But Monarch does not emphasize machine learning; instead it relies on user-defined reports and filters (and faster aggregation via many data providers). It does not have Copilot's adaptive AI, so "smart" suggestions in Monarch are limited to expense insights in the presentation (e.g. customized reports by category or time period). In practice, Copilot continually retrains on each user's edits, whereas Monarch expects the user to refine categories and use reports to spot trends.

**Pricing & Target Demographics:** Both are subscription services (no free tier). Copilot pricing (2024) is **$13/month or $95/year**, with a typical 30-day free trial ([thecollegeinvestor.com](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/41976/copilot-review/#:~:text=Copilot%20Details%20Product%20Name%20,iOS%20and%20MacOS%20only)). Forbes notes this is "competitive with other premium budgeting apps" ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/copilot-budget-app-review/#:~:text=Copilot%20offers%20two%20pricing%20plans%3A,budgeting%20apps%20on%20the%20market)) but higher than freemium competitors. Copilot targets privacy-conscious Apple users: its founders explicitly avoid selling data or ads, fitting a user willing to pay for a polished, private experience ([designli.co](https://designli.co/blog/how-the-app-copilot-is-designed-to-help-users-keep-track-of-their-money/#:~:text=studying%20computer%20science%20in%20Chile,way%20to%20manage%20your%20finances)). The Forbes review calls Copilot ideal if you want "smart money tools with almost no learning curve" ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/copilot-budget-app-review/#:~:text=Copilot%20is%20an%20intuitive%20budgeting,fee%20for%20some%2C%20but%20it%E2%80%99s)) – suggesting its audience is tech-savvy spenders who value design and automation.

Monarch costs **$14.99/month or $99.99/year** (≈$8.33/mo) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/monarch-budget-app-review/#:~:text=Monarch%20Money%20Plans%20and%20Pricing)). There is no free version, but offers a 7-day trial (30 days for legacy Mint users). Its higher price (vs Copilot's annual ~$8/‌mo) reflects extra platforms and features. Monarch's demographic skews towards couples/families and "power users" who need a full financial overview. Indeed, after Mint's shutdown, Monarch's subscriber base exploded (20× growth in 2024 ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/23/personal-finance-app-monarch-raises-75-million.html#:~:text=Monarch%2C%20founded%20in%202018%2C%20saw,sought%20alternatives%2C%20according%20to%20Agostino))), implying it attracted Mint's middle-aged, multi-account users. Forbes says Monarch's robust feature set suits those "willing to pay for in-depth insights" ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/monarch-budget-app-review/#:~:text=match%20at%20L97%20automatically%20categorizes,as%20of%20April%201%2C%202025)) – likely professionals, goal-oriented households and those dissatisfied with free tools. 

**Multi-user/Couples Features:** Monarch natively supports joint finances. You can invite a partner or advisor; when both link accounts, you get a *shared view* of combined finances ([partners.monarchmoney.com](https://partners.monarchmoney.com/#:~:text=Connect%20all%20your%20bank%20accounts%2C,stay%20aligned%20and%20plan%20together)). Family accounts and spending are handled together ("Monarch does let you do household management" ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842?see-all=reviews#:~:text=perspective,The%20fact))). There's no extra fee for multiple users. By contrast, Copilot currently has **no built-in couples mode**; each person needs a separate subscription. App‐store reviews explicitly call out this gap ("support for joint accounts…requires two separate Copilot accounts" ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651?see-all=reviews#:~:text=single%20and%20have%20simple%20finances,eventually%20get%20back%20to%20you))). Copilot's feature roadmap confirms this: "Couple/Family Support – Shared Budgets" has been requested by thousands of users (7.7k votes on their public wishlist ([feedback.copilot.money](https://feedback.copilot.money/feature-requests?category=categories-recurrings&sort=trending#:~:text=Copilot%20Money%20Log%20inSign%20up,Couples))). The developers say they "understand how important joint account support is" and are working on it ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651?see-all=reviews#:~:text=Developer%20Response%20%2C)), so that may arrive in 2025.

**Investment Tracking & Forecasting:** Both track investments, but in different scopes. Copilot lets you connect brokerage and crypto accounts; its Investments tab shows portfolio value over time and highlights major gainers/losers ([thecollegeinvestor.com](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/41976/copilot-review/#:~:text=Investment%20Tracking)). You can customize which investment widgets to see (e.g. chart returns or watchlist) ([thecollegeinvestor.com](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/41976/copilot-review/#:~:text=You%20can%20customize%20the%20%E2%80%9Cwidgets%E2%80%9D,those%20from%20your%20investment%20tab)). Copilot does not provide financial forecasting beyond budget projections (it will warn if you're on pace to overspend ([thecollegeinvestor.com](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/41976/copilot-review/#:~:text=Copilot%20has%20several%20dashboards%20that,likely%20to%20overspend%20your%20income))). Monarch likewise aggregates investments and loans into net worth. Its Tracking page shows "stocks, mutual funds, 401(k)s, ETFs, crypto, and more" together ([partners.monarchmoney.com](https://partners.monarchmoney.com/features/tracking#:~:text=Your%20diverse%20portfolio%20of%20investments%2C,together%20in%20one%20place)). You can view allocation charts and performance trends. Forbes notes Monarch's strength as a "comprehensive understanding" of finances, including investments ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/monarch-budget-app-review/#:~:text=match%20at%20L273%206,are%20categorized%20correctly)) (e.g. listing detailed tracking of retirement and brokerage accounts ([fangwallet.com](https://fangwallet.com/2024/11/18/copilot-vs-monarch-money/#:~:text=Both%20apps%20are%20good%20for,to%20set%20your%20financial%20objectives))). Neither app has advanced predictive investing tools (no robo-advice or AI forecast), but both give historical charts and alerts. 

**User Complaints & Feature Gaps:** App‐store reviews highlight different weaknesses. **Copilot users** often praise the UX but ask for stronger budgeting tools and couple support. For example, one reviewer noted Copilot's budgeting "lights are limited" – there's no clear budget-vs-actual view or income projections built-in ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651#:~:text=,some%20of%20the%20quirky%20UI)). Users want "fire alarm" overspend alerts or better income vs expense forecasts ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651#:~:text=,some%20of%20the%20quirky%20UI)). Others complain recurring bills handling is confusing, and joint account support is missing ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651?see-all=reviews#:~:text=,That%20being%20said%2C%20the)). A common gripe: once you set transaction‐categorization rules in Copilot, there's no way to view or edit them in-app (you must re-download or contact support) – a user described this as a "huge gap" that hinders adjustment ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651?see-all=reviews#:~:text=,my%20Copilot%20rating%20unless%20there%E2%80%99s)). In short, Copilot's feature gaps (per reviews) are richer analytics (budget forecasting), multi-user sharing, and visibility into automated rules. 

**Monarch users** generally love the breadth of features but cite a few annoyances. Many mention the subscription model: one review begged for a one-time purchase option (instead of recurring fees) ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842?see-all=reviews#:~:text=,I%20love%20Monarch)). Users also miss gamification – "little challenges or rewards" for good habits ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842?see-all=reviews#:~:text=knows%20what%20they%20like%20in,and%20the%20effort%20that%20has)). A few point out technical quirks: some accounts (especially new ones) trigger repeated two-factor codes or slow updates, requiring re-login ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842?see-all=reviews#:~:text=A%20good%20alternative%20to%20Mint)). Feature requests in reviews include a built-in credit‐card calendar for due dates (currently absent – users have to guess or add reminders) ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842?see-all=reviews#:~:text=A%20good%20alternative%20to%20Mint)). Another frequent comment: Monarch's Goals can be rigid. If you want to save broadly (e.g. "home fund" or multiple accounts), there's no easy way to track that outside of setting a precise end-amount goal ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842?see-all=reviews#:~:text=still%20missing%20and%20can%20be,topics%20and%20requires%20you%20to)). One reviewer also noted that tagged transaction lists don't show a net total (you can't see "all tagged groceries sum" at a glance) ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842?see-all=reviews#:~:text=,topics%20and%20requires%20you%20to)). Overall, Monarch's complaints focus on polish—streamlining workflows (hotkeys, better shortcuts) and adding small usability features—rather than core functionality gaps.

**Platform Limitations:** Copilot is strictly Apple-only right now – iPhone, iPad and Mac (no Android or web). Forbes advises that "currently [Copilot] is only available to iOS (Apple) users" ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/copilot-budget-app-review/#:~:text=Copilot%20is%20an%20intuitive%20budgeting,fee%20for%20some%2C%20but%20it%E2%80%99s)). The founders acknowledge this constraint: their Series A announcement explicitly raises $6M to *"bring Copilot to all platforms"* (web and Android) ([copilot.money](https://copilot.money/series-a/#:~:text=Since%20our%20launch%20in%202020%2C,AI%20and%20product%20development%20efforts)). In contrast, Monarch is fully cross-platform: it has native iOS and Android apps plus a web interface ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/monarch-budget-app-review/#:~:text=average%20rating%20of%204,the%20same%20features%20and%20capabilities)). This limits Copilot's market reach – Android and PC users cannot use it – whereas Monarch reaches any user on phone or browser. In practice, Monarch's multi-platform presence helped it capture ex-Mint users quickly ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/23/personal-finance-app-monarch-raises-75-million.html#:~:text=Monarch%2C%20founded%20in%202018%2C%20saw,sought%20alternatives%2C%20according%20to%20Agostino)). Copilot's Apple-only design, however, means a very polished Apple-centric experience (including Apple Vision compatibility ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651#:~:text=Mac%20Requires%20macOS%2012,later))) at the expense of platform breadth.

**"Why" Behind Spending vs "What":** Neither app explicitly infers motives for spending, but they both help users see patterns that hint at *why*. Copilot focuses on *"what"* (category breakdowns, budgets, cash flow). However, its alerts and intelligence tab act like a financial sidekick, nudging the user about trends (e.g. "you forgot a bill" or "you're overspending") ([designli.co](https://designli.co/blog/how-the-app-copilot-is-designed-to-help-users-keep-track-of-their-money/#:~:text=Alerts%20to%20Keep%20You%20on,Track)). It also provides goals and personalized insights ("based on your categories, here are tips to save") ([changelog.copilot.money](https://changelog.copilot.money/#:~:text=Not%20sure%20where%20to%20begin%3F,to%20save%20to%20get%20there)), which indirectly address *why* – by turning patterns into actionable context. Monarch likewise doesn't psychoanalyze spending, but its dashboard and reports help users answer "where did my money go?" and "am I on track for my goals?" A Monarch blog post even encourages asking about spending habits and triggers (e.g. identifying overspending triggers) ([monarch-website-staging.herokuapp.com](https://monarch-website-staging.herokuapp.com/blog/understanding-your-spending-habits-a-deep-dive#:~:text=Struggling%20to%20make%20sense%20of,your%20priorities%20and%20financial%20health)). In short, both tools primarily show *what* was spent and let the user draw conclusions. Copilot may tip the scales with personalized ML suggestions, whereas Monarch gives comprehensive data views (net worth, cash flow) so users can infer their own "why" (for example, by linking goals to spending categories) ([copilot.money](https://copilot.money/series-a/#:~:text=As%20we%20celebrate%20this%20milestone%2C,kept%20us%20afloat%20and%20inspired)) ([partners.monarchmoney.com](https://partners.monarchmoney.com/features/tracking#:~:text=)).

**Customer Acquisition & Retention:** Both rely on subscriptions, trials, and word-of-mouth. Copilot bets on Apple fandom and referrals: e.g. it ran sponsored articles (MacStories, 9to5Mac) offering free trial codes ([www.macstories.net](https://www.macstories.net/sponsored/copilot-money-the-apple-editors-choice-award-app-for-tracking-your-money-start-your-free-trial-today-sponsor/#:~:text=Launching%20later%20this%20month%2C%20Copilot,on%20your%20categories%20and%20spending)) ([9to5mac.com](https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/31/copilot-money-review-ipad-cash-flow-tags/#:~:text=Before%20we%20begin%2C%20a%20quick,month%20free%20trial%20of%20Copilot)). It also has a referral program: an invited user gets 1 month free and the referrer earns 3 free months once the friend subscribes ([refer.guide](https://refer.guide/r/copilot#:~:text=,promo%20code%20or%20referral%20code)). These deals encourage sharing among tech-savvy communities. Copilot's "Editors Choice" cachet and an emphasis on privacy also help attract users who distrust ad-supported apps. The co-founder credits user subscriptions for fueling its growth to 100,000+ users by 2024 ([copilot.money](https://copilot.money/series-a/#:~:text=Our%20metrics%20may%20give%20the,a%20great%20product%2C%20and%20patience)), indicating high retention thanks to continuous feature updates (they frequently ship new tools to keep users engaged). 

Monarch's acquisition strategy leveraged Mint's shutdown: it offered an easy Mint-import and extended trials to lure lapsed Mint users ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/personal-finance-monarch-intuit-mint/#:~:text=Agostino%20told%20TechCrunch%20that%20Monarch,%E2%80%9D)). Media coverage (CNBC, TechCrunch) amplified that momentum. Monarch also has a formal referral program: as of 2025 it pays a $50 gift card per qualified referral and gives the new user 50% off their first year ([www.monarchmoney.com](https://www.monarchmoney.com/referralprogramterms#:~:text=)). (Earlier reviews mention a 30-day trial via referral ([apps.apple.com](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monarch-budget-track-money/id1459319842#:~:text=transaction%20I%20want%20with%20a,the%20best%20finance%20app%20period)).) It uses affiliates (e.g. $20 per subscription through Impact ([linkclicky.com](https://linkclicky.com/affiliate-program/monarch-money/#:~:text=Website%3A%20%20,Yes))) and its blog content to draw interest. To retain customers, Monarch frequently updates (per user praise ) and offers a 7-day (or longer for select users) free trial to reduce churn at signup. Importantly, both apps rely on their users' trust and satisfaction (no ads, no data-sell), and on feature releases to keep subscribers renewing.
