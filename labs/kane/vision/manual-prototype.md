# Manual Prototype Approach

## Why Start Manual

Before we build software that grows from behavior, we need to understand what that actually means. The only way to learn is to BE the system for real people.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Be Their Kane

Work with 5-10 close friends. For each person:

1. **Get their transaction data** (last 3 months)
2. **Initial interview** 
   - "What purchase are you most proud of recently?"
   - "What purchase do you regret?"
   - "Where do you feel you're overspending?"
   - "What are you trying to build/become?"

3. **Pattern analysis** (manual)
   - Find the recurring emotional jobs
   - Identify investment areas
   - Spot the contradiction patterns
   - See the emerging identity

4. **Regular check-ins** 
   - Review recent spending together
   - Ask about specific transactions
   - Surface patterns they can't see
   - Track what changes

5. **Create their custom "system"**
   - Could be a Notion page
   - Could be an email digest
   - Could be a simple spreadsheet
   - Whatever helps them see patterns

### Phase 2: Find the Patterns

Once you have enough data points across participants:

- **Common emotional jobs** money is doing
- **Typical domain emergence** patterns
- **Natural conversation flows** that create insight
- **Change triggers** that actually work
- **Progress indicators** that matter

Document everything:
- What questions unlock understanding?
- What patterns do people never see themselves?
- What visualizations create "aha" moments?
- What changes after awareness?

### Phase 3: Prototype Features

Based on discovered patterns, rapidly test:

- **For one person:** Build a custom app/dashboard
- **For another:** Create an AI agent with their context
- **For another:** Design a generative UI mockup

Test different approaches:
- What level of automation helps vs. hurts?
- What features emerge naturally from use?
- What creates sustainable behavior change?

## What We're Learning

### About People
- How they really relate to money (not what they say)
- What patterns are universal vs. unique
- What interventions create change
- What insights stick

### About the System
- How domains naturally emerge
- What capabilities are actually needed
- How interfaces should adapt
- When AI helps vs. overwhelms

### About the Business
- What people will pay for
- What creates enough value
- What complexity is worth it
- What simplicity is essential

## Key Principles

### It's Not About the Tech Yet
We're not building features. We're understanding what features need to exist. The manual work reveals what to automate.

### Real People, Real Money
No hypotheticals. Real transaction data. Real struggles. Real progress. This isn't user research - it's being the product.

### Document Everything
Every conversation. Every pattern. Every breakthrough. Every failure. This is our training data for what Kane becomes.

### Let It Be Messy
Don't force structure too early. Let patterns emerge. The mess reveals what matters.

## Success Metrics

We'll know we're ready to build when:

1. **People ask for more** - They want to continue after the manual phase
2. **Patterns are clear** - We see repeatable domain emergence
3. **Value is proven** - Participants report concrete progress
4. **System is understood** - We know what to build and why

## The Output

After the manual phase, we'll have:

- **Domain taxonomy** - How spending clusters into life areas
- **Conversation framework** - What questions create breakthrough
- **Progress patterns** - How people actually change
- **Feature requirements** - What the software needs to do
- **Technical architecture** - How the system should work

## Why This Is Essential

You can't build a system that grows from behavior without deeply understanding:
- What behavioral patterns mean
- How understanding emerges
- What interventions work
- How systems should evolve

The manual phase isn't preparation for building Kane. It IS building Kane. We're just using humans instead of code for v1.

## Next Steps

1. Identify 5-10 willing participants (start with closest friends)
2. Get access to their transaction data
3. Schedule initial interviews
4. Start being their Kane
5. Document everything in shared folder

## Remember

We're not trying to build the perfect system from day one. We're trying to understand what perfect would even mean for each individual. That understanding can only come from doing it manually first.

The insights from this phase will determine everything about how Kane works. Skip this, and we're just building another finance app. Do this right, and we're building something that's never existed.
