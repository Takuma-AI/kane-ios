# KANE User Flow Testing Framework

## Testing Methodology

This document provides the systematic testing approach for validating all KANE user flows in the Hotwire Native iOS app. We'll document expected behavior vs actual behavior to identify patterns and create holistic solutions.

## Flow Categories

### Flow 1: New User - Anonymous Sorting
**Scenario**: First-time user wants to try KANE without creating account
**Route Path**: `/` → `/connect` → `/plaid` → `/loading` → `/` (sorting) → `/complete`
**Key Features**: Plaid OAuth, transaction sorting, account creation prompt

### Flow 2: Returning User - Authenticated Sorting  
**Scenario**: Existing user with account sorts new transactions
**Route Path**: `/sign_in` → `/` (sorting) → `/complete`
**Key Features**: Authentication, session persistence, sorting interface

### Flow 3: Refresh for New Transactions
**Scenario**: User completed sorting, checking for new transactions
**Route Path**: `/complete` → POST `/transactions/refresh` → `/` OR stay `/complete`
**Key Features**: Refresh mechanism, loading states, conditional navigation

### Flow 4: Authentication Edge Cases
**Scenario**: Various auth scenarios (session expiry, sign out, account creation)
**Route Path**: Various
**Key Features**: Session management, error handling, account creation

## Testing Protocol

For each flow, document:

### Expected Behavior
- **Navigation sequence**: Screen → Screen → Screen
- **UI elements**: What should be visible/hidden
- **Interactions**: Button behavior, modal handling, transitions
- **Performance**: Animation smoothness, load times

### Actual Behavior  
- **What you see**: Exact description of what happens
- **Navigation issues**: Wrong redirects, missing screens, back button problems
- **UI problems**: White bars, wrong colors, web-like elements
- **Performance issues**: Lag, janky animations, white flashes
- **Error states**: Crashes, hangs, confusing messages

### Issue Classification
- **Critical**: Prevents core functionality
- **Major**: Breaks user experience significantly  
- **Minor**: UI polish or edge case issues
- **Enhancement**: Opportunities for improvement

## Documentation Template

For each flow test:

```markdown
## Flow X: [Name] - Test Session [Date]

### Test Environment
- Device: [iOS Simulator/Device]
- iOS Version: [Version]
- App Version: [Build]
- Rails Environment: [Development/Production]

### Expected Flow
1. **Step 1**: [Expected action] → [Expected result]
2. **Step 2**: [Expected action] → [Expected result]
[...continue for all steps...]

### Actual Flow
1. **Step 1**: [What I did] → [What actually happened]
2. **Step 2**: [What I did] → [What actually happened]  
[...continue for all steps...]

### Issues Identified
- **Issue 1**: [Description] - Severity: [Critical/Major/Minor]
- **Issue 2**: [Description] - Severity: [Critical/Major/Minor]

### Notes
- [Any additional observations]
- [Patterns noticed]
- [Potential causes]
```

## Analysis Framework

After testing all flows, we'll analyze:

### Pattern Identification
- **Common issues** across multiple flows
- **Root causes** that affect multiple screens
- **Navigation patterns** that consistently break
- **UI elements** that appear wrong throughout

### Solution Prioritization
1. **Core framework issues** (affects all flows)
2. **Critical path issues** (blocks main user journey)
3. **Polish issues** (improves but doesn't break experience)
4. **Future enhancements** (nice to have)

### Implementation Strategy
- **Holistic fixes** that solve multiple issues at once
- **Incremental improvements** that can be tested immediately
- **Verification approach** to ensure fixes don't break other flows

## Success Metrics

### Flow Completion Rate
- [ ] Flow 1 completes without critical issues
- [ ] Flow 2 completes without critical issues  
- [ ] Flow 3 completes without critical issues
- [ ] Flow 4 handles edge cases gracefully

### User Experience Quality
- [ ] No white navigation bars visible
- [ ] No white flashes during transitions
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Proper modal behavior (Plaid OAuth)
- [ ] Consistent native feel throughout

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Authentication persists correctly
- [ ] Session management works properly
- [ ] Error handling is graceful
- [ ] Performance matches PWA baseline
- [ ] All routes work as expected

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
- **Plaid OAuth flow**: Complex modal handling
- **Authentication**: Session persistence across app launches
- **Navigation**: Multiple redirect scenarios
- **State management**: Sorting progress, user sessions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Test incrementally with immediate feedback
- Document workarounds for critical path issues
- Prioritize fixes that unblock multiple flows
- Maintain fallback to web version if needed

## Testing Schedule

1. **Day 1**: Flow 1 (New User) comprehensive testing
2. **Day 2**: Flow 2 (Returning User) comprehensive testing  
3. **Day 3**: Flow 3 (Refresh) and Flow 4 (Edge Cases) testing
4. **Day 4**: Pattern analysis and solution planning
5. **Day 5**: Implementation and validation

This framework ensures we capture all issues systematically and can make informed decisions about solutions that address root causes rather than symptoms.
