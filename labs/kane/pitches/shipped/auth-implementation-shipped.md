# Authentication Implementation - SHIPPED ✅

## What We Built (July 14, 2025)

Simple email + password authentication that preserves anonymous users' progress when they create accounts.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components
- **User Model**: Email + bcrypt password
- **Account Linking**: Anonymous accounts get linked to users on signup
- **Session Management**: Preserves both user_id and account_id
- **Natural Upgrade Path**: Users create accounts after seeing value

### Key Files Created/Modified
```
app/models/user.rb                    # User model with has_secure_password
app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb # Sign in/out
app/controllers/users_controller.rb    # Sign up and account linking
app/views/sessions/new.html.erb       # Sign in form
app/views/users/new.html.erb          # Sign up form
db/migrate/20250714162556_create_users.rb
db/migrate/20250714162628_add_user_to_accounts.rb
```

### The Flow That Works

**Anonymous Users:**
1. Connect bank → Sort transactions
2. Complete sorting → "Save your progress?" prompt
3. Create account → Account automatically linked
4. Sign out/in works across devices

**Logged-in Users:**
1. Sign in first
2. Connect bank → Account linked immediately  
3. No re-connection needed after logout

### Key Fixes During Implementation

1. **Account Linking Bug**: Fixed `current_account` method to check session first
2. **Plaid Integration**: Updated to link accounts when logged-in users connect
3. **Complete Screen Bug**: Fixed anonymous users bypassing account creation
4. **Password Confirmation**: Added to signup form for security

### What We Didn't Build (YAGNI)
- Magic links (PWA compatibility issues)
- SMS authentication (too complex)
- OAuth providers (not needed yet)
- Account recovery (can add later)
- Email verification (ship first)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Simple Rails patterns (`has_secure_password`)
- Natural upgrade path preserves user data
- Account linking happens automatically
- Clean separation of concerns

### Surprises
- PWAs open magic links in different browsers
- Session UUID != logged in user
- Plaid's persistent_account_id made linking easier
- Required password confirmation field

## Next Steps

Potential improvements (only if users ask):
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] Remember me checkbox
- [ ] Account settings page
- [ ] Multiple accounts per user

## Metrics to Track
- Sign up conversion rate
- Users who connect after creating account
- Session persistence across devices
- Support tickets about lost accounts
