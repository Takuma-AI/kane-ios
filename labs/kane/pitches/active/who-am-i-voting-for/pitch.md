# Who You're Investing In - The Company Reflection Screen

## Problem

You spend money every day without realizing you're shaping companies with every purchase. You support dozens of businesses each week but never see the aggregate picture of who you're investing in. Your money flows to companies but you have no visibility into these relationships.

The real blind spot: You can't consciously choose who to support when you don't see who you're already supporting.

## Enemy

The transaction list that shows individual purchases but never the bigger picture. You see "Starbucks $5.43" repeated 20 times but never "You're investing $108/month in Starbucks." You see purchases, not relationships.

## Vision

A simple reflection that shows you who you've been investing in over the past 7 days - making visible the companies you're actively shaping with your money.

## The Progress

### From Transactions to Relationships
Users shift from seeing individual purchases to understanding ongoing relationships with companies. "I bought coffee" becomes "I'm investing $30/week in this local coffee shop."

### From Unconscious to Conscious
Users move from autopilot spending to awareness. They realize they're supporting 47 different companies this week. They see the Amazon purchases adding up. They notice the local businesses they're keeping alive.

### From Scattered to Consolidated
Instead of money disappearing into a void, users see it consolidating around specific companies. The picture becomes clear: these are the 5 companies getting most of your investment this week.

### From Passive to Intentional
Once users see who they're investing in, they can make conscious choices. "I didn't realize I was giving Uber $200/month" or "I want to shift more support to that local bookstore."

## Forces

**Push**: The discomfort of not knowing where your money really goes. The surprise of seeing a credit card statement. The disconnect between values and spending.

**Pull**: The clarity of seeing your impact. The power of conscious choice. The alignment of money with intention.

**Anxiety**: What if I don't like who I'm supporting? What if the picture reveals uncomfortable truths about my choices?

**Habit**: The ease of not looking. The comfort of individual transactions without aggregate view.

## Core Assumptions to Test

1. **Company-level aggregation creates stronger awareness than transaction lists**
   - Test: Do users change behavior more when they see company totals vs individual transactions?

2. **Recent timeframes (7 days) create more actionable insights than monthly views**
   - Test: Does showing "this week's investments" drive more conscious choice than monthly reports?

3. **Framing as "investing in" rather than "spending at" changes perception**
   - Test: Does investment framing create more intentional decision-making?

## Rabbit Holes

- Complex categorization of company types
- Judgment about which companies are "good" or "bad"
- Historical analysis beyond recent activity
- Detailed company information or ratings

## No-Goes

- Company ESG scores or ratings
- Suggestions for "better" companies
- Social comparison of company choices
- Automated switching recommendations
- Political or ethical judgments

## Success

Users have a clear picture of who they're investing in right now. They see the concentration of their support. They recognize patterns they didn't know existed. They make their next purchase with awareness of who they're supporting.

Most importantly: They see their spending as active investment in companies, not passive consumption.

## Appetite

Small batch - a focused feature that answers one question: "Who am I investing in right now?"

## The Deeper Question

Can showing people their spending as investment in specific companies create more conscious choice about who they support with their money?

This isn't about spending less or supporting "better" companies. It's about seeing clearly who you're already supporting, so you can choose whether to continue.
