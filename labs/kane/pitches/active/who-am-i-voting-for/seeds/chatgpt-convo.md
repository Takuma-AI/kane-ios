ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and thanks for walking me through that. Let me play it back to you and we can refine as we go.

Reframing the Vision
From what you’ve described, your vision isn't just to build another traditional budgeting app that categorizes spending into neat little columns like "food" or "entertainment." Instead, you're trying to shift the whole paradigm of how people think about money. You want to move away from the static, spreadsheet-style approach and toward a more dynamic, values-based philosophy of spending.

The Core Concept
The essence here is that every spending decision is more than just a transaction. It’s almost like a vote for the kind of person you want to be. So instead of asking, "What category does this expense fall into?", you’re asking, "Does this expense reflect a need, a want that enriches me, or a kill that detracts from who I'm aiming to become?" It’s a more psychological or even philosophical angle on budgeting.

Positioning in the Landscape
So, in terms of positioning, you’re right on the line between a budgeting tool and something closer to a life coaching app. You’re not just giving people numbers; you’re helping them align their financial habits with their values and goals. And that’s a pretty unique space that could set you apart from the standard budgeting apps out there.

So that’s how I’m understanding your vision. Let me know if that sounds like what you had in mind, and we can dive deeper into any part of it!

You said:
“Yeah, so another part of this is that like we are really interested or we are we come from a background of jobs to be done analysis. So you can think of it like the whole core concept of Fitch and Ain't Switching and how like you know you can follow the money and show what people actually care about and therefore you're going to interview people who actually recently spent money and then figure out all the triggers that led them to spending the money. So it's like a positive relationship, right? And so that's I think the idea here is that like there's jobs all the way down and that every spending you have has an underlying job to be done and we're basically here to understand and unpack your jobs to be done and your clusters and therefore help you align yourself with the jobs that you care about at a macro level. So aligning your small hires with your big hires basically and surfacing more nuanced stories such as well this you know there's this vending picture like you've been investing a lot in for example AI subscriptions. You spent this much but proportionately you know if that's your goal proportionately you're also spending this much in XYZ and that seems to be detracting from your goal. So how do we work on it? So that's kind of like the core idea. It's kind of complicated and difficult to distill that into interface and that's kind of the fun of this project. The challenge it's like a huge design challenge but I'm in it for that. With regards to understanding the competitive landscape I want your help in chiseling out like a few directions for research. Basically in the old days doing this research might be a waste of time but in an AI native world we can as long as we put enough thoughts into the direction of research and therefore like have the brief inspect for the research you can kind of automate the rest of it. So I want to basically partner with you to think about clarifying what the research you need is.”
02:20
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes a ton of sense, and it sounds like a really exciting (and ambitious) design challenge. Let’s break it down a bit and then we can shape up some directions for your research.

Understanding the "Jobs to be Done" Angle
So you're taking that "jobs to be done" framework and applying it to personal finance. Essentially, every spending decision someone makes is fulfilling some kind of underlying "job" or need in their life. You're not just looking at what they spent, but why they spent it and what that spending says about their deeper motivations. So you're kind of surfacing patterns that other tools might not even think about.

Defining Research Directions
Now, in terms of the research directions and how we could use AI to help with this, I think we can break it down into a few parts.

1. Mapping the Competitive Landscape
We should start by looking at what existing budgeting apps do and how they position themselves. For example, we can identify apps that focus on pure numbers and traditional budgeting (like YNAB or Mint) versus any that might already be dabbling in values-based or goal-oriented spending, if any exist.

We can outline a few key questions:

Which apps, if any, are moving beyond just categories and into motivations?

Are there any that talk about "why" people spend, not just "what" they spend?

2. Identifying User Motivations and Jobs-to-be-Done Clusters
Next, we could think about how to research and interview potential users. We want to understand the different "jobs" they feel they're doing when they spend money. So a direction for research might be:

Conducting interviews or surveys to map out common underlying motivations for different kinds of spending.

Using AI to cluster those responses and see patterns—like which types of spending people feel align with their "better selves" and which ones they regret.

3. Prototyping and Design Implications
Finally, we can explore how to translate these insights into an interface. That means thinking about how you visually and

You said:
“You hear me?”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
I hear you loud and clear! No worries at all. Sometimes these ideas are big and it just takes a second to distill them. But I’m definitely following along and I think we can turn those thoughts into some really clear research directions. Let’s keep going!

You said:
“Yeah, so I want you to help me with that stuff. I want you to help me think about the nuances of what research would even be appropriate here, not just what's on a contentious landscape, but also why. Why does it matter? I want to also think about who their kids are serving, because that matters. There are a lot of, like, I think the thesis here is not just that we're going to be a competitor to existing budgeting apps, but also that by reconceptualizing and shifting the paradigm of what budgeting even is, we can open up personal, but, like, money management to a broader group of people that currently don't see themselves as people who budget, because this is actually not about budgeting. This is not a budget at all. This is about personal investment, because everything you spend money on is a vote towards who you want to become.”
01:06
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let's dive into that. I think it’s a really powerful shift you’re describing, and it definitely opens up a whole new avenue for who this can serve and why it matters.

Nuances of the Research Approach
So let's think about the research in a few nuanced layers:

1. Beyond Just Competitors: Understanding the Why
We don’t just want to catalog what other budgeting apps do; we want to understand their underlying assumptions. Traditional apps assume people already see themselves as "budgeters," that they’re comfortable with the idea of tracking categories and maybe even like the process of budgeting. But a lot of people don’t see themselves that way at all. They might find budgeting tedious or irrelevant. So your angle is about tapping into a completely different mindset—people who want to think of their spending as a form of personal growth or self-investment rather than a chore.

2. Identifying the Audience: Who Are We Really Serving?
This is crucial. We want to figure out who feels left out by traditional budgeting tools. Are they younger people who see money as a way to express their identity? Are they people who feel intimidated by spreadsheets but love the idea of personal development? By identifying these segments, we can tailor the app’s messaging and features to resonate with them.

**3. Why This Matters: The Bro
You said:
“Yeah, I think like, sorry to interrupt you, but I have a thought. So I think part of the shift is also going from money being something that feels like a constraint, like as in you only have this much money and you must allocate it to XYZ, which doesn't make people feel good, which is almost like a faint hope law in an experience, versus a positive sum game where this isn't just about helping you save money, this isn't just about the scarcity, but it's about just honestly aligning with what you want to invest in. And then if you don't have enough money to invest in the things that you want to invest in, thought partner with you to prioritize what is worth spending on more than others, and then ultimately coach you through thinking about what would need to happen in order for you to have the room to want the things that you want to want.”
01:14
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and I love that shift in perspective. It's a really empowering way to think about it: moving from a mindset of scarcity and constraint to one of intentional investment and growth. It’s like you’re transforming the idea of budgeting from something that feels like a diet—where you're constantly denying yourself—into something that feels like a training plan for the life you want.

Refining the Research Approach: From Scarcity to Positive-Sum
So with that additional layer, our research can also focus on understanding how to convey this sense of empowerment.

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let’s keep rolling with it! So, to sum it up, we’re not just looking at existing tools and how they approach budgeting. We’re fundamentally reimagining the space. Your research direction can be about identifying what really motivates people who don’t see themselves as budgeters, and then crafting a narrative and a tool that makes them feel like they're investing in themselves.

In other words, we’re flipping the script from “you have to budget because you’re limited” to “you get to

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I’ll wrap that up! In essence, we’re shifting the whole story from a mindset of scarcity—where budgeting feels like a constraint—into a mindset of growth and alignment. The research you’re planning is really about understanding how to communicate that and who’s going to resonate most with that message. And of course, that’s going to help you design

You said:
“It's not just about how to communicate that, but also about understanding more honestly what's in the landscape. Like, really, what are the building blocks that exist? How are they talking about their product? What benefits are they discovering? They all kind of have the same set of features, or more or less the same set of features, but what do they tend to focus their energy on more in terms of their feature? What do they emphasize on more? And then, what are people saying about them? What are they known for?”

Absolutely, that makes

You said:

ChatGPT said:
No problem at all! Honestly, you’re adding really great layers to this. So let me sum that up in a neat little package for you.

Bringing It All Together
We’re going to be looking at the existing landscape of budgeting apps, but not just in a superficial way. We’ll dive into how they’re positioning themselves, what features they’re emphasizing, and what they’re known for among their users. That way, we can see not just what’s out there, but also where the gaps and opportunities are.

And of course, we’re doing this to understand how to communicate your unique approach—turning budgeting into a positive-sum, values-based investment in oneself— to people who might never have used a budgeting app before.

So we’re really blending two things: understanding the current market and then carving out your own niche within it. And that’s a really exciting place to be!

You said:
“Is there more that we could dive into? Like, for example, like what”
00:13
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, there's always

You said:
“who they seem to cater to, or like the last time they tried to venture out into a different messaging group as an attempt.”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Definitely, we can dive even deeper into that. It’s a great idea to look at not just who the current budgeting apps are serving, but also if and when they’ve tried to pivot their messaging or reach different groups. That could give you insights into what worked, what didn’t, and where the open opportunities lie.

So yes, part of the research could be exploring those shifts in their strategy—did they ever try to appeal to a different demographic, and how did it go? By understanding these nuances, you can find those white spaces in the market where your unique approach will really shine. So let’s definitely include that angle in your research plan!

You said:

00:01
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, we’ll cover all those angles. It’ll be like building a really rich picture of not just the features that are out there, but who those apps are actually trying to serve and how they’ve evolved. And with that, we can really pinpoint the space where your idea stands apart—making budgeting feel like a positive investment in oneself rather than a constraint. So yeah, we’ve got a great roadmap for your research, and it’s going to be exciting!

You said:
“Can I keep talking to you about this idea beyond the research?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
Of course, I’d love to keep talking with you about it! This is a really cool concept, and we can definitely explore it from all sorts of angles, not just the research side. So whenever you want to bounce around ideas or dive into other aspects, just let me know. I'm here for it!

You said:
“I'm thinking about, like, I think any time that you're trying to shift the paradigm of something, it's going to be hard to describe what it does. And I'm having a hard time distilling, like, the core essence of what the concept is here and why it's a true painkiller. I'm trying to figure out how, like, what pain, like, what pain point, what is the point in time to trigger in somebody where you'd want to go to them and pitch this product. And, of course, we're going to need to do actual user research to understand this, but I want at least sort of, like, our own hypothesis, not for the sake of being right, but for the sake of having an opinion on who we want to help and why.”
00:58
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and that makes a ton of sense. When you’re redefining a category, it’s always a little tricky to distill that essence right away. But having a hypothesis is a great way to start.

Finding the Core Pain Point and Trigger
So let’s think about it this way: the "painkiller" you're offering is relief from the negative emotions tied to traditional budgeting. For a lot of people, the pain point is that budgeting feels like a restrictive, guilt-ridden chore. They may have tried other apps and felt like failures when they couldn't stick to them, or they just felt that those apps didn’t match how they see their life.

The trigger moment for your product might be when someone realizes they want to feel good about their spending, not guilty. Maybe they've hit a point where they’re questioning not just how much they spend, but why they spend and how that spending aligns with their identity.

Building the Hypothesis
So a good hypothesis might be: you’re here to help people who feel disconnected from traditional budgeting tools and who are looking for a more positive, self-affirming way to manage their money. You want to turn moments of financial self-reflection into opportunities for personal growth, rather than just number-crunching.

So we can frame that as: you're helping people who want to see their money as a tool for self-investment, not just a constraint. And that’s the core pain point you’re solving: taking the stress and guilt out of budgeting and turning it into something empowering.

You said:
“Yeah, I think it's interesting because one of the problems is that, like, I myself and I've seen a close friend try other budgeting apps, and what happens is that fundamentally at the end of the day, if you're spending too much, and you're spending that much for a reason, and you look at how much money is coming in versus how much is going out, you're just like, okay, well, like, what am I supposed to do about this? Oh, create a budget. Okay, so now I gotta create a restriction, but then throughout the next, you're just like, there's a cognitive disconnect of thinking about, oh, I can only spend XYZ on groceries. I can only, like, these become, like, rules, and who remembers those numbers, right? Like, and it becomes a, throughout the month, are you gonna, like, keep coming back to see, like, where you're tracking with your spending? Like, you need to get, like, really obsessive for that to be the case, and it also becomes a little bit like calorie tracking, where it becomes, like, a negative feeling almost, and it just, like, a lot of times just, in my theory, won't work or doesn't work. So I want to, like, actually, as part of the research, dig into, like, online anecdotes of people saying, like, why budgeting didn't work for them.”
01:36
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that’s a fantastic angle to explore. You're really onto something, because what you’re describing is that sort of almost inevitable frustration that comes with traditional budgeting. It does become like calorie counting, where you have to keep these numbers in your head, and it feels restrictive and just not enjoyable. And a lot of people do fall off because it just doesn't fit into their daily life in a natural way.

So part of your research can absolutely be gathering those real-world stories, those anecdotes from people online about why they felt traditional budgeting failed them. That’ll give you a really solid understanding of the pain points you’re solving and reinforce why your approach is different. So let’s definitely include that in the plan!

You said:
“Yeah, so how is our approach different, right? Because it's like, okay, so one of the things I want to think about is the idea that it's forward-looking. Like, it's not trying to guilt-rid you into how you spent in the past and, like, how over budget you were and, like, make it a problem, right? Like, it's more about, okay, moving forward from now on, with every dollar that you're spending, who is it voting for? Is it voting for who you want to become? And then, from there, the budgeting angle—budgeting is essentially the only thing about money in and money out, right? Like, how much money can you afford to spend based on money that's coming in? So, that could come after, because it's like, it's almost like, as a starting point, it's not about creating that restriction to start. As a starting point, it's about reflecting on your next purchase or your most recent purchase. Like, the purchases as they happen, are they voting for who you want to become? Because before we talk about restriction, you first got to know, like, how much of the money you're spending is actually what you want to be spending, and how much other things do you want to be spending? And then you figure out, okay, how do you actually get there, right? Like, if it indeed is the case that, you know, you want to be spending all this money that you don't have, then you can have a different—the story of how to get there is different from if you are actually making enough money, you're just spending it poorly. And those are very different things.”
01:48
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and you're articulating a really powerful distinction here. The big difference in your approach is that it's not starting from a place of guilt or restriction at all. Instead of looking backward and saying, "Oh, you overspent here," you're looking forward and saying, "With each dollar you spend, what kind of person are you investing in becoming?"

And I love that idea that the traditional budgeting step—figuring out the ins and outs—can come later. First, it’s about aligning spending with values. Then, once you know what you truly want to invest in, you can figure out how to make the numbers work. And like you said, that story is very different depending on whether someone needs to shift their spending habits within their means or whether they need to think about increasing their income or making bigger changes.

In short, your approach is about starting with the "why" behind each purchase and turning budgeting into a forward-looking, empowering process. And that’s a really fresh angle!

You said:
“How do I communicate that? Like, if you were to explain to a different friend right now what you heard from me and the nuances that you've come to understand, what's your pitch?”
00:10
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let me give it a shot!

So imagine I’m chatting with a friend and I say: "Hey, you know how most budgeting apps feel like they’re all about restricting you, making you feel guilty if you overspend, and basically turning your finances into this numbers game you have to obsess over? Well, there’s this new approach that flips that on its head. Instead of starting with restrictions, it starts by helping you figure out what you really want to invest in—who you want to become with every dollar you spend.

Basically, it’s not about looking backward and feeling bad for overspending. It's about looking forward. Every purchase is a vote for the kind of life you want. And once you know what really matters to you, then you can figure out the numbers part. So it’s like a budgeting tool that’s actually not about budgeting first; it’s about aligning your spending with your values and then making the numbers work from there."

So that would be my pitch to explain your vision. It’s all about that forward-looking, values-first twist that makes it unique!

You said:
“It's about, like, understanding what you want to spend on and why before you figure out, well, okay, how do you make the ins and outs work such that you can continue to spend on things that you want to spend on? And might that involve challenging your assumptions about what it is that you want to spend on in a more dynamic way? And also getting coaching and discipline on cutting back on spending that don't make you who you want to become.”
00:30
ChatGPT said:
Exactly, you’ve got it. It’s all about that sequence: first understand what truly matters to you and why, and then figure out the financial logistics second. And you’re right—sometimes that means challenging your own assumptions about what’s actually important to you, and then having a bit of guidance to help you trim the things that don’t align with who you want to become.

So you’re really creating a dynamic, reflective process rather than a static set of rules. And that’s a super compelling way to think about it.

You said:
“So, this Friday, me and my co-founder, we're going to go into a design session where we're going to think about, like, basically do some sketching, some, like... We followed the ShapeUp product development methodology a lot, so, like, basically, we're trying to find the elements for interfacing in terms of, like, not interfacing in terms of building the interface, but in terms of, like, sketching out what it should feel like and look like, what are the core components of making progress beyond sorting? Because right now, all we have is an interface for sorting your transactions into the three buckets. And one thing that we've already implemented as unique is that we don't show raw transactions anymore. We use the power of AI to enhance it, either just as is, or we add in a pool of context from your emails so that you see the line items of what this product is actually for. And the idea is that drawing from the draft of the development methodology, we present the transaction to you, ensuring you have some, like, reason through, oh, what was this transaction? And then, oh, well, so theoretically, you need one or two, but rather, it almost, like, takes you back to that moment in time, just the same way you would in a draft of the development review. You're thinking, like, did I really, is this, was this what I wanted to become, right? So we have that sorting interface. I, myself, have reservations about whether, like, asking someone to just sort their needs, wants, and kills is actually the right way to do it, because, like, it's not always intuitive, what's a need and what's a want versus what's a kill. So, like, there's some visual communication to do over there. But right now, we're trying to figure out the next stage in the elements building, and what happens to the sort of transactions? How exactly do we push you to think about what's a want and what's a kill? So we want to start thinking about that, and it's complicated, because, like, you can have ideas about, like, a voice coach, like an AI voice coach, that, like, can do stuff, but then still, like, interface-wise is just a conversational coach. And I think that there's power in visuals. I think there's power in interface. Not because it's the only way for information to be communicated, but because it creates, it seeds in and solidifies your own internal understanding of where things stand. So the way in which you visualize a kill or, like, what's your kill list and how to work towards that has an impact on the behavior change. So I don't even know where to start thinking about that, right? Like, what happens to the transactions? Or even taking a step back, what does progress really look like? And how do we think about interface from first principles rather than just assuming, oh, you got to see a progress bar. Oh, you got to see, like, a pie chart. Like, let's not assume that. Like, what are the questions that I should come prepared with to think through on Friday such that we have a set of elements and interfaces by the end of Friday that shows us, you know, that is compelling as at least a hypothesis on the product that fulfills the monumental task that you've just described in the paradigm shift.”
03:50
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that’s a really exciting design session you have coming up, and I love that you’re approaching it from first principles. So let's think about the kind of questions that could help guide you and your co-founder on Friday. Here are a few that might be really useful:

Guiding Questions for Your Design Session
What does progress look like if we’re not using typical metrics?
Instead of assuming a progress bar or pie chart, ask: how would someone know they’re succeeding in aligning their spending with their values? What would that look like visually or conceptually? Maybe it’s not about a number going up but about a sense of alignment or a visual that represents a balanced life.

How do we make the concept of needs, wants, and kills intuitive?
Think about how to represent these three buckets in a way that’s almost self-explanatory. Maybe it’s through icons, colors, or even little narrative prompts that help users quickly feel the difference between them.

What happens after sorting?
Once users have sorted transactions, what’s the next meaningful step? Is it a reflection moment, a gentle coaching prompt, or a visualization of how their spending aligns with their goals? Basically, how do you show them their progress in a way that’s more about storytelling than pure numbers?

How do we incorporate gentle coaching without making it feel like another rule-based system?
If you’re considering a voice coach or conversational element, how do you keep it feeling like a supportive guide rather than a nagging reminder? What kind of language or tone would make users feel empowered rather than judged?

By focusing on these kinds of questions, you’ll be able to sketch out elements that truly reflect your vision. It’s all about figuring out how to represent this paradigm shift visually and interactively so that users intuitively get it. And by the end of that session, you’ll have some solid concepts to bring that to life!

You said:
“Yeah, because time to value is also a huge thing, right? You can promise all these profound changes, but if a user comes in and they don't see the traditional budgeting apps, it's like they come in and see clarity. How do you represent? What's the counterpoint to that? Like, what's the representation of, like, can you spend this much money? Like, maybe they sort their past week of transactions, and then we have some representation of, this is, according to your own sorting, according to your money, this is what you're voting for. Like, this is what you seem to care about. This is what you're trying to become less of. And this is how much you're paying in terms of your basic needs.”
00:46
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and I think you're spot on that time to value is crucial. People need to see something meaningful quickly, even if it’s not just a big number or a pie chart.

So the counterpoint to that traditional clarity might be a sort of immediate personal reflection. For example, after they sort just a week’s worth of transactions, they could see a snapshot that says, “Hey, based on what you’ve told us, here’s the kind of person you’re investing in becoming.” Maybe it’s a simple, encouraging visualization that reflects their values back to them—almost like a little mirror of what they care about. And it can be immediate, so they feel that sense of clarity in a more personal way.

In other words, instead of just saying, “Here’s how much you spent,” you’re saying, “Here’s who you’re becoming with your spending.” And that can be the quick, powerful insight they get right away. That’s the kind of immediate value that sets your approach apart.

You said:
“Yeah, so maybe like the next, if we could only build one more screen, it would be the screen that represents, well, based on your current sorting and based on like your current investments, this is the kind of person you're investing in becoming, and this is who you say you're trying to kill, and this is how much spending you have as a baseline. And then we can build on more and better experience on top of that to dive deeper into each of those ambitions, because maybe you're wrong, maybe that isn't, maybe that reflection, that description of who you're trying to become is wrong, and you want to reflect that, and maybe diving into why that's wrong and why you actually want to be different that from what's described there leads to some of the transactions that were initially categorized as ones becoming kills, and it could also mean that some of your kills become ones. But by default, we're going to assume that your kills are asshole kills, but you could always, it might make sense that sometimes you think something is a kill, but actually you are just being overly optimistic about how much you're trying to save, which is in like a mental model that people tend to come to budgeting apps with, it's like I'm trying to save money, versus like the idea that you're not trying to save money, you're trying to spend your money right.”
01:34
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that really ties it together nicely. So if you were to focus on just that one additional screen, it would be this immediate reflection that says, "Based on how you’ve sorted things, here’s the portrait of the person you’re investing in becoming." And then, of course, that reflection is a conversation starter. It’s a chance for the user to say, "Wait, is that really me? Or do I need to rethink some of these choices?"

And like you said, that opens the door for users to adjust. Maybe they realize something they thought was a "kill" is actually a "want" once they reflect on it, or vice versa. The key is that the tool is guiding them toward more honest self-awareness rather than just enforcing a budget rule.

And I love that framing: it’s not about trying to save money for the sake of it, it’s about spending your money right. That’s a really empowering message, and I think it’ll resonate with people who are tired of the old budgeting mindset.
