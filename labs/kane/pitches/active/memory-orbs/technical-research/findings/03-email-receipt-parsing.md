## Implications for Memory Orbs

### Coverage Reality
- Only 1 in 4 purchases have email receipts today
- Major retailers (Amazon, Walmart, Target) well-covered
- Small businesses likely have no email receipts

### Cost Considerations
- At $0.08/receipt, 1000 users Ã— 30 transactions/month = $2,400/month
- Volume pricing brings down to $0.04/receipt
- Gmail integration complexity may justify third-party services

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Focus on major retailers with known email formats
2. **Phase 2**: Add commercial API for broader coverage
3. **Phase 3**: Consider email integration for power users

### Privacy Approach
- Request email access only after demonstrating value
- Process receipts on-device where possible
- Allow manual receipt upload as alternative
