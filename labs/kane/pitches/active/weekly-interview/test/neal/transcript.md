Me: You know what I think happened with your mom? In that big star burger. What? I think she was just feeling emotions because she was leaving. She was thinking about the situation. That's why. She liked it more than the ocean. I liked it because of the context. Not because of the actual taste of her group. I also think that she probably liked the crispy cheese. I guess the cheese was good. Yeah. But that burger wasn't engineered. I don't think she's had a lot of burgers of that type. Okay? That's like a diner burger. And also, like, not smash, but close to smashed. Burger like she's not had that much. You know, like in Hong Kong, you get restaurant style burgers and like McDonald's and nothing in between. Well, actually liked it. Yeah. I think a separate success goal, and I'm writing that down right now. Is that we've had a run trying to stretch 3 Pro to its limit. You want to do that? Yeah. Okay, cool. No problem. Sounds great. I don't know. You probably know more about what it would mean to try to do that. But I'm open to it. That sounds like a great dual purpose. Experiment. It's a side quest. And the worse we get is, oh, it's not as good as we were asking it to do is more for us. We're trying to make. You're saying. Let's see if we can use AI to its greatest extent. Which is what we've been trying to do anyway. You haven't seen my pill box anywhere, have you? I think it's lost in a classic. In the spirit of. Becoming more realistic with time management. I'm going to put three hour appetite instead of two. I have an agenda. So. Ready. All right. So I was thinking. Both in order to make the most out of AI and also to gain the most clarity. We could possibly have around intent. We need to start by just really talking through the context. In full blown detail. Sure. Context. Has two parts. There's personal context. Like just a brain dump in the underlying jobs of this spending, basically. As well. As preexisting buckets that we can't control. Or can't change in a short term, like relative fixed costs. And then also the second part is a more fleshed out version of what you just described. With regards to what a successful system would feel like. The vision. For it. But I think the first one is a lot more tangible. The second one that we need to describe it, but it's less fleshed out. And then we can test. We can use AI as our thought partner for breaking down that context. Into a more sort of concrete mental model. Both in terms of what the inputs and outputs could be and what the flow flow in the sense of. Like, how would we operate this? What are the relationships between the different buckets? That kind of thing. Yes. I can share some inspiration. Cool. So the big unlock for me. Was something that I put off for five years. So Jason gave me early access to hey, email. Right. Five years ago. Yeah. And I just accumulated emails and emails and emails. Probably. Let's call it like 5,000 emails. Yeah. Got sent to that email. Yeah. And I never caught up with it. And it was clear that there were certain features and aspects. Of the service that are only available. If you have cleared your email. S. Yeah. So it was like there was like, this thing of the more time went on. Without me dealing with it. The more inaccessible the things that I wanted about the tool became. And then when I was reading in their FAQs or documentation. Was. They made it very clear. And the guy. I'd never read it. They made it very clear. Like this is designed for you to start fresh. So if you start clean, the system works. And that was when? A few weeks ago. I had the inspiration. I start clean. And once I did, a lot of my anxieties about the past started to get resolved. Because things kept bubbling up. That I had to suppress in order to cut through the noise. Yeah. The inspiration for this budget. Opportunity is very similar. In that the problem that people have with managing finances and budget is that they take the weight of their past to the present, and then they get overwhelmed. So I'm almost interested in starting with the intent of a system. Saying from you right now. How do you put a system in place where you are now presently and proactively addressing your expenditures? What's less about a deep analysis. Of your past, and it's more about designing defensively for your financial future. So not accounting, but financial modeling. Yeah. And that's why I feel like has been actively missing from budgeting. And honestly. It's one of the hardest things that founders. I struggle getting founders to do for their business es. Even though it's something I love for my business. And I hate for my personal I hate it for my personal situation. Because at this point in my life, I'm making more money than I ever have. Right. So I've never had this much cash to think about what to do with and this much income on a monthly basis on what to do. I've never had this number of expenses either. So I'm finally at this critical point in my life. Where I have to go, okay? And you and me. Think about my family to be mindful of and my dad's health coming up, and my mom's going to need. There's all these things I need to be ready. And plan and prepare for that. I am finally ready to face the music. So I need help, and I know it. Separately. I have two other businesses I'm trying to start. Yeah. The way we're going about starting to talk about this makes me think that. I remember when we were talking about our projects and how we research, had set up our production studio and whatever. Like products productions to you. As we can model it after art artistic productions to use. Tell me more. What do you mean? I feel like the way we keep having new ideas and inspirations for things, that in the past, if you were building a single business, you can't afford to think about so many things at the same time. But now it's almost like you can think in systems. You can think in systems. Well, to a limit. Like there's a point where it is still beneficial. It. Focus on thinking about a few things. But at least right now and more broadly, We can draw inspiration from how more artistic, creative production studios operate, potentially. With regards to managing the pipeline of things that we want to do and why and how. Just a potential thought. I don't know. Enough to be concrete about that. Well, I know a little bit. For me. I think of systems at a certain level. But I definitely thought about for a long time. There's our financial system s. There's our health systems. There's our productivity and progress systems. There's our business systems that are adjacent to the productivity, progress and finance systems. And then there's the relationship system, so people that you interact with and care about. Then there's our learning system. You have learning systems. Education. There's productivity. Business progress. There's health, wellness. Financial and then also personal. I don't know. Where does home fit in? Where does it depends on the job. Yeah. I don't know. There's a whole web of these different systems. And concerns that are around, and there's, like, different apps that we hire to help us with some of them and not all of them. Basecamp is the closest system I have. That contains more of this than anything. It's the closest I've gotten. The same way. They've organized emails into those three buckets. There's probably a higher level way to think about those buckets. You just disagree. Why haven't I scheduled my hemorrhoid surgery? Haven't I actually done all the things that my doctor says in the Circle Medical notes? Every month. I meet with her? Why haven't I cut out all of the monthly payments that are 50 to $100? A month. But I'm not even looking at her paying attention to that. I've signed up for service I don't use anymore. There's all these really low hanging fruit things that are a few clicks away from being resolved. That I'm just woefully neglected. And now I feel full confidence as of June 14, 2025, where I'm like, AI is going to help me do anything. I was writing, doing 80%. Faster. You just need to set up the right system. For that. For all these things to start happening. And it's incredibly parallel to progress management for businesses. Exactly. Because if I keep track of all of the complexities I'm managing in my life, I know most people don't have the amount of complexity I do. So if I design these systems to address each of these things, One piece of this thing that I saw for myself is helpful to a lot of other people. Like once again. It's an AI Native version of how you've been using Basecamp. Yes. Or how you want to use basecamp. It's a container for all the progress. I want to manage them up, yeah. Exact exactly. Okay? So taking a step back. Which is where nsg bc kind of came in. For me. Because I wanted to, basically. Some of the most impressive personal websites I've seen. Have been people demonstrating their creative technical prowess. In the spirit. Of like this is me. It's almost like their digital home. Yeah, right. Yeah. So part of me, my way of introducing tools like this for other people and sharing them is by saying, here's how I use it. Yeah. I think it wouldn't make sense. Given the intent of starting future forward rather than analyzing the past. In terms of breaking down the current context. I think we should start from the top in terms of what is important to you right now. In terms of spending. Aspirational. I've thought about that. Yeah. I need a beanbag. Shit. The muji body pillows. Right. Now I want to sit like this. Muji has the body beanbags. I want to be like this. And talk to you. We need speakers in there. That's what we need. Which can come from Oakland. Yeah. I think there's a hybrid approach between those two options. But anyway. I think we should start from talking about higher level aspirations to basically like top of mind talk about the car. Which car. Talk about the car. Aspirations in terms of spending. You said you want to be able to afford a monthly payment for a Tesla. Well, I know I need to. That feels like. You start from the biggest and you work your way down the smallest. Yeah. Because what we learned when we looked at the budget last time was that the biggest expenses made the biggest difference. Yeah. Which was rent and mortgage. Exactly. So okay. Start from the top, then. Well, we know Estabs is renming Oakland. Red. Ends in two weeks. Which happens in two weeks. How much was monthly rent? Yeah. $5,000 a month. Here. $4,000 a month. For chicago. Understood. It's just like 10k a year. At least. So roughly you would break that down? And maintenance. So we will break that down to also another 5k. So just with these two alone. 10K a month. More than that. But there's also some of the utilities. But that's less significant. I've been covering that, but we should build that in too. Okay? So that's vague. What's a variable? So what's fixed? Is mortgage and utilities over here. What's variable? Is what is a rent budget for what we decide to live moving forward? In debate. Well, there's a few things that I hope happened today. Yeah. One is cancel anything. And everything. That we decide isn't necessary to spend money out of order. I really want to do that. I think that would be just a huge win. Because it opens up a lot of free cash flow. Savings for reallocating. I think that there's enough expenses. That I'm incurring. That would cover at least the Tesla Model Y payment for Chicago. How much is that? Probably less than 500. Okay. Well, let's continue to start from the top. I'm just letting you know. That car we just drove that's already available to us. If I just cut expenses. Understood? Okay, so start from the top. We have the fixed cost of the mortgage and utilities over here. And the variable, which is a variable that we want coming out of today. As well. On top of that. Which is the budget. If you want to make all of these other things happen. What is the budget? Was the meant for how much rent you're paying? Moving forward. And taxes. Yeah. And by the way. I made 10k on my Nvidia stock. So I had 60k in there. And it's 70k now. But I still have to pay taxes on that. Yeah. And that's all still in the Robinhood account, just sitting there. Yeah. That made me feel better about getting the motorcycle stolen. But that's like. You can't count on that. You just literally just airing out where everything is. Yeah. I'm just saying that that sounded my bank account currently. But can be transferred in. Yeah. But in the context. Of building up from scratch. Financial model. Future forecasting. That's more like. That's like if a company got a one off contract that gave them a boost. You're talking about the 10K. I'm just talking about the cash. Okay? That's just my bonus money that I now have. I've cashed. That is important to know for the sake of any emergency. Not just emergency, but, like, investment. So that's on a cash balance. Front. Yes. What are. Okay, so we start from the rent. What are the other. This is a bad way to ask it. But basically what I'm trying to get to is, like, what are the other underlying themes or jobs of spending? Like, what are the categories of spending from the lens of. Well, you're spending for. It's actually up for me to decide now. That was all what it was. Up till now, yeah. Which is why I'm trying to. Okay? Let's have three to the side. Because up till now it was programmed. Programmed. Program. Yeah. Conquered. Events. Expenses. The office is throwing away. My obligation to spend time with founders no longer physical. Yeah. I do have an obligation to spend time in the Bay Area. But only under my terms. I can just refuse things that cost money. Well, okay. Always been with Texas. I just do things. And then I hope I can expend some defensive mode. Where I'm only going to do things. That cost money. If they're expensive. If they're not going to spend, I won't do it. So I think that changes my entire outlook for how I spend money. Because most of my money, most of my expenses have been textile related. Yeah. Most of our variable expenses. Yeah. So I think that is like a cash nuance in a context of a financial model. That in reality, idealistically, you know, like, of course, there's always going to be slight discrepancies. But at least idealistically, that should cancel out. Right. Like reimbursements versus spending. Yes. But it actually is deeper than that, in my opinion. Because it effectively shifts the outlook of my expenses. Like, the things that I'm on the hook right now that I'm actively paying for, I need to not pay for. Yeah. Yes. But I'm saying that in a mental model of. If you think, if we're thinking about this, like building a financial model, Yes. There's a practical aspect of how to make it such that it cancels out and that because of the limited budget, we'll have to mean that the outlook and system for deciding what to spend on, like, operationally day to day, has changed. But in a context of how the numbers add up, which is, I think, where we're starting with, right? Like that almost cancels out to zero. Like techstars really to spending and what we're talking about. No. I would not say that 60 to 70% of my tech stars expenditures have been absorbed to move by me personally. Not expensive. I'm saying looking forward. Is that ideal? Like, Is that how it should be? And if it's not reimbursed? Cancel out. Yeah. So we need to figure out how to make it cancel out. And also, what are the drop boundaries around? What are the types of spendings that you would still be willing to make personally? There are founders that you're closer to that you wouldn't say no to grabbing dinner with, even with Jake. I think I would say no to everything. Okay? I think, obviously notice. I'm going to start with no. Okay. I mean, that's great. Budget. Budget. That's great. Start with nothing. And then add when you know you can afford it. That's great. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, like, the why and the what, right? Like there's the how of how you get that to zero, but the what is that Program spent spending on a personal budget basis should be zero. So what are other different programs? Spending. I guess up till this point, for the past like six years, you've had a very blurred line between program and personal spending. And now we need to draw much clearer line and we almost need to then understand, well, then what are the buckets of things that you are willing to spend personal money on for reasons outside of program. What you haven't had to think as much about before. They're spending time with family. I'm just going to list out a bunch that I observe. These aren't buckets. These are just categories. Or just, like, ideas of things. You're visiting Jason or basically, like, deep connection opportunities. Deep connection opportunities that aren't framed under the lens of Techstars, mentorship development or EIRs, but personally, these are people or communities that you need to stay connected to for your own growth and your own just personal network purposes. So that's one category of spending, and sometimes it overlaps that. Corkins is both part of it. Is both for creational and part of it. Is the networking aspect and also whatever. Spending time with family. And then there's personal. Oper operational conveniences. Such as uber rides. Yeah. We should take a lot of. And you don't think twice about. I mean, honestly, you're Uber rights alone would be like 500amonth. More. Easily. Well, that's different. Than for the past three months. Is a total anomaly. Yeah. I understand. It's just all airport. Yeah. But also before. Even when you aren't traveling, you do tend to Uber a lot. But you also don't go outside a lot, so it's like every time you're going outside, you're basically Ubering. Which will change if you rely more vehicles. Yeah. Fix the ali. Exactly. But, like personal operational conveniences, could involve other things. Right. Like, Uber is, like, the biggest example. But, like, even some productivity, personal productivity software could account into that, even though that's, like, a very small bucket of money. Relatively. Like I'm talking about parameters. Basically. And then finally there's just, like, fun money. Like, I don't know, money you spend on buying the latest 100 merch. That's a different category. Or. Like the collector's edition of Tough Stranding, too. Exactly. That kind of stuff. I'm having a little bit here, by the way. Cool. I switched the address today. Today. So that kind of spending. Like the purpose of transcribing is so that we can just throw out examples of spending and try to articulate the job underlying it. Because I think the premise of organizing money, part of the inherent assumption of saying that there's a financial model for personal life, is that all spending have an outcome. Some of them, or it's like spending framed as investments, basically. Yeah. Well, there's Neo's personal spending. There's Neil's tech. Start spending. There's meals. New business. Taco Bell and shopping. And then there's Neil's extracurricular spending, which is like Corkins and Cheryl Winter. And I guess those can be categorized under personal as well. And then you can flag or tag them as those different extracurriculars. They don't fit in the context of those separate entities. Distinctly. Because ultimately those are personal absorbed commitments. That's what I mean. There's a lot. Of ways to slice the same spendings, and the most typical way is to slice it by bucket. In terms of project. It's this personal and professional, though, for me. Yeah. Understand. And then the professional has three buckets, which is Takuma, Shogunan and techstars. And then the personal has a ton of buckets. But they're still just perfect. I guess. Professional is still the right categorization of expenses. Or the underlying difference is that the professional spendings have a much more direct monetary roi. Associated with this vending. And then the personal roi is less, is more like soft roi. Stuff that doesn't immediately reflect on. I don't know. What you mean. Harmonic ROI isn't if you spend money, presumably if you spend more money, like, thinking about it, like a financial model where you could have parameters. Right. Like if you spend more money on shokuno, for example. How much more money could that drive? In terms of income. Got. Understood? That makes sense. And yes, that's going to be rough because also, this is not a company specific financial model. So this is going to be like, higher level. And based on a lot rougher assumptions. But let's just say roughly, like because it's not money allocated towards Takamaru Shokuna for no reason. Right. Like. It's like, well, what is that money going to return? Well, I don't want a vehicle in California. For my personal convenience. Except for when it's ski season. I want to be able in California because I have all these people I need to go see and things I need to do. My uber budget. Could cover the monthly expense of evil instead. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Which is why it depends on I think we should categorize spending and budgeting based on job. Job as in what is the job of the expense. Job at expense. Like, what is it? What is it? You need to budget dot com. Great. To know their language. How they talk. Because that's the way you're talking is how they 15 years. Who do you want to be? And how can the money you earn help you get there? That's exactly it. Basically. Yeah. Probably wind up is that the manual work wasn't intrinsically. It didn't make intrinsic sense for me at the time. It makes intrinsic sense to me. Now. So Ynab versus Ynab versus Monarch. I'm curious to know that the difference.  
Them: So I want to search for the best budgeting app. If you don't know how much money is coming in or going out of your life, You're probably going to struggle to have a healthy relationship.  
Me: Finances.  
Them: With your finances.  
Me: Did you think of your.  
Them: You should think of your budget. And your money as a business. And it's really the business of you. Just like any business, you need to track your income. Your expenses and ultimately plan for long term growth.  
Me: Plan for longer term growth.  
Them: This strategy has helped me in my own personal life to pay off my student debt. And really just to get ahead financially overall.  
Me: Financially.  
Them: For background. YNAB is different from some other budgeting methods you may be used to in that it's a zero based budgeting system. So what does that mean? Basically every dollar you have needs to be assigned a purpose. Whether it's paying for rent, groceries, student debt, or just kept a savings. In this way, you allocate your money. To ensure your budget is fully accounted for. Down to zero. Again. This doesn't mean you're spending every dollar. You can have some money as savings. Every dollar just needs a purpose. The important thing to note with YNAB is that you only budget for the money you currently have available today. Said another way. You don't include future paychecks or any money that's expected to come in until it's actually available.  
Me: Expected. To come in actually available. To create a narrative for.  
Them: There are two main ways to create and access your account, the first being a mobile app available for Android and iPhone users, and the second way being a web app available on your computer. The system itself is fairly straightforward in design and relatively easy to use once you get the hang of it. Next for full transparency. Widen costs money to use.  
Me: Interviews.  
Them: There is a free trial. For a little over a month, and I'll leave an affiliate link in the description if you're interested. But yes, the full version costs money. The annual cost is currently a little bit over $100. And you're probably thinking that it is counterintuitive. To pay for a budget ing app. And while that's totally understandable, According to YNAB, the average user saves $6,000 in their first year. I believe if you put your own money into a program, You're more likely going to actually budget. Beyond spreadsheets, there are free alternatives. But I've noticed, at least in my experience, like, 99% of the time, You have to pay to use certain features. There's really nothing that's fully for free. Just my thoughts, but either way, I'd recommend at least giving the free trial a chance link in the description. If you haven't been scared away yet, let's learn how Ynab actually works.  
Me: That actually works. In the description.  
Them: Once you follow the link in the description. You'll be hit with this screen. Where you can start your free trial. Sign in, and then from there you're going to be met with a starter budget template. And this is the main ynab dashboard. As you see here, there are different categories. Needs, wants and then certain line items that are just pre populated. And may not be relevant. For your own budget. As a first step, I recommend connecting your bank accounts and any credit cards that you actually use. This is one of the best features of ynab. It allows you to take your transactions, the items you spend the money that comes in, and have it flow directly into this YNAB dashboard. It's done through plaid, which is really the industry standard. It's a secure, trusted platform. And once you connect your accounts, you'll notice at the top in the green, ready to assign. That's basically your available balance. At this point, I think it's best to start to really modify the budget. To make sense for your own life. For example. If you pay Ren instead of a mortgage, you can modify text. Additionally, you can add in a new category. This is something I like to do and just call it savings. Then from there you can drag up something like emergency fund, if you have one, if you're working towards building one. And then maybe you want to add something like a Roth IRA. You're trying to max out with $7,000 per year.  
Me: If you ever wanted to. Add. Conjugations.  
Them: Of contributions. Then you can go in here and add targets. This is essentially the amount you expect to spend per month. Per week. Per year. I prefer to do my budgeting by month. As you can see, I type in an estimate. Maybe it's fifteen hundred dollars for rent. Then certain amounts for your phone Internet utility.  
Me: Let's see. Third one. What is up, guys? It's another tile.  
Them: Hey, what is up, guys? It's Brendan here. And today we're going to be comparing some of the top budgeting apps. Now budgeting apps are everywhere. But which one actually works for your money? Well, in this video, we're going to be comparing Ynab versus Monarch money.  
Me: Versus.  
Them: Versus Wallet Hub and which is the best of the three of some of the most popular budgeting tools out there.  
Me: Popular budgeting tools out there.  
Them: Whether you're a zero based budgeter, a wealth builder, or you just want your credit score to stop haunting you, that's going to be taking a look at here in today's video. Again comparing Wallet Hub, Monarch Money and ynab. Now, I have personally tested and used all three of these budgeting tools. That we're going to be taking a look at here in today's video. And first, we're going to be starting with, you know, what app does each of the different things best, Right? Because each app kind of caters to different people. And in terms of different features as to what might be best for each type of person. And at the end of the video, we're also going to be summarizing, you know, which is kind of best for each type of person. To help you decide between Ynab, Monarch or Wallet Hub. So first things first, of course. With Ynab or you need a budget. So again, in terms of each of the different apps, Is better for someone who maybe needs a more proactive approach. Maybe you're paying down debt.  
Me: Monthly budget.  
Them: And maybe you're really just trying to look at that monthly budget. They do also have the network tracking, but it's not necessarily as in depth as Monarch. Same thing if they're reporting in categories. Monarch just gives it a little bit more visibility. Into that. But it can sometimes be a little bit of too much of a hands off approach. If you aren't being tactical with it. Whereas Ynab kind of forces you to have that tactical approach.  
Me: So again.  
Them: So again, in terms of each of the different apps, if you would like deeper dives or would like to check them out more.  
Me: It's more traffic.  
Them: Again. Feel free at the links down below. In the video description. If you want to check them out, maybe start free trial, I would test. You know, test them out, at least give them a shot. Try them out for yourself. And kind of, you know, see which one you like best, because ultimately it really is a personal decision as to which one.  
Me: Forces you to go. This goes to has to go here. This has to go here. Monarch kind of gives you the assessment. What we're talking about is different than both of those. Yeah. No. We're basically trying to come up with scenarios. And talk through life plans. And go. If Neo has the apartment. And Oakland and is paying 4,000. This is what it looks like. If he doesn't do that. And he does this instead. We want to be able to dance a little bit. With our scenarios. Play with the wife a little bit. It's a test drive. Thing. I agree with you about the spreadsheet first. In that case. Yeah. Let's do it. But we still need to, like, okay. We mapped out a few of the big variables. What else? We covered. Red covered the aspirations for the car payment. We. We covered a bucket of the extra expenses. We talked about personal bucket. I truly think it's not a bad idea. As context for AI to put in one of the Monarch months. But one that's more representative. So not the past three months. And one that has been labeled, which we did last year. There's family and friends, money. Which you're wanting to make it less. Actually. I mean, the trade off of, not the benefit of not providing any context of what actual transactions have been in the past is the hey thing where you're starting from scratch. That's what I'm saying. I'm ready to change my lifestyle. To accommodate a new aspiration. Yeah. I'd rather have more money available for high tech transportation options. And AI investments. Tools and resources. Than anything else. Getter gpu. Yeah. Those things are more important to me. Than most other. I'm willing to go. I can't go to dinner anymore. I'm willing to say. Hey, guys, I can't hang out. Anymore. Come over and I'm available to cook dinner twice a month. Max. I'm not interested. In any of the superfluousness anymore. I don't need it. I don't want it. My systems have been broken down in a way that I no longer interested in allowing. Because what am I? Best moments in the past six years. Was the month where I didn't eat. I love. That month. It was hard, but I got to talk to you every day. I got healthier. And I just focused on work. And I liked it. You need focus. Like more than anyone. Your time and energy has been clawed upon by everyone. In all context s. In a way that has not allowed you to focus on making the progress that you want in any of them. Okay? That's helpful context for that. I just want to slash and burn. So much. And free up a lot of space to breathe. Is there anything that we haven't talked about in terms of things you're willing to spend money on? You said you willing to invest in business. I'm going to plan another teacher. My birthday is now the trigger for planning a ski trip. Yeah. So every year. My birthday gift to myself. Is an email to all my friends planning our next feature. August and November. Okay? Which I'm on the hook for personal. Yeah. What is your job? Of that money. Of what? Of the text, race, Japan money. I'm treating it like a vacation. That's what I gathered. Like this is the limitations of traditional budgeting, right? Because work money, but it's not. It's not worth money in that I'm spending it personally. And I'm not getting reimbursed. Yeah. And also that also is reflected in the fundamental motivation of the reason why you're still willing to do it. Even though you have to spend personal money is because you're investing in something else. Yeah. Yeah, I want to buy motorcycle. For what? Motorcycle for California. So there's like, there's two jobs. In california. One is a vehicle for ski trips, and then the other one is the vehicle for overriding traffic limitations. Yeah, so that you can get to your things faster. Yes. That's basically doing the job that Uber has been doing. Okay? And then you're willing to spend on investing in new businesses. Which. The lower level of what that means. And that's a later conversation, but that's a professional lever that he's from a money so that you can make more money. So that's on the professional side. And on the personal side. You're looking for network growth. You're looking for personal life, like wellness enhancements. If you're looking for family and friends. And then there's the fun money. Which will always be there. But it's variable. Yeah, but I want to invest in basically maximizing our access to AI tools. Yeah. I think that's one of the smartest things to invest in. If you utilize it. Yeah, if we use it well, because our productivity, it implies, like, supercharged productivity. At discounted rate because we haven't hit the part where all of these things are going to become more expensive. I mean, they're coming cheaper. But, guys. There was a time when the Internet. We were at this phase. Where things were available. It's going to get worse. Well, it's going to get worse. In the sense of the baseline of what's acceptable and usable is going to increase. The more expensive stuff isn't going to be for the same things that exist today. All I'm saying is that trust me on this. It's going to get more expensive. Sure. Yeah. That's all I'm trying to say. If you want to stay competitive. You're going to be paying a premium. Already today. Easy. I'm just letting you know. It's $20. A month until you pay $200 a month for both an employee. Yeah. Okay? AI spending. So I think what we can do now. How's the charger in your computer? Good. I think what we can do now. Before we jump into getting AI to do stuff with what we just said. I think it's worth. We've been hinting at the vision for what it is. That we want to put together. But I think it's worth. Fleshing out a little bit more. Why the all the existing solutions for budget ing. Which is this whole big category in tech. And elsewhere. Why what we're talking about is not a soft problem. Because I can't have this conversation with something, and it just kind of shows me, okay? Okay, here's what we need. To do. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. That's definitely the future. Is that just it, though? Is it just that? Because if we attach a chat bot to. You need a budget. With that. No. It won't, because then it goes, all right. So every day you want me to ask you these questions? And get this information. Every week. You want me to ask these questions to get this information? Every month. You want me to ask these questions? Get this information. Proactively. Yeah. So it's like. Well, I guess what I'm saying is I want to have a daily, monthly and weekly daily, weekly, monthly check in with my personal budget. Ing assistant accountant, financial expert person. I don't think that encapsulates what you're talking about. It does. In all of the assumptions I'm making about what this genius person would do for me. Like here are all the things that I filed the expenses for you today. On. Are these all the things you want to be spending money on, or should I cancel some of these going forward? Should I adjust these going forward? Should I switch your budget around? Here are some of my suggestions for what I think you might want me to do. Confirm all of these before I make them. I think, yes. And also I think the same way, all of these, what's out there? Is like what's superhuman is to email. They can make it infinitely complicated. At automations. All of them are going to add, like, chatbots at some point where you can talk to your finances. That's, like, one of the most pitched things. I'm just saying that. Cora did a good job. Hated a better job. I understand. Hate has no AI. I understand. There's no AI. It's literally just. Which is why. It's so good. Your life is intuitive. Now, which is why. What I'm saying is the layer that's like, let me talk to it. Or there's a coach. That's almost like an interface thing. It is. Yeah, but if there were an inbox for my expenses. On a daily, weekly, monthly basis. And I just saw the numbers, and I could just categorize the numbers as I saw them come in. And then go. This is to be eliminated. This is a one off that goes into this fun money budget. There's a way to take the expenses in as they come. And basically just play the game of over time. It'll become a genius at understanding you. But in the beginning. It's your job to intuitively categorize the money as it's been flowing out and in. Maybe the money flows in and out, and as it does. It learns what your life is. What your money life is. Is that how proactive financial modeling for business works? No, that's different. So the proactive, that's a separate job. So separate content. So what I'm talking about is how do we make sense of today? Like past expenses. Up to now. How do we understand you? Right. So you have this thing where it's almost like you could do it like a. Like a train. You're training it. So here's your expenses. Let's go through a month of your expenses. You know, and then based on that month, We'll learn enough about you to understand how the stuff should work going forward. And then tell me what's going on in your life. In the next year. Are you going to keep your job? What's your income? Now your income going to change? What's your bonus structure? What are you anticipating for that? What's the low and high of that? What are the other expenses? That tend to come up every year that you don't always anticipate or predict. What trips do you plan in to take? What other side income do you have? Where have you had the loan money? Or offer up. There's all these nuanced things that happen in life. That people know designer account for. In the future. What are some of the things that you're hoping that you could spend money on that you haven't or that you would like to? Given the desire to start blank state right now. Wouldn't it? From my view, I've been operating or asking questions on the assumption that what we want to focus on right now is the test drive. Thing. Not the tracking thing. Both sure. They connect. They're connected. Basically, it's June 14th. Mine starts July 7th. Yeah. Between now and July 7th. I want to have a handle on my finances in a way where going into July 7th, I know what I can sprint towards for my new project. Outside of being obligated to spend my time for tech starts. So that when I come back August 1st. I have systems in place for my personal life. Takuma, Shokuna and Texars, so that all four of my primary buckets of life activities are under control, organized thought, fully planned and designed for financially and otherwise. The reason why I say that we should focus on the modeling, though, is because I think the tracking part is pretty much soft. By Monarch because the mobile app has that swiping thing. Totally agree. Yeah. So I think we need a workflow operationally to match that. Tracking that habit of reviewing expenses. That show up on Monarch and being like this was for this category. This was for that category. We might even want to do a refresh. Of the categorization given new circumstances. We need to add in business expenses that aren't tech stars, for example. But that's a monarch. Manageable thing that they're much better at. Already. And I think what's missing. From Monarch. And what's, by the way, you're paying for Monarch already. What's missing from Monarch is the proactive modeling of the future. Well, so, I mean, I was just thinking about my own expenses. I'm almost interested in getting rid of and not even factoring in tech starts, expenses. Exactly. What I'm saying is, and again, this is aggressively simplistic. But I'm thinking. You say no? I think fixed variable, one off. Yeah. Fixed variable, one off. With outcomes attached soon. Yeah. Those are the three categories. Of expenses. In mind. Simple brain. Fixed variable and one off. That's numerically. That makes sense. In the context of figuring out scenarios. Like in order for you to be able to figure out the scenario. For how much would it make sense for me to spend on, like, shokuno? Like, what would need to come as an output of you putting a certain number in? We'd have to plan and bet. What do we want to do? Shokuna. Yeah. What would be done with that money, which is on its own financial model name for Shokana. Right. Okay? Before we jump into the next step. Two things. One. I think we need to explain a lot more explicitly on a transcript. The situation that you're in. What's your job? What's your, you know. All that. Quickly. Yeah. The second thing is. Let's just do the first thing. I had something else. I'm the managing director at Tech. Serves in San Francisco. I co locate between Chicago and San Francisco. Because I used to be the managing director of Texar Chicago. My spins and overall company expenses across the board of our accelerator programs has been significantly reduced. So my co living situation in both the Bay Area and in Chicago. Presents some significant personal costs that are arguably not necessarily actual personal obligation expenses. But I have embraced them as personal obligation expenses for the sake of practicality in both lifestyle and effectiveness in my role. All that being said, going forward, Now that my next active program, which is my high expense cycle for my year round job in this role, doesn't begin until March of 2026. So between now and March of 2,026, the primary work that I have to do is managing director and techstar San Francisco. Is largely related to networking, sourcing, and selecting potential investments for my next class. Starting in March of2026. So because of that, my primary goal is to simplify how I spend my time and money to focus primarily on AI first initiatives that allow me to scale and automate a lot of my working models and practices. And also, the other big part of my job over the next nine months before my next class starts, is to support my portfolio. Companies, of which I have nearly 160 and with over 300 founders. I am in touch with and have obligations to maintain some sort of connection. And support systems around going forward. My plan is to spend the least amount of money required to interact with them and spend time with them. Which. Which in the past has been related to dinners and coffees and meetups. And travel. And lots of other money spending activities that I no longer need to conduct in order to be supportive to them, especially if I take an AI first approach. And then on top of that, there's a lot of other professional opportunities. Such as meetings with investors, meetings with mentors, meetings with potential team members and potential founders that I'd like to invest in that I now need to do my best to design against needing to actually participate in and stick to a digital and AI first related kind of filter. For. So the more money and time I spend automating and making my workflow AI focused in first, the less I need to actually step out into the outside world and spend money in ways that I don't want to anymore or need to anymore. To make professional progress. The other three aspects of my life are two new companies that I am starting. One is called Shokanash S h O K U N A which is a research demand side driven initiative that I'm doing with my friend Liliana. Are trying to develop a consulting business where we work with companies. In approximately six week projects to do research of their customers and help them better understand the demand side of the equation. Of learning about how they're actually helping people make progress. And how they can generate more business progress and opportunities for their company by better understanding their customers. The other project is with my girlfriend, Kate. She and I are working on another project called Takuma Tak Uma. Which is meant to be our AI focused product development studio. Where we have ideas and projects that we are developing that we think could not only make our lives better and be in support of other people who need AI first, both training and projects completed, but we also plan to build out our own products and projects alongside learning as much as we can by helping other people make progress as well. We don't quite know the income outlook. For it. But what we do know is that at the very least, Kate probably needs to get to a point where she's earning $10,000 a month. Within the next three months. So that's another goal that we have for her. As far as my financial outlook for both Shokuna and Takuma, Kate and Liliana as my partners for those businesses are the priority when it comes to income. I'm not assuming that I would get any income from either of these entities in the near future. And instead my primary income is coming from tech sars, of which I'm getting paid. I think at the bottom level, income wise. $220,000 per year. But nearly half of that goes towards taxes, fees, expenses, and other obligations that are related to either federal expenses, healthcare expenses, or whatnot. And then the other half of the cash is largely being spent on a monthly basis across my two living situations, primarily along with the myriad of expenses, both fixed and variable expenses, many of which I'm in a position where I can now cut or reduce dramatically. A lot of that was dining out lots of extra payments for things that I no longer either need. Need access to. Or goods and services. That I no longer need to continue buying. Lots of nice to haves. And not as many must haves. So what I want to do now is assess my personal budget. Because the majority of my expenses, even if their work or personal have been going to my personal obligations and have been leaving my bank account and my active savings are relatively limited. So what am I missing? I think right now this is very focused. This is great. This is great context. It's very focused on past or present. What I want to do going forward. Is I want to reduce my rent expense in California. But I have to have some sort of living situation in California. Because my formal job that is paying me that 220k. Is under the agreement that I live in California. And work in California. So I am planning to activate Elise again. At least expires on June 27th in Oakland. In san francisco. And the question is, where do I live and how much money do I spend? How much money should I spend? Where I'm going to live. What I've been spending so far is. North to $5,000 per month. Just for the apartment. I would like to spend significantly less than that. But not to the extent that it impacts my productivity. In my living situation. In a way that is negative. But the other big obligation or important factor going forward. Is that I want to be able to, let's just say, spend $3,500 a month. In california. For living and then approximately $4,000 a month. In Chicago to continue living with the mortgage I have here and the rent that I would pay there. So that's $7,500 a month. Between the two places for living expenses, but at the same time. Have the ability to provide my family and myself with an electric vehicle in Chicago when I'm here working and making progress with Kate. And also having two vehicles in California. One that's an electric vehicle that allows me to get around and get jobs done and also travel as needed. Around the bay area. And then also have a motorcycle to be able to travel and get around the Bay Area when traffic is bad. Especially if I look on Treasure Island. One thing I did learn, Kate, is because we walked around and we talked to some people. So what we learned is that the bridge sometimes can get shut down. So you end up becoming reliant on the ferry. Or it doesn't get shut down. But the traffic gets really bad. When the traffic is really bad, you're stuck. Unless you have a motorcycle. So if you have a motorcycle, you can get around that and get through the bridge. But a lot of people complain by being on Treasure island and stuff. On a bridge. On the bridge gets stuck or traffic is fed. Understood? So basically, you want electric vehicle and a motorcycle, because that's the killer combo to always have a way to get out. The Fairy takes eight minutes to get to the Fairy Building in San Francisco. Which is cool. It stops running at 8:30 or 9:30pM That's a great constraint. Yeah. So living being said, I also need to look at the owl. House today. Kate, and we might need to just get a lease. Is all of the good ones are getting gobbled up. One of the things, one of the scenarios that might be helpful to model out is, and this might be really out there. I know. You're saying you're making the short term assumption that you're not seeking to make any personal money. From Shoguna and Takuma. I think for the purpose s of modeling. It's helpful to model out. How much money would you need to make? From new businesses. For the trade off or the offset of you, for example, getting to live in Chicago. Which you love. And not eating to have that barrier. Presidents and paying different taxes or whatever. How much would it have to be six miles away? I understand. I'm just saying that's one figure that out in there. But that's so far away from even being thought about, I don't even know if that's worth modeling. Sure. That's not even more modeling yet. Sure. Because you and Liliana. You all aren't even close to having income. So until that's already established, There's no conversation about. Understood? Okay? I'm saying that as an example of. I know. It just doesn't even feel relevant. Yet. Understood? It feels more relevant. To go. How can we make Neil's income the most efficient it can be? Great. But for progress in those two categories. So that we, having the privilege of even having that question, get great. Awesome. I'm interested in investing in both of these projects. To figure that out. Understood? Because that also informs the appetite. Right. My appetite is. Take whatever. Like I need to spend less. I don't care about my lifestyle. Only to the extent that it affords my ability to work on these two projects. Understood. Because the more I can work on these two projects, The the more lifestyle potential. Other strokes. Becomes great. Understood? Yeah. It has to be. Make the whole pie bigger thing. Because in the short term, Yes. There's basically not a lot of room. In the short term. With all of these constraints. For there to be actually, like, a significant amount of unlock. Yeah. It's working within constraints in the short term. Yeah. Anything else top of mind about this? We need extern. Al. The song bathroom. Too. Don't say. Understood. What's the plan? Do that. I would feel requests that I've sent in a few texts. Messages, threads that are open about it. My main blocker or anxiety has been trusting that whichever one I decide to come get here. Will not just be scamming and collecting money without actually doing stuff. Which is hard to design against, but at some point, there's no more information I can gain. So I just need to do it. And just. It is what it is. Because there's no perfect information. About who actually did that. Mean, you can try to get one of them. Agreed. Or contractually come back for free if the problem persists within a certain time frame. Understood? And pay cash. Understood. Don't give them any payment information. That's what I learned. They basically stole like four or five hundred dollars from. Recently scarred by the all of these home services. Every time you get someone to come here and fix something. It's like. They just take the money with the minimum amount of work. And it's like, what are you going to do about it? You want your dishwasher breaks? We fixed it. Look, it runs. And then they leap and it doesn't run. And what can you do about it? Okay? We're going to give it a spin. We need to give it my financial statement. For the purpose. Of subtracting the past. Of understanding it. Yeah. And should we get the information about Troy's funny, Jamal? See, like the important inputs. To help. It makes sense of everything. Let's try it. I think we should try it with and without. Think this is 3 Pro, right? Yes. But what I'm saying is there are times when additional context distracts it further. Or like, steers it towards fix, being fixated with aspects of the context. That isn't relevant. So what outcome do you think we want from this? That's what I'm trying to think about. I think. You said. Let's try it. I'm not sure what you mean by. Let's try it. Well, let's try it. As in. I was saying that with figuring out what that means in mind. That's the first step to trying it. Originally, I put, like, what the buckets are. But I think there's more value to be extracted out of the conversation just now. I think we can do a few things. One. We can ask AI for feedback. On how we talked about this and how we're thinking about it based on a constraints that were expressed. So it's more of. What am I not thinking about? Part of the equation. And then, as a result, I recommend a set of recommendations. Or recommend it. Almost like process. For establishing the kind of system. That you're talking about. So that's, like, at a higher level of obstruction. A lower level that's more executional. Is, then can you take all of this skyline and all of these constraints? And apply. It with the context of these exciting transition transactions. As, like a more practical granular analysis of what's going on. Through the lens of Troy's financial modeling workshop. Yeah. So I think we should try both of those. Because I think that's different value. Add. Let's write a ladder first because I think that's going to take longer. For us. Because the way it responds now is defensive. It's almost like, here's all the stuff you need to worry about. I'm like, No. Nigga. You worry about it. Ask me what you need to know to do it. That's why you're here. You're fucking AI. Yeah. Well, this prompt was explicitly that, but I tend to go to war with AI for this reason. This is usually what happens. It tells me everything I need to do, and I'm like, no. Wait a second. I thought this was AI. This is the stuff I don't want to do anymore. In your AI. So can't we have you do it? Because I'm willing to say yes or no to these things. Reframe all of this from the lens of the goal isn't just to get an output from AI, but also to get coaching as well as follow up very thoughtfully crafted follow up questions so that the AI will also just helpful in the gaps of what is not covered. Here. In a way that we can still continue to steer rather than a one off assessment. I don't think you're being aggressive. Enough. I think what you just said was mealy malk. I. I think it needs to be way more direct and candid. Well, that was really the other one. This one is actually already. This is for the prompts. Like, actually, this one is already kind of conversational. But you want to try it? Okay? If you think it's enough. I'm curious. The way you said it almost is like you felt like it was doing your favorite rather than just telling it more what to do forcefully. Okay? Let me finish reading this first. That's getting good. It's all clear to me. That the specified structure deliverable addresses the need at hand. Can you be a lot more aggressive? With your analysis. Of what the expressed need is. And what the concrete deliverable would be to reach that. Can I say something? Yes. Being silly. I'm thinking about. The job. Is to answer the question. On daily or weekly basis. Key decisions which money gets spent or committed. Can I? And should I? Those are the two layers. Of. Of the question. Yeah. Makes sense. Can I spend this? Yes or no? Technically, yes. Should I hear, given what you've already shared about what matters to you, given the circumstances, given the unknown variables. Here's helping you actually reason about the choice. Rather than just technically verify what making the choice. That's the level of thinking that can be applied to this, that none of the tools that we do so far do. No. All of them is like supplies at first, with the sense of, here's a spreadsheet, and here's how we make a dress up a spreadsheet. Versus from first principles of well, what does it feel like? The whole. It's like the ad for the financial modeling thing, where it's like a financial model is a video game for your business. It should feel like playing a video game. What are the parameters? Of the decision making. Can I? Or should I? Should I? And then should I breaks down into, well, this spending. If you did this every day, that equates to a Tesla. It's like you're providing your financial analysis. With the project instructions. And about the constructions. Are in the context of whatever your life goals. Yeah. And those life goals are morphing over time. And it's almost like there's an agent that repeatedly shapes those aspirations. Into the money goals and the monetary equivalence. And that is heavily tied and integrated with the whole personal coach thing. Because you're spending and spending goals are attached to your personal aspirations. As well. And so personal aspirations, including, like, if in your daily, for example, yesterday, your daily journal or whatever. With the coach would have been related to something. Related to, like, your dad and a Tesla and all of that? And then it could smartly parse out some of that and, like, tie that to some of your spending decisions. I could save all black people. It's been so much money that we don't have. Yeah. The other thing I was thinking about and I'm not sure what it takes to experiment with this on that. Is it? There's a black. Sab. Com sale. AI is probably available. Do it. You're such history. It's $0.01 for the first year. No one thought of that. That's crazy. That's crazy. This app is only for black people. And it's only free for black people. AI is you have to send a video explaining to me that you're black. And something only black people will say. Save the blacks AI is also available. Save all blacks. Save. The save all is also good. You said you saved double. Da. Let's try. Save the black Daddy. Act. You're terrible. The truth. I'm the answer. I'm actually right about this. Oh, you're going to give me the prompt? Oh, cool. All right. Let's see. It's like if your life coach also had access to your bank account. Not if your accountant had access to your life. Insight s. Month over month model that lets you test lifestyle and entrepreneurial scenarios side by side. With the transaction history and the transcript that is pasted within the prompt as Financial Modeling Workshop. And sound is special. Or a separate file. That's referenced. Also for this initial conversation. I want the output. Or the Deliverable to be more content based then. I want it to be operationalized in the sense of the contents of the model. In the simple early version. It's developed, but not in a sense of a technical guidance. Around Plaid integrations and et cetera. That is for a later state, and we don't want to jump straight to that. I really want this focus to be less like an arch. Like this should be less of an architect. And more of. A coach that will shape the existing conversation in the existing data into something more tangible. Analyzed. And substantial. They should be using a transcript. Lens. From first principles. The reasons why. That workshop is so good for businesses. On a more abstract level. And how that could be applied. And with that applied. To. The personal context. Given the transactions history. Also don't need the side deck. Don't need the superficial deliverables. At the Deliverable should be more focused on the substance. Of the content than form. I basically want analysis of. To simplify things, I want analysis of the transaction history. From the lens of what's expressed in the transcript, as well as. The lens of the expertise. That the financial modeling workshop lends. That's potentially multiple prompts. Give me the one right now that will squeeze the most value out of the transaction history. Mista most immediately actionable. With the goal of reaching our Version one spreadsheet within the next hour. I want you to look up another AI. What? Yeah. Sproge s c r o g AI. Those screw chat AI is available. Oh, it is. The scrooge. Scrooge isn't. Damn. Is it available? Technically, there's no website on it. Someone bought it. To make money. That's so good. That's such a good name. God damn it. You know why I wondered the name of that, yes. What? Scrooge mcduck. Me, baby. I can see it. See what? The financial help. Ecosystem. Yeah. Again. It's not about financial health. It's financial health as a. As an enabler. Of personal progress management. It's the reality check. In a personal progress management ecosystem. With all the pickups. And things around how I would have or how I would do things differently next time. I still just want to take a moment and appreciate that. That was a lot of work for two weeks. It's also not enjoyable. To work with people who don't appreciate how much work is being done. They're all like, oh, the copy. And it's like, yes. It's not hard to do. Stop worrying about that. Yeah. I don't want to help people. I'm good. But it's almost for my own sake. It was an all in all. Helpful rep lace a better sense of an end to end. Thing. You know what I mean? Got my cursor wrapped. In. What is a desired outcome? From using AI for this. Right now, are we focused on analyzing the past? Because that's the disconnect. I'm feeling with this context. Is like the transaction history is history. The financial modeling is about future. Modeling, but understanding how we got here. But there needs to be the deliverable needs to focus on one or the other. By thinking about interface. Sure. With information that would be the most helpful one for to monitor on a regular basis. Okay? So think about that. My answer is. Here's what. It's basically like a three month this month. This is what we think you're going to pull in. Income. This is what we think you're going to spend. Here's why. Next month. Three. Why? What are all of the variables happening? Travel in japan in august. In August, we know there's going to be these things. In july. You're on your sabbatical. Right. So you're going to spend more time in Chicago? In june. There's a contextualization of your financial outlook. With your life. That could be afforded out. So in my mind, the interface is that. So it's like a human conversational interface. That also has some numbers associated with it. But it's like, hey. Do we want to get this so that you're not in the red. Progress with your Japan trip. How do we load balance your expenses? So that we actually restrict or limit some of the things that you normally would do. During this time that we're going to say no to this time. Now that we designed against it. Yeah. We give it access to the schedule and the calendar. Says you're going to New York. End of june. Are you expensing all of that? Or is your budget. Do you have some fun money? You're going to see friends when you go to New York as well. Are you only going there for tech starters? It knows your calendar. It knows what's on it. And you can assume and make assumptions and ask questions to verify what your plans are. Given what's on your calendar. When new things get added to your calendar. To seem like it implies a location or an activity that could relate to expenses. It asks you questions about it proactively. Goes. Hey. Does this new money we have to budget. For now. You know what I mean? It's like a hawk. It's a hawk on your life. The schedule encounter as a proxy for future planning is good. Driver based model. This is not what you're describing. But I'm going to run it anyway. Because I think it's valuable. What I'm describing is cool. Yes. What you're talking about right now. Is essentially. What we're trying to do right now. With regards to helping you make your current life decisions based on the money impact and implications. And the product development version of Progress is starting from the interface. And then figuring. And then working backwards from there. I'm just thinking about it in the context. What would be the most helpful to actually go about making decisions? Yes. Changes. What would set me up. So that I'm actively thinking about, should I spend this money today? Should I spend this money this week? Should I make this purchase or not? What kind of information and filters need to exist. To actually assist me in making the best possible decisions when those choices come up right now. There's no fucking filter. I just do it. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want to be black PS5 Pro doing it. I'm definitely buying one, but I need something to challenge me to make adjustments and trade offs elsewhere. Because I'm doing that. Yeah. Again. I don't need to tell you this. You'll push back if this is wrong. With a model. But I guess what I'm trying to say is. Is an emote way to make progress on starting to do that. Figuring out how to do it. Like actually getting a rep of doing it. Because I think. Yeah, I know. But. But what I mean is, there's designing the system. Such that it's seamless and easy. And frictionless. And smart. For you to do in the future. Long term. And then there's literally just trying to do the job today. Yes. However, there's a new way. You have one on the challenge you to think about. Which is that in the past. What you're saying is true. Meaning I had slave away for 10 months. Teaching myself programming. Before I chanced upon the coding school model. Different now is I'm slaving away. To do this. With AI. Me with Neil's personal financial situation. There's no gap between me doing that. And then actively going, what would be better right now? What would I want to happen that doesn't exist? Currently. That I would prefer. And I can say that out loud. Too. Because I'm dealing with the frustration in my mind. Right now. Yeah. So it's actually good to think about the better way. In real time. And as you're doing the main. This is the new manual way. Yeah. What we're doing is the man giveaway. There's another version. Just like with the Hashi Project. Where it's like, no. You got the creepy Google AI video person. And you have a meeting. And they're like, all right. Where's all your stuff? And I'm like, all right. I'm making out here. A little bit of Texas. And I got these assets. And these liabilities, this loan. Okay, let's get it. Off. Let's make sure we get it all. Do we get it all? We have everything. Are you spending? Everywhere you spend money, all your money. Got a little piggyback somewhere in the house. It's like, what's the deal with all the money? Now we got all. Let's take a look. Oh, shit. All right. So you make a lot of money, but you spend it all. This is interesting. Now, let's make a plan. What do you want? It starts to talk to you about it. And then you tell it what you want. All right. Based on the life you're telling me. Is this true? This is what I understand. You want? Yes. Okay? Here's what you're going to have to do. It's just like, lays it all out in a really practical way. And it goes going forward. Available if you need me. But here's what you're going to see every day. And every week and every month to have one more to actually help keep you both accountable. And dynamic. For how you go about managing your expenses. In a. Really? Nasty. That's what we should be using. Right now. Instead of what were. You and I have to reason through ourselves with our brains. We should be signing up for that service. And all this gets done. Yeah. Well, in order, I guess what I'm saying, I agree with that. But also I feel like in order to get more specific, like, for example, We wouldn't have been able to do a hashi if we didn't have a lot of strong opinions in a first place about how to dos need to be done. I just gave you all of these details. About it. I know. But like whole K. If we're going to make a decision on one of these decisions today and give you the kind of advice. That you're looking for from the system. What we. What exact. What is the exact data pieces? That that we're looking at. To make that decision. I literally lay out all the pieces. I feel like you're instinctual response. Is to talk about what something isn't and what it's missing. And it's weird. For you to say that because I literally actually already gave you all that information. I already said it. Something a little confused on what you're asking. For. Because it's already been said, okay? What are all the pieces? I made out all the pieces. Okay? I'm confused. I'm asking you. That's not how I mentally registered it, but it's okay. What piece do you think is missing? It's all the pieces. In a conceptual sense. But, like, literally, if we were to make one of these decisions manually right now, what would it be? What are you talking about? I don't know what you're talking. Like. Ps 5. Right. Like, what are your trade offs that associate with it? What are data pieces? What's available. Is nothing available. Do we have to do to make something available? Are you willing to give up on instead? What do you want to sell? But I guess I'm speaking more deeply. Directly to uk again. I feel like every time all this stuff happens, You're always saying why not? And why something can't be and why something won't work. What? This happens every time. I'll start from what's top of mind for me. That is some part of me. Has some frustration about this because. Sometimes it feels like. I either. Have to. Not clarify things. That feels like what you're saying. Makes sense. In some ways to me. And don't make sense in other ways to me. And I need to not talk about the ways in which, how I'm thinking about it. Is different. So basically not contributing what's going on in my head. In order for the conversation to move forward. And then when I try to contribute what's in my head, The result is a feedback on how what I'm saying isn't helpful. Or isn't, from product to the conversation. And so it becomes. There's something I'm thinking of and I don't know how to put it out there. In a way that is helpful. Or perceived to be helpful. And then that becomes a source of frustration for myself. So that's one. And I don't like healing that way. And it's not a healthy way to feel. And I don't know what to do about it. And I know the part of it. Is just. I need to get better at communicating what's in my head. And I'm not the best at it. And I guess. It's interesting that the way what I'm saying comes across as what something can't be. And I'm not trying to say that it can't be that. I'm trying to say that. Like. Can we literally go through some level of instruction, go through the process of doing what you're saying once right now? Maybe we're in the age where we don't have to do it, man. We can skip the step of doing this. Ones ourselves manually altogether. But then the manual equivalent would be, can we get an AR today? Like, basically give all this context to AI and be like, hey, we want a prototype, this vision for a conversational thing that would help me make financial decisions. Based on all of these transactions and the goals that were listed here. Can you help me reason through how to? Or can you give me the tradeoffs that were associated with me buying a PS5? First. Concept. Yeah. But like the interface first being. Dealing with the real world scenario. Dealing with the feedback I'm giving you is that every time I'm in here talking to me about the possibility of something, it feels like you're dismissive. And cycling with your queries. Okay? When you respond when I'm like, what if? Or what about? Or, oh, this would be cool. It's always like a dismissive or stifling response. Okay? And I'm always just like, okay. Now I got to fight you. Understood? Why? You stopped saying words. Okay? That are thoughts of what could be possible. At a time when it's more okay to do that. Than ever. I understand. So I feel like I shouldn't be battling with you about the possibility of something. You should just imagine it. And entertain it. And then say yeah. But that's a huge scope. So maybe something more that we could fight off. That would be a reasonable starting point. Could be this. Is yes and version of a response. That you don't seem trained at all. Mentally to respond. With. I understand. It's coming from a place of. Well, I'm trying to put actual words in a prompt box and figure out what I want. To say at right now. And I don't know what to say. To get what you're saying. Register what I'm saying as an aspiration and not a literal directive. And not just happening at the back of my head. I just didn't express it, which is my fault. I'm just giving you feedback because I want to be more generative and imaginative with you. Every time I feel like I'm getting excited. About something. I feel like you're, like, pouring cold water. An excited thought. Sure. And it's less enjoyable. To share. Because then all of a sudden, every time this is going to be a bath, whether it's even peaceful to think about that, okay? Yeah. No. I love that. It being like a super. Like the hawk thing. And I love it. Especially because it's, like, completely not limited to money. Either. It's decisions. It's decisions. It's like if I do this, but there's all this. And then if I do that. There's all that. And someone's. Well, you care about these things. Know, make them happy. But you don't want to because types of things like that. That we're making one off Props. Now to ask me out. Hey. I'm having a tough decision to make. Can you help me with it? Instead. It knows your whole context. It knows how much money you have. And you don't now can actually really answer the question. It's a decision, Coach. With Theta, with money as a data piece. And understanding you. Yeah. The reality check. All that. What if the vision right now, given that Piper envision, is which isn't actually that far away? What if the way to make progress towards that today. Is to literally get that output. On the decisions that you want to make today. Well again. It's a daily thing. Yeah. So it's like, here are your money inflows and outflows today. Let's talk. Yeah. Maybe talk about it. Okay. That was really good. Do you want to talk about past week? Yeah. Let's talk about it, okay? Cool. I'm talking about past week. It's more of a. That is an assessment. That's not like. Because you won't have to do it every day. You do the assessment? And all of a sudden you do have a recurring assessment. That'll come up as new expenses emerge. But it's less involved than the first initial assessment. The first initial assessment is what gives you most of what you would need to know. Going forward to design the right system for you. In the sphere of automation. In a spirit of dreaming. And I don't know. How much I need to. Like, this is where it's like, interface first. I really need to feel it to know if this is even true. But there's a part of me that's dreaming of. A version of this. Where you're bypassing even the conversational aspect. And it's like you're seeing. You're seeing. A mirror. Of what is. You're talking out loud. On what you want it to be. And the interface kind of like response. Response to how you're talking about stuff. In the form of the actual output. Not just in a form of a response. Like a human. It's like. When you're doing a piece of writing. Instead of talking to someone and that person doing the writing for you and you going back and forth that way. It's like you're looking at a piece. Of writing. And you're just directly saying, like, it doesn't feel right. Here. And then it just morph into that. It doesn't feel right there. The morph into that. I want to also add this in morphs into that. You know how when you edit a document with canvas, At least for me. Most of the time I'm not even looking at the stuff around the edit. That the AI agent says, as if I were interacting with a human. I'm just looking at a document because that's what I care about as the output. I don't know if that is true. In the context of financials, but there's a version, for example. Of it reflecting to me. Here are your current top priorities. As reflected in your spendings. And you're like, that doesn't resonate. This doesn't like I. That's not how I want to think about it. Then it responds to that, and it's like, all right. Like here's aspiration, but here's the reality. Well, you know, here's what you think the budget should be. The way you're talking about. And here's the reality of how you're spending. But. Like, I don't know, at some point. It's to me. Some part of me thinks it's worth questioning. The default to. Well, not questioning, but, like, I don't know. I feel like there are applications where even bypassing a conversation itself and just working directly with morphing the output. And the progress. Can't be even better. I don't know. I think the conversation. Is what allows the vulnerability. To emerge. Because it's very uncomfortable. Thing. That the majority of people on Earth. Haven't. Most people aren't even willing to have. Feels like an important. Like this is the kind of thing that would make somebody cry. What would also make me cry. Is if this was a different version of myself. Like I'm talking to myself. Yeah. I actually gave Merck that advice. I told him. Why hasn't he built himself? Because he keeps asking for advice or feedback on leadership stuff. And things. It's like there's what I can tell you. And what I know you want to hear and what I know you need to hear, and it's more you talking to you. But it's like there's a version of this coach, this whole Hawk concept, it's like a wiser version of you. It's like you in heaven. Looking down on yourself. Yeah. There's also the young people. I have my old blog posts and the young birds me, and I read them and made me cry. Because I was like, wow. It feels like young me. Current be? It's interesting. It's more like. In the God analogy of AI being integrated intelligence that has a lot of humanity's expertise and experience. This is like the higher version of yourself that is one with the universe. That you're talking to. You know, like, it's your intense and your ideas and what you want. To make happen, but attached to the rest of. That body of knowledge. And experience, and you're talking to yourself. In reality, it could actually end up being feeling a little creepier than having a fake Persona that you talk to. But could be interesting. So we can just let this run for a bit. For more. Time. Then go eat that straw berry donut. Coffee. I have coffee in the coffee machine. This is a donut. You can get black coffee from Chris Droppers. I could go get black coffee for you. I could go to Anticonquista and get it for you. Let's see what this comes up with. It looks like it's almost done. Right. I don't know. How much of that is an illusion. One doesn't know it's actually done. What is the definition of done? If it's a reasoning engine that just keeps thinking. Yes. What? Yeah. Oh. Took two minutes. So the ui okay. Understand new product. 6000 transactions. What are the tags? I guess the tag field what I think it is. Yeah. No, it's nothing. It's important to note that the credit card has changed from 7444 to 8. Is that connected? I don't think so. It should be. It should have transferred. If not, then. That's important. I don't see it. Wait, no. It's using 74 4, even though it's a different card now. Some monarch registers. S 74 4. But we don't have to do here. That's good to know. Yeah. Okay? So you want your donut and coffee? No. P is fine, so we don't have to leave. I can leave. You want to leave? I don't, okay? Then don't, because I don't want to leave. I want something hot. I don't want anything. Never mind. Let me stay right here. No, I just want to do this. Okay? I want to do this forever. All right. I just want to do this on everything. We're doing the financial peace now. I got the health piece. We got fucking the Adventure Capital shit. And then there's the fucking. One of these we're going to turn into a system and monetize it. Say fuck it to all these other things that we need to make money. Because you can just turn on the money thing for one of these. So my head is taking your face because I'm thinking utility. And instead of immediate monetization. I put on nsgwc, I share it with a subgroup of target audience people. I know they're going to like it. They use it. Oh, I'm going to bring. I'm like, oh, very. Yeah. Cool. And all of a sudden. I was a thing. You know what I mean? I know what I'm doing. I have an audience. That I can help with any of these things. Because so many people have asked me how to be like me. And I'm not even like me. I know what me could be, and it's more like this. And if I make myself actually this, and then I make that version accessible to other people. And I see how they use it. And then I learned how to make it better. And I prioritize it. I'm good. Because none of those things would be that hard. Yeah. So that's what I'm kind of working on here. I'm like, I'm thinking about this. Not because I want to solve my budget problem. It's because I know if I solve it, I can solve it for anyone. Just like with coding. Like when I was learning coding. I was like, if I can teach myself this, I can teach anybody. Yes. This is new code. Progress management. Yeah. So my energy is around the spirit of solving the money. Riddle. Ultimately. Maybe there's, like, a Jewish enemy somewhere I never knew about. So okay. So this is part the hawk vision. Of. Let's for now say. I got this inspiration from Hay. Literally, the hate email is like, all right. What's the job of this email? Is this the paper trail? Is this the V? Is this like a digital newspaper that you don't give a shit about? Ultimately, but if you want, you can go peruse it. Or is this an actual email? That you want to deal with. And if sorting these two piles and we'll deal with it. Amazing. Genius level simplification of a very messy, complicated system. No AI required. Like that. I'm scared of that. I'm like, you guys. Are fucking john henry. Like when the railroads are getting. It's crazy. The categories. They're three categories. Are like me. See what? They're very elegant. The three characters. So there's a clever name for fixing variable and then one off. Yes. Talk me through the experience of. Thinking like, okay. I guess with the parallel of the hay thing. You interact with in a very different. With a different headspace and mindset. And you do that at different times. Right. How is that for fixed variable? One of. Well, think about it. Actually, I don't know about the answer. That, but I was going to say in response to the three buckets, Is that there's only one. You're actually spending time. Which is the inbox. The other two are kind of like insurance. Paper trailers. Like when you would look for something. Paper trail is when I need to understand an important email I got that is important for documentation purposes. Or some kind of transaction or something else. The feed is information that I'm interested in. But not necessarily obligated to always consume. But it would be great if there's an infinite running list of that information. And over time. It kind of gets fizzles away. It's always there. It's social media. It's like fizzles away. And then the inbox is like, no, these are actual direct communication. Because when you filter by that, you realize how few direct communications you're actually even dealing with. Relative to all the noise. I mean, there are probably still people in the world. I mean. You're up there, but there are people in the world who actually have a lot of even in Buck. No one has more like no one I know has more than. I promise that. If I solve for my situation here, everyone else's life is going to be dead simple. Okay? What's the appetite for short term progress? I think. The most important thing is actually making the budget plan. So I make decisions today. So the appetite for short term progress is canceling unnecessary expenses. Deciding on a plan for the next three months. Of financial expenses. And commitments. Those are the two requirements. The bonus nice to have is that all of that happens and we're like, yeah. We did it. We have a better understanding of Neil's financial outlook. And we're going to do it. We made a plan. And we know what he's going to do. All that's done, and we still got a little extra time. We can design an interface. A sketch. That's it. But discussion isn't even needed today. I just rather do those things and think about it. But if we get through that and we feel good about it, Then let's brainstorm. All. All right. What? Actually, could this be in the Hashi level? Brainstorm mvp. Okay? Makes sense. Because what we're doing right now is the assessment period. There's the daily going forward. Experience that I want to design for that. What I'm saying is, maybe that's actually a better task for 3 Pro. I'm just trying to get a sense of what it's good at. Yeah. We need the assessment. Done. Do we, though? Yes. Sure. Because I need to make these decisions. Right now. That's more important. Well, what I'm saying is the instance of it helping you make that decision is a prototype for what you're talking about. Because that could just happen on a daily basis. If it build a system around it. I think it's two separate things. I think one is like a reset. A financial reset. The other one is a daily, weekly, monthly habitual system. System for financial health and routines. As ongoing decisions get made and new things come up. Those are different situations. Okay? I think there's a spectrum between it. But yes. It's a bigger higher today. For AI to help us help you make the life decisions that you need to make in the next three months and have a plan for money. In the next three months. But that process. Is a system. Or that process. With a system around it. Done repeatedly with smaller hires for smaller decisions is the daily Trekken thing. Like it's still, if you break down to the first principles, It's still looking at what money you have. What? Sounds like you from the left. You. You don't just need a spreadsheet. You need a turnkey. Personal finance platform. Your mirrors is a sophistication of startup, FP and a Cleveland. Jeff. Dana Lake's forecast. Oh, my God. That sounds like you. What? You are a computer. That's how you talk? Don't act like it isn't. That's literally how you talk. You're terrible. Isn't it? Am I wrong? Maybe. Would you read that? Look at that. You need to just calm them down. What are you doing? Why are you so eager? Because the details aren't coming. Out. No details available. Without anything to summarize. I was saying. Like you need an instance of help. In thinking through. The streams and pieces. That would help you make the upcoming decisions. But that process repeated over time. In a system that's proactive. Becomes the hawk. Like you need that before every small or higher. Which is why I'm saying it's more of a spectrum. The underlying principles of looking at your transactions, looking at the job. And helping make the trade offs. Is still there. What I'm curious about is. We could design this because. Sorry, go ahead. What are you curious about as well? No, go ahead. There's all this boring financial terminology for this stuff. And we can free to fly the shit out of it. And package it. And turned it into a very intuitive, friendly, consumer friendly system of let's manage your money, honey. Because everyone thinks about money management and budgeting and. The first thing you see on a budgeting platform is, like, the whole dollar thing with the tables and rows. You know what an interesting financial model would be for pricing model for it? Because it's all money related. Pay us what we save you up to a limit. We'll save. We'll take 10% of what we save you up to $1,000. And then we're done. You know what I'm saying? Literally. That's the model. It's outcome based. It's like, pay us what we say to you. There's, like, some nuances there, right? Worse terms. Whatever. But that's an interesting outcome based way to design the system. Because then it's no fucking brain. Because you're not stuck in this lifelong long wall of commitment from us. We're committed to just saving you money. And all you pay us after that is whatever it costs us to give you the output. So it's at cost. After you pay us a grant. They're sick. O. And then what could even there's saving. In the sense of how much less you're spending. And then they're saving, in a sense, of how much more cool stuff you're able to do. As a result of that. Extra money. Click. That is also outcome. The personal equivalent of, well, how much more is your company able to make? Now. Now that you're investing in the right places. Equals your it's nuanced for thinking through the outcome based pricing piece of that. This is it. Go where the money actually is. Which give us all of the money. That you're spending and saving and earning. And we'll help you solve for it. And based on that, you give us a commission. And it's not a permanent commission. It's a temporary commission. Up to a limit. That we're okay with. We're saving the world money. We're making the world more money. And we're, like, making money. Save the axe. Praise the jews. Important. I'm learning from. That's really good. I'm good. Man. I'm scary. My thoughts are good. I got good thoughts. That's a good thought. I like your brain. That's a real good thought. Track people's money. Better. Help them save more money. Actually. It's for them. I don't care about the data. I don't want to monetize. I want to do that. It's all the good best practices. Base camp, no app. You know how app school. I need access to your photos. I'm like, fuck you. You can't max this. My photos. Limited access or no access Base camp. They got access because it's not going to look at my fucking photos. They're not going to steal them. They're not going to use it for data training. They don't do any of that shit. So if you're one of those companies in this day and age, and you make that clear and trust reliability comes your reputation. And you want to play people's money like that? Is such a killer. You will be valued. In society. Deeply. It's not. I don't think I got the. Where's the mortgage? But this is not it. We'll figure it out. I think the most. It is straight. Straight hallucinate it? I think it did, yeah. No. You didn't pay $1,000 in rent. That's interesting. I think it's more like it's information overload. We still need to figure out what it's good. At. I think what we should do. Is. Treat Chatgpt as the Hawk and get it to do for you what you want the Hawk to do for you. For this script. Let's just define what decisions need to get made. Exactly. So let's talk through that. From the top, right? Or what? The well, interrogate me with what's going on. And I'll answer your questions. Let's just start from the top of mind one. Like, what's the thing that. What's the thing that you're constantly thinking about? June 27th. Move out. To my oakland lisa. Yeah. June 27 is when your Oakland lease ends. What are your options? Well, actually, June 27th is when you're Oakland lease ends, but you need to move your stuff out before. Right. I come back from New York on the 26th. Oh, cool. Leave for New York on the 24th. Okay? So. Far. You've given the options of option one. Immediately look for a place to move into before then. So that by June 27, you're moving into a new apartment in a Bay area. Option two is you don't get a neoplace in a Bay Area. You move into storage. In your head right now. What is the case for either. I want to know how much money I can be saving right now. I want to make sure I seal all my leaky buckets. Expenses to understand what cash I even have available to make a more informed decision. I want my options. Should either be. To july. What's the purpose of this analysis? I don't have much money I'm even working with. Define working with. Given the things that I am still committed to spending money on going forward. How much more room is there available for things I haven't committed to spending money on in light of things I need to commit to spending money on and things I would like to spend money what I'd like to spend money on and there's bucket of what I need to spend money on. That's on top of what I've already committed to spending money on. And there's a bug in the stuff. And I'm sitting on it now that can choose not to spend money on going forward. So I need to basically come up with those quadrants. It's a quadrant. What I'm spending money on now that I need to consider. There's one money on now that I can start sending money on. What I want to spend money on now that I don't need to, but I want to, and what I need to spend money on going forward. Those four buckets. And spend money on how keep spending money. Up spending money now. Stop spending money on submitting money going forward. Want to spend money on spending money going forward. Need to spend money on. That's it. Those four buckets. Is where I want everything to go. The two on the top. Are not things I'm spending money on. Now. So that's the plan. The two on the bottom. Are things I'm spending money on now and I need to do something about if I want to go into the other quadrant. And the purpose of all my expenses into those four quadrants. And in order to. So in order to know how much availability there is for the things that you want to spend money on, you need to know how much it is that you actually need to spend money on. Both those that you need to, and you want to, and those that you need to, but you don't want to. There's the present. There's a forecast. It's super simple. So what it is, is I see a grid. Right. Where's the paper? No, not right. Now. Can we do, like, a drawing? This is a quick, rough sketch. Actually, you know what? It can just be tax. It could be four bullets. Sure. No. Just keep going. Okay? This and that, okay? So here would be. Mortgage. Looking. You label the four quadrants first. Need. Future need. Future 1. Current, don't. So these three are spin ned. This is saved. Or kill ed. You can call these saved. I guess. Or a vest. Invest current need add one, right? What is the way you originally worded it again? How are the four buckets? Described. Before. We got to the future. Want need type of labeling. I think I'm seeing it as more. And then each of these three have a current and future. And then the kill is I killed. It's like trying to cut it off on the timeline. And these two is, like, persistent in future. And obviously both needs can change over time. And there are needs to only apply in the future. What I want is to take all of that data from my transactions and basically pull it all in front of me. And then sort into these two categories. Yeah. Then they call an action plan to do all these things. Because the wants are current and future. There's a future want here. And there's a future need coming up. Yeah. And there's kills that are scheduled. That filter from wanting me, like, for example. A kill is the Oakland lease. Yeah. A future need is whatever new California lease. Yeah. I didn't even tell us these buckets. Save the black s. Why don't we do that? Was doing this mean right now? It means taking the transaction. History from Monarch explaining what we just talked about and say I need to categorize my expenses. Based on what need kill. What I'm going to do first is categorize the existing ones. And after we do that, And we have that laid out, then we move on to talking about the future situation. And we begin to categorize the needs and wants. So then we have a plan. That's it. Yes. Am I missing? Don't just be skeptical. If I'm elegantly simplified the life. What? I'm genius. I'm not being skeptical. I'm going to Kanye west of software development. I'm thinking. Through. How to make something real right now. Because we're closing in on three hours. I just gave birth to Golden. This is who killed Laura Palmer. Okay? How does that. So to translate this. Okay? What I'm hearing is we need to categorize the existing spend into one eating killed so that you know how much room there is for want. How would you categorize? The decision on whether to store or rent what. Like the decision that you need to make at hand, right? Is the criteria for success for today. Is both what to kill. And also. Whether to do storage versus renting place. That's what you said. You know how when you were helping me with Monarch, we were just sorting? Things. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, because the more we do that and we come up with the output to go, okay. Here's where you stand based on what you want to kill. And what you need Think you need and what you want. Here's what's left. Your income. Yeah. Why don't we literally go to Monarch and do that? Yeah. We could do that. Because the thing I'm thinking about just. So then we need to add categories for kill or not. Right. I think I would just only have those two categories. And get rid of the rest of them. Yeah. How do I do that? In a way that's reversible. It's a great question. Tags. Okay? Yeah. Tags. Is there a way to look at this that has the tag? We just need to tag things first. Right. Create the tag. S. Is there anything tagged right now? No. Let's create those tags. Delete them all. How do I make tag? I think you just called this a want. I'm saying, is there a way to do this tagging without clicking into each of it? But it's okay. Is it okay? I don't know. Also the colors matter. You can edit the tags. In the other. Try to see if there's a. We could do it. Here. Where's. Oh, here. It is. We could do it here. If you want. What do you mean? Like you do a hearing memo. What's the next step after this? No. Import data. What's the reason why we can't do. Just that. We can. But based on that, We're going to work on the interface. Interface. B. So the reason I was thinking Monarch for it instead of this is because it can smartly associate that same tag with previous transactions. You know? What the fuck is that? What is autom atic? What does? Automate Group, llc. What is that? Which one are you talking about? Row 14. Auto maintenance. What is that? How much is it? $4. Can you just. Can you please just press command option? I. Does monarch like? I mean. One. I'm not that familiar with what you're talking about. In terms of this smartly associate in the past. Two, so I don't know if that's even something that Monarch is capable of. Especially with tags. Two is. It depends on the level of granularity. You want? Because if you're trying to make it. Actually accurate in terms of want and need. I don't think there's necessarily. Really a pattern to it. At a very granular level. Because. Some meals, for example, are needs, and some meals are wants. And some are kills. So if we're trying to categorize them so over time, if you train enough of it. It's like the wants. The only need meals are what? I guess once it needs art more clear in that sense because some types of spendings are just always going to be once, but in a sense of what needs to be killed. Like there are a subset of meals that you want to kill, and I don't think that is reflected on the type of meal or the merchant. I can make it easy, though. That's easy for me. I'm easy in advance, right? In terms of overall, you killed them all. Now and then. Only start with me being, like, $300 for groceries every month. Which is why what I'm trying to say is, basically, there's a world where we look at these categories. In this already, the categories fall into one Eating co. I'm interested in how you're thinking about it. Oh, yeah, no, I know. I found no wallet. Yeah. It was on the street out here, and I never ended up sending it to the guy. Sure. Do you guys need anything? Okay? Cool. All right. Talk to you later. Shav just sent me an AI assessment request. Did you put a paywall? We're about to. Like. I think. We get a reasonable we get 80% or more. Of the accuracy and outcome. In, wants, needs and kills. From just the categories. Alone. Income is different. Income is different. So if we look at expenses, Rent is a need. Cleaning is a need. Home goods sometimes classes over into once, but mostly we can categorize rise it as jeans. Won. Is it okay? You can clean yourself. Yeah. Morris just need home goods. Mostly. Want, except when you have guests. Over. Debatable. Furniture. I think it's safe to say that you have more than enough furniture. So for the purposes of the future, It's fun. These are all needs. These are kills. As far as personal expenses go. These are all wants. DR Medicine, dentists are needs. Fitness, our needs. I mean. These are all needs to an extent. Like groceries is where sometimes it's one. Way I'm hearing you. Think about it. What I came up with. That is the system of on a daily basis. Transactions occur. That makes sense. Future ford. Yes. And as transactions occur. You're deciding one of those three buckets. Of where you think that transaction belongs. I agree and I understand. I'm saying for practical purposes. Of looking at the past. So let's look at one day. Like a month ago. In Monarch. Because what you're doing now, I think is mentally not tracking with what I talking about. Okay? Give me a circuit. Like here. Two. Mark is reviewed. Go. What'd you just do? What did you just do? There's. Okay? It's okay. Now. Same fried coffee. Is a kill. Right. Same frying coffee. Anything that isn't groceries I should kill. Start parcel pending. I think they're scamming me right now. Why Parcel Pending is scamming me. I think it's the Lydian apartment. And they fucked up something with their. What are they charging me? OpenAI is a need. What need? Technically, I want. Matter because 1. So this is just modeling out what it would look like. On a daily basis. This is what you would do. Yes. Hi, sue. Why? Because I should cook. Circle medical care need. What? Why? Because I'm paying for. Don't need to pay for. I don't have to pay for that. I'll put that in one big star kill. Automatic. I don't even know what that is. Automate. The auto maintenance. So we need to add a new tag. Investigate. There's the skip for now, Button. And maybe an investigate tag that we create so that we can actually go through the investigation. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's a good category. Actually. That's a good tag. It's like putting it in a different space. Venmo. Which one? $93. From yesterday. Is that uber? Yeah. Venmo is a reverse. Okay? That was for your parents. Yeah. Kill. And then there's your Uber from the airport. That's a co. Right. Or what? That's a war rant. Because I couldn't take the blind because I had a meaning. So he had to Uber to be on the meeting, even though I was trying to get to you guys. Understood? Alternative would have been me taking the meeting and then coming to you. On the blue line. But then I wouldn't have been late. United airlines wifi need. Google one. Need one. Google one is like the all in one subscription with Google where you get like drive storage and email storage and also now Gemini. And all of that. It's in the one. Parcel pending. Kill? No. Investigate. Motivate coffee. Cut and combo. Beanbag cafe. Being bad cafe. From Thursday. Probably one of the coffee shops you went to. It's only $9. Is it? Blue bottle. Cafe. $9. There was probably a kill. At and t need. Apple. $65. What is that? Sounds like a subscript ion. Investigate. Zella100 oh hoa. Need. Well, how much was it? 116 70. That was a one off for Evo property tax payment. Okay? But that was a need. Or do you want me to say observations out loud right now? So what I'm observing is that. Deliberate decision making. That's human intent coming from Want vs Kill. Needs. The way that I'm seeing you categorize the line between need and want. Need is literally like expenses that you cannot avoid. And so those are things that. I'm just going to throw out. To the hypothesis. I feel like things like spending categories in a typical sense of like, oh, these are groceries or whatever. Those are things that machines can categorize. What are something as fundamentally a need like fundamentally something you can avoid. Machines can probably do that. Like you probably can't avoid extra money payments. You probably can't avoid taxes. Like that's a need. But then the want versus kill is to part where the human intent can be the most focused. In a sense of. If you review your expenses and you look at this like, yeah, I want to be able to keep spending that money. I. I want to prevent spending that money in the future. And then it becomes, well, how do you kill more of the things that. Yeah. So what I'm saying is this kill is a to do list. Warrant is a conversation. What is an aspiration as well? Like, how do I make more of this possible? For? It's an interrogation. Of it as well. Why do you want this? Needs. The function of kill is basically, that's the list of like, all right, well, have we killed it? Yeah. Are we going to kill it? Have we designed against this happening in the future? Because kill isn't just not spending the money there. It says, I'm against being in a position where you end up spending that money. So it helps you think through, okay? When someone wants to invite you to eat. Here's what you need to say in response. Yeah. Or here's what you need to do in response. Yeah. It's actually in life coaching you to address that as a kill. Yeah. It's not just cutting off the expense. Tell me more about want being in conversation. Wants is a conversation because. I'm signing up for all the AI tools. How much might using all of them. I can always resubscribe the ones that I want later and I can kill some of them. So I want to spend in all these categories. But should. So it becomes a conversation about each one. Whereas kill. I've already decided I want to kill. The separate conversation about how do I design against these expenses coming up. Need is also a conversation. Because it becomes. You then have to verify why it's needed. So you need to give reasons for each of the categories. Of things. And based on those reasons, It can help you actually sort them out. Make plans to dress each. It's almost like there are needs are ones and our needs are kills. The matter of need at some point, except for very few standard things like Internet. Needs is a matter of time horizon. Like there are things that you can't kill in the short term. But if you had everything your way over the course of 20 years, you can kill. I don't know. I'm just drawing. Okay? Progress. Ive. Why? Because it's. Why is auto insurance. I want because. Are you sure? Painful right now. I think I'm paying for our motorcycle insurance. Even though I'm not even. Like, I wouldn't even have one of you. It could be kill. $100 venmo. That you paid that clean to anyone. June 10th. I've done a whole bunch of random. Investigate. Let's get for now. Acorns. Mariana. She requested a book club reimbursement. She's such a. Oh, it should have been a kill. That is so petty. Oh, my God. By the way. You owe me money. Too. Imagine. Picture how smart she thought she was when she requested that. Okay? Acorns. $10. Whisper 360 doll ars. Spot ify. No kill. All right. I don't use it anymore. Calendly. You can build your own calendar. Please. This is a want for now. More venmos. 56 78. June 9th. That is unclear. I'm sorry. What? Venmo. $57. June 9th. I'm just going to put investigate. Pretty much all Venmo's investigate. I've got to go through them. They're unclear. Built. Payment 4400. That's rent. That's ren. Amed Lydian switched to built. What needle? Need. Even though you want to kill yeah, It's a need that's going to be yeah. It's a need that's going away. That was my last one. Amazon is investigate. I mean, it's almost always a want. Definitely. Acorns. So you know what acorns. Is. This? Yeah. Basically. It's been taking $10 a month. For years. And then just invest. I don't even look at it. Cool. I pull out all of that, I'm just going to put as one. Or some of it could be kill, I don't know. Investor game. True, laurel. That was brunch. Was alison gabby? So that's a kill. Prime video. Claude 222. Gemini bottle. What is that? Wine shop. In san francisco. Oh, that's the whiskey. That's a kill. Burt asked me to buy whiskey. Costco. Technically. But let's put it into. You can't put. Put it in the kill. You can't put. I bought groceries for Mer and Uzair and myself, but it's mostly for them. And I hate them and the boys, and they're sloppy. I want nothing to do with how they operate. Just so you know. I don't want to look like that. Tell me more. They just make shitty food. They make shitty food because Mer tolerates it, because it's like they both just like boys building a business. Their boys building a business. So they just fuck around in the kitchen. And just whip shit up, and I just hate it. They cook the way they cook where they at? Yeah. It's the same thing. And I'm like, I want nothing doing any of this. This is not how it all lives. But I bought them a whole bunch of groceries. Buttercup diner. That was with Verona. That's a kill. What I was trying to say is you can't kill both groceries and eating up. I know. But I can also reduce grocery significantly. So I don't want that 660 Costco to represent what I would want to spend. Well, as in there's a. Groceries aren't just grocery spending today, which is cooking for yourself. That was an exception. It's also groceries that would be increased because other people will come over and you would still spend time with them. And cook for them. I just want to design a forward looking budget. Once we finish this of like, okay. Giving your income. And giving your foundational expenses. Here's what you're going to budget. That you can spend on top of on these things. That's what I want to do. And the budget is purely once, but then the planning is the discrepancy. That truly was. I was living in San Francisco. Is a need. Yeah. I checked to decide what my budget is for. So the budget is not pure. Sure. Well, what I mean by purely wants is, like, no kills. In the budget. Maybe. PlayStation. $97. I was tekken. Kill. Cattle. I love that is. Amazon is awesome. Zoom com. What? United Airlines flights. Want. Visit airline wifi is neat. No. I don't have to get it. Starbucks. Kale. Uber eats. Chill. Uber. Hudson news. That's the news. Airport food. Or airport. Bob. Yonder. Target. How much? Just, like $15. Target. Winston. Chill. What was that? Mina and sierra. Double clutch, bro. Kill. Samsung $3. What? Phil's coffee. Cool. Anything that's food that isn't groceries. Is a kittle, right? I'm going to kill it. All. And then see what we can add. A parking city of Evanston Parking. I don't have to park in a page park as well. Otter, AI. More target. $24 June 3. I feel like this. No, el. I don't even go to Target. Like, ever. I don't go to Target. I haven't spent money in Target. I'm on a target. Why would you? What, like $24? It's like the pot bellies. Ye ah. That's not me. I'm not spending money at Target. Investigate. Gases. Need. Cleaning is one, right? Hoa is need. $500 of Venmo. June 2nd. So Venmo is weird because they had a lot of cash in it. I was moving things around. So put investigating on it. Because I have to use Venmo to send the Chloe. I've had to send the George. This was 10 stars transactions. Safe co insurance. I'm getting scammed on that. That's a kill and investigate. Why? What is that? It might be insurance for this place. It might not have figured out. Do you know about that? Yeah. I've been paying for that for years. It's annual. Yeah. It's an annual thing. I need to investigate. That. Kill, investigate. Soho House membership. What? More PlayStation june 2nd. $35. Pay email. Why is another one. It's like a foundation. Utility. Like Internet. What's the difference between that and, say, like, OpenAI subscription? I can turn off OpenAI. Without a hitch. If I turn off Hay, it's literally like. It means I have to move the shit over in a Gmail and set up a new workflow. That's almost like a non starter at this point. It's like water and electricity. Now. Register. That's good nuance. Right. Shokuno google workspace. Neat. Energy google workspace. Turo cyber truck. Is that reimbursed? No. Irish pub of kill taisho. Taisho kill. Well, that's reimbursable. Yeah. But for now, for the purpose. S. Starbucks. State scoops homemade. Go netflix. Venmo. Skip for now. Investigate. Different. Investigate. All the united airlines. Is all the plates. Starbucks. I'll go through to a month and then I'll share. What's a travel credit you got? 300,000. Your travel credit. Then make the chase. Sapphire reserve. $80 booksy haircut. That's it. What? Is it? There you go with the haircut. Could you go? What would happen if you went without haircut? I could get a different hair cut. So that's still a need that you can minimize. The same way. Rent is a neat that is variable. I'm just going through stuff. Yeah, but talking me through. So. Venmo. Venmo. Uber eats. Kill. Raids, kill raids. Kill raids. Kill. Credit card payments. That doesn't make sense. Equal to. Apple. I miss any patreon? Motivate, copy, kill PayPal, investigate. Name com. That's probably for Takama Ya. What is the deer? Takama AI name? Domain purchase. One. Nate. Motivate coffee. Kill Riley's use co de. Amazon tips kill. Amazon Grocery. Actually, that's a need. You can kill it off first. And then I'll budget forward for groceries. What was the purpose of this kill? The purpose. Is to basically design against these transactions. In the future. And defensively field making them again. Does that make sense? Yep. Patreon. So many of these perks that are necessary. And I've never had a system that has held me to task about it. Green street. Oh, that's set up. Hello, global pod. Ium. Pancake house. Prime video. Line. Pleasant host. Kill. Copy legend diplocock again. Blooper kill. I'm almost at one. Any increase their kid. The progress. $268. That was dinner with Yuki and Chloe. From tokyo. So that's a kill. That says a work expenses. No. It's not even working. Smith, just so you know. No, we can't go after dinner or whatever I said. I'm taking you guys. Out. But we don't have the budget for it. And I said, I'm taking. That was my way of welcoming them because they're worried about money. And I was like, mel's kitchen. I mean Caesar chicken wrap. So kill $36. Yeah. Giant Coke in a Caesar chicken rat. It's $36. Serious. I hate it. Treasure island. The amount of casual $50 thrown up in bottle. And casual. $150 overhead. Cursor. F. What? It's more of a need. Affirm is neat because it's a load. Open. AI. Want uber kid. Hub. Also GitHub spending. Pay for something. For GitHub. Pay for my legacy. At a legacy gamble. That I pay for. I'm not going to pray for that. I'm going to pay that forever. I should just take it and move it over to the industry at vc. Okay? I'm at a month. So here's what. Now, if we download the data set again. Here's what came up in my head. So. After this, we need coffee. Africa. Exactly. So black is want, green is need, and red is killed. I was thinking reverse for need and want, because you want more of green. And some of the needs you want, like, for example. Black is kind of static, but if you want to make more space for green, You can try to reduce it, but that's usually more long term. So black is need. Black is need. Green is like you want more of it. Red is like, eventually this just goes to zero. So that's what came to mind. Okay? Cool. And I didn't even realize it looks like Africa until. Going back to Africa. Well, this is what. It could be a pie, it could be a whatever. But it's a straightforward representation of. And then each time you review an expense is like, was this a neater or what? And then if it's a. Or was this a kill or do I want to keep spending this? Like what? Future me spend the same money? Will future me have spent the same money? What future me be proud of me spending the same money? Like that be a decision between the red and the green. And sometimes the black, but because it's relatively static. It should basically be systematically known that those things are need and you don't even need to tell it that those are need at some point. But the main decision making is about tracking the proportion between the green and the red and proactively eradicating the red to make more of them for the green. So let's make this useful now. Yeah. So we can get basically the version of this for right now. Like what is from the past month. What is this proportion? Not counting to investigate, of course. Correct. Well, I mean, we could default categorizing investigate into want. And then decide otherwise later. Yeah. I wonder if you could just. I think all three can do this even. But let's try it. What sister? Right. Thread. Now. Let me check that it doesn't. Taking just the last month. Of expenses. On this export. Where we've tagged Kill want versus need defaulting investigate to want. And taking out all the blank ones. And all the ones that are positive. Because this is just about expense. So the ones where the transaction value is positive, take it out. Produce an analysis in summary of the proportion. Of spending. The last month. Between things that were once things that were kills versus things that were actually needs. And then also offer up insightful report. That identifies patterns. In the types of things that are kills. With the addition of the transcript context that I'm about to provide below. That shows the reasoning around what we categorize as wants and needs and kills. The output should be an action plan for how to actually kill what we labeled as kill moving forward. For a clean slate. How to. Make more room for the once. And also. Add more. Nuance in our original understanding of wants versus niece versus kills. That are grounded. On what's actually happening in the transactions. I have a feeling. That this should actually be a new chat. Because then I'm going to attach the transcrib again. That has to full context. We'll do this. And then we'll worry about the visualization. That's the most trivial. That's the most trivial part. Anything else you want to add to this? The Valen mortgage. Is the mortgage included for Chicago? I think so. I don't know if we categorize it or if you saw it. You should tell me. Neat. Let's just give it a rol. L. All right. But then we could actually also do a more simple version of this. That's just looking at Monarch reports. Oh, cool. They make the Sankey better. Apparently. Holy shit. I mean. This is off because there's a lot of personal treats, Ashley Pecksnars. But this is how much you're relying on reimbursements. This gap. Between the left and right. It's almost double. Right at the end of that. Yeah. They're not the wrong. Bait. They don't do it by attack report. That's annoying. I mean. I understand. Choose the kill type. I know. $7,000. It's pretty good. Yeah. And these are just one hundreds adding up. The Irish bot overheard about it. It's like 1000 dol lars. Call it 2000. There's still 5000 saved. Yeah. It stays mostly. All the coffees. And the Ubers and the big meals. How many of these are actually going to be reimbursable? None. So $7,000 in the last month. Why is it cheaking and die? That's funny. Okay? That's $7,000. Versus. $90000 of needs versus. $3,578. This was my issue. Yeah, here we go. It's like we can get rid of 8k expenses. We have to spend 9k for sure. And we have 3,500 playlists. And here's what I'm going to do. This. Is what the thing currently looks like. Roughly an approximation. And I feel like most people have something looks like. And over time. How do you get to something more like. That. Or even. Less. Or maybe with a little bit of, like, lower in need. But that's not the goal. You're not counting on reducing the black. The blacks are needed. What could also be savings. One could also be investments. One could also. It's not need, but I'm choosing to actively spend my money or put my money in a certain place. Well, all wants are in some way, shape or form. What do you mean? Their actions. Their actions I'm taking with the money. Yes. And they're also all investments. Well, my way or the other. Yeah, true. Sure. Yeah. You probably decided, yeah. There's a reason you want the want. There's a certain outcome that it gives you in life. Either personal enjoyment or relationships. Or you're totally right. You're totally right. I like that. So these are if your life were a business. These are fixed costs. These are variable costs that have, at least theoretically, on a financial model. Has positive aura. And efficiencies. Red is an efficiency. So you want to get rid of. But you need the dynamic nuance of your situation. To get assistance on how to manage these, especially the red. And you need help in thinking through what matters to you in life in order for you to even have the mental capacity to decide. This is a point. Do I want to spend this moving forward? In most of the existing budgeting, or all of it. Is focused on categorization. And tracking. And not the deliberate decision making around what is A one, because the nuance is extremely personal. And deciding what's what is almost the whole point. So then the swiping left and right is not that I review this expense. That means nothing to nobody. Right. That's what it is on Monarch is I review this expense. Save for later. What does that mean to anybody? Nothing. It's. Do I want to keep spending like this? It's almost like your future self, Tinder, swiping on your present self. Well, you're familiar with the game. Right. Which one? Buckner kill? Yeah. That's what this is. Yeah. You're marrying. These. You're fucking these. You're killing me. Yeah. It works. And then maybe, like, need goes down. And then. That's right. And then it's coaching you to deal with it. To deal with it. Yeah. Says shit. All you're doing is fucking. This will work. I'm serious. And then there's, like, all sorts of fun onboarding. Too. Because, like, pulling out, like, 10 of your expenses that stand out the most. Yes. Like the ones that matter. Yes. The ones that keep coming up, like, tell me about these. Tell me about these. Exactly. Jobs. We can do it. Yeah. What's the story behind us finding. Do you want to like, would your future self be proud that you spent this money? Do you want to keep spending this money? Why? Tell me more. What does that tell me for a life goal? What matters to you right now and then what you can do. Is just like with base camp. You can bubble up stuff. It's like I'm stressed out. I don't want to talk about it. Let's talk about next. Yeah, okay. Bye. Since we're going to classify this as a need for now. Yeah. We're going to revisit this next month. Yeah. And then the once is like not only if it's a want. Like I want. As in you want more of this? You want. Like this is an investment. Then you can't just say it's a want. You have to name what it gives you. If it's personal, Joy. And enjoyment. Okay? Then now you have a summary of what are the things that are actually important to you. That's for personal enjoyment. How much money is like putting a dollar amount on your personal enjoyment. And how much that is versus career growth or versus relationships. Like, how much money are you spending on each of those jobs? Those underlying purposes. And then the kill is. The kill is just like. Well, if you don't want this, First of all, why don't you want this? Are you sure? Sometimes people are unrealistic about things. Being, oh, I shouldn't spend money on that. But actually, there's a reason why they keep spending money on that. So there's nuance there, too. But it's more like. Well, it's more action oriented, as in. It's almost a little bit biased, where there could be the same amount of interrogation and kill, but it's almost more effective. Overall. To focus on if you say you want to kill it. Let's work on killing it. And then if you can't kill it. And you keep saying you want to kill something, but it keeps coming back. And then we reinvestigate why that thing is killed. And you can even give your budget a health score. Well, the health score is almost by definition. The percentage of money you're spending on things that, well, percentage of kills. Is the negative health story. But now I have my kill list, which is one of the things I was hoping to get out of this. At least for this month. There's more kill list that's longer. Yeah. Already just from doing it. For one month and worth of data. We know a lot of it. Is eating out. Especially big ticket. Like, not even like the $5 personal coffees, even though those add up across a whole year. Sure. But the bigger tickets is like the $500 dinner, the $700. Whatever. This will be a crazy ass problem. Like the channel. We keep liking. On YouTube. He was saying that O3 Pro is like all by context. Like people are seeing it overthinks if you don't give it enough context. Let's see. Let's see it. Show it to me. Like, so far, I feel like it has been marginally more insightful than three, but not in a way that's worth the additional time and compute. So there's like, probably a threshold to pass widgets. Okay? Fuck mary. Kill of money. That is the inbox. Paper trail. And feed money. I know. But the conversational AI piece is the area that wasn't possible. Before, but now we're sitting here like, oh, but there's a version of this, even without conversational AI. Would sure make a huge difference. The same way. Hey. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Let's get it right. You and me having that conversation just now. Illuminated the categorization. In a way. That wouldn't be normally possible. Because on your own. You don't have the pushback. It's interesting. Obviously. It's not clear. It's not a question we should answer now with regards to whether the conversational AI should feel like a Persona of, like a unified Persona that you're talking to. Versus a version of yourself. Versus a Persona that you can shape. I don't know. But where are you going? There's a saying. Don't tell me your values. Show me your budget. And I'll tell you your value. So that was something that can be said about, like, a city bucket. Or care about these things. Where you're spending money. Like, what do you actually care about? It's a personal thing as well. Right. You can say as much as you want. Or you actually spending your resources. And given where you're spending your resources, That reflects what you care about, what you value. It's almost like you can have an AI that is trained on how you talked in the past about what matters to you. And that version of you is talking to yourself. And when I was thinking about the personal journaling thing, the prototype that I have half working is starting from a standpoint of everything that's going first person. It's like, I want this. It's. It's like a self reflective kind of thing. That might be. Creep some people out. But that's who you are. And this is who you want to be. Yeah. Right. And then we'll take who you want to be and let them talk to who you are. To get you there. Or use your own reasoning to tell you why that's a kill. Exactly. So that's the power. That's the opportunity. It's like that conversation is almost like. It's almost like there's a master prompt behind the scenes. That merges the consciousness of who you were. Or who you think you were or who you, through the words of your past self, describing who you want to become. Merged with other people that you admire. So it's almost like a past version of Kate. Who said this thing matters to her? Merged with the wisdom. Of beyonce. And whoever else. Here's the onboarding, right? You go to nsg, you find this whatever tool. Whatever. I've made this budget tool for myself. This is kind of how it laid out. Try it out yourself. Take 30 months. 30 days. The past 30 days. Grab your transactions. From. And we only take the past 30 days. We're not asking for an integration yet. Past 30 days. Just to give us the past 30 days of transactions for you. It could be your trading account, your credit card, or both, something like that. Here's the data format. Whatever. Here's a template. Uploaded here. Blah, blah. And then through that, it takes you through. What you want to keep spending the money on. And based on what you want to keep spending money on. Is it a want or is it a need? Well, you don't want to spend money on, say, kill. And based on that, Do you want to start with a business version of that? Tell me more. I think there's a version of this that's very business. The same simplicity. It's almost like I want to start with a business. I want to start with my personal because it matters to you. But what you're saying is true on that end as well. Workshop. No. That's how Jason runs base camp, just so you know. He doesn't know how to financial model. He thinks like this. It's like the green stuff. Is the stuff that you actively change and invest in and change on the financial model. Those things are piped into your financial model. Those are variables that are tied to KPI. You'll see your constants. Yeah. In a personal context. The KPIs or liberal more nuanced because not everything has a dollar amount that comes out. But in a business context, there's a very direct positive outcome that's supposed to be associated with each of the grades, but there's a health profit. There's a financial health profit. Like you said, it's not financial. In that it's not like a profit. But there's a personal health profit. Personal, financial, health, profit. Yeah. But the reason why I said business and why instinctively my mind jumped to there's a world where we start with business is because with business, the ROI part is a lot more direct. It's almost simpler. In a business context because it's a lot more black and white. It's more. I know. But you know what I mean. It's a lot more. Also, people have a lot less personal attachment to business. Write it out. Based on the three categorizations you just did. No, I'm saying from the Monarch output. You said it was 9k or 9k of. Well, 8 something. Yeah. 9K, actually. 9k of need, 7k of Q and 3.5k of 1. Right. So it's, like, based on these three things. Let's make it conversational. Right. Here's the plan for you to reduce your 7k down to 2k. Here's your plan to maintain your wants. And plan for them budget wise for this next month. And then for your needs. There needs to be some sort of ledger, some sort of visual compendium of your situation. Now and then what your situation could be. And what your savings could start to look like. Plans. The one is inaccurate because they counted the blanks that weren't supposed to be counted. But the need and the kill was accurate. And the reason why there's discrepancy is because I think I went a little bit further than 30 days. And I'm monarch. It's 30 days. But this is roughly it. So here are the kill categories. It's interesting. Oh, you can set a weekly cap and add. Maybe you made that up. Yeah. Take Uber would want to do that. No. 65k a year. Reallocating the freed cash to high leverage once AI Tooling met was finally mentioned. Like that. Cool. Seed want? Yes. It's like a. This is great. Prototype. It's our third co founder right now. We're cooking. Can we set this up? One. We set up the manual version of this system. And then two, we do an interface. Yeah. The Seed wants in graduating them. To need won't kill is great. The reason I'm saying this is again. Making it a thing. Makes it real. And then it motivates me to want to behave that way to make it work. Which is how people work. When you have a system and an interface that you're accountable to. All of a sudden your behavior changes to in service to it. Do you follow? Yeah. So that's why it's important to me to make it. That's why I wanted to do my metrics dashboard. Yeah. Which is also related to this. But this is better than the metrics dashboard. Because it's real metrics. And this is the underlying aspect of the intended behavior. It's like I intend to eat less food. Were you spending your money? Like this is not about money management as much as it's about following the money as a switch behavior. It's like demand side. The same way we tell founders to interview people who spent money. What are you spending money on? What are your jobs you're hiring for? Is there a job behind what your. Is that a job that you want to invest in that matters to you? There's a by the way. There's a more monthly thing That's a JDBD investigation into your kill list. And why you purchase those things. Yeah, but it becomes a separate in the app. You go to the place where it's like, This is so bad. The name of the Link is the Executioner. The fucking guillotine. Comes up there. It's got like. Put the head in. And it's got the little thing up there. And you got the person's going to do it. And it's like one of those things you want to kill. But there's a time and place for that. Go do this. And it gets closer and closer. Job, you killed it. There's a whole thing you can experience. The whole idea. In optimum AI is anthropomorphize more of the experience. So if you make it more like interactive, playful fun, but at the same time, it's related to a tangible thing you're going to do. Cooking. Gamify me, making my financial health better. Yeah. It's a life coach with access to your money. Not the other way around. And you talk about the personal KPIs. And it's not Scope Creep for an app like this. To also have access to your weight and your calories. Exactly. Because it's the same system. Same system. So the version that we need to prototype as an mvp, though, is the one that we can share with other people. Just like we did with Hashi, right? So Akashi's like, oh, interesting. Good conversation. Here's all this to do. This is like, okay. I play with my transactions. Every day. Because that money gets spent every day by me. Right. So now I got a sorting system. In a way that's real smart. And then when you get to the business version, It's like the business is tied to your personal. Ly for early stage founders. So what we're going to do today. In the spirit of this is, we're going to sign up. We're going to set up Takama domain. And we're going to add the Haiti. So that you can start seeing what I see. And if you want, we could set up. Kate's gmail. To forward to hag if you want. And then you can see the personal side of it. As well. Just slightly different. Can we make the progress that you were looking for first? Yes. P and then we want this rare, we donut. Help me make the progress. Go to. Part where I actually have to do real things. I know. I can tell. This is insane. Bryce? Yeah. Go to. Talk. So it looks all pretty, right? Yeah. This is disabled. At all. It don't look like this at all. It's just these two buildings. This is a rendering of what they want it to be. You understand? Like none of this is here. The future. This is all, like, desolate. This is hilarious. It's just these two buildings. And then a few over here. There's, like, a juvenile detention center right here. If you go over here. It looks real. It's real ominous. It's, like, government property and, like, a storage lot in this really shitty grocery store. It's weird. It's weird. It feels like you're in a place where something could happen to you. It's a strange none of this is what you see. They're literally lying. They're selling the future. That's very san francisco. Yeah. It's a literal lie. But let's look at what the actual partners look like again. This? No, none of the four point stuff is what you want to look at. Yeah. Pretty much it. Took a smaller Lydian. Yep. Understood? This is insane. This for $3,000. I should probably look in the city. We tried. So let's make money. That's the natural answ. Er. Now. Hawkins actually has a ring I like. So if you want to go there, Broker, I'll show you. Look up unit 212. It's one bedroom. One bath, one din. 12, right? That's probably. This. Is there a den? Doesn't look right. There's a den. This ain't it, though. Maybe that's it. Try that. No. Interesting. I think this is probably the closest because it's 12. Where's the den? Here? Yeah. No, that's not it. Yeah. I know this. Let me tell you what it is. When you go in. There's a big living room. Into the right is the bedroom. And if you keep going. There's a dent here. That's cool. It's actually cool. There's no view. No view. What if you just kept living in Oakland? Are the prices a little better? Would that help? Vehicles? And vehicles. Is it like? Was it? A one time occurrence. Did you see that? Given a private parking lot. Like if you have a private residence parking lot in a different. I would rather do Treasure Island. Be honest. I'm just speaking in terms of price. I feel like a one bedroom. And Lydia would have been less money. This one. Yeah. So flip this. But that's 4,000. So you get three. I think you get three months free. There's a 15 month lease. Out of pay. Yes. So that will put your need to still around 8,000. Yeah. Which, like, it can be fine, but this is it. Yeah. You could divvy it up so that it's not. Like you're counting on average. Let's say, like. But it's only 15% occupied. Submert and Uzair were like, basically, like, if you wanted this unit, You could probably negotiate pretty aggressively. It's. I think I could negotiate a three months free. I could negotiate a 12 month for three month with three months free. Sure. So let's assume that then it would be 3,000amonth. Which I would do. Think we can spread money against any. Given what we saw last time. There's a reason why we saw Treasure island and no. Because this is elongated. The living room is extended. It's way more spacious. Than I thought. This room here. And this right here is the office. So just so we still have the clear. Thought. Around the trade offs. First of all. Would it make a difference? In cost negotiation. If you move in now versus move in in August. That's what I'm trying to figure out. Let me know what you think of this email. Yeah. This only trade off is like the only. Decision here. Like controversial part is what are to include the August 1st thing. Because obviously, That might swing the pop. Yeah. Everything. Does absolutely necessary. Like if the read of the situation is that. Their need for. An offer to move in early. Yeah. That gives them an attentive and it helps me. Because if it's a 12 month lease, that means I'm out of the center. That's true. Both standards. Feeds me and them. Because they might still want arms first. That's okay. But there's only a 50% occupancy. They've only been open for two months. And they're unlikely to fill that one sooner. Yeah. So I would actually help them make more money. If I got rid of my lease earlier. So they can get more for the next lease. Cool. So if you count the investigators once. It's actually more. This is accurate. Good. This is good. So this is the kill list. Is meals, ride share, Amazon orders. Easy. I can kill all this right now. I need to Strawberry donut. Which is in a kill pile. Oh, you still like me. Yes. Okay? There's some acting, right. But you know my motivation. Okay? Is, like, app related. Yeah. I know because I saw the change in my behavior. With email. Once I started using hay and I did that thing. It actually changed me, literally. Like a few weeks ago. Like the way I interact with email is different now. I'm subscribing from shit. There's another service called Don't Bother Me. Or something like that. That I signed up for. And unsubscribe from, like, 40 things. Which was great. And I'm shocked at how few emails I get. Across all my accounts. It's quiet. Immanageable. I think with transactions, if I had a similar dynamic. We're like, on a daily basis. I'm sorting my expenses. But into those three categories. And proactively taking care. What do you do? Yeah. Does monarch have an API? Do you mean? These tools that are already pulling my data from Plaid have an API. Or. Not. What do I see? On plaid. That's all official. Same with Fox. But it exists. I mean, I went over complicated. I mean, it shouldn't be that hard to work with plaid. It's an API. How hard could it be? Okay? So I have to make a little decision. Before I get into that. You helping me make this better decisions. So one is the apartment. So I have to look at a backup apartment. So it's fine. Backup. Another apartment building. What? Why are you looking at me? Look, I'm like a sandwich. Because you are. Sandwich. You're egging. Pepper sandwich from Frateros, which is delicious. I want more. Tank to go have that tab. You're my italian. You can't eat it anymore. This is the last of times beef I ever get to eat. Because my budget says I have to kill it. And then you get to eat all the pork belly in the fridge. There's a Chinese pot roast. That has a bit of star knees in it. I will warn you, but not that much. And there's a pork belly with preserved vegetables. Mashed Chinese yams. And then there's. And then there's papaya dessert. Why am I stupid? Because you're not. Because you're my favorite person on Earth. So can we find a backup apartment? Please. My brain is scared. Of that. Why? Because it was terrible. Last time. No. This might all be apartment building. I'm also willing to look at portrayal of Hell to be up by Maggie. That seems really nice. That'd be good for mental health. I think I was on my personal time. Start over. Let me look at something. This was fun. Okay? Let's look at. Jesus. E 204 poly shit. Let's look at the floor plan. Which floor plan is it? Someone black and see. It's one by one. C. Jesus. Christ. I mean, this was a not cheap one. This is a quote unquote luxury. There's a reason why we ended up looking at that. But here, right? Betrayal, dog patch. Mission Bay is here. Basically. Everything. Here. What's this? 3,000. 3,500. See this one? What the fuck? This got to cost 5,000. What is this website? Verde. Like that literally just exists to bypass filters. No floor. 406. Look at these shelves first. See what's a bit 301. What? 's everyone? Is it? Yeah. Oh, shit. Oh, God. Oh, God. This is crazy. That's crazy. Which is why. I said maybe not now. You're right. Not now. But we need to look at the financial model. Of how much money you're saving. You can't necessarily compare how much money you have to make in order for the trade off to be worthwhile. Against you right now. When the financial trade off is also that you need to commit to this kind of rent. And all the other taxes and complications associated with hex Nurse. Can we look at non apartment buildings? This is like the average living situation. In san francisco. What's that one? The 3200. No. Kind of old ass building that you hate. That's 374 square feet. Oh, God. What if I commute? D. From. South. Yeah. Goofy lights. Like you might not be. Which is why I throw those crazy ideas. Day in Oakland. Because if you put in the same amount of money. In auckland or since in san francisco. The trade off of the annoying stuff about Oakland might actually be worth it compared to the trade off in space. Where? Because last time we weren't looking at, like, one bedrooms, right? So do 600 square feet. And then okay with apartments. Right. Like in Oakland, it might actually be better. You can zoom out some more. Too. So good. 3d. Very japanese. Have a little bit space here. Another space here. And it's a studio. Yeah. Not ideal. It is under $2,000. You would just spend a lot less time there. I mean this. Much is that? Like 2,400. Like, do you hate Oakland? Yes, you do. Do you hate Oakland? More than an old tiny space. No. It just has a bedroom. I need a place to work. You're going to dress it in. Let's see this. 13 month 2,600. George montoya. That's the one I thought I saw. Yeah. This is the den? Yeah. There's a bedroom. In a den. This is the. Yep, that's what I need. That's what I need. Doing? Move in cost. But, I mean. When you want. Let's treat it as 20 cents. Okay? Let's see it. It is under 3k. It's this or treasure. R. How much is treasure island? Again. It would be. The monthly payment would be 30. Right. But you have the month three. Calculating all of that. All in. It would probably be around 3400. Okay? June 27. You get back on this? I think you get back Tuesday. Actually. Okay? Well, then. Sure. You got to schedule the tour tomorrow. What's that? Scheduled a tour by tomorrow. I'm just saying. So that was one option. Let's look at others. He looked at Caspian. Right. This isn't crazy. Bad either. I mean, this is actually kind of good. Oh, it's a brand new property. Yeah. That's why they have the three month, the free thing. Have a lot of availabilities. No den. They might have densed. Some of them don't list it. There's no, there's not. This one. Technically. Robot class ics. Are 10. Se? All in all is all terrible. Though. Living room is basically. You just wouldn't have a living room. Well, let's look up all of the newest city buildings. Across San Francisco and Oakland and whatever is. New. Thank you for helping. This sucks. Let's do that. Let's try. It. You want to dictate. No. This makes me die. Which is why you need a straw. Berry donut. You don't want me makes me live. We need a whiteboard. In there. But I was thinking about turning. The handles to the closet. Putting a layer of acrylic over it. And. And making a whiteboard. You just get. Take the course off? No, but want the whiteboard. But I like having a closet. There's construction material that I put in there. I'm looking for. A one bedroom. Apartment. In san francisco. Or oakland. Or anywhere. Commutable to san francisco. So even if it's a little bit further south in the Bay Area, That with the requirement of it having a separate space for desk and work. Basically an office. It's within separate space within the apartment. For working. In a lot of places. This is the den. So one bed, one bath and a little den. And for cost as well. As condition reasons. Want to look at all the new apartment buildings that are opening up in the area. You please help. Compile first of all all of the new properties across the area, and then also highlight and analyze and compare the types of features that actually matter to me. With a direct cost in space and just a comparison of all the things that matter. Whether they have a den and also gives just like quick views into, for example, if they have any virtual tours. To get a better sense of what an apartment looks like. What do they have deals? For new move ins, for example. That a lot of them have three months. Free. Be proactive about additional trade offs. And concerns it might be in consideration, such as commute time. And neighborhood. Understanding that work. That a lot of commute towards downtown San Francisco will be needed. I think I messed up. I'm just going to redo it. Features are important to me include there being a dedicated space that could be separated and dedicated towards work and desk within the apartment itself. And a lot of places. This is the den preference for. I've been stupid. All right. Perplexity labs. Is going to show itself. In nine minutes. Do you want to go eat your donut? What's happening? Perplexity labs. Is working on this. Come on. Seven minutes. Oh, look. I mean. I don't know. What's actually going to do yet. Come on. It's my first time using labs. What do. Technically. The black part, like the fixed part. Yes. It does. If you're total pie increases, the black part does increase, especially with things like if you count taxes. And also you're more likely to have a bigger apartment and stuff like that. But over time, The green should take up a bigger portion. As your stack grows. That's what I like about this. I want a whiteboard. That's what's on my mind. What is fun stuff? Everything you don't even want when I'm sleep. Ing. It's after work. Work day is over. We actually hang out. Is the answer no. All right. I'll stop. Like I know that Carlo is unlikely to do that. But you know how you suggested that Carlo could probably replicate what the agency built for him? For example. I don't think this is going to happen. But there's a parallel universe. Where? Attack with my project. Is a rebuild of Xor d, but it's rebuilt. Fundamentally either rebuilt or a fork of the existing code. But the project is a fundamental reconsideration of. The design and architecture of the whole thing from the ground up, with him in the driver's seat. That's like 80% there. And the last mile is like he gets in the driver's seat and start making direct edits. So it's like an ongoing. Scaffolding from the over the course of. Let's say a project is two weeks. It's a spectrum. Moving increasingly from wearing a driver's seat to them in a driver's seat. With, like, one thing being had over at a time. And then along the way, we're also testing internal tools and software. Because we could provide tools. Provide access to tools. Which is basically R and D for us. Which a lot of the challenge in is actually not necessarily the skill and implementation, but the skill in asking the right questions for AI to help. The message that Chef sent to me today. That's a question that eventually something that we build can just take and help break down. Right. Like, he basically told me that EPC has a working app that, like, their existing app, the chef portal thing. The fancy business card. That are currently hard coded that they would like to be able to manipulate but have zero idea how and don't know how to figure out. But that's something that AI should be able to help with. But if you don't know how to ask the right questions today, you're going to feel very lost. That's about right. There's a version of this book that is native to the empowerment era. There's a version of you right now. That calls in bed for a few minutes. Whatever you say, dear. Yes.
