## Movement 1 - Needs (15 seconds)
"$413 on the essentials - Verizon, Booksy haircut, domain renewals. Basics covered."

---

## Movement 2 - Wants (The Real Conversation - 5 minutes)

**KANE:** "You booked $1,294 in United flights this week - two identical $647 charges. Plus you've got Apple subscriptions, Acorns investments, Patreon support. That's $1,414 total on future-building. Tell me what June looks like for you."

**[Your insight: Setting up travel for Techstars obligations, maintaining the tools and investments that compound]**

**KANE:** "I notice Superhuman for $30 - marked as a kill. When did email efficiency become unnecessary?"

**[Your recognition: Another optimization tool I'm not actually using, just collecting]**

**KANE:** "The contrast is interesting - you're investing in Acorns and Robinhood Gold, but then marking Superhuman as waste. What's the difference?"

**[Your moment: Passive investing works, active tools I don't use don't]**

## Movement 3 - Kills (The Coaching - 5 minutes)

**KANE:** "Neal, the coffee situation - $183 across 8 visits: Blue Bottle three times ($77), Motivat Coffee three times ($55), plus Starbucks and Timeless. That's not about caffeine. What's the real job these coffee shops are doing?"

**[Your recognition: Escaping the apartment, buying the feeling of productivity without actually working]**

**KANE:** "The Uber Eats on May 27th - four separate orders totaling $241. Walk me through that Monday."

**[Your admission: Spiraling, ordering food instead of dealing with what needed dealing with]**

**KANE:** "Amazon Grocery for $204 marked as kill, but you still ordered Uber Eats the next day. The groceries are rotting while you order delivery?"

**[Your insight: Buying the fantasy of cooking at home, then avoiding the reality of it]**

**KANE:** "Se√±or Sisig - two separate charges, $93 total, both marked kill. What happened there?"

**[Your recognition: Overspent trying to treat people who didn't need treating]**

## The Insight Moment

**KANE:** "Here's what I'm seeing: You're spending $183 on coffee shops not for caffeine but for the *feeling* of working. Another $241 on Uber Eats to avoid cooking the $204 of groceries you already bought. That's $628 spent on avoiding your actual life."

**KANE:** "Your money is revealing something critical: You marked 52% of your spending as 'kills' this week. That's not waste - that's a cry for help. You're buying escapes, not experiences."

**KANE:** "Look at this pattern: $1,294 on flights (building the future) vs $628 on avoidance (escaping the present). You know exactly where you want to go, but you're using coffee shops and food delivery as expensive procrastination."

## The Living Dashboard

**Becoming:**
- Strategic traveler ($1,294 on United flights)
- System builder ($114 on Apple, Acorns, Patreon)  
- Still searching (52% marked as kills)

**Killing:**
- Coffee shop procrastination ($183)
- Food delivery spiral ($241) 
- Grocery waste ($204)
- Social overspending ($93)
- Dead subscriptions ($30 Superhuman)

**This Week's Reality:**
$413 needs | $1,414 strategic wants | $751 kills
**Kill ratio: 52% of non-essential spending**

**Kill Patterns:**
- **Productivity theater:** $183 (8 coffee shop visits)
- **Cooking avoidance:** $445 (groceries + delivery)
- **Tool collecting:** $30 (Superhuman unused)

**The Core Question:**
"You're flying to your future while coffee-shopping through your present. What would happen if you worked from home for one week straight - no coffee shops, no 'productivity spaces,' just you and the actual work?"

## Why This Works

This conversation:
- **Names the real pattern** (buying the feeling of productivity instead of being productive)
- **Connects spending to struggle** (coffee shops as escape, not fuel)
- **Offers a clear experiment** (work from home for one week)
- **Uses his own tagging** (52% kills = he already knows)

Neal walks away seeing that his "kills" aren't random - they're a consistent pattern of avoiding the deep work he claims to want.

The epicenter: **Money reveals you're addicted to the aesthetic of work, not the work itself.**
