## The KANE Interview

### The Mirror Preview
"Here's your week, Kate: **$1,001 across 28 transactions**

I see three major investment areas emerging..."

### Movement 1 - Needs (10 seconds)
"$12 on bank fees, $5.51 at Mariano's for groceries. Your essentials were light this week."

### Movement 2 - Wants (The Real Conversation - 5 minutes)

**KANE:** "You invested heavily in your craft this week - $438 on development tools and learning. That's almost half your spending. Tell me about that."

**[Space for your response]**

**KANE:** "I'm noticing something interesting. Claude.ai was $222 - that's your single biggest purchase. At the same time, you bought Codecademy, Windsurf, ElevenLabs, Midjourney. What's driving this learning sprint?"

**[Your insight about preparing for something, building something, or leveling up]**

**KANE:** "The Amazon purchases tell a different story - $299 across multiple orders. Some big ($98, $69), some small ($6-9). What were you building or setting up?"

**[Your recognition of apartment setup, workspace improvement, etc.]**

### Movement 3 - Kills (The Coaching - 5 minutes)

**KANE:** "I noticed some patterns that might be worth examining. Uber Eats on Tuesday for $31, but you also went to Paris Baguette for $82 that same day. What was happening Tuesday?"

**[Your realization about stress, convenience, or social situation]**

**KANE:** "The Klarna payments ($50, $39) and Target ($53) feel different from your intentional tool investments. Tell me about those."

**[Your recognition of impulse vs. intention]**

### The Insight

**KANE:** "Here's what I'm seeing: You're investing seriously in becoming something - the tools, the learning, the infrastructure purchases. But there are stress purchases mixed in that don't serve that vision. Does that feel accurate?"

**[Your moment of recognition]**

**KANE:** "For next week: What's one thing you could do when you feel that Uber Eats impulse that would serve the person you're building toward instead?"
