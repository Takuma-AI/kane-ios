## What This Reveals About Data Quality

The purchase_contexts table is polluted with marketing emails:
- Coursera "purchase" was just a promotional email
- Martie "order" was likely an abandoned cart email
- All the detailed product breakdowns were from marketing, not receipts

This is why KANE's email parsing needs to distinguish between:
- **Actual receipts** (charged to your card)
- **Marketing emails** (trying to get you to buy)
- **Shipping notifications** (real but duplicate info)

## The Corrected Interview

Without the fake purchases, your story becomes:

**You invested $442 in AI tools this week** - almost half your spending on becoming an AI-native builder. Claude Pro was your biggest single decision at $222.

**Your Amazon spree** was $293 across multiple orders - suggests setting up workspace/apartment with specific purchases we can't see detail for.

**The stress purchase was real** - $31 on Uber Eats CVS delivery shows convenience-seeking behavior.

The real pattern: **Heavy AI tooling investment + setup purchases + minimal stress spending**

This is much cleaner than the inflated story from marketing emails!

## Technical Implication

KANE needs better email classification:
- Receipt parsing: ✅ 
- Marketing email filtering: ❌ (causing false purchases)
- Purchase confirmation vs. shipping notification: ❌ (causing duplicates)

The email context is valuable, but only when it's actually about real purchases.
