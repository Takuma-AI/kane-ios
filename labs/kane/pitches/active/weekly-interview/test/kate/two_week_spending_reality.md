## The Real Conversation

**KANE:** "Kate, you've spent $2,065 in 13 days. That's $158/day, which projects to almost $5,000/month. How does that feel?"

**[Your response about income pressure, runway anxiety, need to earn]**

**KANE:** "Looking at what you're spending on - $378 on development tools, $715 on setting up your life and workspace. You're not buying frivolous stuff. You're investing in capability and infrastructure. The question is: are these investments paying off in earning potential?"

**[Your insight about needing these tools to generate income]**

**KANE:** "The daily spending is actually reasonable - $285 on food and life stuff over two weeks. The big numbers are infrastructure. How long until this setup starts generating returns?"

## The Pressure Point

You don't feel bad about the spending because it's intentional. But the math creates pressure: **You need to earn $8-10k/month to sustain this comfortably.**

**The real question:** Are you building the right infrastructure fast enough to justify the burn rate?
