## The Real Story

You're spending **~$1,800/month** beyond rent on:
- **$500/month on AI tools** (serious builder investment)
- **$500/month on food** (includes social and health needs)  
- **$400/month on services/transport**
- **Plus one-time apartment setup** (~$650 that won't repeat)

**Total monthly burn: ~$5,400** including rent.

**You need ~$7,500/month income** to feel comfortable - challenging but achievable for an AI business.

**Key insight:** Your spending is well-allocated for someone in your phase. The AI tool investment shows serious commitment. The apartment setup was necessary and temporary. Your food/lifestyle costs are reasonable.

**The pressure is real but not overwhelming.** Focus on getting those AI tools generating the income you need.
