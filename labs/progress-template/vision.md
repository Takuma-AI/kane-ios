# Progress Management Template

## The Enemy
Every project starts in chaos - emails, documents, conversations, ideas scattered everywhere. Traditional project management imposes structure before understanding. This creates empty folders and abandoned plans.

## Our Vision  
A minimal template that lets structure emerge from the work itself. Not project management, but progress enablement. The system adapts to what you're building, not vice versa.

## Core Innovation
- **Input → Process → Output** instead of arbitrary categories
- **Context cascade** - instructions can specialize per project phase  
- **No prescribed structure** - could output a document, an app, or a decision
- **Anti-hallucination** - work with what's real, not what's imagined

## Use Cases
- Legal discovery from email archives
- Book writing from research notes
- App planning from user feedback
- Decision making from scattered evidence
- Any situation where mess needs to become clarity

## Success Metrics
- Time from chaos to first clarity
- Projects that actually complete vs abandon
- Reusability across completely different domains

## Technical Implementation
Simple folder structure with cascading CLAUDE.md instructions. Clone, customize, progress.
