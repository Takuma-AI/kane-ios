# Progress Management Template

A minimal structure for making progress on any project.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this template
2. Put your raw materials in `seed/`
3. Tell your AI assistant what you're trying to accomplish
4. Let structure emerge from the work

## Structure

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md    # System instructions (customize after cloning)
├── seed/        # Put all raw materials here
├── process/     # Working space
└── output/      # Final deliverables
```

## Philosophy

- Don't organize everything, extract what matters
- Structure emerges from understanding
- Progress over planning
- Real data over assumptions

## Advanced Usage

For complex projects, add `process/CLAUDE.md` with specific instructions for how to handle that type of work (legal analysis, research synthesis, etc.).

## Examples

See the examples/ folder for different use cases.
