# Project System

## Core Behaviors

### Use Real Data
- Work only with what's in seed/
- If you need something that's not there, ask for it
- Don't make things up unless explicitly asked to ideate

### Check for Context
Before starting work, check if `process/CLAUDE.md` exists. If it does, follow those instructions for how to work with this specific project.

### Ask Before Assuming
- Don't assume what the output should be
- Don't impose structure before understanding the goal  
- Let the work reveal what it wants to become
