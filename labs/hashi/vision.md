# HASHI Vision

## One-Sentence Vision
Transform fleeting understanding into structured action before it evaporates.

## The Enemy

### Functional Enemy
The evaporation of understanding - that tragic window between when you see something clearly and when it fades into vague memory. Traditional todos are accomplices, giving false comfort of having "captured" something when you've only written shadows.

### Philosophical Enemy  
The teleportation fantasy - the dangerous myth that AI can skip the thinking and just "do the work." Tools that promise to eliminate the journey up the hill, when the journey IS the understanding.

## What We're Building
HASHI is the tram that helps you find and climb the hill of understanding. It amplifies your thinking into clear paths others can follow - whether that's an intern, a founder, your future self, or eventually an AI agent. But crucially, it keeps you in the driver's seat.

Like an electric skateboard vs a teleportation machine - HASHI accelerates your journey but doesn't skip it.

## The Core Experience
1. Brain dump your thoughts (meeting transcript, ChatGPT session, personal rant)
2. AI extracts not just tasks but the methodology - the HOW, not just the WHAT
3. Review and refine the structured understanding
4. Send to Basecamp where it becomes actionable progress

## What We're NOT Building
- Another task management system
- An AI that works without human understanding
- A tool that creates tasks you don't comprehend
- A Basecamp replacement
- Meeting recording software

## Current Solution (MVP)
- Simple text input for any unstructured thinking
- AI prompt that produces actionable, context-rich todos with milestones
- Direct Basecamp integration
- Human review before sending

## Why This Matters
Every use of HASHI is about making thinking transferable:
- From you to an intern (with all your VC context)
- From a meeting to a founder (turning 30 minutes into a week of progress)
- From today's clarity to tomorrow's confusion
- From understanding to execution

The magic is in preserving not just what needs to be done, but the entire mental model of how to think about it.

## Success Metrics
- Users trust the output enough to send directly to collaborators
- Recipients can work autonomously from HASHI-generated tasks
- Thinking that would have evaporated gets preserved and acted upon
- Users feel they're climbing hills faster, not being teleported

## The Bridge
HASHI (æ©‹) is the bridge between thinking and doing. But more importantly, it's the bridge that ensures you understand the territory you're crossing.
