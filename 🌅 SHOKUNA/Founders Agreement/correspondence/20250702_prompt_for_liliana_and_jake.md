# A Leadership Question for Shokuna

## Where This Comes From

I've been CEO three times. I've seen co-founder breakups, fired people I brought in as partners, and spent years building businesses that made millions only to feel like I was carrying all the weight. I know what it feels like when this goes wrong.

Jake, you've tasted this as CEO and founder of Zest. Lilliana, you're experiencing it now as we build Shokuna together. We all understand that building something great requires more than just dividing equity and hoping for the best.

So here's what I'm thinking: We need to decide who runs this business. Not just on paper, but who bears the full accountability for its success. Who makes the hard calls. Who keeps us moving when things get tough.

## The Real Question

I believe the three of us working together—all equally excited and motivated—is the best path for Shokuna's success. But we need clarity on leadership.

Could it be Lilliana? Could it be me? Could it even be Jake, despite being newer to this specific venture? I honestly don't know. What I do know is that each of us has brought enough to the table to earn consideration for that responsibility.

This isn't about the work done so far. It's about what we can build together going forward.

## What I'm Asking

I want each of us to answer this question: **If I were CEO of Shokuna, how would I run it?**

Not just the mechanics, but the real stuff:
- How would you keep all three of us meaningfully involved and motivated?
- How would you handle profit distribution when my Techstars role limits what I can earn?
- How would you navigate the concerns we each have about the others' commitment levels?
- What would "earning your keep" mean in your model?
- How would decisions get made?

Write it in plain English. Tell your story. Show us how you think.

## Why This Matters

The people I've admired most as CEOs—Jason Fried, even Steve Jobs in his own way—understood that leadership isn't about getting the most money or having the biggest title. If I were designing this, the CEO wouldn't necessarily get paid the most. It's about committing to the deep responsibility of making this work for everyone.

I've learned these lessons the hard way. Now I want us to learn together, the right way.

## What Happens Next

Take a week. Really think about it. Then we'll share our visions and either:
- Combine the best elements from all three
- Choose one that resonates most
- Refine them together until we're all excited about our roles

Right now, Lilliana and I own this business 50/50. But I'm open to—excited about—finding the right way to involve Jake to whatever degree makes sense for all of us.

## One Last Thing

This is your moment. Each of you is a leader. Show us who you are, what you're committed to, and how you think at the deepest level.

Don't write what you think I want to hear. Don't hedge your bets. Step up and show us your vision.

The first job of a CEO is to design the foundational model for the organization. Show us yours.
