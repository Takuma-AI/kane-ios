# Neal's Communication to Lilliana
Hey, I'm about to ship an email uh with an idea I have to basically do a couple things. One, give you an opportunity to uh design together the overall uh structure uh for like a founder's agreement. But then two, give Jake a shot to prove to you and to me and to us uh that he belongs at the party or not. So, uh hopefully um you resonate with what I'm about to send, but uh as I was building out my uh vision for a founder's agreement, I chanced upon a really cool or what I think is a really cool way to go about it. So, uh let me know what you think. I'm definitely open to uh and flexible if you want to talk through it more, but I'm just going to ship it because it feels right. And just one more thing because I've been thinking about it. Um, I know we are going to keep our coms between you and I and not involve Jake as much until we get more clarity and confidence in him. The reason I chose to include him in this exercise is because this is basically my way of assessing his readiness and his fit for us. So, I just wanted to be super clear with you that I I did it on purpose and with intention. Um, we don't necessarily have to involve him to any extent that you wouldn't be comfortable involving him, uh, especially if you think he's going to if you're if you're not sure on the trust level. But I think if it's going to work out, we have to be able to do something like this. So, this is the ultimate test and if this doesn't work out or bear fruit, then we know that we can't work with him and we need to move on and focus on our partnership together between you and I exclusively. Um, but this is basically my one shot at seeing whether he's worthy of joining us in whatever way we we deem necessary. Uh, because between you and I, we still make the call on who gets involved and who doesn't. So I just wanted to reinforce that message and let you know I didn't mean to step around you in any way, uh, by just firing this off and including him. But uh, I I I do think this is the right move to help us understand whether he could be a partner of ours in any way, shape or form or not.

# Lilliana's Response
I hear you, but I don’t understand why we couldn’t discuss this first or at least give me a chance to read it before you included Jake

I’m sorry I didn’t discuss further with you. Like I mentioned I can walk it back still if preferred, it felt right. What do you think the problem will be with giving him a chance to show up?

What bothers me about the email is that it wasn’t discussed beforehand. Many assumptions were made that I disagree with. I don’t think that a CEO is necessary at this point, especially with it just being the two of us. Even if we were to discuss leadership, I think it was inappropriate to involve a third party. I also really didn’t appreciate the implication of bringing him on as a cofounder or potential changes in equity. I was surprised by a lot of the contents of the email.

If this is truly just an exercise to sus out Jake, I think it should have been done differently. I think we should’ve asked him about ideas for providing tangible value, not clueing him in on internal discussions that should be between cofounders. What bothers me and feels like a breakdown of trust is that this brought him into the business in such a significant way without my agreement. I want us to work together with trust and open communication like we always have. This felt like a serious lack of communication and a breach of trust.

I want to have a normal discussion with you about anything you’re worried about in regard to the business. We can just chat openly
Then next week Jake can present to us. I don’t want it to be a three-way discussion

# Neal's Response and Thought Process
 
Me: Yes Okay. Yeah. So I think it's coming from a place of Neil and Liliana are the business partners and sole owners of this company, and you guys are the definitive founders, and no one else is a part of the business yet. And, therefore, it needs a lot more. It's a lot more of a sort of careful and deliberate process to attempt to bring in a third party And there's this kind of, like, higher horse of you and Liliana having to judge Jake. When I think part of the initial intent of the exercise is for the three of you to almost be healthily competitive. Because that draws out the best in you. And I think Liliana didn't appreciate that competition. Which Yeah. She doesn't understand the the value of that competition. One part of the thing is that what Jake would bring in is is a contrast or a or a bar. If if Jake is able to be a lot more thoughtful with how to run this business and even, like, the two of you, then there's no reason why he shouldn't be part of it. We're also getting free ideas from him. Yeah. You know, we're getting free contributions. We don't owe him anything. We don't have to commit to anything. And I don't even think we're putting anything at risk by having him as a part of the conversation at I think if anything, we're gonna learn a lot by I don't consider Jake a third party. I consider him someone who's been helping us from day one. Yeah. Think through this, work through this, give us advice, engage us, participate in conversations, nudge Bob along to reinforce these messages and ideas. I think it's a little dismissive and incomplete and incorrect. To treat Jake like some outsider who, you know, were considering either as an intern or, somebody who needs to present work to us to prove himself I I I think that's really doing a disservice to his contributions to date both for us professionally at Techstars, how he's helped us grow and all of the support he and the advice he's given us to be better about how we've even gone about conducting the business Exactly. For jobs to be done itself. So think that there's I'm not hearing enough of a actual respectful deference towards contributions that he both has made and has the potential to contribute going forward. Yeah. So there is a disconnect there. But my way of handling it because the notion of they're not needing to be a CEO right now, I think, is incorrect. Mhmm. And wrong. And the reason I feel that way is because it's very clear that you don't agree with the decision I made but I had every right to do it. And if you thought that that was a betrayal of trust, I'm sorry. But we need this is why we need agreements and founders agreements and things like that because we haven't established the right communication protocol and expectation on these types of decisions because as I was generating my idea around this, I thought this was actually a valuable contribution that could help the business succeed. And you clearly seem to not agree with that and have a very negative visceral reaction to what I did. So this is a really helpful thing for us to work through together. This is one of our first tests. Yeah. Right? As as team members and cofounders. Right? Because I trust you. But I will challenge you. And it sounds like what you're saying is after me doing this, you don't trust me. And I'm sorry you feel that way, but it's it's a little I think it's there's a there's a huge disconnect if something like this could so deeply betray your trust. Yeah. And rather than having curiosity before judging what I did and why I did it, I think there might be more questions to ask of me before you rush to the conclusions that you have. Yeah. There's also the whole Bob Nesta connection. Like, at this point, I'm like You wanna hit record again? I mean, it's been Recording. It's still recording now? Yeah. Okay. At this point, it's like I feel like there's a disconnect and not like just because you guys incorporated among the two of you and you guys have started one contract together. It's early enough where Jake is very much legitimately in the running to to be a cofounder. I mean, I think we should just seriously consider it, I don't think it's a given. And I think I made it really clear in my message that there is no guarantee whatsoever he's gonna be involved at all. Yeah. Like like, I I make that pretty clear. Like, the no the notion of equity again is, what are we talking about? Like, that that's not even what this is about. No. And if anything, I think we're getting free ideas from him on how we could think about structuring the business given his different perspective and experience. Yeah. And we're getting someone involved who Bob Messda himself has directly endorsed. Yeah. That's something we're working on for Liliana. That's something we objectively have for Neil and Jake. Yeah. So if anything, one of the biggest criterias for our excitement and and validation of being successful as a company is inextricably linking ourselves to the Rewire Group and Bob Messta. Yeah. And I think the likelihood of that happening dramatically increases with some version of Jake's commitment or involvement, which is what I've been aiming for, which I thought would be in her best interest. Yeah. Like, it's not guaranteed, but it's very much should be in conversation. And the fact that that isn't clear or or Mhmm. Isn't obvious to her is telling. Well yeah. And and I don't know. Let's let's figure it out. I I wanna know what we can come up with based on everything we've said so far. Yeah. I don't think he's been brought into the business in a significant way to that to that end. But No. Like, this is this is an exercise of what are you talking about. Like, you you you conversations with people, with hires, which sound very real to the very last moment fall apart all the time. And and by the way, we need to treat Jake at the level that he would even consider being involved in. Yeah. So the the fact that I, you know, found out from him that the intern option was voted I think was already a breach of of trust between us because I asked you not to do that. Yeah. Right? So if you wanna talk about trust, Yeah. Like, here we go. Like, that's something that we'd already actively talked about because I'm trying to do what's in our best interest. And when things like that happen and we treat people like they're lesser than, I think that's a huge mistake and it already puts the business at risk. Yeah. That is a very clear expectation that I had set. Yeah. That was not followed. Yeah. That's I want that in there. Yeah. Like, because there's some there's a there's a level of respect that you have for Jake that Liliana clearly doesn't. And and there should be a reason we should talk about that. I've made it clear why. I've also acknowledged my concerns and hesitations. Yeah. I think I've been very transparent and direct about those choices and I'm bringing a lot of experience to the table for why I wrote the message the way I did. Yeah. I stand by it. Yeah.
