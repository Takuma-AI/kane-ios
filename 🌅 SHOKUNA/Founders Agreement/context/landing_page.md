Be the blade they reach for.
Most products fail because they chase wants, not struggles. We don't.

⸻
How we work
Listen for the hire
10–12 casual conversations with people who actually switched.
Friendly on the surface. Forensic underneath.

Map the forces
We diagram the demand.
What pushed them forward,
what held them back,
what made them move.

Apply the insight
No decks. No fluff.
Just sharp sessions that cut straight into your roadmap, pricing, and copy.

⸻
Why it works
Talk is cheap. People don't lie with their wallets.
