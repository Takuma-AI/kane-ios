# Shokuna Founders Agreement - Consolidated History

## Timeline of Events

### Background Context
- **Neal and Lilliana**: Currently 50/50 partners in Shokuna (jobs-to-be-done consulting)
- **Jake's involvement**: Has been advising since before incorporation, considering deeper role
- **The catalyst**: Jake exploring other opportunities, window closing for involvement

### January 2024: The CEO Exercise Incident

#### Neal's Decision to Send Prompt
Neal sends email to both Lilliana and Jake proposing a "CEO exercise" where each envisions running the company. His reasoning:
- Believes leadership structure needed from day one
- Wants to see how each person thinks about the business
- Inspired by avoiding the Ryan Singer/Basecamp situation
- Acted quickly due to Jake's job search creating urgency

#### Lilliana's Pushback
Lilliana responds with strong concerns:
- Feels it's a breach of trust to include Jake without discussion
- Doesn't believe they need a CEO with just two people
- Sees Jake as external party who needs to prove himself
- Upset about implications of equity changes

Key quote: "This felt like a serious lack of communication and a breach of trust."

#### Neal's Perspective
From transcript analysis:
- Had previously asked Lilliana not to treat Jake as "an intern"
- Sees Jake as integral from day one, not a third party
- Jake is "#1 of 322 founders" he's worked with at Techstars
- Bob Moesta trusts Jake more than any other founder
- This is about "three people I care about more than anyone"

#### The Trust Breach History
1. **First breach**: Lilliana suggested treating Jake as intern (against Neal's explicit request)
2. **Second breach**: Neal sent CEO exercise without consulting Lilliana
3. **Core issue**: Different views on Jake's standing and role in company

### Key Relationship Dynamics

#### Neal's Position
- Broker between Jake and Lilliana (has deep trust with each separately)
- More experienced/senior, but wants thoughtful agreement over hierarchy
- Limited to $66k/year from Shokuna due to Techstars salary cap
- Wants profit sharing over equity focus

#### Lilliana's Concerns
- Questions Jake's commitment and capacity
- Wants him to prove value before inclusion
- Feels partnership with Neal was violated
- New parent with time constraints

#### Jake's Situation
- Built Zest using jobs-to-be-done methodology
- Has Bob Moesta's endorsement
- Actively seeking new opportunities
- Brings fresh operating experience

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Forcing function**: Neal's action surfaced underlying tensions
2. **Clear exercise**: "If I were CEO" prompt was simple and revealing
3. **Experience matters**: Neal's pattern recognition from past failures

### What Failed
1. **Process**: No agreed-upon protocol for major decisions
2. **Assumptions**: Each person had different view of Jake's role
3. **Communication**: Went straight to action without alignment

### Key Insights
- "This situation proves we need a CEO" - disagreement itself demonstrates need
- Trust must be bidirectional and explicit
- Respect and evaluation are separate considerations
- Windows of opportunity require decisive action
- Competition/comparison can draw out best thinking

## Documents Generated

### Strategic Documents
1. **Original CEO exercise prompt**: Thoughtful request for leadership visions
2. **Neal's CEO model**: Profit-based, flexible, phase-based approach
3. **Response strategies**: Multiple drafts from apologetic to assertive

### Communication Evolution
- V1: Overly apologetic, focused on breach
- V2: More assertive, establishing context
- V3: Jason Fried style - concise and direct

## Open Questions
1. Will Lilliana and Jake complete CEO exercises?
2. Can trust be rebuilt while maintaining momentum?
3. How to balance Neal's constraints with leadership needs?
4. Is Jake's window truly closing?
