 
Them: Happening, man?  
Me: Man. I'm, I'm having a great day.  
Them: Oh, yeah?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I I I knocked out some, like, health stuff this morning. I was at the University of Chicago. I had an appointment. So I'm excited to, you know, get fully get to 100% So I'm feeling good about that, and that's like a life thing I gotta take care of. And then I had a a lot of, reflecting over the weekend where I wrote that fucking crazy article you read. Feeling good about that too because I've done more work and analysis since and I'm feeling very, very strong. In the sense that it'll it it will never come to that extreme, but at least I'm ready if it does.  
Them: You've essentially yeah. You've you've almost liberated yourself by taking extreme position.  
Me: See that article you read is just the tip of the iceberg of what I actually did.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: So I have a I have 30 pages of, like, like, case analysis that I basically AI hired corporate lawyers and employment lawyers in California and Illinois. To, like, review, to figure like, basically, objectively assess do you actually have any substance here that you can, like, claim? And  
Them: Is there is there a software, or did you just ask to  
Me: is there a soft drink?  
Them: the mainstream guys to try?  
Me: You say mainstream guys, like,  
Them: Like like, I  
Me: there's nothing keep  
Them: can can TratchGBT, are they, like, allowed to give legal advice like that?  
Me: My my friend. My friend. There's nothing mainstream about how I move right now.  
Them: Got it.  
Me: This is what all of you guys are doing, and this is what I'm doing.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So, yeah, I'm I'm I went all the way as deep as you could possibly imagine to verify that I basically if if I had met with lawyers, I would have spent $10,000 to get the understanding that I have.  
Them: Got it. And and you're in, like, a very strong position.  
Me: Extreme  
Them: Is how you feel.  
Me: Like, well because here's the thing, you feed it evidence.  
Them: Mhmm. But is it is it I guess, lawyers are also designed to get to yes.  
Me: Well, that's that's when you're talking money and stuff.  
Them: Right? Right. Like, are but are these when you're feeding an evidence, it it is is it designed to get to a yes?  
Me: No, no, no. It's the scientists assess the strength of the case. At least for how I've I mean, so far, you know, I'm like, so here's the thing, like these tools, I think people are too distracted by tools. Like, there's a use of tools and what tools do, and and those are all helpful for jobs. Right? That are carved out people. But I'm not at that level. I'm at the systems level of thinking about to utilize these things. So I'm more at the operating system level.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Sweet.  
Them: Yeah. Sweet. I think as you have to be. That's great, though.  
Me: Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So I I I I'm thinking basically mostly in in code as far as, like, what's possible. Because any tool that you think of someone made. And if someone made it, that means that I can make it too. And if it's worth it to me to build a custom answer for something I need progress on, then I will do that first because no tool's ever gonna do as good of a job as me at what I need it for. Unless it's too much takes too too up too much of my time. So for example, I'm not gonna reinvent iOS software to use my iPhone better. Right? I'm not going to rewrite Voxer yet, but I might soon. But that, like, that that that's what I mean. So that's the level of, like, depth. That I'm at. So when it comes to lawyers, I go, well, I could call a lawyer, which I will, right, and talk to you this week, But before I do that, let me do everything that the lawyer would probably do anyway to get 99 through the way there.  
Them: Right. Right.  
Me: Whatever the lawyer says is validating what I already know, which is the same thing that happens when I go into a doctor's office.  
Them: Interesting.  
Me: Interesting.  
Them: Are you so I guess flashback to the initial piece, are you okay? Is everything okay with you?  
Me: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Everything's okay. Yeah. I I mean I mean, this is TMI, but I've had, like, a horrible hemorrhoid problem for about a decade, and it's finally gonna be  
Them: Oh, you know who you could talk to about this is, Graham. Who I don't know if it was a hemorrhoid or a weird thing on his butt. And I guess  
Me: No. But it no. Dude, this is life. Like, it's not TMI for me. It's just like, you know,  
Them: that's TMI. Right? I guess he's  
Me: I try not to fool people with, you know, personal problems, but it's real, dude. It it it sucks. But it's fine.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Gonna get it done this month, and I'll be ready for snowboard season.  
Them: Huge. Alright. Hell, yeah. Well, I yeah. That's that's obviously not boring to me. I've I've had a few more ideas on the Shokana front. I'm but I'm looking forward to Thursday and really starting to talk about this a little bit more.  
Me: So  
Them: Yeah. I I'm I'm feeling good. Has anything changed for you?  
Me: I'm just more excited.  
Them: Cool? Cool. I spoke to Bob.  
Me: Great.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So  
Them: He and I caught up for a while on the on the fourth. It went well. I think that we need to prove that we care about sir that, like, we will we care and will be good at servicing clients. I think this is my read. But just, like, sharing full transparency inside baseball,  
Me: Just like  
Them: He I think his anxiety is that gonna experience client work and not like it and pivot. Away from it. So it's not that he needs us to prove that we can close and do this and do that. He's nervous that once we experience the like, the shit, of his job, we're actually not gonna like it, and we're gonna end up wanting to leave. And we're not gonna wanna say no to people, and we're gonna let you know, like, we're gonna essentially get caught up in in the in the downsides.  
Me: It's a wonderful insight.  
Them: Of I got you.  
Me: That's a wonderful insight. That's such a beautiful insight. Because, like, I I love how valid that is. But that only speaks to what we already know about Bob, which is that he can just get to it. Right?  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: We haven't had enough client work to know that or not, but client work is fucking hard, dude.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And unless it's done on your terms where, like, we have to very quickly get to a point where it's a joy for us to take on work. Because we're working with people that we believe in and are proud of and want serve because we think they're gonna do something in the world that we're not.  
Them: No.  
Me: But by helping them do it, we're very happy with our contribution to their progress. Until we get to the point where we're joyfully serving clients and not opportunistically serving clients, we're not gonna know the answer to that.  
Them: Right. And he's one of the reservations is expressed was essentially, like, we actually need to be able to say no to people. His example is a cent right.  
Me: So rather than it being inbound,  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: like, meaning people come to us, it's almost like we need to present ourselves to the right opportunities and places  
Them: Right. And when people ask certain things of us, we need to recontextualize their ask.  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: So it's like people will go to him and be like, we wanna figure out why people are using us. He's like, that's not what I do. I invented the way of figuring out why people are paying you. You know?  
Me: Really good reframing.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. Obviously, a relative relative cone of silence, but that's  
Me: Saying a word, bro. I totally get it. Just to be clear though, it's not even that that's not even that scary to know. You know what I mean? Like, that's that's  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm  
Me: that's what it is. Like, that that's so true. It's like, yeah. Let's go prove that.  
Them: yeah. Right.  
Me: That.  
Them: Right. Right. So it's less yeah. It's like it it's it's actually, I think, a tactical anxiety of his is he's nervous that we're gonna, like, like, oh, the ReWired group is sick. Jobs you've done is sick, which obviously we feel both of those ways. And then it's like, we're gonna go in and actually take on take on the work, and it's gonna be like this We don't like this. And that or, like, we'll get you not distracted, but we'll move away from it, and and then it'll be like, it won't be what it originally was. He almost it almost was like he's waiting for he's waiting for it to settle. You like, if it was like if we were able to project with confidence or, like, signal that, like, no. We are doing the like, in inheriting the rewired Like, that is the that is what we're doing. Then it would feel better for him  
Me: Well, what's helpful now is that he doesn't know is that I'm  
Them: This is my  
Me: I'm more on the way out in tech cars than we anticipated.  
Them: I I know. So I didn't yeah. And I I didn't share any of that, obviously. Like, that's not mine to share. And so yeah. He doesn't know any of that.  
Me: And that's talking to Big Mac.  
Them: I think the other thing, though, is the the other thing have you talked to I didn't say anything about this. Did you talk to him about the 37 signal side of this idea?  
Me: The product  
Them: Yes.  
Me: The product front?  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Yeah. I did, but I don't know if it registered.  
Them: I think that that might have scared that might be part of his anxiety.  
Me: Okay. Got it.  
Them: It's basically you're gonna find something is is you're gonna find something that you you enjoy doing more and you're gonna leave this part aside.  
Me: Oh, interesting. No. No. No. So there's three levels to the work. As you know. Right? So  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: one is the actual, like, demand discovery. The other one is  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: the dojo. Which is, like, giving the world the the skill. Right? And can  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: to to, like, evangelize. And then we've always been up about the desire to also do it ourselves.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: Now, to what extent? I have no idea. But the idea isn't to abandon the the spirit of jobs for a company. It's to like, basically evolve into it. Because we'll never be the best at this unless we are pushing the boundaries ourselves.  
Them: I think that, just making sure that with especially the last piece, whereas tight as possible because, like, what I hear you saying is essentially, unless we're actually doing like, we're essentially reading a book as opposed to doing the work because we're not actually doing the work to build it. Bob did the houses, but he's worked on a million different things. DOD, my part is  
Me: Gotta do real things.  
Them: I I think that that's the yeah. That's the positive angle of it. The the anxiety inducing one is like, okay. Once they start building this next which I don't I'm not hearing you say. What I've heard again, like, I've told you, like, essentially how this is contextualized for me. Is that in the act of taking on rewired group, projects, we will become aware of opportunity we're gonna build things to essentially make those and make progress in those areas. Ultimately, something's gonna break out. As opposed to, like, we're actively looking for a a a product which could signal a lack of patience with the process as is.  
Me: So let me just be clear about something.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: On the product front especially. A product any product that we work on together right now,  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: not gonna pay Jake, Liliana, or Neal a $200,000 salary anytime soon.  
Them: Right.  
Me: And I'm not raising venture capital.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So those two cases in mind, you got two years at the earliest that we're even  
Them: We're literally constrained. Yeah. It makes it makes total sense. I yeah. So I I just he doesn't see that light yet. But he is in. Like, he he's obviously down to support you. He doesn't he, like, knows that we're kind of talking, but doesn't really know the involvement. Lovelyhat. I think he would be down to support us. Like, I think he would be very excited to you have more insight into that side of the conversation than I do. I was just, like, trying to get down to like, alright. Where's the how do I know? You know?  
Me: here's where we're at. Where we're at is I've asked enough and I've done enough to get their buy in. Where it's getting to the point now where, like, the round is closing,  
Them: Yes.  
Me: and the price is gonna go up.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: So that's basically how it feels. Like, I wanted him to angel invest. He want he didn't wanna commit to the angel investment. So now we can put together a proper round because our valuation's about to go up because hopefully Jake joins and we make it worth his while and we all get happy and excited and we start to execute And this becomes something that they can't control anymore, but can still be a part of if they're willing to endorse.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Like, I'm at that point already.  
Them: My my thing is I wanna and we'll talk more about this on Thursday, actually. I should write this down I haven't written this one this one down yet. But I am interested in inheriting some of the bigger ticket work that they do. As we learn. So I'm not saying, like, we should walk in and sign McDonald's tomorrow. I don't think that that's realistic. It's similar to the product argument. But he basically was, within three to five years, me and Greg are gonna retire.  
Me: I know. And and but here's the thing, though. You don't inherit their work by just, like, trying to get their approval or permission. You inherit their work by being the best.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: So we just need to be the best. Like, that's really it. Like, I'm not worried about it. Like, I know Bob needs to see more or, like, whatever. I'm like, okay. Well, I'll just be more. I don't need you to to to I don't need your permission for that. I'll I know what to do.  
Them: Right. Right.  
Me: Especially now, bro. Especially now that I'm like, alright. Well, I'm on sabbatical, and there's a real chance I don't even go back to Techstars at all. Or if I do, it's  
Them: I  
Me: very different context.  
Them: yeah. Let's put it this way is, like, at the very least, you're in the passive looking phase.  
Me: No. I would say, like, I I mean, I'll just tell you this.  
Them: Like,  
Me: Like, I'm out of that company one way or another. Like, I'm shipping my my my  
Them: yeah.  
Me: my California stuff this week back to Chicago.  
Them: Fuck. Yeah. Okay. That's it.  
Me: So that's that's what I want you to understand. Like, it's, like, literally, like, I'm not signing a new lease. I'm shipping everything I I own back. I'm already planning on all of this. If I have a a a month or two more of California obligation for some technical handoff, of some kind, then by all means, I'll just crash at a friend's place.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: But I've had my two years in California.  
Them: Sick.  
Me: And I can go back whenever I want.  
Them: Yeah. I think, like, the key then for us, as we know, on Thursdays, we gotta just shift this into the land of the real.  
Me: Oh, I I am I am I just started cooking on that today.  
Them: But hell yeah.  
Me: And  
Them: Yeah. So that was gonna be my other thing is, like, you don't you can keep hitting me up. And I'm down to do stuff in advance of Thursday. I don't wanna violate or overstep on any lines. I was also thinking on really Liliana and I wrote this down and I'll offer it on  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Thursday. But, like, she should talk to one of my founders my cofounders, and she should talk to Julie who had a pregnancy while she was my employee. And had a child while she was my employee.  
Me: Yeah. Well, so  
Them: And and learn about who  
Me: there's there's there's one person out of the three of us that has never been a CEO.  
Them: Yes. Right.  
Me: Right. Right. So that's the thing. It's just there's there's there's things to learn. There's things to learn about that.  
Them: Right. But my thing is on I I'm looking essentially on the again, I'm re perceiving two anxieties, which I have too. How do I know that Like, mine are how do I know this is real? How do I know I can trust Liliana when I work with her? I know she's asking  
Me: Hello? Hello?  
Them: Basically, all I was saying Basically, all all I was saying is, like, if the two anxieties are how do I know that we can make money doing this thing, and how do I know I can trust that guy? I I'm more than happy. And honestly, like, if if she would be interested in it, she should have the conversations with the people whose experiences will most closely mirror hers I've worked with, which is, like, cofounder relationship and first time parent. Like, I literally have had those two working experiences on a very close and similar basis. And so those people those people can speak to what that that actually looks like.  
Me: Does actually look  
Them: From me.  
Me: Okay. So let me read to you what I wrote to her about you.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Okay? This weekend?  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: So I'm gonna paraphrase. I said, Liliana, I met you and Jake the same year. You were both my students. I've watched both of you evolve over nearly seven years. Take on my thinking and ideas and teach me just as much in return. Out of the 322 founders I've invested in across 160 companies, we've founders we worked with together. Jake is number one. The founder I would most trust to build something great alongside us. He's not just someone who learned JTBD in a classroom. He's exhibit a of a founder who's actually implemented it as an operator in the real world. If there's any chance of this working, it has to come from a place of respect. We need to acknowledge what he brings. Fresh operating experience building and running a real business. One of the very few founders who established a deep connection with Bob Messa independently, Bob trusted more than any other founder we worked with. Battle tested frameworks from his time at Zest. And a deep understanding of concepts like the fifth discipline, same book I re recommended to you when you were struggling as accelerator lead.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: Jake is actively seeking opportunities. This decision needs to be made relatively quickly. All I've asked is for him to share his vision. And the same thing I've asked for you and myself. No commitments, no equity promises, just show us how you think, and I think we'd be foolish not to leverage his strategic thinking. While it's being offered. So I I said a whole lot more than that to basically get on the same page with her. But I wanted you to know, like, that's what I think about you. That's what I've communicated to her and I think she believes me.  
Them: Alright. I yeah. I appreciate, man. I I our big thing like, yeah. My my thing is I ultimately, it's gonna be a show for me. Show, tell.  
Me: Of course.  
Them: Is is how how I wanna feel it, but, like, yeah, well, I I I appreciate  
Me: I just wanted you to know what I think of you and what I communicate  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: to her and what I got into alignment with her about you on. Like, I need to I needed to have the same language. I needed to write it down, so I did.  
Them: Yeah. No. I mean, listen. I really I I really do appreciate that. And I think that it helps It's gonna be helpful just in the sense of, like, there's no confusion over what we're we're trying to see if we the three of us can work together as a as a as a nucleus to make something happen or what we can do together so it'll be less confused, call it, Again, like, she's not gonna offer me, like, the scouting role. Or something like that, which I I'm happy to  
Me: That's not no. We're not that that's not the level of  
Them: talk about it and stuff. But it's not like, yeah, we're in alignment over, like, what we're trying to see happen.  
Me: I I I I actually part of what I wrote as well called called that out, by the way.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Right.  
Them: Right. Because it's also, like, I don't yeah. My my thing is and you get I know that you have this. It's like I'm not thinking these conversations aren't like a dual outcome There are like a million permutations and shades of coloring for where they kick out.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: And so it's like it's not like we're just going in and kinda feeling out what like, there's just a lob of clay, and we're just gonna feel out what we mold. You know? It's not like there's no expectation of of where this goes. But I I am just trying to think of different confidence building measures that I can try to give to her in order to help her build, some sort of context.  
Me: Help like, some sort of context. Yes.  
Them: For what? It could be. But yeah. And on the on the Techstars front, I I I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this. My general feeling is we should be operating like you're gonna leave in three weeks, four weeks, but  
Me: Yes.  
Them: we but there's no reason for you to rush a departure unless you feel like you need to get out.  
Me: No. So so what what's happening is I don't know what their terms are, but, like, I I just this there's a side of me that people very rarely experience. Because it has only happened a few times in my life where people have crossed the line. With with with respect to integrity. And my boss, the head of our accelerator, investment, team,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: has crossed that line. So there's no going back from having done that. So now the question is is what do we do because that happened? Because like, even if something gets settled and she either gets removed or seeks penance. That I'm not interested in staying at a company that allowed this to happen.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So there there is a transition plan underway. The question is what are the terms?  
Them: And and and also, like, I guess, from what position are you saying I need like, is there a is there an Alamo point Do you need to leave by the New Year? Or by next year? You know, like, we had been kind of been talking in terms of twelve months. Are you, like, saying, like, I'm never I'm not running another program for  
Me: That's that's exactly what I'm saying.  
Them: these guys? Okay. Like, you yeah. You've now, like in in reflecting, that needs to be the case.  
Me: Yeah. Exactly.  
Them: And so it's it's essentially figure out the that's like,  
Me: It's essentially  
Them: figure out the vesting for which you have a great case, it seems, then get out.  
Me: Can you hear me? What the hell? Hello? What about now? Hello? Hello? This. I don't  
Them: Yeah. Is that is that happening to you a lot?  
Me: It it just only on this this call.  
Them: Okay. Yeah. I don't know what the deal is. This is the first time that I've seen this too.  
Me: Whatever. It's fine. We'll we'll get they're they're just trying to slow us down. That's all.  
Them: Yeah. I got so I got  
Me: So I was just saying I had to I I wanna wake up storming out of my bedroom every day.  
Them: yeah. And I guess  
Me: I really  
Them: I have, like, a few general  
Me: Like thoughts and feelings.  
Them: thoughts and feelings on the these things. Number one is you found Bob.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So it's like you're, like, halfway through season two. Unfortunately, at this place, like, David Lynch just left the show, everything's a parody of itself. It kinda sucks. Like, in you're just now but, like, season two has to play out. You know, like,  
Me: See the two as the plan. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. But the last episode's a banger.  
Them: the last episode is a banging us. So it's like, you're gonna yeah. There is a and that's like I think my big thing is, like,  
Me: You  
Them: you're you've now shifted into that get out  
Me: you now  
Them: quest  
Me: quest Yep.  
Them: that that Bob had? In in the book. And the question is, like, his big thing in the book is that's where people will also will make mistakes. And so it's like, how do you navigate this from a position of strength?  
Me: Well, that's why I'm calling the lawyers.  
Them: Huge. Yeah. Because it's like yeah.  
Me: She did Because it's like yeah.  
Them: I'm like and and also for  
Me: I'm like, it can also go for  
Them: what we're we'll talk we'll talk on Thursday tactically. Like We can do our thing. If we can. If we do have a shot a good shot at it, Because something that I'm becoming increasingly convinced of is you can invest because you're a very talented person, but I think you were born to operate.  
Me: you are all helpful. Completely agree. I've made enough investments.  
Them: Right. I'm just like and and I'm sure you'll keep on investing  
Me: I've already done that part.  
Them: as, like, your career goes on just as a form of diversifying or because you're drawn to helping people and more involved in their stuff and all that.  
Me: How my life work?  
Them: Right. But  
Me: I'm just, like, seeing  
Them: I'm just, like, seeing you as an operator over the course of the increasingly over the course of the past six to eight weeks, it's like, this is like a it applies all of your principles, but it's just a different energy.  
Me: Applies Different energy. Yep. Feel it, man. I feel the difference.  
Them: Right. Like and I can like, I'm I feel like I'm seeing it, and it's like you're talking about this brain bleed. So  
Me: I feel like I'm seeing  
Them: it's not necessarily the way that I function where, like, I'm building a complicated legal case and then I'm like, I'm gonna turn around and make, like, a very easy to digest Twin Peaks breakdown. For everybody.  
Me: So so that I can share it because I share this on the like, I don't trust your  
Them: So that I can share it because I share this a lot in my like, I don't but, like, you just, like, it seems like the more you do, the more you do. Is kind of like an interesting dynamic.  
Me: I can't wait to fully unleash it because today is the first day that it's actually  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: technically unlocked. Like, I've never I've never started a day not thinking about my obligation to text SARS until today.  
Them: Yeah. It's crazy.  
Me: Yeah. It's crazy. I mean,  
Them: I mean, it's crazy. And  
Me: six years. It's like to  
Them: and just, like, to  
Me: see  
Them: say, like, the  
Me: this is another thing that I was thinking about with  
Them: this is another thing that I was thinking about with the the Liliana stuff, like, in terms of, like, what should  
Me: with  
Them: what could build  
Me: what could  
Them: like,  
Me: in terms of, like, I I just I I spoke a little bit on Saturday night,  
Them: I I just I I smoked a little bit on Saturday night,  
Me: and I'm  
Them: I'm just sitting there. And I realized, like,  
Me: you know, just sitting there. You know?  
Them: you're you're Dale Cooper.  
Me: you're you're the  
Them: Like like, you're literally just coffee and cherry. Pie. Right? Now. And it's like, that's a pattern. It's crazy. You so it's  
Me: It kills me a lot of dumbness.  
Them: it gives me a lot of confidence because I don't believe that you like,  
Me: that you, like,  
Them: it's this lethal combination  
Me: is this a lethal combination?  
Them: of also being in it for the betterment of other people.  
Me: Also being an  
Them: That then lets you call balls and strikes because it's not political. You're not like what's best  
Me: You're not, like,  
Them: for Neal.  
Me: need? That's what makes it easy. Like, you don't have to overthink anything. You don't have to worry about your decisions. You don't question your choices because you know what you're doing it for. You know what your intent is. So it makes life a lot more relaxing. And and, like, it makes you easy it makes it easy to make decisions that way, like, it's so I don't know. It's very, very enlightening and refreshing. I want everyone to feel that way if they want to.  
Them: If they yeah. If they want to.  
Me: They want to. Yeah. But  
Them: But  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: yeah.  
Me: I'm just  
Them: I'm just the way that I  
Me: doing doing that I see that. I was like, literally sitting  
Them: the way that I see that, I was, like, literally sitting there because at first, I read that thing, and I was like, oh, bro. Yeah. I was  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What are you doing?  
Them: I was like, dude. Yeah. You're like, this is you're about to go off. Like, this is crazy.  
Me: It's not meant for public consumption. That wasn't like, I'm gonna send this to TechCrunch. It's like,  
Them: The yeah. Right. I so I understood that.  
Me: That's for my friends. But even, like,  
Them: But even, like, the fact that you're able to  
Me: the second thing you're essentially  
Them: essentially articulately shine a light on that reality, Because I'll tell you, I believe  
Me: because I think that one my train.  
Them: listen, I have faith in a lot of my strengths. But I think in situations that are that tangled, I I would act in a more dissonant way.  
Me: Mhmm.  
Them: Would essentially try to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'd understand I need to get out because it's a toxic experience. But I'm not sitting down in in truth just looking at everything that happened. And taking that audit.  
Me: And taking that all I mean, I hadn't done that until just now, man.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You I hadn't done that myself.  
Them: It's a crazy experience to do.  
Me: Well, I'm trying to remember when I spoke to you about it. If at all, because, like, I figured out what it was about. A few days ago. Because I I I got lunch with my mom and I told her, like, hey, mom, like, I'm probably actually coming back to Chicago. Because this thing happened, and they told me that they're they're know, questioning my performance and you know, like this, that, and the other. And she looks at me almost like she almost looked a little disappointed, and she says, I don't think you're a failure. And then when I when I saw her say that, was like, oh, she used to understand what I actually mean by this. Like, she needs  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: know what actually happened. So it became less about injustice and more about honor.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because all of a sudden, it was like, need my family to know that I've I I, like, I did right. By everything and they raised me well.  
Them: Great.  
Me: Like, that's what this is ultimately about.  
Them: And that's gonna fire you up  
Me: Yes.  
Them: way more.  
Me: Yeah. That's the ultimate. Like, I don't care about the money. I don't care about the legacy. I don't care about the reputation. I care about my, like, my family knowing that, like, their son is who he says he is.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. That's what this is about. So it got really deep.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. We hadn't talked about that, but I do I literally think that that was  
Me: Think that that was  
Them: that was what I saw.  
Me: that was what I saw. Yeah. Fuck god. I'm like, oh, shit. Like,  
Them: Come out, and I'm like, oh, shit. Like  
Me: it's just as clear  
Them: it's just this clear  
Me: picture, and it's you.  
Them: picture. And view.  
Me: So thank you for reading it and hearing me out on it, man. It means a lot and I didn't know I had it in me. But I I drew it out.  
Them: Right. And I think that that then I don't know. I again, like, I I'm I wanna keep working on the thing or within the thing if if we can, like, and if you have ideas, if I can bring things out. But I do think that this Thursday, session is gonna be helpful for us. Dude, tomorrow's crazy. Tomorrow, I'm doing six jobs we done interviews in a day, which is the most I've ever done.  
Me: I'm proud of you. That's exciting. It's almost like you're going to, like, an an amusement park.  
Them: You  
Me: You get to ride the it's different roller coaster.  
Them: My issue is that I don't know if I'm gonna actually be able to like, summarize them in between calls because I'm trying to do it a little bit slower to get better at it. Like, I'm trying to train the muscle.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Right now. So it's like, I dude, it's about to go crazy, though. It's gonna be crazy.  
Me: Dude, I I just gotta say, like, I I the only time what you just said I remember experiencing was when I did jobs with Bob Ryan, and Jason.  
Them: Ten  
Me: At 37. For base camp. We had, like, a hell week. Where we did an entire job cycle in a week.  
Them: It's crazy.  
Me: And we cut by Friday. We started on Monday. We finished by Friday. It was insane.  
Them: Yeah. It's nuts.  
Me: Yeah. It's it's real fun.  
Them: Mean, it's literally nuts. This is this is it. I mean, literally,  
Me: This is this is it. I  
Them: it's, like, cool. Like, I'm basically I'm going in. We have our number one competitor, ReciMe. And I just went on responding, and I decided to go full villain. And I go,  
Me: course.  
Them: I go, have you paid for estimating the last month or two months? And now we're gonna gonna talk to people that use it weekly.  
Me: Of course.  
Them: That paid. Yeah.  
Me: How how's everything going? But I know we're overtime by the way, so wanna respect that.  
Them: Yeah. I I got I got a few, and then I'm gonna jump to book more of these  
Me: But  
Them: things.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: But it's it's good Their like, me, Graham, and are essentially still work. Like, I'm still involved for strategy and everything like that. They're grinding Amrit built the entire app on web over the course of the weekend. He's fully leaned into the AI stuff as well. Like, we're deploying on web first from now on, which is great for me. I'm gonna get us the the trademark now. Because we're getting down to the last month or so to to grab it. And then they have this just four step plan. That's gonna that's gonna be great.  
Me: And you're gonna step in and and close the deal when it's time.  
Them: I  
Me: However long it takes.  
Them: did I tell you that or you knew that?  
Me: I'm I'm guessing. I'm I'm asking you.  
Them: That that's yeah. So, basically, the way that I'm thinking about this they have expressed that they wanna build a business and essentially support themselves on dividend. Scale, redeploy capital into the business to grow again, and then, like, scale their compensation to a certain point. That being said, I believe if that strategy is achieved, this company will be able to exit for an o like, if that's what they're pursuing, which they are, it's gonna take a little bit longer But, yeah, we can scale the call, like, 3 to 10,000,000 in ARR. Which is pretty well benchmarked.  
Me: Do you think they're want you to come back and step in and lead?  
Them: At which yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is all expressed.  
Me: I love  
Them: And and listen again, like, if if it's not the case if I can add value in that way, I I won't I won't do it. But I am happy to to be in that position should the time come that I should be. Yeah.  
Me: I love it. I love it. So part of I I won't give away too much for Thursday, like, one of the things that I've learned from you that I'm emphasizing more in preparation is, AORs.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: So it sounds like you still have one, but it's just kind of inactive, possessed right now because it's not a particularly active area of response But eventually, like, valuation, liquidity, and even leadership are going to be domains that they're going to need more support on at some point.  
Them: That's my that's listen again. And if they don't, it's okay. But just knowing the skill set of the team, it seems like they that would be that would be my a big value out of mine.  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: To comment.  
Me: Yep. They know that, which is awesome.  
Them: Right. Right. Listen. I mean, that's the one thing, and and there's a lot that I'm learning and reflecting on and knowing that we could do better. But from a cultural perspective, we built something really special there. Yep.  
Me: There's there's no doubt about that. There's no doubt. I mean, like I like I I mean, again, like, I have a crazy dataset now and amount of perspective because of how many companies I've worked with and helped and seen.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I'm telling you, man, your your you're in a special category.  
Them: I listen. I appreciate it. Because it's like I won't I I won't lie. Like and this is the tough thing where, ultimately, it has to come from my Like, this faith has and belief has to come from myself. It is hard when the market hasn't validated it yet. Right? So it's like, it's hard when it feels like I went out and we did this thing, and it feels like we did a lot of things that felt right. And we didn't quite there there wasn't quite that click. That's hard. But you just gotta trust that the muscle is being skill being trained in that like, just gonna keep learning. Like, this is the dumbest I'll ever be in in my ability to do this stuff.  
Me: Correct.  
Them: Yeah. But I I appreciate that. I'm also yeah. So I'm gonna have more of these investor over the course of the next couple weeks here. We're going big ticket, like, biggest ticket people. Like, you would be on the list for this week. And then, ideally, we get duck through all those and then that invested slightly smaller amounts into the business. I just wanna make sure. The the name of the game for me is integrity. So  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: it's like  
Me: We're good. We don't have to have a meeting at all. We're good.  
Them: Yeah. No. No. No. I I appreciate no. Yeah. You you know, dude. You know you know more than they're gonna know. So  
Me: That's correct.  
Them: yeah, I I just wanna make sure that everyone's in the loop.  
Me: Yep. Well, what do you need that you don't have aside for money? Because we're gonna work on that.  
Them: For for Zess?  
Me: Help for your life for Jake. I know we need money, so let's get that done. I know I'm I'm focused  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: on that. Why I'm trying to move so quickly.  
Them: Yeah. What do I need? Three bottles of water a day.  
Me: Love it.  
Them: Music. I listen to music. That's the hard part too. Right?  
Me: Good WiFi.  
Them: Yeah. Know, the opening the opening to the hard part too?  
Me: Of course.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: Well, dude, look, No. It's well, here's the thing. Like, what's crazy is, like, I'm just excited to, like, have the freedom to tell people that the cab light is on.  
Them: And  
Me: You know what I mean? Like like, like, I'm ready I'm I'm ready to work. And I the people I'm working with, like, as soon as people find out that I'm leaving and I'm working with these specific people, Like like, you got like, it's I can't predict what's gonna happen, but I know it's good.  
Them: Right. Listen. I'm I'm excited. I think that we lit like, if we can I if we can leave this weekend with an under like, by the end of you know? So what kicks off on Thursday, has 80% of its work done by Sunday. By which I mean, like, we feel like we've said a lot. We're gonna be in I I really good shape. Did I lose you again?  
Me: Oh, you didn't, man. I'm just I'm not at a loss of words. I'm just, like, taking time to process. You can't see my face. Like, I'm staring know, at my ceiling my gal ceiling that Joe Suda painted in my office.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: And I'm just like, yeah, like, I'm I'm ready to tell you guys that it's time to ride. Like, didn't  
Them: I  
Me: I didn't realize until last week  
Them: yes.  
Me: like, how  
Them: So I don't know what it was for Liliana. Whatever happened for Liliana was my JSON free text at that dinner table. And it was your David Cohen. Conversation. Like,  
Me: Right. Right. Is The universe is literally, like like, bending itself.  
Them: right. There's before that moment and after that moment. What it's essentially saying is, like, you guys gotta take a shot on goal.  
Me: Yep. Because, like, he because  
Them: Goal.  
Me: Yep. Because, like, he because he's  
Them: Like,  
Me: like like, remember, the first the first signal of this timeline was I bought a new laptop.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: And now the next one that's tangible is I'm shipping my furniture.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: To Chicago. Like, I have very objective investments that are being made that are related to money being spent to make progress. That you can track with the behaviors and in response. To certain actions and activities and movements.  
Them: Yeah. Yep. I mean, like, on a separate it all from this level, like, I am really excited that you're gonna the full brain is going back into the house project.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Like, not to say that it's it's like, it's obviously in continuous motion there, But the fact that you're gonna be able to get all that shit back in there is amazing.  
Me: Yeah, dude. It it's already changing things. Like, me being in this space for the past week, has already changed my own brain chemistry.  
Them: Mhmm. Yeah.  
Me: Space and environment matter so much.  
Them: Yes. Yeah. I no. I mean, I I completely I completely agree.  
Me: So back to what you need.  
Them: I yeah. So we have the one piece I have a feeling that that also operates as if that switch it's like a top line it's the the reason that they use revenue as a as a primary KPI. Because what that means is, like, I wanna we should be actually helping people make progress on the problems that they're trying to solve, and we should be fueling the benefit that we bring to the table. For for people. I I believe that I can actually get a lot of the joy of building by inserting myself and ourselves into really difficult business contexts. And helping others make progress. And, again, a like, we'll know. We'll be able to follow or not that actually is is happening. As a result of doing this. And then the other side of it is just, like, what is our r being the three of r what is our working relationship actually look like at the be like, in this initial What's that second turn of the wheel gonna look like? Because again, if like, I think that that if the top line thing is solved not superficially, but by closing deals, it means that we've solved the other two implicitly.  
Me: Yeah. And by the way, like, I I don't know to what extent I'll pull this off. Like, I'm in pursuit of as close to an equal partnership that I can broker here. Like, I don't I like, I think what I'm trying to overcome is obviously Liliana's, like, learning journey of understand  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: like, what matters when it comes to life progress business and what's fair. But, like, I don't have the same oh, well, you know, like the whole prove yourself type that, like, I don't have that Like, you just designed the deal in a way where we all get what we deserve because of what we do together.  
Them: I don't disagree that it's in it's coming from a place of inexperience for her. Because I feel the same way. Like, I feel very similarly to how you feel. And I think it's more so, like, once we're doing it and once we're behaving as if we're in it and it's gonna be obvious why everyone's  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: in it.  
Me: And I already know that, and you probably  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: already know that, but you might even still have hesitations about Liliana about that, right, with that in mind. Because you haven't worked  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: I'm the only one who has the confidence in both of you to know that when we work together, it's  
Them: So  
Me: about to be insane.  
Them: That that's right. That's right.  
Me: And you me that that's true, which I  
Them: That's right. No. You're you're totally right on that.  
Me: yeah. Yeah. But but this is  
Them: Let's see.  
Me: thing, like, if there's one thing I'm good at, it's like putting brilliant people together. So  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I I see I see what's happening, and, like, I can't wait. For you all to experience what I've already experienced from each of you. Together.  
Them: Yeah. And to be clear, like, I think that I've had a good hunch around that that type of idea too. So it's like, I I I can defer I feel like I'm deferring trust on the on the latter. But, yeah, we'll we'll put it I mean, we'll work through  
Me: We'll we'll iron out a a structure so that it's just objective.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Like that because we're all objective oriented people. Like, we we like facts. Of matters.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So that's great. Like, let's do it. Like,  
Them: And and and to to be clear, I yeah.  
Me: they don't know how to do that.  
Them: Right. Right. And so, like yeah. I do think that this could as long as the prospect like, as long as we're set up the way that we we should be, I think that it's it's good. It's the key the key thing is not papering over the differences at at the beginning. Like, some we don't know the answer to everything, so I think that that's also I'm not gonna touch that area of it with her. Because clearly, we don't have that level of working relationship yet, but it seems like you're working with her on the ambiguity.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: Aversion And that that's just an important area of growth because you cannot do this and and be, like, on train tracks. You know? You're a ship in the ocean. You're not a train on tracks.  
Me: I can't wait.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Seriously. I I I just keep going over to my notes and scribbling down a little more a little more. Oh, yeah, man.  
Me: Anything I can work on  
Them: Well  
Me: before birthday in support of you or anything you want me to think about or just  
Them: I would say two things. Nothing that we haven't spoken about yet, but the first would just be if there's anything that I should be aware of  
Me: from  
Them: from  
Me: Lilian  
Them: Liliana's standpoint that you feel would be helpful for me to know  
Me: Not  
Them: not, like, oh, the sub the the footnote of?  
Me: Okay.  
Them: So, like, fifty fifty was the one that you had shared with me earlier. Like, just understanding so that I'm not triggering her or saying anything that is not gonna be perceived the way that I'm trying to say it.  
Me: So so I have a quick question for you on that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: My confidence in advocating for you has done nothing but go up as the days have gone by.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: And I'm in a position where I I have to be careful not to exercise my power and privilege in the position that I'm in too much.  
Them: Oh oh, dude. Totally just let me go. I just wanna make sure that I'm not offending with anything. Like, I think in that first conversation, I unintentionally positioned things. And maybe it was just necessary to do that to get to here. But I unintentionally position things in a way that were incompatible. So what I was saying, what like, I felt I was saying was not what she was hearing.  
Me: Correct. Yeah. And and and I I think she her concerns were I think, I like Liliana for her contrast to me.  
Them: Mhmm. Yeah. I do too. I I do too, by the way.  
Me: Right? Don't like Greg. Like like,  
Them: I do too.  
Me: she's more skeptical of things. She questions things more.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: She's optimistic about that kind of stuff.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: She she says no first. You know? Like, these are good things to have in the  
Them: They're really good. They're really good.  
Me: contact. But that can also be that can be very shortsighted. Especially when there's a very obvious opportunity screaming at your face.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So and I think it's the reason it's being so precise because in her mind, she didn't fully grasp the grape to watermelon truth. That is upon us.  
Them: Right. And I think that this date David Cohen one also or the the Techstars reality.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Also, like, I didn't fully grasp the great watermelon until honestly, even that call.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Like, you got off you got off the phone with him, and I'm,  
Me: Right. And And  
Them: like, oh, shit. If this is gonna happen, it's gonna happen quickly.  
Me: Yep. And just so you know, Liliana has not read what I sent you.  
Them: Okay. Yeah. That's good to know.  
Me: And I'm planning to share with her. Put, like,  
Them: I I I yeah.  
Me: she doesn't I I can't I don't think I told her about the breastfeeding thing.  
Them: Right.  
Me: So I'm gonna tell her about that.  
Them: I don't I didn't even fully understand that. They were asking judgmentally whether or not she was breastfeeding.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Because if she Because if she was, then she has to take breaks from her desk or something.  
Me: So, Jake, it it it goes it's a it's a very this is a a longer conversation story. But case in point, I had, an 8PM phone call with Shirley, the person I was talking about.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: And which Angie, my other my direct port and there's two people on the call. Right? So one, I have a witness. To her saying this.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: She goes, I'm just gonna keep it really real with you. Because I'm pushing for Liliana to join stay on my team. Like fighting tooth and nail.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: And she goes, is she breastfeeding? And I say, I I I don't know. I I I have no idea. Like, I don't like, I was like, I didn't know how to answer that. Like, I was and she then proceeds to tell me that she has three kids. And that she had to, like, deal with that when she was rearing children. And that Liliana would not be able to accomplish her responsibilities. In light of her context.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: It was insane.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That is illegal.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Also a really shitty thing to do.  
Me: Yeah. But and I told I know I told Liliana something. I didn't I don't know if I gave her the that exact quote. I did communicate to her that there was feedback about her capability to travel from Seattle to California.  
Them: You told me that too. Was that that was the hang up.  
Me: Yeah. And and and I didn't use the specific words because, like, in my mind, I was like, can't prove that she said it. And, you know, whatever. But like now it's like, no, no, no. Like, I know what you said. And I know someone else knows what you said.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: And I realized now when I did my research, like, saying that is not okay.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So  
Them: Shit. Yeah. That's my, but that's my one or that was one one of my things was, just if I if I if there's anything that I'm doing to put her off, like, to let me know  
Me: No. I I I I honestly think that the biggest thing was she was worried about your intentions. Like, she was worried that like, what we're doing could be, like, extracted, taken advantage of, usurped. Like, she just doesn't know you like I know you. And I think  
Them: Right. Right. And I I do again, I I think that there are ways that we can because that's my other thing, actually. Is I I'm a very I'm not that I'm not that I'm either not like, I'm just not that smart like this. Like, I'm a very direct communicator.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: So I don't typically feel comfortable if there's, like, subtext left unsaid.  
Me: Correct.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: And there won't be.  
Them: That's that's the other thing. The  
Me: We can't move forward unless it's all clear.  
Them: And and we and then there will reach a point, I'm sure, honestly, by third again, I very in quick succession, we're gonna be able to do things in parallel. But there is a side of it at this point that's closer to that. Like, again, it just feels like all of us are just going in in good faith, so we're down to do stuff with this present state is unsustainable. You know, like, where we we would just kind of like  
Me: We're my goal is after this week, we're all on the same page and we're all just  
Them: trust Yeah.  
Me: together.  
Them: Right. That that's that's my that that's totally mine as well. I think it's like absolutely achievable. And and then my thing is, like, again, I I already told you about this, like, Algerian revolutionary war, civil war thing where it's like, you had your Kabils and your Arabs, and they were just like, we're not gonna talk about the number one thing that will divide us until after we fight the war.  
Me: Well,  
Them: And it's like that it just kills you.  
Me: Bro. So here's the two things. One, like, you should know  
Them: It ultimately they  
Me: I pushed back on Liliana again today because last week when we had a little debrief when she was upset about the choice I made to send that email, What I asked her was, hey. Like,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: alright. So we're gonna meet next week before we meet with Jake to get on the same page about our current understanding of these questions that you know, he asked you questions about that you didn't have answers to. So we're gonna get on the same page, right, about where the story so far. And in light of that, we also need to probably go into the conversation with Jake with some version of a founder's agreement that you and I have already, like, understood between each other. We haven't had one. And I asked her. I said, well, when we do that, like, what do you want? Do you want to come up with you like a version of what you want and then I could present a version of mine? Or you like to do it? And she goes that's a really good question. I'll think about it. And that was on what was that? Thursday? Or Wednesday? Yeah. Whenever. And today, I got a message from her. She says, okay, I thought about it and I think you should share one with me, and then we'll talk about it. And I  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: responded and I said, look, I anticipated this response. It's a little last minute given that we have to talk tomorrow. I think it's only fair that you do the same work. And we'll come to the table together. And the reason I'm doing that is because it's another coaching moment for her.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Because I know her patterns. I expected her to do that. And I'm gonna hold her to task because I think she's gonna realize like, you gotta show up.  
Them: Right. It feels like a latent anxiety of hers  
Me: Yep.  
Them: is also be be like, getting it right, quote, unquote,  
Me: Yep.  
Them: And so it's like, if I don't like, to you, it's okay to just show up as long as you've thought about these questions. Like, nobody's getting it right. No one's getting it wrong. There are no like, don't get points for the numb this amount that your of your thing that's incorporated. You know?  
Me: Yep. Exactly. So there were two other responses that I'm going to coach her to success to be better within the future in my opinion with respect to that situation. One response would be, okay, happy to do it. Let's meet each other on the same page and bring something to the table from our perspectives. Or I actually have questions for you about what that would mean.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Expectations you would have. For what we're bringing to the table together. Right? So either way, clarify it or commit. But not  
Them: Right.  
Me: delegate. This is too important because of what she expressed  
Them: It's  
Me: concerning about last week. It's like, wait. You're gonna delegate this  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: agreement to me again after we just  
Them: Right.  
Me: did that? No. You like,  
Them: Like, you don't feel that you're being torn apart by the fact like, you're you're not virtually not able to commit to this thing because of your uncertainty here. So yeah.  
Me: So anyway, I'm I'm helping I'm coaching her to success in that way and I'm excited to learn. As well because I'm sure there's things that I haven't thought about that she's gonna help me realize or think about.  
Them: Oh, Oh, yeah. For sure. And and this isn't even the code. Like, when you say that, it's not even the that it's not that three step thing. What it is is just like something that most people, I guess, don't really deal with in their jobs. Most people are told what to do and then execute.  
Me: Yeah. Coaching success is just a way of life.  
Them: I can say, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: I coach myself to success and everyone around me wherever I can, always.  
Them: Right. I've only heard that used by you when you're talking  
Me: Objects of change of role,  
Them: right. Right.  
Me: know, kind of thing.  
Them: Right. Which isn't yeah. I I like it more in the first way that you're saying it here, obviously. But, yeah, I I think it makes sense for you guys to to ultimately align,  
Me: I'm just trusting my intuition to to to dream and to  
Them: And I yeah. I  
Me: be creative and to have joy. Like,  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: I I I'm sure you were having a blast with Zest. But if you're gonna be a part of this in in the significant way that I'm I'm hoping we find a way to make happen,  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: I want this to feel even better.  
Them: I there's a way that it does Like, again, my wildest dream is just that we're closing a bunch of meaningful contracts for awesome companies that understand what we do. Like, that's, like, in a stupidly stupid English sentence. If we can do that, that's amazing.  
Me: Well, I mean, but there's also a version of work, Jake, that doesn't feel like work. It literally just feels like you're doing what you want to do every day. And it just so happens that you're you know,  
Them: I I've had moments of that. Right? It's definitely not been all of what I did, but I definitely had moments of that with  
Me: Yeah. Like, they you were able to run Zest but never have to raise a dime of venture capital.  
Them: the prior Mhmm.  
Me: That's that's what I'm trying to say, basically.  
Them: Yeah. And, dude, that would literally that it'll literally be a dream.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. It'd be a dream.  
Me: Yeah. That that's that's what we're that's what gearing up for.  
Them: Be a hell of a story, wouldn't it?  
Me: It it's about to be. You just gotta write it.  
Them: Sick.  
Me: Alright, man. Well, I'm Alright, man. Well, I'm on it.  
Them: Awesome. Alright. I will I'm gonna talk to you soon.  
Me: Anytime, bro.  
Them: Sweet. Alright.  
Me: Alright. See you.  
Them: Peace, Doug. Bye.
