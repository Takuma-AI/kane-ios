Innovator’s Dojo
Let’s team up to cultivate
builders who care
The market is
noisier than ever
We see it daily: Founders chase trends and
ship products without understanding the why.
Faster AI shipping only strengthens this supply-
side temptation.
So much of the market is throwing spaghetti at
the wall, building stuff nobody actually needs.
The world needs
better builders
There is a window of opportunity to help
the new wave of high growth companies
use technology thoughtfully, and build
sustainable value.
We need builders focused on one thing:
helping customers make real progress.
Starting from
the source
Working with you, we will help
builders figure out what customers
actually want.
The goal is to deliver immediate
client value while honing our craft.
The “Dojo”approach
to building mastery
Like martial arts, innovation isn’t magic or guesswork
— it’s a craft requiring care and discipline.
We want to partner with you to structure this craft
into clear levels of mastery.
This will set the foundation for developing our
company’s product talent and culture.
Immortalizing the
discipline through
product innovation
Consulting is how we hone the craft and
build the foundation.
The long game is to scale these principles
with product innovation.
Together, we can empower multiple
generations of thoughtful builders.
We’re asking for your
collaboration & support
Your work is the direct inspiration for this venture.
We seek your guidance during projects and
interviews.
Access to your network for client referrals is also
crucial for early traction.
Let’s make it
fair and simple
We propose a fair revenue share based on
project origin.
For example, work referred by Rewired can be
60/40 in the early days, while work we find
ourselves can be split in reverse.
With your guidance and support, we confidently
aim for $500k revenue in year one.
Bottom Line
This is a chance to do meaningful work,
build a real business based on proven
principles, make good money, and extend
the impact of the ideas we all believe in.
It's a win-win.
