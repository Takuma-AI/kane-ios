 
Me: Yes Okay. Yeah. So I think it's coming from a place of Neil and Liliana are the business partners and sole owners of this company, and you guys are the definitive founders, and no one else is a part of the business yet. And, therefore, it needs a lot more. It's a lot more of a sort of careful and deliberate process to attempt to bring in a third party And there's this kind of, like, higher horse of you and Liliana having to judge Jake. When I think part of the initial intent of the exercise is for the three of you to almost be healthily competitive. Because that draws out the best in you. And I think Liliana didn't appreciate that competition. Which Yeah. She doesn't understand the the value of that competition. One part of the thing is that what Jake would bring in is is a contrast or a or a bar. If if Jake is able to be a lot more thoughtful with how to run this business and even, like, the two of you, then there's no reason why he shouldn't be part of it. We're also getting free ideas from him. Yeah. You know, we're getting free contributions. We don't owe him anything. We don't have to commit to anything. And I don't even think we're putting anything at risk by having him as a part of the conversation at I think if anything, we're gonna learn a lot by I don't consider Jake a third party. I consider him someone who's been helping us from day one. Yeah. Think through this, work through this, give us advice, engage us, participate in conversations, nudge Bob along to reinforce these messages and ideas. I think it's a little dismissive and incomplete and incorrect. To treat Jake like some outsider who, you know, were considering either as an intern or, somebody who needs to present work to us to prove himself I I I think that's really doing a disservice to his contributions to date both for us professionally at Techstars, how he's helped us grow and all of the support he and the advice he's given us to be better about how we've even gone about conducting the business Exactly. For jobs to be done itself. So think that there's I'm not hearing enough of a actual respectful deference towards contributions that he both has made and has the potential to contribute going forward. Yeah. So there is a disconnect there. But my way of handling it because the notion of they're not needing to be a CEO right now, I think, is incorrect. Mhmm. And wrong. And the reason I feel that way is because it's very clear that you don't agree with the decision I made but I had every right to do it. And if you thought that that was a betrayal of trust, I'm sorry. But we need this is why we need agreements and founders agreements and things like that because we haven't established the right communication protocol and expectation on these types of decisions because as I was generating my idea around this, I thought this was actually a valuable contribution that could help the business succeed. And you clearly seem to not agree with that and have a very negative visceral reaction to what I did. So this is a really helpful thing for us to work through together. This is one of our first tests. Yeah. Right? As as team members and cofounders. Right? Because I trust you. But I will challenge you. And it sounds like what you're saying is after me doing this, you don't trust me. And I'm sorry you feel that way, but it's it's a little I think it's there's a there's a huge disconnect if something like this could so deeply betray your trust. Yeah. And rather than having curiosity before judging what I did and why I did it, I think there might be more questions to ask of me before you rush to the conclusions that you have. Yeah. There's also the whole Bob Nesta connection. Like, at this point, I'm like You wanna hit record again? I mean, it's been Recording. It's still recording now? Yeah. Okay. At this point, it's like I feel like there's a disconnect and not like just because you guys incorporated among the two of you and you guys have started one contract together. It's early enough where Jake is very much legitimately in the running to to be a cofounder. I mean, I think we should just seriously consider it, I don't think it's a given. And I think I made it really clear in my message that there is no guarantee whatsoever he's gonna be involved at all. Yeah. Like like, I I make that pretty clear. Like, the no the notion of equity again is, what are we talking about? Like, that that's not even what this is about. No. And if anything, I think we're getting free ideas from him on how we could think about structuring the business given his different perspective and experience. Yeah. And we're getting someone involved who Bob Messda himself has directly endorsed. Yeah. That's something we're working on for Liliana. That's something we objectively have for Neil and Jake. Yeah. So if anything, one of the biggest criterias for our excitement and and validation of being successful as a company is inextricably linking ourselves to the Rewire Group and Bob Messta. Yeah. And I think the likelihood of that happening dramatically increases with some version of Jake's commitment or involvement, which is what I've been aiming for, which I thought would be in her best interest. Yeah. Like, it's not guaranteed, but it's very much should be in conversation. And the fact that that isn't clear or or Mhmm. Isn't obvious to her is telling. Well yeah. And and I don't know. Let's let's figure it out. I I wanna know what we can come up with based on everything we've said so far. Yeah. I don't think he's been brought into the business in a significant way to that to that end. But No. Like, this is this is an exercise of what are you talking about. Like, you you you conversations with people, with hires, which sound very real to the very last moment fall apart all the time. And and by the way, we need to treat Jake at the level that he would even consider being involved in. Yeah. So the the fact that I, you know, found out from him that the intern option was voted I think was already a breach of of trust between us because I asked you not to do that. Yeah. Right? So if you wanna talk about trust, Yeah. Like, here we go. Like, that's something that we'd already actively talked about because I'm trying to do what's in our best interest. And when things like that happen and we treat people like they're lesser than, I think that's a huge mistake and it already puts the business at risk. Yeah. That is a very clear expectation that I had set. Yeah. That was not followed. Yeah. That's I want that in there. Yeah. Like, because there's some there's a there's a level of respect that you have for Jake that Liliana clearly doesn't. And and there should be a reason we should talk about that. I've made it clear why. I've also acknowledged my concerns and hesitations. Yeah. I think I've been very transparent and direct about those choices and I'm bringing a lot of experience to the table for why I wrote the message the way I did. Yeah. I stand by it. Yeah. I've just included a new file, Liliana pushback. Which I'm gonna link the path to here and you have access to. That includes how Neil has separately communicated Wait. It wasn't. Can't wait for this problem to be over. I just included this new file called Liliana pushback. That outlines how Neil communicated to Liliana about the Liliana, Jake, prompt that was sent out yesterday and then Liliana's response, which included a lot of hesitation and accusations of a breach of trust, And then I also include Anil's response and thought process. And so I want your help to first understand, like, deeply understand where this is coming from and what has happened here. And two, write a response in Neil's voice as outlined in the response and thought process. Also include the from the ego at the door. Thing from Jake. I can basically say, like, one thing I learned from him, for example, I've also separately included another reference, ego at the door, which is a doc from Zest, Jake's company. Which is Jake's company. Here that I've I'm linking to past to and alongside all of the other Zest reference documents. This is especially relevant as a point of reference. And serves as an example of something that we're learning from Jake. And want you to incorporate some of the messages or some of the messaging and language here because it's very relevant for what we're trying to say. This is so good. What I wrote? What we wrote? Yeah. What the what it wrote? I mean, it's what you said. I think Leon's offended by each of us has brought enough to the table to earn consideration that responsibility. But, like, It's true. It's true. I mean, that's how I feel. Yeah. And I think it's true. Like, the only reason Jake hasn't been Like, the only reason Jake hasn't been involved yet is because he was still running Zest. And he was very much a part of the conversation to whatever extent and beyond it would have made sense for him to do it while doing Zest. Mhmm. And remember how when you first explained what you were up to to him and he was so enthusiastic about getting involved and you're like, please go on your company Mhmm. No. It did not fuck up the process. Shut up. No. Hell, no. Please anchor more on the point of view and language that was used in Neil's response and thought process. Rather than what Liliana expressed. Because we're not trying to be overly apologetic here, and this is way too apologetic. I think reread what Neil's thought process was. There was no process. There was no agreed upon protocol here. That's in part why we need to do this work, because we don't have an understanding there. And then sometime between now and tomorrow, you need to set up your autoresponders. Yes. And I mean, I do it until Monday. Sure. Yeah. Have you Have you inbox zero? No. I need to do that as well. If I can do that while you're I I can do that without you. Okay. Is there anything that actually needs be done on Sierra's part? Not Sierra doesn't have to do it, but I need Angie to respond to me today. No. What I mean is there was work that you took off Sierra's plate. Oh, I'm in control of it. Okay. It's like yes, but, like, nothing Nice to have. Yeah. Exactly. I'm in con like, I she's doing all she had on her plate was what I asked her to do. Yeah. What did it say? I think we should refine this, but I also think that you can respond in a voice message. Exactly. Yeah. We're gonna respond in a voice message instead of a written long response like this. So can you distill this into like, the three to four key points that need to be made? You can do supporting bullets for reference, but the main points should be crystal clear. I think you start Don't think you start with the pre chest or chest. Thing. I think you should start with, we don't owe him anything. Like, that We, like, we don't owe him anything. Getting his strategic thinking to solve a fundamental problem that we have right now. I think we should start from the situation proves we need the CEO because that's, like, the point that I feel is less contentious, like, as in she's saying that she doesn't think we need a CEO first and foremost that it's a fundamental disagreement. And then and then it's talking about Jake isn't a random third party and the botters me that you know, we're almost talking about him like some lesser contributor who needs to, like, I think this should be a base camp message. Okay. I'm gonna send a message here and say, hey. I sent you a message. Here in base camp because I wanted to think through my thoughts and, like, refine to make sure they're clear. Okay. So we aren't doing a voice message anymore. We are making it a message. Written message. But that being said, even if it's a big written message, it should be done in, like, clear thought process. Like like, let's say, like, four points. Right? So we start with a we start with this situation itself proves we need a CEO. Second, Jake isn't some random third party. Like, we should have respect for him, and we need to make for this to work out, it needs to be work that's worth whatever. Like, the language that Neil already used before. And then if you wanna talk about trust, you know, like, it's a two way street or two and then lastly, you judge instead of asking why. Actually, I think you judge instead of asking why comes before you know, like, let's talk about trust you broke it first. So with that new order, can you rewrite news response to Liliana not as this long letter but as sort of like these four crystal clear. Points. And let's also open and close with enthusiasm and excitement about the partnership the commitment to the business, and the fact that there's no one else in the world that I'd rather be in league with and in partnership with than her. Yep. Like, I'm in. And I want to reinforce that at the beginning and at the end to let her know, like, this is all coming from a place of love, care, support, deep commitment, willing to put everything on the line, and I've demonstrated that to every action and behavior I've had to date. As we've worked together. Yeah. So this is not what she's saying this is. And, like, it's more, like, the decisions that were made here were more coming from your years of experience and knowing what a company like this, what your ambitions actually need in terms of, like, leadership and, like, organization and, like, stuff like that. Yeah. It would be crazy for this moment and this one thing to topple trust in this way. The way she's talking is as if there were already reasons not to believe or trust me. You know? You're not assuming good intent. As we've always said is important. Yeah. So weave that into the points. The way I'm imagining this, it's like a really, like, concise but compelling like, four sections, one for each point. Each point has a very, like, crisp crisp header type of thing. So drafts that in in that vein. Moozy. Hi. How are you feeling? Good. This feels good. This is really good. I'm so glad we're like, I'm glad I shipped it because it's like, oh, fuck. But, like, now she she was gonna slow down progress she's like, no. Let's do it this way. No. Let's do it. And now it's like, I I did something that was too That's the point. And now it forced all of this to happen. Yeah. Which is great. Yeah. So I'm winning. But that but that's the point. Like, if you if, like, it's a problem that if you had the fact that you felt that and I agree that if you had asked for her feedback and then it went back and forth on this would not have gotten here. We would not have gotten here and would have taken forever, and Jake would have very well might've Door would've closed. Yeah. Jake didn't introduce them to the Jasuda methodology as much as he's served as the exhibit a of a founder that has actually implemented it in real life as an And I, Neil, met Jake and Liana the same year. They were both my students in my class. So I've seen both of them evolve over the past six nearly seven years and take on a lot of my own thinking and ideas and ideology and we've grown together, and they've taught me a ton. Both of them. Yeah. So this is a really special opportunity situation and relationship between two people who I care more about than anyone. And by the way, out of the 322 founders that I've invested in across 160 companies with your help, Jake is number one at the top of that pile of the founder that I would trust to actually build something great with. Alongside you. So I wanna take this as seriously as it deserves to be taken. And I also want to incorporate the fact that there's insights from the fifth discipline, is a book I recommended Liliana read back when she was struggling through being regional accelerator leading lead for San Francisco. I'm not sure whether she ended up reading it or not. But the ideas that are in there are relevant for this very moment. And I wanna bring that back up. And readdress that. So super important as something to refer to and that's also something that I've had the pleasure of engaging deeply with Jake about. So that's just one example of many where we have opportunities to bring our brains together. Yep. So and, like, just also more practically, like, you and Liliana have collectively or worked together on investing in the growth of so many so many founders that you listed. And Jake has been, like, the primary example of the founder who has applied jobs to be done. The real world as an operator. Not just theoretically in a classroom. Correct. Connect us to Bob Messer. But that being said, he was the one founder or one of the very, very few founders who through us established, like, a deep connection with Bottmesta independently And Bob trusts and believes in him. More than basically more than any other founder. Correct. We've worked with. First, I want to be absolutely clear. There's no else in the world I'd rather be building this with than you. Every action I've taken, every wrist I've shouldered, every hour I've invested is because of what we're creating together. That's my starting point for everything. This is about three people I care about more than anyone. You, Jake, and the opportunity for us to build something extraordinary together. Three people. That's weird. It's a weird way to say it. Yeah. It's like me. You, Jake, and me. I care about me. That's where I thought I was going. I was like, oh, okay. You know me. You know me. I think he needs to talk out loud. About what resonates and what doesn't. I wanna read it. I think you've been able to Okay. Tell me about this girl. So for this part, this is about three people I care about more than anyone, you, Jake, and the for us to build something extraordinary together. This is about three things I care about more than any thing professionally. You the opportunity for us to build something extraordinary together, and the chance to potentially bring in somebody else who could help us make it even more extraordinary. The exploration of that, is interesting enough. Take it seriously. So my years building companies have taught me that leadership structure matters from day one, not in five years, not when we attend employees day one. Someone needs to make the call when partners agree or disagree or we'll be stuck in endless debates of opportunity best by. On this paragraph, the other thing I would include here in this section is that she herself questioned the necessity of a founder's agreement. When I suggested it, and I have literally necessitated this from every application cycle and process we've with the founders we've invested into Techstars over six years. So it gave me pause to hear her even question the efficacy or the necessity of a founder's agreement. In that very moment. Given my history, given my story, and given my background with companies that I've started and had to struggle through really difficult times because we did not have one. So that already gave me a lens as to an opportunity for growth on her end. I think this needs to I think this needs to address, like, the What is this? Section two. So Jake deserves our respect, not our suspicion. This section needs to address the shared concerns that both of you have had about Jake's incentives and values. But acknowledge that not as a it's not those aren't reasons for us to not respect him, Those are reasons why this may or may not work out. Correct. But if it were to work out at all, it needs to come from a place of respect. Yes. Like, those are two different vectors. Like, what are his values and incentives are aligned is about whether he is involved or not. The extent to which he's he's involved and how he can add the most value. Like, he's like, how how that is structured is a different story. And when we're discussing that, it needs to come from a place of respect and acknowledgment of everything he's contributed in he's been here since day one, and he brings a lot of recent operating expertise or experience that is a lot bring on the table and is absolutely necessary and critical for the growth and success of this venture. Or this company. This can't like, this is not something to be necessarily to be put explicitly in a message, but Jake has a lot fresher experience around actually operating a business compared to, like, Liliana. Sure. Should we also contextualize it with the email I sent? What email are you The the email I sent that caused this. It's you. It's incorporated into it? It's referenced? I'm gonna make sure it is. It should be because it's the same thread. But Just verify. Yeah. That what's being proposed there is being weaved back into this. Because I want to be specific and tactical about why I think we should still do it. Can we get a little bit more specific and tactical in our reference to the original prompt that was sent to Liliana and Jake? Mhmm. Mhmm. Yeah. She ain't ready for what progress management can do in response to things like this. That's cool. It feels like when we were sussing out the leak ities between Mariana and Joe. It's like, oh, actually, no. The Neil's case, high. Strong.
