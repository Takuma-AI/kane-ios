There's a version of that that needs to be navigated with all the context already, but also with my sentiment. My own sentiment is as follows. I believe that the three of us working together and all equally excited and motivated to build the business together is the best possible way for this business to be successful. So I'm starting with that intent and premise even though I know there needs to be some careful management between the relationships that I have between Jake and myself. Then myself and Lilliana. Because there's deep trust between me with those two parties separately. But the three of us together have still a long way to go to make sure that the three of us are in deep alignment and and have trust with one another. So given that, there is a parallel narrative that could exist that I want to learn from and derive a case study around, which is dynamic between Jason Fried, David The agreement between the three of them did not translate to Ryan Singer having any significant ownership or equity in the business, which ended up leaving him somewhat disgruntled. And departing that business in unfortunate, you know, ways and terms ultimately. That is what I want to design against. Even though I do see the relationship dynamic between the three of us, being you know, potentially similar. Given that the three of us might be endeavoring into business with one another. So given that there's a interesting parallel of comparison between those three individuals and the business that they built, together, and the three of us and how we're exploring getting into business together. I have to weigh the concerns of Lilliana with respect to Jake's commitment. Capacity, and value alignment with she and I going into business together. Along with Jake's concerns about Lilliana's contributions and potential effort associated with how she will be involved in the business. So I stand in a place of privilege as the broker between these two and as somebody who's more experienced, more senior, and who has done more arguably business and professionally than the two of them combined to date. But that is less important to me than coming up with a very thoughtful, creative, nuanced, and highly customized agreement that is in plain English meaning not required to involve lawyers, but still very artful in the spirit of both our company, Shokana, as well as in the spirit of both fairness and inputs and effort leading to outputs and profits. I want people to earn their keep even if there's an ownership structure that is fairly standard, meaning Lilliana and I are currently fifty fifty partners, I'm very much open to incorporating Jake into an ownership model there because frankly, we're not looking to sell the business. We're not looking to flip the business, and we're not looking to raise capital for the business. So because of that, the notion of equity stake in the business is less important. Than the notion of profit share. So I think that's a far more important thing to emphasize and add value and associate it with the economic returns and model on. So for example, I can own a majority of this business but Lilliana and Jake could receive more of the profits depending on how we structure the model and the design. And depending on how much effort I'm able to put into the business relative to the two of them. So case in point, just getting super practical, in the next year, presumably, if Neil maintains his employment, me, at Techstars as managing director in San Francisco, then I will be paid a salary. That salary is at $220,000 a year. Given that $220,000 salary, I am only allowed by the company to earn 30% of that amount of my job. So there's literally only 30% of 220 k that I am allowed to earn. So therefore, I'm most interested in structuring an economic model so that the returns of our efforts in the business are primarily directed to Lilliana, to the business's needs, and to Jake, potentially if we get Jake involved. That will have to change over time, especially if I would like to go full time into the business. And there needs to be a model design so that that could happen at a moment's notice. If Neil becomes full time, there becomes a new load balancing of this economic model and profit share structure. Mhmm. I also wanna call into question the pathway to earning ownership and equity in the business. Even though I don't think it'd mean much, means much, it could be a reflection representation of profit sharing. So there is a way to think about that for all the future employees that could be derived from base camp. People who get involved in Shokana. But for the owners of the business, of which currently it's Nilna Liana, there's a nonzero chance that we'd be open to the conversation of exploring that with Jake as well. Okay. Last part of what I wanted to say before we generate some sort of idea to have a discussion and back and forth and brainstorm about this. Is who runs this business? Who makes the decisions? Who leads the effort? Who is the owner who is the CEO, who is the ultimate shock caller and decision maker? That could rotate, that could change, that could be declared right now. We don't know. Jake's recommendation to me on the phone earlier was to come up with three different ideas for them to play My three ideas that I came up with in that conversation was essentially each one of us being the CEO of this business. There's three different versions of this business being run. If Jake's the CEO, what does it look like If Neil's the CEO, what does it look like? And if Lilliana's the CEO, what does it look like? And what is our respective commitment to do so? Those models could be determined by each person. Because the CEO should own and declare what they think it should be. And make that call. This is the first job of the CEO. Is to design this foundational model for the organization itself. So what I can do is I hope that Lilliana or Jake want to be CEO. So I'll step in and say, if I'm CEO, this is how I'm doing it. And my other recommendation for the other two models is that Lilliana's CEO or Jake's the CEO, and you guys come up with what you think the fair model because here's mine. That's how I would do it. Mhmm. That's all. Do you wanna talk about what yours would be? What we're doing right now. But the the all of this. Like, this whatever this is, what we're doing right now is it. So I have to decide whether I give them that first or whether I say, hey. I came up with my version of CEO. Want each of you to come up with your version of the CEO if that's what you want. If that isn't what you want, let me know and then trust me to present something to you. What's your instinct? My instinct on what? On what are you would show them what you think first? Or let them do first? No. My instinct is let them do first. Who's the CEO? Because I think Lilliana's gonna learn how Jake shows up to questions like that. And then Lilliana can decide if she wants to show up to questions like that. So we don't even need to do anything right now because you were just saying No. I wanna come up with my version of because I wanna be able to come up with the right like, I wanna come up with the right thing to ask them knowing that I already have mine. Okay. Great. There's no question that Jason's the CEO. You know? Okay. Here's some thought that Neil expressed around how he wants to approach especially in response to and in light of the conversation that he just had with Jake. Take this in and incorporate some of the new nuance that are expressed here in the read me. And then we're gonna move on to ideating and chiseling out what Neil's version of how this would be flushed out if he were CEO. How that would be. Attempting. It's a stay up, not a start up. I meant to say that. I put the entire 37 signals employee handbook Babble version. Like, I think the delicate balance of like, why work ethic is even a con concern and why input output is such a delicate thing here. Is worthy of fleshing out or talking to. Let's see what he comes up with. And have access to especially referencing the more nuanced conversations and the existing conversations folder. Can you try drafting the first version? Of this how this would work if Neil were CEO? Two things. One is a message explaining the prompt to Lilliana and Jake about what I want them to try to do before it gets before each of us share our version of it. As a leader, And then also work on my version of it. Yeah. And the the reason why we would have Neil's version ready while only posting the prompts to the other two. Is both that that serves as a good foundational baseline and also that the prompt itself needs to be thoughtful and informed by like, one at least one try. In doing it on this end. So those two things is what we want to work with you on now. Let's see how it does. What how is how is input typically measured in an agreement like this? Like, how hard someone works? Jake shared the stuff on that. Yeah. Like, what he shared is is is worthy of reviewing. Check Ready? Yeah. Where is it? You want me to read this? Oh, this is the I don't need to read it. Sorry. You wanna read your model first? Sure. Growth fund. You could do the almost like the the class peer review thing where you score each other. Mhmm. Keep going. Cool. Okay. This is a good start. I think I can dig in this way more. Not tonight. I think what's more important is the message. You can think out loud because I have granola running. QR. Keep going. Can't wait to go to the bar. Why? That's Okay. I think this needs to storytell a bit. So I need to basically speak from my experiences and my observations in my life. So Jake got a taste of this as CEO of and founder of Zest. But I've been CEO one, two, three times arguably four, but three I would say three objectively. And It's not It's not something that I would ever consider doing lightly. I wanna be on a team, and I wanna build something great. And I know this gonna be something great that gets built as a team. But I do think that we need a decision maker. I think we need a single like, like, what do you call it? Stop gap. We need somebody who's committed. To bearing the full brunt of accountability for this business' success. The person I've admired the most is Jason. Fried, probably a CEO. I would see people like Steve Jobs, as well who have studied closely as CEO and leader and owner of businesses. And, I think we need to decide who we're gonna trust to do that. And I think it could be Lilliana. I think it could be me. I think there's even a case for someone like Jake who's new to the party. To a business that Lilliana and I have founded together. It been running for that long. Hasn't been running for long enough for us to know who would be best, and I would be happy to equally consider all three of us for that opportunity. But, I don't think that we should tiptoe into it or is Neil and Liana thinking about how Jake gets involved? I think each of us have brought enough to the table where we all have a chance at actually earning that position and responsibility. When it comes to work done so far, obviously, Lilliana and I put in relatively disproportionate effort compared to Jake, but it's not about effort up till now. It's about what this can become in the future. And I have the position of the three of us together generates far more value and than if it's only two of us. Or one of us. Or only part of one of us or a few of us. So given that, I'm gonna draw a line in the sand and say that you know, just give a giving up one piece of my story If I were CEO, I think I would find a way to keep both of you meaningfully involved and be compelled to be all in on this and make sure that beat both of you are well taken care of financially and otherwise so that you're duly motivated to focus on this and almost nothing but this. So that can be included in the message. I think my experience over the years of which they're both very familiar with. Comes into the message as well. I've learned a lot of hard lessons in dealing with people and cofounders and relationships and have gone through lots of break ups and nasty experiences. I've had to fire cofounders before. I've seen things not work out. I've spent years building businesses that have made millions of dollars. Only to have my cofounder me feel like they aren't even pulling pulling their weight. So I I know the feeling of when this goes wrong, so I'm committed to making sure that whoever has bestowed that responsibility understands the deep of the role. It's not just something exciting that gets you the most money. Because I'm not even planning on designing a model where the CEO gets paid the most. That's not how I would want this business to run. It is a functional functionally and fundamentally important aspect of this business getting run. That we need to come to an agreement on and understand who is doing what and how. So rather than me giving you all the answer and proposal for us to negotiate around, I think each of us need to basically put ourselves up and say, if I were CEO, this is how I would want it to work. And with our powers combined, we can come up with the best version of an answer either combining the three or choosing one of the three or chiseling one of the three or chiseling all three. To a point where we all feel really excited about the role each of us can play. And by the way, whoever the CEO is, and as of right now, the way that that gets decided would be exclusively between Lilliana and I. She and I have built the business and own the business currently. But I'm very open and flexible to a degree of involvement from Jake to the extent that Lilliana would agree and deem appropriate and that Jake would be compelled by. So given all of those things, I think we have a lot of really interesting approaches that we could take to do this right. And we can get help, outside help even if we want to. I don't know if we need it, but I'm I'm also open to that. So that's my prompt. I want to see you all. Each of you all are leaders. This is your moment. This is your time to shine and show we can show each other who we are. What we're committed to, and how we think. At an ultimate level. And I think a week is enough time for us to figure that out between each other.
