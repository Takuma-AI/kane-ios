The Philosophy
The Struggle Within The Struggle
Our work helps companies find the struggles that drive their customers' decisions. Your work is to find companies struggling to understand those customer struggles. Same philosophy. Different application.

We don't chase wants. We listen for struggle. Our method:
Listen for the hire. 10-12 conversations with people who switched. Friendly surface, forensic underneath.
Map the forces. Diagram what pushed forward, held back, made them move.
Apply the insight. No decks. Sharp sessions that cut into roadmap, pricing, copy.
Your role: Find companies struggling to find their customers' struggles.

The Work
Scout deeply. Find people who already grasp Jobs to Be Done, however limited their understanding. Not just founders. Look for design leaders struggling with product-market fit, product managers talking about unmet user needs, anyone posting about Jobs to Be Done on LinkedIn, companies iterating but missing the mark. The tell: They know something's off but can't diagnose it.

Qualify thoughtfully. This isn't about market size or funding stage. It's situational, nuanced qualification, qualification on steroids. Why them? Why now? Why us?

Leverage our names. Use Neal and Lilliana's credibility to open doors. Set us up to send targeted messages. You get it to the point of conversation. We take it from there.

Document everything. Weekly reports tracking all outreach and qualification reasoning. Document new selling insights and best practices discovered. Share patterns you're seeing. Collaborate on refining copy and outreach strategies. Utilize AI to the fullest extent.
