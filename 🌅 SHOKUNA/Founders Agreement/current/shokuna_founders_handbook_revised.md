# Shokuna Founder's Handbook: Operating Manual for a Calm JTBD Company

## 1. Vision & Mission: What Shokuna Does

### Our Purpose
Shokuna exists to help companies deeply understand their customers through Jobs-to-be-Done methodology. We believe that surface-level user research misses the real reasons people buy products and services. Through rigorous JTBD practice, we uncover the progress people are trying to make in their lives - the real job they're hiring products to do.

### The Three Levels of Our Work
1. **Demand Discovery**: Excel at uncovering why people buy - the core consulting work
2. **The Dojo**: Teaching the world JTBD methodology through workshops and training
3. **Living the Method**: Eventually building our own products to push JTBD boundaries

We'll never be the best at this unless we're pushing the boundaries ourselves by doing real things.

### What We Do Today
- **JTBD Research**: Conduct deep customer interviews to uncover underlying motivations
- **Synthesis & Insight Development**: Transform raw interviews into actionable insights
- **Implementation Support**: Help clients apply insights to product and business decisions
- **Capability Building**: Train client teams in JTBD methodology

### How We're Different
- **AI-Amplified**: We operate at the systems level, leveraging AI to do more with less
- **Practitioner-Led**: Every team member masters JTBD methodology
- **Calm Philosophy**: Building work that doesn't feel like work
- **Joy in Service**: We only serve clients we believe in, who are building something meaningful

### The Future We're Building
A company where we:
- Close meaningful contracts with companies that truly understand JTBD value
- Build something great without ever raising venture capital
- Wake up excited to work every day
- Bring brilliant people together to create collective magic

## 2. Founding Agreement

This section constitutes the binding agreement between founders and must be signed.

### Founding Principles
1. **Mission First**: We exist to help customers understand their customers
2. **Contribution Drives Compensation**: Profit sharing reflects actual value created
3. **No Outside Investment**: We stay independent to maintain our values
4. **Stay Small, Impact Big**: Quality over quantity in everything
5. **Document Everything**: Transparency and knowledge capture are non-negotiable

### Current Ownership Structure
- **Legal Entity**: LLC
- **Ownership Split**: Neal Sáles-Griffin (50%), Lilliana Robinson (50%)
- **Decision Rights**: As detailed in Section 3 (Contributor Levels)
- **Profit Distribution**: Quarterly, based on contribution scoring (Section 5)

### Financial Framework

**The Insurance System**
Instead of guaranteed salaries, we offer an insurance system for qualified contributors:
- Contributors can request annual "insurance" (like a salary)
- This insurance is actually a zero-interest loan from the company
- To qualify: Must have contributed 75% of requested amount in prior year
- If actual contribution < insurance taken, the difference is owed back
- Repayment happens through future profit share adjustments

**Example**: 
- Year 1: Contribute $150k value → Can request up to $200k insurance for Year 2
- Year 2: Take $200k insurance but only contribute $180k → Owe company $20k
- Year 3: Contribute $250k → Receive $230k (after $20k repayment)

### Binding Commitments
By signing this agreement, founders commit to:
1. Operating according to this handbook's principles
2. Quarterly contribution reviews with radical honesty
3. Resolving conflicts through direct conversation
4. Maintaining trust through transparency
5. Evolving the handbook as we learn
6. Recognizing when obvious opportunities present themselves and acting decisively

### Amendment Process
- Any founder can propose changes
- Requires at least 50% agreement for major changes
- Minor operational updates by consensus
- Quarterly review of effectiveness

## 3. Contributor Levels & Rights

### Starting Level Determination
New contributors don't necessarily start at Level 1. The current ownership partners assess each person's experience, proven track record, and immediate value to determine their starting level. Founders may start at Level 4, experienced operators might enter at Level 2 or 3, while those new to the field typically begin at Level 1.

### Level 1: Project Contributors
- **Status**: Commission-based specialists
- **Examples**: Demand scouts, workshop facilitators, implementation specialists
- **Compensation**: Project-specific commissions (e.g., 5-10% for demand scouts)
- **Rights**: No profit share, no voting rights
- **Path Forward**: Prove value to advance to Level 2

### Level 2: Profit Share Contributors
- **Status**: Regular contributors without security
- **Compensation**: Pure quarterly profit share based on contribution
- **Rights**: Participate in profit distribution, attend quarterly reviews
- **Requirements**: Invited based on proven work or prior experience
- **Path Forward**: Contribute ~75% of desired annual insurance amount to qualify for Level 3

### Level 3: Insurance-Eligible Contributors  
- **Status**: Proven contributors with security option
- **Compensation**: Annual insurance + profit share
- **Rights**: Can own Areas of Responsibility, vote on operational decisions
- **Requirements**: Prior year contribution of ~75% of requested insurance amount
- **Accountability**: 6-month warning if contribution < insurance, 12-month revocation

### Level 4: Ownership Partners
- **Status**: Co-owners of the business
- **Compensation**: Insurance + profit share + equity stake
- **Rights**: Vote on all decisions, veto powers on critical items
- **Requirements**: Multiple years of excellence, irreplaceable value, or founder status

## 4. Core Operating Beliefs

### Work Doesn't Have to Be Crazy
- 30-40 focused hours per week is plenty
- AI amplification means one hour can produce what used to take days
- Effectiveness beats productivity - measure outputs, not activity
- Your best work happens when you're not exhausted

### Contribution Is Everything  
- You're valued for what you ship, not hours logged
- Proactive innovation beats reactive execution
- Own your area completely - no excuses, full accountability
- Results are the only currency that matters
- This isn't zero-sum - when one person grows from grape to watermelon, everyone benefits
- Everyone coaches everyone to success, always

### Trust Through Transparency
- Document everything important
- Make commitments you can keep
- Communicate problems early, not late
- No surprises, no bullshit

### The Trust Battery
Every working relationship has a charge level:
- New relationships start at 50%
- Delivering on promises charges the battery
- Breaking commitments drains it
- Below 30% requires active intervention
- Monthly check-ins to monitor levels

### Direct Communication Culture
- Say what you mean - no subtext, no politics
- When asked to bring ideas, show up prepared with your thinking
- Call out patterns directly when you see them
- Either clarify expectations or commit to action, but don't delegate critical thinking
- Nothing moves forward until everything is clear between all parties

---

## 5. How We Work: Areas of Responsibility

### The One Owner Rule
Every business function has exactly one owner - the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI). Only Level 3+ contributors can be primary owners, though Level 2 can be backups.

## 6. Tracking & Rewarding Contribution

### The Quarterly Model
We separate project execution from financial rewards to encourage honest learning.

**During the Quarter**:
- Daily Basecamp check-ins on work completed
- Project post-mortems focused on learning
- Weekly "What I Shipped" summaries
- Documentation of innovations and improvements

**Quarterly Review Process**:
1. **Project Review** (90 min)
   - What did we complete?
   - What did we learn?
   - How did we improve?
   
2. **Contribution Assessment** (60 min)
   - Individual presentations of quarterly impact
   - Three components evaluated:
     - Client Impact (40%): Deliverables, revenue, satisfaction
     - Business Building (30%): Systems, knowledge, capabilities
     - Team Amplification (30%): Helping others, trust, knowledge sharing
   
3. **Financial Distribution** (30 min)
   - Consensus on contribution percentages
   - Insurance obligations considered
   - Profit distribution calculated
   
4. **Planning Ahead** (30 min)
   - Next quarter priorities
   - Process improvements
   - Insurance requests for next year

### Making Contribution Visible
Good updates are specific and measurable:
> "Delivered Brand Strategy report for Client X ($30k project), created reusable interview guide template, mentored demand scout on qualification calls"

Not vague and generic:
> "Worked on client stuff and internal things"

---

## 7. Communication & Work Rhythms

### Daily Practice
- **Check-in**: Post what you shipped in Basecamp
- **Deep Work**: Minimum 2 hours uninterrupted focus
- **Boundaries**: No expectation of response after 7pm

### Weekly Flow  
- **Monday**: Week planning and priority alignment
- **Wednesday**: Mid-week progress check
- **Friday**: "What I Shipped This Week" summary

### Monthly Touchpoints
- **Trust Battery Check**: How are relationships?
- **Energy Audit**: What's energizing vs. draining?
- **Process Improvement**: What should we document?

### Quarterly Intensives
- **Full Review**: As detailed in Section 6
- **Handbook Updates**: What needs to evolve?
- **Health Metrics**: System performance dashboard

---

## 8. Project Management Philosophy

### Output-Driven Lists
Every project is named for its deliverable, not its activities:
- ✓ "Acme Corp JTBD Report Delivered"  
- ✗ "Acme Corp Project Tasks"

### Clear Agreements
- Painfully specific objectives with owners and dates
- "Objective third party test" - could a stranger judge completion?
- Break early, not late - communicate as soon as you know
- First miss = clarification, pattern = accountability issue

### Documentation Religion
- Say it twice? Write it down immediately
- Do it twice? Document the process
- Every meeting recorded for AI context
- Weekly documentation sprints
- Proactive organization - see a gap, propose a solution

---

## 9. Financial Management

### The Insurance System (Detailed)

**How It Works**:
1. Track actual contribution value quarterly
2. After one year, can request insurance for next year
3. Insurance amount ≤ 133% of prior year average (75% rule inverse)
4. Insurance paid monthly but reconciled quarterly
5. Shortfalls become company debt owed by contributor

**Accountability Measures**:
- Quarterly review of contribution vs. insurance
- 6-month warning if trending below insurance level
- 12-month revocation of insurance rights if gap persists
- Return to pure profit share until re-qualified

**Special Situations**:
- Founders have insurance rights from company start
- New parents/medical leave can request adjustments
- Sabbaticals pause insurance and contribution

### Timeline Reality Check
Product development won't generate meaningful salaries anytime soon, and we're not raising venture capital. This means consulting excellence funds everything for at least the next two years. Products are a long-term aspiration, not a short-term distraction.

---

## 10. Growth Philosophy

### Hiring Resistance
Default answer is no. Before adding anyone:
- Can AI do it better?
- Can we systematize it?
- Can we eliminate the need?
- Can existing team absorb with better tools?

### When We Do Add People
1. Start with commission-based project work
2. Test cultural fit and work quality
3. Graduate to profit share only if exceptional
4. Insurance rights earned through sustained contribution

### Building Resilience
- Every AOR has documented backup
- Quarterly "vacation tests" of backup coverage
- Cross-training through: Shadow → Assist → Solo → Certified
- Knowledge capture in our wiki

---

## 11. Performance & Conflicts

### Transparent Feedback Culture
- Monthly "Like/Wish That" exchanges
- Focus on specific behaviors, not personality
- Document patterns, not isolated incidents
- Celebrate growth and improvement

### When Things Aren't Working

**Performance Gaps**:
1. Direct conversation about specific gaps
2. Written improvement plan with timeline
3. Weekly check-ins on progress
4. Clear decision point at 30-60 days

**Insurance Holders**:
- Additional accountability due to security
- 6-month warning process
- Support to improve contribution
- Return to profit-share if needed

### Exit Protocols
**Voluntary**:
- 90-day transition period
- Continued profit share during transition
- Knowledge transfer requirements
- Negotiated buyout terms

**Involuntary**:
- 30-day minimum transition
- Immediate AOR transfer
- Final profit distribution
- Professional references

---

## 12. Tools & Systems

### Core Infrastructure
- **Basecamp**: All internal work and communication
- **hey.com**: External email (stay responsive)
- **AI Tools**: Individual choice, shared learnings
- **Financial**: Monthly transparent reporting

### Meeting Excellence
Every meeting follows ACT structure:
- **Accountability** (10 min): Yes/No on commitments
- **Coaching** (20 min): Issues with proposed solutions  
- **Transparency** (10 min): "Like/Wish That" feedback

### System Health Dashboard (Quarterly)
- % of AORs with documented processes
- % of functions with trained backups
- Trust battery average across team
- Energy audit results (% green time)
- Contribution vs. insurance alignment
- Proactive vs. reactive work ratio

---

## 13. Personal Excellence (Shared Practices)

These are practices team members have found helpful - not requirements, but shared wisdom that's worked for us. Try what resonates, ignore what doesn't, and share what you discover.

### Energy Management
**Monthly Energy Audits** (optional but enlightening):
- Review calendar and color-code activities
- Green = energizing, Red = draining
- Target 75% green time
- Trade red tasks to others' green zones

**Zone of Genius Focus**:
1. Incompetence → Delegate immediately
2. Competence → Transition to others
3. Excellence → Do selectively
4. Genius → Maximize time here

### Boundaries That Work for Many
- Lunch is sacred (no meetings)
- Weekends are real (batch requests)
- Vacations aren't "fakecations"
- Deep work blocks are untouchable

Feel free to adapt these to your own style and share what works for you.

---

## 14. Living Document Commitment

### Evolution Process
- Quarterly review of what's working/not
- Anyone can propose improvements
- Test changes for one quarter
- Adopt what improves outcomes

### Sacred Unchangeables
1. Mission to help customers understand customers
2. Profit sharing reflects contribution
3. No outside investment ever
4. Quality over quantity always
5. Documentation and transparency

### The Ultimate Test
Are we building a business that:
- Produces exceptional client outcomes?
- Gives us lives we're proud of?
- Operates calmly without drama?
- Improves continuously?

If yes, we're succeeding. If no, we evolve.
