# Neal's CEO Model for Shokuna

## Foundation: Profit Over Equity

If I'm CEO, Shokuna operates on a simple principle: you eat what you kill, but we hunt as a pack. Since we're not building to sell, equity is just a number on paper. What matters is how we share the profits from the value we create together.

Here's how it works:

## 1. The Profit Distribution Model

### Base Structure
- **Equity Split**: Neal 51%, Lilliana 30%, Jake 19% (if he joins)
  - This reflects founding risk and prevents deadlocks
  - But equity ≠ profit share

### Profit Allocation Formula
Every dollar of profit gets distributed based on:

**Contribution Score = (Direct Revenue × 0.4) + (Operational Value × 0.3) + (Strategic Value × 0.3)**

- **Direct Revenue**: Client work you personally delivered
- **Operational Value**: Running the business, managing projects, building systems
- **Strategic Value**: Business development, thought leadership, methodology creation

### Quarterly Recalculation
- We assess everyone's Contribution Score each quarter
- Profit distribution adjusts accordingly
- Historical example: Q1 might be Neal 20%, Lilliana 50%, Jake 30% based on actual work

### The Techstars Exception
While I'm at Techstars:
- My maximum take is capped at $66k/year (30% of my salary)
- Excess profits from my contribution score flow to a "Growth Fund"
- When I go full-time, accumulated Growth Fund pays out over 12 months

## 2. Work Commitment & Expectations

### Minimum Viable Commitment
- **Neal**: 10-15 hours/week while at Techstars, full-time thereafter
- **Lilliana**: 30+ hours/week as primary operator
- **Jake**: Starts at 20 hours/week, can scale up

### Value Not Hours
We measure output, not input:
- Close a $50k client? That's worth more than 100 hours of internal meetings
- Build a reusable framework? That compounds value over time
- Keep the lights on? Essential and valued

### The "Earning Your Keep" Standard
Each quarter, everyone must contribute at least 10% of total value created. Fall below that for two consecutive quarters triggers a conversation about role adjustment.

## 3. Decision-Making Framework

### CEO Authority
As CEO, I have final say on:
- Company direction and strategy
- Hiring and firing
- Major financial commitments (>$10k)
- External partnerships

### Consensus Zones
These require all active founders to agree:
- Bringing in new equity partners
- Fundamental business model changes
- Profit distribution formula modifications
- CEO succession

### Autonomous Zones
Each founder owns their domain:
- **Neal**: Strategy, methodology, major client relationships
- **Lilliana**: Operations, project delivery, team building
- **Jake**: Product development, digital assets, technical systems

### The 24-Hour Rule
Any major decision can be delayed 24 hours by any founder for reflection. Use sparingly.

## 4. Growth & Transition Planning

### Phase 1: Foundation (Year 1)
- Establish working rhythms
- Validate profit sharing model
- Build to $500k revenue

### Phase 2: Expansion (Year 2-3)
- Neal transitions to full-time
- Hire first employees (profit sharing, not equity)
- Scale to $2M revenue

### Phase 3: Evolution (Year 4+)
- Consider specialized equity classes for key employees
- Explore CEO rotation if desired
- Build towards sustainable $5M+ business

### The "Life Happens" Clause
- Parental leave: Maintain 50% profit share for 6 months
- Health issues: Case-by-case basis with presumption of support
- Career pivots: 6-month transition period to find replacement

## 5. Values in Action

### The Shokuna Way
We practice what we preach:
- Jobs-to-be-done thinking applies internally
- Progress over perfection
- Experiments over grand plans
- Trust over contracts

### Weekly Rituals
- Monday: Strategic alignment (30 min)
- Wednesday: Operational sync (30 min)
- Friday: Reflection and recognition (30 min)

### The "No Asshole" Rule
Doesn't matter how much value someone creates—toxic behavior has no place here. One warning, then they're out.

### Continuous Calibration
This model isn't sacred. Every quarter we ask:
- Is this working?
- What needs adjustment?
- Are we building the company we want to work for?

## The Bottom Line

This model prioritizes:
1. **Fairness**: You get out what you put in
2. **Flexibility**: Life changes, the model adapts
3. **Focus**: Profit and progress over politics
4. **Foundational Trust**: We assume good intentions until proven otherwise

If I'm CEO, I'm the keeper of this vision, but not its dictator. My job is to ensure we're building something that outlasts any individual founder while rewarding the people who pour their energy into making it real.

The goal isn't to build a perfect system—it's to build one that's perfectly aligned with who we are and what we're creating together.
