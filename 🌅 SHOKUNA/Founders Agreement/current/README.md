# Shokuna Founders Agreement Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive founders agreement framework for Shokuna, a jobs-to-be-done consulting company. The agreement will address how to manage varying levels of founder input and establish fair compensation structures based on contribution rather than equal splits. Currently, Neal and Lilliana are 50/50 partners, with Jake being considered as a potential third founder.

## Context
Shokuna faces a delicate relationship dynamic: while Neal has deep trust with both Jake and Lilliana separately, the three-way dynamic requires careful navigation. Neal sees parallels with the Basecamp founders (Jason Fried, DHH) and Ryan Singer situation, where Singer's lack of significant equity led to an unfortunate departure. This case study serves as a cautionary tale to design against.

Neal brings the most business experience but prioritizes creating a thoughtful, creative agreement that ensures all parties earn their keep while feeling valued and aligned.

## Key Objectives
1. **Profit Share Over Equity** - Since there's no intent to sell, flip, or raise capital, profit sharing becomes more important than equity stakes
2. **Dynamic Economic Model** - Account for Neal's current Techstars salary constraints ($220k with 30% cap on outside earnings) and potential future full-time transition
3. **Three CEO Scenarios** - Explore what the business looks like with each founder as CEO, letting each design their ideal model
4. **Plain English Agreement** - Create an artful, customized agreement without requiring lawyers, reflecting Shokuna's values
5. **Trust Building** - Address Lilliana's concerns about Jake's commitment and Jake's concerns about Lilliana's contributions

## Current Constraints
- Neal can only earn 30% of his $220k Techstars salary from outside work
- Economic returns should primarily flow to Lilliana, the business, and potentially Jake while Neal maintains employment
- Model must be flexible enough to adjust "at a moment's notice" if Neal goes full-time

## Strategic Approach
Each potential CEO will design their version of how the business should run:
1. **If Neal is CEO** - [To be developed in this project]
2. **If Lilliana is CEO** - She designs her model
3. **If Jake is CEO** - He designs his model

The first job of the CEO is to design this foundational model for the organization.

## Guiding Principles
- The three founders working together equally excited and motivated is the best path to success
- Ownership structure can differ from profit distribution
- Future employees could earn ownership through a Basecamp-inspired model
- Leadership and decision-making authority could rotate or evolve
- Fairness in spirit matters more than legal complexity
