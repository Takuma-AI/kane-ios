# Chapter 5: Evolution & Growth

Everything in this handbook is a 3-month experiment. What works, we keep. What doesn't, we change.

But our experiments serve a bigger purpose. We're not just building a consultancy—we're part of a movement toward more thoughtful product creation. Every client we help understand their customers better, every builder we train in JTBD thinking, every product that succeeds because it addresses real struggles—these ripple outward.

The world needs builders who start with why, not what. That's the future we're creating, one project at a time.

## Growing Smart, Not Big

Our default answer to hiring is no. Before adding anyone, we ask:
1. Can we eliminate this work entirely?
2. Can AI amplify us instead?
3. Can we redesign the process?
4. Can existing team handle it with better tools?

Only if all four answers are "no" do we consider adding people.

Small teams win through focus, not headcount. Three excellent people outperform ten good ones. Less coordination, clearer ownership, faster decisions, better work.

## AI as Amplification

We use AI for three things:

**1. Raising the quality bar**  
Faster iteration means more refinement, which means higher standards.

**2. Learning what we don't know**  
When we hit knowledge gaps, we get curious: can AI help us understand this? It's about rapid learning and connecting dots.

**3. Automating energy drains**  
Tasks that drain energy but don't require our unique talents get automated, freeing us for work that matters.

Bottom line: We use AI to augment and amplify our thinking, not replace it.

## Evolving This Handbook

### Quarterly Check-ins
Every quarter we ask: What's working? What's not? What did we learn? What needs updating?

### Anyone Can Propose Changes
See something that doesn't match reality? Write up:
- What's broken
- Specific fix
- Why it matters
- Bring to quarterly review

### Test Everything
We run 3-month experiments:
- Identify friction
- Try small change
- Measure results
- Keep, modify, or abandon

No sacred cows. If something consistently doesn't work, we change it.

## What Stays Constant

While everything else evolves, these remain:
- Ongoing curiosity and strive for excellence
- Getting better at understanding and applying JTBD
- Direct communication
- Contribution-based rewards
- Trust and accountability
- Sustainable pace

Methods change. Principles endure. What matters is that we keep learning, keep improving, and keep helping builders create products that actually help people make progress.

## The Bottom Line

This handbook is a tool, not a bible. It should help us work better, not create bureaucracy.

Stay curious. Challenge assumptions. Share what you learn. Build something better.

We're not trying to build the biggest consultancy. We're building a dojo that creates better builders. Every project makes us sharper. Every client we help becomes an advocate for understanding customers deeply. Every team member who grows with us carries these principles forward.

That's how we grow—not by getting bigger, but by getting better. Not by scaling headcount, but by scaling impact.

The world deserves products built on understanding, not assumptions. That's the change we're part of creating.
