And then three we use AI to so those two are the more ambitious like boundary pushing things and then the third part is just it helps us automate things that shouldn't take as much of our energy like helps us automate things to drain our energy so those are the three pillars of how to use AI and then how not to use AI we use AI to learn and get curious about things that like to fill in the gaps in our own thinking and learn not like I think the second point is less focused on thinking and more focused on learning so we say as a help us learn unfamiliar things which is in essence is about filling in gaps our own thinking faster actually not even about speed it's more about it affords you more iterations on thinking allows you to push further with your own thinking um I think so that's like I think we can talk about the use of AI in those higher level needs so one is we use AI to iterate on our thinking iterate and refine on our own thinking both in chapter 1 and chapter 5 and everywhere else is that I don't think we should name the ways in which we use AI yet I don't think interview synthesis should be named as a way to use AI I think the focus here should be even higher level at a more meta level AI is used to help us iterate and amplify the core beliefs are great the only thing that I have to note that I have around the mention of AI across the board Alright I'm gonna talk through um my feedback on this current draft it's so much better it's so good but there are obviously some areas some details that I want to push on so AI is to, we're not going to use AI to replace our own thinking on, especially on things that matter. So I think there's a relationship between this and the zone of genius concept that is mapped out in the original draft. So it's like almost like for, for things in our zone of genius, AI helps us. We use AI to help us amplify and iterate on our own thinking as well as to learn and grow and get curious about the things that are outside of our zone of genius that we want to do. And then there are things that we just drain our energy on that are completely out of our scope that we can get curious about using AI to take off our plates. But that's not the primary purpose. What we don't use AI for is to replace our genius. We don't use it to get lazy. We don't use it to think less. So I think that needs to come across instead of just a typical like "what took weeks now takes days". That's ultimately true, but I think it's more important here to focus on how the principles of how we're using AI or why. It's really about amplifying the genius of whoever is on a team. I don't like the mention of the word "junior analysts" in Practitioner-Led. It's us about junior like there's no notion of being junior. It's more that you know you work with us like we're the real deal. Find a way to draw that contrast without using a word junior. between types section because that's not established for now it's over thinking that will emerge over time when commitments aren't met um everyone including contributors get to hold each other accountable um and it's okay if the observation is wrong it just needs to be voiced in a healthy way like i notice this this is a problem here's why it's a problem it's but different people have like not everyone has an equal say on who gets to contribute how much so like if your partner you'll have the first dip on how much you're contributing so you have the first right to the dollar basically don't use mine's at words but revise the description of members and partners to to have that um i think we can remove the moving bit of being a partner but by getting to lead more projects but they the partners could decide that a member gets to lead a project too so that's the fundamental difference like members most of the time are more so assigned um work like assigned like they they can advocate for themselves but ultimately they don't have the final say on who leads a project or how much they get to contribute so it's like income is proportionate to contribution uh also you have less of a say in assigning yourself work so like you could proactively contribute more you could advocate for more but ultimately the partners are the ones who decide who gets to lead a project and so in essence the partners get to earn more not by um not just by their own virtue planning um you get sort of ownership stake nobody gets also nobody gets um like guaranteed income like not even owners get guaranteed incomes not even partners get guaranteed income but what you do get is um profit share so i want you to update the members description with what i just said about it's a profit project based profit share but you also get a voice in you you get a voice you have a say in the financial planning and also the higher level plan because that's when you know if we're on track to meet both our individual and collective financial goals so we've revisited a financial model now i'm going to move on to chapter that should happen just when the check comes in right also i think the company should keep 10 percent prior than 20. that could be adjusted over time but i think we should start by proposing 10. um yeah so i think like yeah i think i'm pretty i feel pretty strongly about that so project the pro the profits share is done by when the project is done and the check comes in the quarterly review is for revisiting the financial model what are the pros and cons of doing the project doing the profit share by project like every time a project is done versus by decoder i think the quarterly review is still needed for more sort of like overall like quarterly reviews when you revisit the financial model and be like are we on track to hit our financial goals this year but when should the profit sharing happen i think it doesn't a daily weekly monthly and quarterly is great but also add an underlying like ongoing is just really good project management in terms of tracking tasks and outcomes the one thing i want to revisit here is whether to stick to the quarterly review for profit sharing given that the calculation is now project based remove the part about meeting free because of the nature of the work being jobs we've done interviews you're going to have jobs be done interviews and calls and debriefs so meetings are actually kind of necessary so remove that and then i think as a part of the communication that works section um now then moving on to chapter two love the areas and ownership part and tries to solve it. And then ultimately, the partners get to decide what to do with it. But the partners need to hold each other accountable too. So it's like, that's where the inter-coaching comes up. I think we need to remove, going back to the previous, so chapter two, I think, that everyone coaches everyone right now is hypothetical and not a real example. I would rather you remove that from everyone coaches everyone and instead make it a more succinct, high-level paragraph. Under everyone coaches everyone, that's just like a general value and principle of you know we are all going to get curious about each others strengths and perspectives and when we don't understand we ask them to coach us into understanding like the mutual curiosity in coaching. There's like a higher level value that we should describe here but it's not it's not like don't go into the details of the example yet because we're not ready for that.

Okay now I'm going to move on to chapter four. Love chapter four, I think it's the highest quality or highest fidelity one right now. Again, let's make company 10% to start. And that yes we'll discuss and agree on a split before starting based on who's doing what. The project lead is in charge of holding everyone accountable to that work, including themselves. If it so happens that the project lead isn't carrying the weight, the rest of the team will support that. The goal is for this to be more of an upfront determined thing. The project lead proposes the split and assigns what that means. So like if the project lead says that I need 30%, I'm going to give you 30%. The project lead is responsible for determining how much work that would entail in order for that team member to deserve 30%, and that team member is responsible to work with the project lead on doing that. This is great. The rest of this is great.

Finally, evolution and growth. I said what I needed to say earlier about AI usage, so follow what I said earlier about the pillars of what AI helps us with. AI also I think it's also correct that AI doesn't help with human connection but AI can help coach us into being better at human connection. So like use AI. I think the second part about the second pillar of like using AI to fill in gaps always starting with curiosity of what AI could do beyond what we could do ourselves so it's not like taking everything for granted that AI can do xyz but it's more like getting curious about whether AI can potentially fill in a gap. That is a value that I want to woven in throughout less so like an explicitly named separate thing but like in general that should come off. It's less JTBD methodology excellence is more like ongoing curiosity and just strive for excellence right like getting really really really collectively the goal is for everyone to get better at both using and applying JTBD to create to serve the mission. I think right now chapter 5 is a little bit underwhelming because chapter 1 is painted a grand vision and I think there's a way to tie the evolution and growth back to the grand vision of creating higher quality things in a world by helping more people really understand a why before the why. But otherwise it's great. I think that's all as far as feedback goes.
