# Chapter 3: Contributors, Members & Partners

Three ways to work with Shokuna. Where you start depends on experience. Where you end up depends on contribution.

## Contributors: Project-Based Specialists

Project-specific work. Project-specific pay. No promises beyond that.

**What you do**: Demand scouting, interview support, workshop facilitation, implementation
**What you get**: 5-15% of project value
**What you don't get**: Profit sharing, voting rights, guaranteed future work

Most start here. Low risk both ways. Some become Members within months. Others prefer staying Contributors for flexibility. Both work.

## Members: Regular Team

Part of ongoing work. Share in profits. Help shape operations.

**What you do**: Lead assigned projects, own areas, train others, build capability
**What you get**: Project-based profit share, voice in financial planning
**What you don't get**: Guaranteed income, final say on assignments, ownership

Income matches contribution, but Partners decide who leads what. You can advocate for more work, but don't control assignments.

Invitation based on: quality work, cultural fit, mutual commitment.

Members lead areas and shape methods. More contribution = more earnings.

## Partners: Co-Founders

Co-own the business. Shape strategy. Carry the biggest risks and rewards.

**What you do**: Strategic decisions, assign projects, ultimate responsibility
**What you get**: Equity, first right to work, vote on everything major
**What you carry**: Personal liability, reputation risk, partner obligations

No guaranteed income—even for Partners. But Partners assign work, so they control their opportunity to earn.

Partnership requires: exceptional value creation, mission alignment, unanimous partner agreement.

Currently just founders. May expand eventually.


## When Commitments Aren't Met

Everyone—including Contributors—can hold each other accountable. We address problems early and directly.

### First Sign of Issues
Anyone notices? Speak up within a week. "I noticed X. Here's the impact. What's going on?" 

Wrong observations are fine—voicing concerns healthily matters. Partners decide responses, but everyone maintains standards.

### Persistent Problems
Written plan: specific gaps, success metrics, 30-60 days, weekly check-ins.

### No Improvement
Transition time. Members might become Contributors. Contributors get no new projects. No one's above accountability.

## Trust & Accountability

Trust builds through patterns:

**Up**: Deliver promises. Communicate early. Help others. Own mistakes.
**Down**: Miss commitments silently. Make excuses. Hide problems. Blame others.

Trust below 30%? Talk immediately. Fixable early, toxic late.

## The Human Side

Life happens. Illness, family, mental health. We adjust expectations temporarily, provide support, reassess when stable. Never weaponize life events.

Standards remain, humanity comes first.

## What We Don't Do

- No politics or hidden agendas
- No surprise demotions or exits
- No keeping people who poison culture
- No pretending problems don't exist
- No arbitrary hierarchies

## The Bottom Line

Three types. Clear expectations. Honest accountability. Direct feedback always.

Most people want great work. We create conditions for it. When that fails despite real effort, we adjust or part professionally.

Simple system. Human approach. No bullshit.
