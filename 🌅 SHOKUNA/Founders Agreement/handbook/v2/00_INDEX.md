## TL;DR


1. **Three clear roles: Contributors, Members, Partners**  
   Contributors work project-by-project. Members get profit share and voice in planning. Partners assign work and have first right to projects—but no guaranteed income for anyone.

2. **Collective financial modeling**  
   We share our individual financial needs openly and work together to achieve them. Quarterly planning sessions ensure everyone's on track to meet their goals through collective effort and mutual support.

3. **Income = Contribution**  
   The mechanism for getting paid is doing the work. Need $120k annually? Lead enough projects to earn it. Splits: Project Lead 40-60%, Company 10%, Team 30-50%. Leads who delegate more earn less—the split reflects actual work done, not title.

4. **Partners control work assignment**  
   Partners decide who leads projects. This gives them first opportunity to meet their financial needs—by doing the work. Members can advocate for more but don't control assignments.

5. **Areas have single owners (Area Leads)**  
   No shared responsibility. Each area has one lead who owns outcomes. They don't do all the work but ensure it gets done well.

6. **Everyone holds everyone accountable**  
   Contributors can call out Partners. Wrong observations are fine—voicing concerns healthily matters. Partners decide responses, but everyone maintains standards.

7. **AI raises our quality bar**  
   Faster iteration means higher standards. We use AI to augment thinking, not replace it. AI handles energy drains so we focus on work that matters.

8. **Proactivity over delegation**  
   Default is doing, not delegating. Uncomfortable? Ask for coaching, not for someone else to do it. Project leads do work, not just assign it.

9. **Quarterly experiments**  
   Everything is a 3-month trial. What works, we keep. What doesn't, we change. No sacred cows.

10. **Work visible on Basecamp**  
    All outcomes and deliverables tracked transparently. Not micromanagement—it's how we support each other. Can't help if we can't see.
