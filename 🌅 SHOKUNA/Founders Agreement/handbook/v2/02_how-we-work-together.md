# Chapter 2: How We Work Together

Every area has one lead. Every project has clear outcomes. Everyone helps everyone else succeed.

## Areas & Ownership

We don't share responsibility—we divide it clearly. Each area has a single Area Lead who owns outcomes and makes final decisions.

**Business Development** - Finding clients, closing deals, managing demand scouts
**Client Projects** - Project delivery, client satisfaction, quality control
**JTBD Excellence** - Methodology advancement, training, consistency
**Operations** - Finance, legal, systems, tools, documentation
**Innovation** - New services, AI integration, pushing boundaries
**Culture** - Hiring, conflict resolution, team health, handbook

The Area Lead doesn't do all the work—they ensure it gets done well. They can delegate tasks but not responsibility.

When you need something, go directly to the Area Lead. When something falls through cracks, the Area Lead catches it or proposes who should.

## Communication That Works

### Daily Flow
End each day by posting what you shipped. Be specific: "Completed synthesis for 3 interviews, found pattern about pricing anxiety" not "worked on interviews."

Protect 2+ hours of deep work daily. Notifications off. No meetings. Real focus.

Check messages at set times—morning, lunch, end of day. The world won't end if you take 2 hours to respond.

### Weekly Rhythm
**Monday**: Post your week's concrete deliverables by 10am
**Wednesday**: Quick check—on track? Need help? Flag now, not Friday
**Friday**: Summarize what you actually shipped

Given the nature of JTBD work—interviews, calls, debriefs—meetings are necessary. Batch them strategically to maximize focus time.

### Monthly Practice
Last Friday: Reflect on trust batteries. Any relationships need attention?
Track what energized versus drained you. Hitting 75% energizing work?
Document anything you explained twice. Create process for anything you did twice.

### Quarterly Reviews
Half-day covering: project retrospective, contribution assessment, financial model review, next quarter planning, handbook updates based on learnings.

### Ongoing Project Management
Make sure all your outcomes and deliverables are tracked on Basecamp. This isn't micromanagement—it's transparency that enables mutual support.

Keep your project lists updated with what you're working toward right now. When others can see your goals and progress, they can help when you're stuck or overwhelmed. Accountability and support only work when work is visible.

See Project Management Guidelines below for specifics.

## Project Management Guidelines

### Name for Outcomes
Every project is named for what it will produce:
- ✓ "Acme Corp JTBD Report Delivered"
- ✗ "Acme Corp Project Tasks"

### Crystal Clear Agreements
Could a stranger judge if you succeeded? If not, your agreement isn't clear enough.

Every project needs:
- Specific deliverable (what exactly will exist?)
- Quality bar (what makes it good enough?)
- Due date (when will client have it?)
- Owner (who wakes up thinking about this?)

### Fixed Time, Variable Scope
Time doesn't extend. Scope does. When deadline pressure hits, cut nice-to-haves, ship must-haves. Quality stays high by doing less, not working more.

### Document Everything
Second time explaining something? Write it down.
Second time doing something? Create a process.
The third time should be a link or following a playbook.

## Everyone Coaches Everyone

We cultivate mutual curiosity about each other's strengths and perspectives. When we don't understand something, we ask others to coach us into understanding. 

This isn't about hierarchy—it's about recognizing that everyone has zones of genius worth learning from. Your expertise in synthesis might be someone else's growth edge. Their client communication skills might unlock new approaches for you.

We lead with questions, share what works, and stay curious about different ways of solving problems. Knowledge flows freely in all directions. Everyone teaches, everyone learns, everyone gets better.

## Proactivity Over Delegation

Your default should be doing, not delegating. When something needs to happen:

First, try to do it yourself. If you're uncomfortable or lack the skills, ask someone to coach you through it—not to do it for you. Growth happens at the edge of comfort.

This applies especially to project leads. Leading means doing the work, not just assigning it. You model the standard through your own contribution.

Delegation happens when work genuinely exceeds capacity or requires specific expertise—not because something feels hard or unfamiliar. We're all here to expand our capabilities, not stay in narrow lanes.

## Sustainable Rhythms

### Meeting Discipline
Before scheduling, ask: 
- Have I done enough thinking to make this a good use of everyone's time?
- Could this be a written post? 
- Could this be a recorded video? 
- Can it wait for regular check-in?

If you must meet: 30 minutes max, written agenda in advance, clear owner and outcomes, written follow-up summary.

### Boundaries That Matter
- Response within 24 hours for team, same day for clients
- No expectation after 7pm or weekends
- Vacation means vacation—no quick questions
- Lunch is sacred—real break from screens

### Tools We Use
**Basecamp**: Home for all work. Projects, updates, decisions, knowledge—everything lives here.
**Video Messages**: When showing beats telling. Complex explanations, visual feedback, adding personality.
**Real-Time Chat**: Rarely. True emergencies, quick clarifications, social connection.

## Practical Wisdom

Some practices team members find helpful:

**Energy Audits**: Color-code last month's calendar. Green = energizing, Red = draining. Aim for 75% green.

**Deep Work Blocks**: Many find 6-9am golden before the world wakes up. Find your equivalent.

**Batch Processing**: Monday = admin, Tuesday = emails, Friday = documentation. Protect the rest.

**Two-Minute Rule**: If it takes less than two minutes, do it now. Don't list it.

**Walking Meetings**: Take calls while walking. Think better, move more, return energized.

The key: experiment with what works for you. Share what you learn. Ignore what doesn't fit.

## The Bottom Line

Structure enables freedom. Clear ownership prevents confusion. Open sharing accelerates learning. Boundaries protect sustainability.

We're building something together. These practices help us build it well.
