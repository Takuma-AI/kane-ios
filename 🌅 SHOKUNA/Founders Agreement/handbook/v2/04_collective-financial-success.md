# Chapter 4: Collective Financial Success

Simple system: Tell us what you need to make annually. We'll work backwards together to figure out how to get there.

## How It Works

**Step 1: Be honest about your number**  
"I need $120k this year." Great. That's $12k/month over 10 working months.

**Step 2: Do the math together**  
If leading a $40k project earns you $18k, you need to lead 7 projects a year. Can we generate that work? Can you handle it? Let's figure it out.

No judgment. No negotiation. Just math.

## Project Splits

When a client pays $40k:
- **Project Lead** (40-60%): Owns delivery and quality
- **Company** (10%): Operations and growth
- **Supporting Team** (30-50%): Everyone who contributes

Project lead proposes the split upfront. Says "you get 30% for doing X, Y, Z." Then holds everyone accountableâ€”including themselves.

You get paid when the client pays. Simple as that.

## Quarterly Reality Checks

Every three months we ask:
- Are you hitting your numbers?
- Do we need to adjust the plan?
- What opportunities are coming?

This isn't about judgment. It's about staying aligned with reality.

## The Deal

- Everyone knows what everyone else needs to make
- Need more money? Lead more projects or create more value
- Partners decide who leads what, but everyone gets a voice
- No salaries, no loans, no complex systems
- Just transparent math and shared commitment

## Why This Works

When everyone's transparent about their needs, resentment disappears. When contribution drives income, incentives align. When we plan together, we succeed together.

Your financial success is in your hands, supported by all of us.
