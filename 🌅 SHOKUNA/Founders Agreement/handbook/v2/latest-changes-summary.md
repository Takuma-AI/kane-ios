# Latest Changes to Handbook v2

## AI Section (Chapter 5)
Refined to be crisp and clear:
- Changed to "amplifying and refining our thinking"
- Emphasized that AI = faster iteration = more iterations = higher standards
- Simplified learning section to "can AI help us understand this?"
- Reduced "what we don't do" to one sentence
- Removed the part about requesting help from others

## Collective Financial Success (Chapter 4)
Dramatically simplified:
- Cut length by ~60%
- Made the process instantly understandable:
  1. Say what you need annually
  2. Work backwards to figure out projects needed
  3. Simple splits: Lead 40-60%, Company 10%, Team 30-50%
  4. Get paid when client pays
- Removed over-explanation and complexity

## Meeting Discipline (Chapter 2)
Added critical first question:
- "Have I done enough thinking to make this a good use of everyone's time?"

## Proactivity Over Delegation (Chapter 2)
Added new section addressing growth mindset:
- Default is doing, not delegating
- If uncomfortable, ask for coachingâ€”not for someone else to do it
- Project leads do work, not just assign it
- Delegation only for genuine capacity/expertise issues

All changes maintain the handbook's direct, human tone while addressing the specific patterns and principles needed.
