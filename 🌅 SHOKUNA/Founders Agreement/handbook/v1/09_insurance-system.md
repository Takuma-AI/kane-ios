# Chapter 9: The Insurance System

We don't pay salaries. We provide insurance against contribution volatility.

## How Insurance Actually Works

Insurance is a zero-interest loan from the company to contributors. It's not a salary. It's not guaranteed income. It's financial smoothing for proven contributors who prefer predictable cash flow.

### The Basic Mechanism

1. You contribute value to the company
2. We track that contribution quarterly  
3. After a year, you can request insurance for the following year
4. Insurance cannot exceed 133% of your prior year average
5. If you contribute less than your insurance, you owe the difference back

This system ensures everyone has skin in the game while providing stability for those who've proven their value.

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: The Successful Contributor

**Year 1:**
- Q1: $30k contribution
- Q2: $35k contribution  
- Q3: $40k contribution
- Q4: $45k contribution
- Total: $150k (average $37.5k/quarter)

**Year 2:**
- Requests $200k insurance (133% of $150k)
- Receives $16.7k monthly ($200k/12)
- Actually contributes $220k
- Profit share: $20k additional ($220k - $200k)
- Total received: $220k

**Year 3:**
- Can request up to $293k insurance (133% of $220k)
- Chooses $250k for work-life balance
- No debt, more flexibility

### Example 2: The Underperformer

**Year 1:**
- Contributes $150k total
- Requests $200k insurance for Year 2

**Year 2:**
- Takes $200k insurance
- Only contributes $160k
- Owes company $40k
- Receives 6-month warning at Q2 review

**Year 3:**
- Contributes $180k
- Receives $140k ($180k - $40k debt)
- Insurance rights under review
- Must rebuild track record

### Example 3: The New Joiner

**Month 1-3:** Level 2 contributor, pure profit share
- Q1: Receives $8k profit share

**Month 4-12:** Proves consistent value
- Q2: $25k contribution
- Q3: $30k contribution  
- Q4: $35k contribution
- Year 1 Total: $98k

**Year 2:**
- Qualifies for up to $130k insurance
- Requests $100k to be conservative
- Promoted to Level 3

## Accountability Timeline

### Quarterly Review
Every quarter we compare:
- Insurance taken (3 months worth)
- Actual contribution
- Running balance

### 6-Month Warning

If trending below insurance level:
- Formal warning issued
- Support plan created
- Specific improvements identified
- Check-ins increase to monthly

### 12-Month Consequences

If gap persists after warning:
- Insurance rights revoked
- Return to pure profit share
- Must re-qualify from scratch
- Level 3 status reviewed

## Special Situations Explained

### Founders
Start with insurance rights because they're creating the company infrastructure that enables everyone else's contribution. Their early work has delayed payoff.

### Medical Leave
**Scenario:** Contributor needs surgery, out for 6 weeks

**Resolution:**
- Insurance continues during leave
- Contribution requirements pause
- Quarter prorated for contribution calculation
- No penalty for health needs

### New Parent Leave
**Scenario:** Contributor takes 3-month parental leave

**Resolution:**
- Insurance continues
- Contribution averaged over 9 working months
- Can request temporary insurance reduction
- Full rights restored upon return

### Sabbaticals
**Scenario:** Contributor takes 6-month sabbatical

**Resolution:**
- Insurance pauses (no payments)
- Contribution requirements pause
- Rights resume upon return
- Prior track record intact

### Part-Time Transition
**Scenario:** Contributor wants to work 3 days/week

**Resolution:**
- Insurance adjusts proportionally
- Contribution expectations adjust
- Can maintain Level 3 status
- Flexibility preserved

## Special Exceptions

The insurance system as written is our default policy. However, we recognize that abnormal circumstances can occur. If uncontrollable factors lead to an extraordinarily low contribution year (major illness, global pandemic, client industry collapse), voting members can grant exceptions.

This is not automatic. It requires:
- Clear documentation of the abnormal circumstance
- Proposal for adjusted insurance amount
- 51% vote from ownership partners

These are case-by-case adjustments, not precedents. The default policy remains the maximum you can request.

## Common Questions

### "What if I have a bad quarter?"
One bad quarter doesn't break you. The system looks at trends. Communicate early, show improvement, and you'll be fine.

### "Can I decline insurance?"
Yes. Some contributors prefer pure profit share. Higher upside, more volatility. Your choice.

### "Can I change my insurance mid-year?"
No. Insurance is annual commitment. Plan thoughtfully. You can always contribute more and receive additional profit share.

### "What if the company has a bad year?"
Insurance is a company obligation. We pay it even if unprofitable. That's why we're conservative about who qualifies.

### "How is contribution calculated?"
See Chapter 6. Three components: Client Impact (40%), Business Building (30%), Team Amplification (30%).

## The Psychology

This system creates healthy pressure:
- Contribute or face consequences
- But not so much pressure you make bad decisions
- Stability for proven contributors
- Flexibility for those who want it

It attracts people who:
- Bet on themselves
- Want upside potential
- Value contribution over tenure
- Think like owners

It repels people who:
- Want guaranteed income
- Avoid accountability
- Prefer activity over results
- Think like employees

## Making Insurance Decisions

### For Contributors

Before requesting insurance, consider:
- Do I want predictability or maximum upside?
- Am I confident in sustaining this contribution level?
- Would pure profit share serve me better?
- What's my personal financial situation?

Request conservatively your first time. You can always increase later.

### For the Company

Before approving insurance, we consider:
- Has this person consistently delivered?
- Is their contribution sustainable?
- Do they strengthen our culture?
- Are they committed long-term?

We'd rather have fewer insured contributors than compromise standards.

## The Long-Term View

Year by year, successful contributors build increasing insurance rights:

- Year 1: Prove yourself ($150k contribution)
- Year 2: Get stability ($200k insurance)
- Year 3: Build cushion ($250k insurance)
- Year 4: Find your sustainable level
- Year 5+: Optimize for life goals

The system rewards longevity through compound growth, not automatic raises.

## The Bottom Line

Insurance provides stability for proven contributors without creating entitlement. It's earned through past contribution and justified by future value.

Choose your level thoughtfully. Contribute consistently. Build the life you want.
