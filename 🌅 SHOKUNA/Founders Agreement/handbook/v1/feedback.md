# Handbook Feedback - Detailed Extract

## Chapter Reorganization Discussion

"I think this goes before chapter three. Chapter four goes before chapter three. This is chapter four. Instead of chapter instead of chapter five. Chapter five should be chapter four."

"Basically, I'm trying to push back the compensation. Discussion terms and all that stuff. Because they need to understand what work is going to be like before they think about, okay, but what am I going to get paid? So for me. You should understand what you're signing up for. And then talk about. Okay. Now we can talk money. And by the way. The money's fair. Yeah. Get what you contribute. Because it's framing the information. So that you know what's expected of you in order to get it."

## Terminology and Framework Issues

"We should figure out how to get rid of that acronym directly responsible individual. And just figure out, like, a more plain English. Better term for it. An owner. Yeah."

"There's all this stuff from the Gracia with. Omega graphic version of this. It's like levels and contributors and stuff like that. These are for corporations. Like there's contractors. Cool. Interesting. Yeah, I see that. Computers. I see it. I get it. Contractors, contributors and owners. Levels 1, 2, 3. So demand scouts are a type of contractor."

## Insurance System Concerns

"I want to question salaries, but the notion of insurance doesn't make sense. It already starts off doesn't feel right. At all. When you say insurance. You're like, it's not a good thing. It's not the right word. No. It's not. There's something else that has to be framed to describe what that is."

"But I like the spirit of it. So there's got to be a way to let go. This is what it is. Rather than all of this stuff. This is complicated."

### Alternative Compensation Model Discussion

"My thought on this is that we can basically allocate a percentage split of every deal. We lock in so that there's an allocation of that deal. To the person. To the company. And to whoever else helped, okay? But there's a project lead who gets the proceeds. There's company that gets allocation. And then there's the people who help, okay? Right. There's, like, tears."

"This Lilliana deal, right? This 20K, yeah. What if it was? 10k to Lilliana. 5k to shokana. And then between 3 to 5K to Jake, Neal and whoever else was involved."

**Concerns raised:**
- "How does that not lead to people fighting over leading projects?"
- "Lead to people feeling disincentivized to contribute to projects. They didn't win the fight for."

**Response:** "So again you still want to earn your keep and its ratio to your contribution. Okay? Right. There's a way to structure so it's ratio to your contribution still that amount."

## Areas of Responsibility (AOR) Division

"And for aor, I would say. I think I could probably lead biz Dev. She could do contact management. I should probably do. I think it's a toss up between me and her for JTBD and Operations. I think you should do operations. I think so, too. But I should also do innovation and growth in coaching development."

"So she does biz dev, client project management, JTBD and I do option systems, innovation and growth and culture and team development."

"If she wants to get all the priority and all of the funding and all the money, then she got to do those three. That's right. Yeah. But we'll figure it out what that means. Yeah. Because I think the AOR may also have influence on compensation."

## Financial Model Philosophy

"So to summarize. There's no quote, unquote, loan system. There's no anything like that. Whatever your earning target is, be transparent with each other. Build a financial model about it. If you project that, you won't be like. You collectively won't be able to make enough money to pay. You like $200,000 while you do only 30% of the work, then you got to do more of the work. That's that. And if you all need money, then you are just going to work harder. To make more money. Like, keep it simple. Know funny numbers. Funny contracts. No funny loans. Nobody owes anyone anything."

## Research Needs Identified

"There's a bunch of like, Oh, I didn't think about that. But that happens a lot. Whatever those happen. The client project falls through or they don't actually make the second payment or how do you make these calls? When those things fall through the cracks. So add that research brief."

"And we might want to research, like, consultancies and what frameworks exist for them. Because there's probably, like, some really smart systems that people have thought of because they've been around for so long. Small consultancy, small innovation. Consultancies. Two to three to five people, small boutique, studio level consultancies and dev shops. How do they structure incentives? And compensation. And things like that. Based on the work coming in."

## Trial Period and Accountability

"I think all of these terms should be trialed for three months. And then you guys do a post mortem and review. And adjust."

"I also want to break down what happens when people don't do these things. If they don't meet the commitment of an update, if they don't meet the commitment of responsiveness, if they don't meet a commitment in some kind, that's expected here and that's written here. How does that get acknowledged? And how does it get documented? And how do they get held accountable to it?"

## Overall Length and Complexity

"There's a lot to learn, right? There's a lot to process. It's almost too much. It feels like AI because of how much it is. All right. So Jenny's coming on Friday at 9:30, okay? I agree. With mildur soon. Because I can tell it just feels. It should be, like, five chapters. Total. And tight. End time."

"Basically, like, one chapter about culture, one chapter about or, like, areas of responsibility. And expectations. One chapter about accountability, one chapter above. Pay one chapter about growth. Yeah, exactly. That kind of stuff."

"But I get it. The amount that this covers is almost the amalgamation of lots of other companies. That are at scale. But not everything applies. At this early stage. But it's almost like how when you write the way to write a very tight essay, Is to start by blurting out everything. That's what this is."

## Implementation Approach

"I'd be curious to take this whole thing. And free to fight. And not free to five, but strategically predefined. You know what I mean? Because I think what we can do is strip down a lot of the structure here by, like, 50 to 30%. Maybe even 60 to 70%. But if we do so, we agree that when something breaks or something missing or is needed, We can add it and discuss incorporating it."

"Basically, there are systems. That should just be intentionally left unknown. And be like, we'll figure it out when it's time. And whoever's in charge of that project should be the one leading the charge to figure it out. So it should be, like, intentionally, like, just enough based on what's available."

## Key Specific Changes

- Chapter 8: "In chapter eight, remove the six week cycle. Because for now, Shokuna is not going to do a lot of product development."
- Chapter 10 (Growth Philosophy): "the AI stuff is currently a little bit not well thought out. It's a little too. It's just not thoughtful... It's not meant to eliminate work. It's more to amplify your existing thinking."
- Trust batteries: "I'd actually be interested in how you would suggest how to track trust batteries monthly. But really, keep it simple. And elegant... it's more of like a recommended way because it's more like something that should be a backup mind thing that is brought up for discussion."
- Everyone coaches everyone: "For the everyone coaches. Everyone include an example that's more of a story. And less about levels. The levels is more of, like, an internal concept."
