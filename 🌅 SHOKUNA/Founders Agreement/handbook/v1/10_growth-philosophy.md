# Chapter 10: Growth Philosophy

Our default answer to hiring is no.

## Hiring Resistance

Before adding anyone, we ask four questions in order:

1. **Can we eliminate this work entirely?**  
   Often the answer is yes. That feature request, that process, that report—do we really need it?

2. **Can AI or automation handle it?**  
   One hour with AI can often replace what used to need a full-time person.

3. **Can we change our process to avoid it?**  
   Sometimes the problem isn't the work but how we've organized things.

4. **Can existing team absorb it with better tools?**  
   Give people leverage, not more bodies.

Only if all four answers are "no" do we consider hiring.

## Why Small Wins

### Communication Paths Explode
- 3 people = 3 communication paths
- 5 people = 10 paths
- 10 people = 45 paths
- 20 people = 190 paths

Each new person adds complexity, not just capacity.

### Quality Beats Quantity
Three excellent people outperform ten good ones. Every time. Less coordination, clearer ownership, faster decisions, better work.

### Culture Stays Strong
It's easier to maintain our direct communication, high trust, contribution-focused culture with fewer people who deeply get it.

## When We Do Add People

### Start with Commission Work
Many new relationships begin project-based:
- Demand scouts on 5-10% commission
- Implementation specialists per project
- Workshop facilitators as needed

This tests:
- Work quality
- Cultural fit
- Reliability
- Growth potential

Though experienced operators with proven track records may start at higher levels based on the value they can immediately deliver.

### Level 2 Before Level 3
Most contributors prove value at pure profit share before qualifying for insurance. This protects both parties from mismatched expectations. Some may qualify for Level 3 immediately based on their experience and the specific value they bring.

### The 90-Day Roadmap
Before bringing someone to Level 2 or higher:
- Define exactly what success looks like
- Create specific 30/60/90 day milestones
- Identify who will mentor them
- Document what they'll own

Without this clarity, don't hire.

## Building Resilience Without Headcount

### Every AOR Has a Backup
Single points of failure kill companies. For each area:
- Primary owner (Level 3+)
- Trained backup who can cover
- Documentation anyone can follow
- Regular "vacation tests"

### Documentation as Infrastructure
The second time you do something, document it. This creates:
- Institutional memory
- Training materials
- AI learning data
- Reduced bus factor

Good documentation means needing fewer people.

### Cross-Training Through Rotation

Every quarter, practice backup coverage:
- Sales person learns synthesis basics
- Methodology expert takes client calls
- Operations helps with delivery

This builds resilience and empathy.

### The Wiki Mindset
Our knowledge wiki isn't a nice-to-have. It's critical infrastructure. Every process, every template, every learning lives there. New people self-serve. AI trains on it. Knowledge compounds.

## AI as Thinking Amplifier

Before asking for help or hiring, ask yourself: "Could I do this myself if I had more time? Can AI amplify my ability to do it?"

AI doesn't eliminate work—it amplifies your existing thinking and capabilities. We use AI to:
- Accelerate synthesis without losing nuance
- See patterns human eyes might miss
- Maintain quality while moving faster
- Free mental capacity for strategic decisions

The constraint becomes intentionality, not capability. AI gives you leverage to do what only you can do, better and faster.

## Growth Metrics That Matter

### Not This
- Headcount
- Office size
- Revenue per employee
- Management layers

### But This
- Revenue per contributor
- Profit per person
- Knowledge documented
- Processes automated
- Client impact delivered

We measure leverage, not size.

## Saying No to the Wrong Growth

### Client Work We Refuse
- Projects that need armies of analysts
- Work requiring geographic presence
- Clients wanting staff augmentation
- Engagements requiring >3 people

### Internal Work We Won't Do
- Building features for edge cases
- Creating process for process sake
- Hiring for potential future needs
- Adding management layers

### The Cost of Yes
Every yes to hiring means:
- More coordination
- Diluted culture
- Slower decisions
- Higher overhead
- Less profit to share

## When Someone Leaves

Don't immediately backfill. Instead:
1. Redistribute critical work
2. Eliminate non-critical work
3. Run for at least a month
4. Only hire if truly breaking

Often you discover the role wasn't needed. Or that AI can handle it. Or that a process change eliminates it.

## The Long-Term Vision

In 10 years, we want:
- Same size team (or smaller)
- 10x the impact
- 10x the profit per person
- Industry-leading methodology
- Work we still love

This happens through leverage, not headcount.

## Questions for Growth Decisions

Before any hiring decision:
1. What specific pain does this solve?
2. Have we tried every alternative?
3. Will this make us better or just bigger?
4. Can we maintain our culture?
5. Is this reversible if wrong?

If you can't answer all five confidently, don't hire.

## The Bottom Line

Constraints breed creativity. Small teams force focus. Limited resources demand innovation.

We're building a company that gets more valuable as it gets smarter, not bigger. Every person we add should make everyone else more effective, not just add capacity.

Stay small. Stay focused. Use leverage. That's how we win.
