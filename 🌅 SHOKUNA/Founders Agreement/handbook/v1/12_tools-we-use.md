# Chapter 12: Tools We Use

Simple tools, used consistently, beat complex systems every time.

## Core Infrastructure

### Basecamp
Our home for all work. Everything lives here:
- Client projects
- Internal initiatives
- Team communication
- Knowledge repository

**How we use it:**
- One project per client engagement
- Clear naming: "Client Name - JTBD Research"
- All decisions documented in comments
- Files attached to relevant discussions
- Daily updates in designated threads

**What we don't use it for:**
- Real-time chat
- Personal tasks
- Calendar scheduling

### Hey.com
External email that stays manageable:
- Client communication
- Vendor relationships
- Public inquiries

**Our email philosophy:**
- Respond same day to clients
- Batch process twice daily
- Use "Reply Later" liberally
- Screen aggressively

### AI Tools
Individual choice, collective learning. Team members use:
- ChatGPT/Claude for synthesis
- Perplexity for research
- GitHub Copilot for automation
- Custom tools as needed

**Sharing what works:**
- Document effective prompts
- Share custom instructions
- Build reusable workflows
- Train each other

## Financial Systems

### Monthly Tracking
Simple spreadsheet tracking:
- Revenue by project
- Contribution by person
- Expenses by category
- Profit to distribute

**Transparency rules:**
- Everyone sees everything
- Updated by 5th of month
- Questions encouraged
- No hidden calculations

### Quarterly Distribution
Clear process for profit sharing:
- Contribution percentages agreed
- Insurance obligations noted
- Distribution calculated
- Payments processed by 15th

## Meeting Excellence

### The ACT Structure
Every meeting follows this format:

**Accountability (10 min)**
- Previous commitments: Yes or No
- If No: Why and what habit prevents recurrence
- Next commitments declared

**Coaching (20 min)**
- Issues raised with proposed solutions
- Group problem-solving
- Resources identified

**Transparency (10 min)**
- "Like/Wish That" feedback
- Trust battery checks
- Appreciation shared

### Meeting Tools
- Video calls via Zoom/Google Meet
- Shared agenda in Basecamp
- Timer visible to all
- Notes posted after

## Knowledge Management

### The Wiki
Living repository of how we work:
- Process documentation
- Templates and frameworks
- Client learnings
- Method innovations

**Wiki rules:**
- Document on second use
- Update when things change
- Link liberally
- Search before creating

### Templates That Evolve
Starting points, not rigid rules:
- Interview guides
- Synthesis frameworks
- Report structures
- Email templates

Use them, improve them, share updates.

## Communication Tools

### Asynchronous First
- Basecamp for all work discussion
- Loom for complex explanations
- Written documentation default
- Meetings as last resort

### When Synchronous
- Client interviews (obviously)
- Quarterly planning
- Crisis management
- Relationship building

### Never Email For
- Project decisions
- Work discussions
- File sharing
- Feedback

## System Health Dashboard

Track what matters monthly:
- % of AORs documented
- % of processes in wiki
- % of templates updated
- % of meetings under 30 min

**Green/Yellow/Red indicators:**
- Green: System working well
- Yellow: Needs attention
- Red: Blocking progress

## Tool Selection Criteria

Before adopting any new tool:

1. **Does it solve a real pain?**
   Not theoretical, but actual current friction

2. **Is it simpler than current option?**
   Complexity compounds dangerously

3. **Does whole team need it?**
   Individual tools = individual choice

4. **Can we commit to using it?**
   Half-adopted tools create chaos

5. **Is the cost justified?**
   Both money and time investment

## What We Don't Use

As important as what we do use:
- No Slack (creates false urgency)
- No complex project management software
- No time tracking
- No employee surveillance
- No feature-bloated platforms

## Personal Productivity

Team members choose their own:
- Task managers
- Note systems  
- Calendar tools
- Development environments

Share what works, don't mandate systems.

## Regular Tool Reviews

Quarterly we ask:
- What tools cause friction?
- What manual work could be automated?
- What complexity could be eliminated?
- What tools do we barely use?

Then we simplify ruthlessly.

## Security Basics

Non-negotiable practices:
- Password manager required
- 2FA on critical systems
- Regular backups
- No shared passwords
- Client data encrypted

Simple security beats complex systems people bypass.

## Integration Philosophy

Tools should enhance our work, not define it. We integrate sparingly:
- Only automate stable processes
- Keep manual override options
- Document all integrations
- Test regularly

## The Meta Tool: Documentation

The most important tool is discipline:
- Write things down
- Keep things current
- Make things findable
- Share things freely

Without this, all other tools fail.

## Future Tools

As we grow, we'll need:
- Contract automation
- Advanced analytics
- Enhanced AI capabilities
- Better async video tools

We'll adopt them using the same criteria: simple, necessary, committed.

## The Bottom Line

Tools serve the work, not vice versa. We choose boring reliability over exciting complexity. We use tools consistently rather than constantly switching.

The best system is the one everyone actually uses.
