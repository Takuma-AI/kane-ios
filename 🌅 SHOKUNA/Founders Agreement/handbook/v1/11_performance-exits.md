# Chapter 11: Performance & Exits

Address problems early. Support improvement always. Exit with grace when necessary.

## Transparent Feedback Culture

We don't save feedback for annual reviews. We share it constantly.

### Monthly "Like/Wish That" Exchanges

Last Friday of each month, in addition to trust battery checks, exchange feedback:

**Like:** "I like how you handled the client's concerns about timeline. You were direct but reassuring."

**Wish That:** "I wish that you'd flag blockers earlier. Waiting until the last week creates unnecessary stress."

This format keeps feedback specific, actionable, and balanced.

### Focus on Behaviors, Not Personality

✓ "When you interrupt during client calls, it undermines their confidence in us"  
✗ "You're rude"

✓ "Your synthesis identified patterns I hadn't seen"  
✗ "You're smart"

Behaviors can change. Personality attacks just create defensiveness.

### Document Patterns, Not Incidents

One missed deadline happens. Three missed deadlines is a pattern. We address:
- Specific examples
- Impact on team/clients
- Needed behavior change
- Support available

## When Things Aren't Working

### Performance Gaps

Problems rarely surprise anyone. By the time performance is formally addressed, everyone knows something's off. Here's our process:

**Week 1: Direct Conversation**
- Specific gap identified
- Examples provided
- Expectations clarified
- Support offered

**Week 2-4: Written Improvement Plan**
- Clear success metrics
- Specific timeline
- Resources available
- Weekly check-ins

**Day 30-60: Decision Point**
- Measurable improvement → Continue with support
- Some progress → Extend 30 days
- No improvement → Transition planning

### For Insurance Holders

Insurance creates additional accountability:

**Quarter 1:** Normal contribution tracking
**Quarter 2:** If below insurance level, formal warning
**Quarter 3-4:** Improvement support and monitoring
**Month 12:** Insurance revoked if gap persists

The higher the level, the higher the bar.

## Supporting Improvement

We want people to succeed. When someone struggles, we provide:

### Structured Support
- Clear improvement targets
- Regular check-ins
- Skill development resources
- Reduced workload if needed

### Coaching Resources
- Peer mentoring
- External training budget
- Time for skill building
- Regular feedback loops

### Honest Timelines
- 30 days for simple fixes
- 60 days for behavior change
- 90 days for skill development
- Clear endpoint either way

## Exit Protocols

Sometimes it doesn't work out. We handle exits professionally.

### Voluntary Exits

**90-Day Transition Period**
- Knowledge transfer requirements
- Project completion/handoff
- Documentation updates
- Continued profit share

**Negotiated Terms**
- Buyout calculations for Level 4
- Insurance reconciliation
- Non-compete considerations
- Reference agreements

### Involuntary Exits

**30-Day Minimum Transition**
- Immediate AOR transfer
- Critical knowledge capture
- Clean project handoffs
- Professional references

**Severance Philosophy**
- Minimum 2 months for Level 3+
- Pro-rated quarterly profit share
- Insurance reconciliation
- Health coverage transition

### Exit Interviews

Everyone who leaves gets asked:
- What worked well?
- What needed improvement?
- Would you recommend Shokuna?
- What should we change?

We learn from every departure.

## Special Circumstances

### Performance During Life Events
Life happens. When someone faces personal challenges:
- Acknowledge the situation
- Adjust expectations temporarily
- Provide flexibility
- Reassess when stable

Performance standards don't disappear, but humanity comes first.

### Cultural Misalignment
Sometimes skilled people don't fit our culture. Signs include:
- Resisting direct communication
- Creating politics
- Hoarding information
- Undermining trust

Cultural fit matters more than skill. Address quickly.

### The Brilliant Jerk Problem
No amount of brilliance justifies destroying team cohesion. We'd rather have collaborative competence than toxic genius. One warning, then exit.

## Learning from Turnover

Every exit teaches us something:

### Patterns We Track
- Why people leave
- When they leave (tenure)
- Where they go
- What they say

### Process Improvements
- Better hiring filters
- Clearer expectations
- Earlier intervention
- Stronger culture

### No Shame in Mismatches
Not every hire works out. Not every person fits forever. What matters:
- We tried honestly
- We learned something
- We parted professionally
- Both sides can speak well of the experience

## Re-Engagement

Good people sometimes leave for the wrong reasons. We welcome back contributors who:
- Left on good terms
- Gained valuable experience
- Still fit our culture
- Can contribute immediately

Pride has no place in business decisions.

## Prevention Through Culture

The best exit is the one that doesn't happen. We prevent unnecessary turnover through:

### Clear Expectations
- Role clarity from day one
- Regular contribution tracking
- Consistent feedback
- No surprise standards

### Growth Opportunities
- Skill development support
- Increasing responsibility
- Path to higher levels
- Learning from everyone

### Sustainable Pace
- 30 focused hours standard
- Real vacations
- Life flexibility
- No burnout culture

## The Bottom Line

Performance management isn't about punishment. It's about clarity, support, and honest decisions.

Most people want to do great work. Our job is to create conditions where they can. When that doesn't happen despite real effort, we part ways professionally.

No surprises. No politics. No drawn-out suffering. Just honest communication and human respect.
