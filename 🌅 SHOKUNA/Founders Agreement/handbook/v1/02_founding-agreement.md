# Chapter 2: The Founding Agreement

This chapter constitutes our binding agreement. It defines how we operate and stay aligned.

## Founding Principles

1. **Mission First.** We exist to help customers understand their customers through Jobs-to-be-Done.
2. **Contribution Drives Compensation.** Your profit share reflects the value you create.
3. **No Outside Investment.** We stay independent to maintain our values.
4. **Stay Small, Impact Big.** Quality over quantity in everything we do.
5. **Document Everything.** Transparency and knowledge capture are non-negotiable.

## Current Structure

**Legal Entity:** LLC  
**Ownership:** Neal SÃ¡les-Griffin (50%), Lilliana Robinson (50%)  
**Decision Rights:** 51% agreement required for major changes  
**Profit Distribution:** Quarterly, based on contribution scoring

## The Insurance System

We don't pay salaries. Instead, we offer an insurance system for qualified contributors.

### How Insurance Works

Insurance is actually a zero-interest loan from the company. To qualify, you must have contributed approximately 75% of the requested amount in the prior year.

**Example:**
- Year 1: You contribute $150k in value
- Year 2: You can request up to $200k insurance (133% of prior year)
- Year 2: You take $200k insurance but only contribute $180k
- Result: You owe the company $20k
- Year 3: You contribute $250k but receive $230k (after $20k repayment)

This system ensures everyone has skin in the game while providing financial stability for proven contributors.

### Insurance Rules

1. We track contribution value every quarter
2. After one year, you can request insurance for the following year
3. Insurance cannot exceed 133% of your prior year's average contribution
4. Insurance is paid monthly but reconciled quarterly against actual contribution
5. Any shortfall becomes a debt you owe the company

### Accountability Measures

**Quarterly Review.** We compare your actual contribution to insurance taken.

**6-Month Warning.** If you're trending below your insurance level, you get a formal warning and support to improve.

**12-Month Revocation.** If the gap persists after warning, insurance rights are revoked. You return to pure profit share until re-qualified.

### Special Situations

**Founders** have insurance rights from company inception.

**Medical Leave/New Parents** can request temporary adjustments.

**Sabbaticals** pause both insurance payments and contribution requirements.

## Binding Commitments

By signing this agreement, founders commit to:

1. Operating according to these principles
2. Conducting quarterly contribution reviews with radical honesty
3. Resolving conflicts through direct conversation
4. Maintaining trust through complete transparency
5. Evolving this handbook as we learn
6. Acting decisively when opportunities present themselves

## Amendment Process

Any founder can propose changes to this agreement. Major changes require 51% vote. Minor operational updates can be made by consensus. We review effectiveness quarterly.

## Financial Reality Check

Product development won't generate meaningful revenue anytime soon. We're not raising venture capital. This means consulting excellence funds everything for at least the next two years. Products are a long-term aspiration, not a short-term distraction.

## The Bottom Line

This agreement ensures we're building the same company with the same values. It provides a framework for decision-making and conflict resolution. No surprises, no hidden agendas, just clear expectations that evolve as we grow.
