# Chapter 14: Living Document

This handbook represents our best current thinking. It will evolve as we learn.

## Evolution Process

### Quarterly Reviews
Every quarter, during our planning session, we ask:
- What's working well?
- What's causing friction?
- What have we learned?
- What needs updating?

Changes come from experience, not theory.

### Anyone Can Propose Changes
See something that doesn't match reality? Propose an update:
1. Document the issue
2. Suggest specific changes
3. Explain the why
4. Bring to quarterly review

The best ideas come from daily practice.

### Testing Changes
We don't change everything at once:
1. Identify the friction
2. Propose small experiment
3. Test for one quarter
4. Measure the results
5. Adopt, adapt, or abandon

Small experiments reduce risk.

### Major vs. Minor Updates
**Minor updates** (typos, clarifications, tool changes):
- Anyone can propose
- Consensus sufficient
- Immediate implementation

**Major changes** (principles, structures, compensation):
- Require 51% ownership vote
- Full quarter discussion
- Clear transition plan

## Sacred Unchangeables

Some things define who we are. These require unanimous consent to change:

### 1. Mission to Help Customers Understand Customers
We exist for Jobs-to-be-Done insights. Everything else serves this mission.

### 2. Profit Sharing Reflects Contribution  
Your rewards match your value creation. No politics, no tenure-based pay, no entitlements.

### 3. No Outside Investment Ever
We stay independent. No VCs, no private equity, no loss of control. Ever.

### 4. Quality Over Quantity Always
Better to do less excellently than more adequately. In client work, team size, and everything else.

### 5. Documentation and Transparency
If it matters, we write it down. If it affects others, we share it. No secret knowledge.

## What Changes

Everything else adapts to reality:

### Tools and Systems
As better options emerge, we adopt them. Basecamp might become something else. AI will certainly evolve. What matters is the function, not the specific tool.

### Processes and Rhythms
Six-week cycles might become eight. Daily check-ins might become weekly. We optimize for effectiveness.

### Levels and Structures
The four-level system might need five. AORs will definitely multiply and divide. Structure serves the work.

### Specific Practices
Meeting formats, documentation templates, communication patterns—all can improve with experience.

## How to Read This Handbook

### For New Contributors
Read it all once to understand the whole. Then reference specific chapters as needed. Ask questions about anything unclear.

### For Current Team
Review your area's chapters quarterly. Flag mismatches between documentation and reality. Propose improvements.

### For Future Partners
This shows how we think, not rigid rules. Expect evolution, but understand the core won't change.

## Version Control

We maintain versions to track evolution:
- Date of major updates
- Summary of changes
- Rationale for changes
- Who proposed/approved

Not for bureaucracy, but for learning.

## The Ultimate Test

Every quarter we ask four questions:

### 1. Client Success
Are we producing exceptional client outcomes? If not, what needs to change?

### 2. Life Quality  
Are we building lives we're proud of? If not, what's broken?

### 3. Calm Operations
Are we operating without drama? If not, where's the friction?

### 4. Continuous Improvement
Are we getting better? If not, what's stagnant?

If we answer "yes" to all four, we're succeeding. If not, we evolve.

## Cultural DNA

This handbook captures our cultural DNA, but culture lives in daily actions:
- How we treat each other
- How we handle problems
- How we celebrate wins
- How we learn from failures

The handbook documents culture; it doesn't create it.

## Future Chapters

As we grow, new chapters might emerge:
- International Operations
- Product Development
- The Dojo Structure
- Alumni Network

We'll add them when reality demands, not before.

## Your Role

This is your handbook too. You're responsible for:
- Living these principles
- Flagging disconnects
- Proposing improvements
- Teaching newcomers

Passive compliance kills culture. Active engagement builds it.

## The Meta Principle

The only constant is change. The handbook that perfectly serves three people won't work for ten. The practices that work today might fail tomorrow.

What matters:
- Clear principles
- Honest assessment  
- Willingness to adapt
- Commitment to improve

## Final Thought

We're building something special—a company where:
- Work doesn't feel like work
- Contribution drives rewards
- People matter more than process
- Excellence is sustainable

This handbook is our current best attempt to codify how. It will get better as we do.

Keep what serves the mission. Change what doesn't. Always be learning.

That's how we build a company worth building.
