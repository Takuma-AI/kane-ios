# Chapter 6: Tracking Contribution

We separate project execution from financial rewards to encourage honest learning.

## The Quarterly Model

During the quarter, we focus on doing great work. At the end of the quarter, we assess contribution. This separation prevents gaming the system and keeps us focused on what matters: delivering value.

### During the Quarter

**Daily Basecamp Check-ins**
Post what you shipped today. Not what you worked on—what you completed. Keep it brief but specific.

**Weekly "What I Shipped" Summaries**
Every Friday, summarize your week's concrete outputs. This creates a record we can reference during quarterly reviews.

**Project Post-Mortems**
After each project milestone, we ask: What worked? What didn't? What did we learn? Focus on improvement, not blame.

**Documentation of Innovations**
When you create something new—a process, a template, an insight—document it immediately. Your innovation becomes everyone's capability.

## Making Contribution Visible

Good updates are specific and measurable:

✓ "Delivered Brand Strategy report for SocialInsider ($30k project value)"
✓ "Created reusable interview synthesis template now used by whole team"
✓ "Mentored new demand scout—their response rate improved from 5% to 15%"

Not vague activity reports:

✗ "Worked on client stuff"
✗ "Had some meetings"
✗ "Made progress on various things"

## The Quarterly Review Process

We block half a day every quarter for comprehensive review.

### 1. Project Review (90 minutes)

We answer three questions:
- What did we complete?
- What did we learn?
- How did we improve?

Each person presents their quarter's work. No PowerPoints—just honest discussion of what shipped and what it taught us.

### 2. Contribution Assessment (60 minutes)

Individual presentations of quarterly impact across three dimensions:

**Client Impact (40%)**
- Deliverables completed
- Revenue generated
- Client satisfaction
- Quality of insights delivered

**Business Building (30%)**
- Systems created or improved
- Knowledge documented
- Capabilities developed
- Processes streamlined

**Team Amplification (30%)**
- Others helped to succeed
- Knowledge shared
- Trust batteries charged
- Culture strengthened

### 3. Financial Distribution (30 minutes)

Based on contribution assessment:
- Reach consensus on contribution percentages
- Consider insurance obligations
- Calculate profit distribution
- Document for transparency

### 4. Planning Ahead (30 minutes)

- Set priorities for next quarter
- Identify process improvements
- Declare insurance requests for next year
- Commit to specific outcomes

## How We Track

We keep it simple. No complex software or time tracking.

**Individual Tracking**
- Use whatever personal system works for you
- Just make outputs visible to the team
- Focus on results, not activity

**Team Visibility**
- Basecamp for all project work
- Weekly summaries in one place
- Quarterly contribution in shared doc
- Financial results transparent to all

## Contribution Components Explained

### Client Impact
This is the direct value you create for clients. It includes:
- Completed projects and their quality
- Revenue from deals closed
- Client retention and satisfaction
- Referrals generated

### Business Building
This is how you make the company stronger. It includes:
- New methodologies developed
- Tools and systems created
- Processes documented
- Capabilities expanded

### Team Amplification
This is how you make others better. It includes:
- Mentoring and coaching
- Knowledge sharing
- Collaboration quality
- Trust building

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**Don't Track Activity**
Hours worked don't matter. Meetings attended don't matter. What matters is what you ship and how it impacts our mission.

**Don't Game the System**
The three-component model prevents gaming. You can't just close deals (Client Impact) without helping others (Team Amplification) or building systems (Business Building).

**Don't Compete Internally**
This isn't zero-sum. When you help others succeed, your Team Amplification score increases. Everyone wins when anyone wins.

**Don't Hide Problems**
Surface issues early. "I'm struggling with X" during the quarter beats "I didn't deliver X" at quarter end.

## Recognition Beyond Money

Financial distribution is just one form of recognition. We also:
- Celebrate wins publicly
- Share learnings openly
- Give credit generously
- Build on each other's work

## Special Circumstances

**New Contributors**
First quarter is learning. We assess contribution but weight it knowing you're still ramping up.

**Project Delays**
Sometimes client projects slip quarters. We account for work done even if final delivery is later.

**Innovation Time**
Building new capabilities counts as contribution even if it doesn't generate immediate revenue.

## The Bottom Line

We track contribution to ensure fairness, not to create competition. The goal is transparency about value created, not surveillance of activity.

Ship great work. Help others succeed. Build lasting capabilities. Do these three things and contribution takes care of itself.
