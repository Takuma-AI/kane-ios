# Chapter 5: Areas of Responsibility

Every business function has exactly one owner. Shared responsibility is no responsibility.

## The One Owner Rule

When several people share responsibility for something, it often doesn't get done well—or at all. That's why every area in our company has a single Directly Responsible Individual (DRI).

The DRI for an area:
- Makes final decisions
- Is accountable for outcomes
- Can delegate tasks (but not responsibility)
- Must be reachable
- Updates on progress

Only Level 3+ contributors can be primary DRIs. Level 2 contributors can serve as backups.

## How Our Areas Connect

Here's how all our areas work together to achieve our mission:

```

                       ↓
                [Documentation]
```

Each area supports and depends on others, but each has one clear owner.

## How to Use This System

### When You Have a Question
1. Check the AOR list (this chapter)
2. Contact the DRI directly
3. If urgent and DRI unavailable, contact their backup
4. If no backup exists, contact a Level 4 partner

### When Something Falls Through Cracks
1. Identify what area it should belong to
2. Propose to that area's DRI
3. If unclear, bring to quarterly review
4. Update this chapter once decided

### When You Want to Own an Area
1. Reach Level 3 contributor status
2. Identify an area needing better ownership
3. Propose taking it on at quarterly review
4. Create 90-day improvement plan
5. Execute and prove capability

## Backup Coverage

Every DRI must have a documented backup who can cover for:
- Vacations
- Illness
- Emergencies
- Eventual transitions

The backup should:
- Shadow the DRI quarterly
- Have access to all relevant systems
- Understand key processes
- Be able to make decisions if needed

## Evolution Over Time

As we grow, areas will split and specialize. What matters:
- Single ownership remains sacred
- New areas get clear boundaries
- Interactions stay documented
- Mission alignment stays central

## The Bottom Line

This isn't about hierarchy or power. It's about clarity and accountability. When everyone knows who owns what, work flows smoothly. When ownership is unclear, everything slows down.

Own your area completely. Support others in theirs. That's how we build something special together.
