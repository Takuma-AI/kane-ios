# Chapter 1: What Shokuna Does

Be the blade they reach for.

## Our Purpose

Most products fail because they chase wants, not struggles. We don't.

The market is noisier than ever. Founders chase trends and ship products without understanding the why. They throw spaghetti at the wall, building stuff nobody actually needs. Faster AI shipping only strengthens this supply-side temptation.

Talk is cheap. People don't lie with their wallets.

Shokuna exists to change this. We help companies deeply understand their customers through Jobs-to-be-Done methodology. But our mission goes beyond individual client success. We're cultivating a new generation of builders who care—entrepreneurs and operators who use a jobs lens to create more thoughtful products and experiences.

The world deserves better builders. Builders focused on one thing: helping customers make real progress.

## What We Do

We listen for the hire. Through 10-12 casual conversations with people who actually switched. Friendly on the surface. Forensic underneath.

We map the forces. We diagram the demand—what pushed them forward, what held them back, what made them move.

We apply the insight. No decks. No fluff. Just sharp sessions that cut straight into your roadmap, pricing, and copy.

Most companies have personas, demographics, and feature requests. They think they know their customers. But they're missing the underlying job that drives purchase decisions. That's where we come in.

## A Real Project: SocialInsider

SocialInsider, a social media analytics platform, came to us with a hypothesis: their self-serve customers use the platform for "competition benchmarking." They needed to validate this and understand what drives trial-to-paid conversion.

Our six-week engagement delivered:
- 12-15 deep customer interviews
- Clear learning objectives aligned to business questions
- Pattern identification across customer segments
- 3-5 core jobs their customers are trying to get done
- Conversion insights they couldn't see from inside their product
- Hands-on JTBD training for their team

The project revealed that customers had completely different success metrics than SocialInsider assumed. Now they know what actually drives purchasing decisions and can build and market accordingly.

## The Three Levels of Our Work

### Level 1: Demand Discovery
This is our core consulting work today. Six-week engagements where we interview your customers, synthesize insights, and deliver actionable findings. We also train your team in JTBD methodology so you can eventually do this work yourself.

### Level 2: The Dojo
Teaching JTBD to the world—but not just as another methodology. Like martial arts, innovation isn't magic or guesswork. It's a craft requiring care and discipline. We're structuring this craft into clear levels of mastery.

Through workshops, certification programs, and community building, we're creating a dojo for thoughtful builders. The goal is to empower multiple generations of entrepreneurs who build from a deep understanding of customer progress, not trend-chasing.

### Level 3: Living the Method
Eventually, we'll build our own products to push the boundaries of JTBD thinking. Consulting is how we hone the craft and build the foundation. The long game is to scale these principles through product innovation.

We'll never be the best at teaching JTBD unless we're living it ourselves—facing the real struggles of product development, not just observing from the outside.

## How We're Different

**AI-Amplified.** We use AI to do more with less. Interview synthesis that used to take weeks happens in days. Pattern recognition that required teams of consultants now needs just a few sharp minds with the right tools.

**Practitioner-Led.** Everyone at Shokuna masters JTBD methodology. When you hire us, you get us - not junior analysts doing the real work while partners play golf.

**Calm Philosophy.** We've built work that doesn't feel like work. 30-40 focused hours per week beats 80 hours of burnout. No manufactured urgency. Deep thinking over busy work.

**Selective Service.** We only work with clients we believe in. If we don't think your product creates real value for customers, we'll tell you upfront. Life's too short for bullshit projects.

## Who We Serve

Our best clients share these traits:
- They've hit a growth plateau and need to understand why
- They have real customers (not just an idea)
- They're willing to be surprised by what customers actually want
- They'll act on insights, not file them away

Recent clients include SaaS companies, marketplaces, and enterprise software providers who know they need to get closer to their customers but don't know how.

## What Success Looks Like

When we succeed, our clients:
- Close bigger deals because they understand the job customers are trying to get done
- Build features that actually matter instead of what's loudly requested
- Write messaging that resonates with real customer struggles
- Make strategic decisions grounded in customer reality

More importantly, they internalize JTBD thinking. They stop guessing what customers want and start knowing what progress they're trying to make.

## The Future We're Building

We're creating a company where:
- Consulting excellence funds our experiments
- Every project makes us better at our craft
- We wake up excited about the problems we're solving
- Brilliant people come together to create something special

But beyond our company, we're building toward a bigger future:
- A world where builders start with customer progress, not feature lists
- Where innovation is a disciplined craft, not lucky guesswork
- Where entrepreneurs build what matters, not what's trendy
- Where thoughtful products win over fast followers

We're not trying to be the biggest JTBD consultancy. We're building the dojo that creates better builders—one client, one workshop, one breakthrough at a time.

Off the radar. On the mark.
