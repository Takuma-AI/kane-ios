# Chapter 7: Communication Rhythms

Structure enables freedom. Clear rhythms let us work autonomously while staying aligned.

## Daily Practice

### The Check-in
End each day by posting what you shipped in Basecamp. Keep it brief but specific. This isn't a time log—it's a record of completed work.

Good: "Completed synthesis for 3 SocialInsider interviews, identified pattern around trial conversion friction"
Not helpful: "Worked on interviews"

### Deep Work Blocks
Protect at least 2 hours of uninterrupted focus daily. Morning is best for most people. During deep work:
- Basecamp notifications off
- No meetings
- No "quick questions"
- Phone in another room

### Communication Windows
Check and respond to messages at set times:
- Morning after deep work
- After lunch
- End of day

The world won't end if you take 2 hours to respond.

## Weekly Flow

### Monday: Week Planning
Post your intentions for the week in Basecamp by 10am. What are the 3-5 concrete things you'll ship? This helps others plan around your work.

### Wednesday: Mid-Week Check
Quick assessment: Are you on track? Need help? Flag issues now, not Friday. A 5-minute post can save a week of misdirection.

### Friday: "What I Shipped"
Summarize your week's concrete outputs. Celebrate wins. Note learnings. This becomes the record we reference during quarterly reviews.

### Meeting-Free Time
At least 3 days per week should have zero meetings. Batch necessary meetings to maximize uninterrupted days. We suggest:
- Tuesday: Internal meetings
- Thursday: External meetings
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Deep work

## Monthly Touchpoints

### Trust Battery Check
Last Friday of each month, reflect:
- How are your working relationships?
- Any batteries below 30%?
- What conversations need to happen?

### Energy Audit
Track what energized vs. drained you:
- Are you hitting 75% energizing work?
- What needs to shift?
- What should you hand off?

### Process Documentation
If you explained something twice this month, document it. If you did something twice, create a process. Future you will thank current you.

## Quarterly Intensives

### The Full Review
Half-day session covering:
- Project retrospective
- Contribution assessment
- Financial distribution
- Next quarter planning

### Handbook Evolution
What in this handbook needs updating based on what we learned? Every quarter we get smarter. The handbook should too.

### System Health Check
Review our communication rhythms:
- What's working?
- What's causing friction?
- What should we experiment with?

## Communication Defaults

### Async First
Default to asynchronous communication. Write it in Basecamp where others can read and respond when ready. This respects everyone's deep work time.

### Write It Down
If it matters, write it. Verbal agreements get forgotten. Written agreements create clarity. When in doubt, document.

### Meetings as Last Resort
Before scheduling a meeting, ask:
- Can this be a Basecamp post?
- Can this be a recorded video?
- Can this wait for our regular check-in?

If you must meet:
- 30 minutes maximum
- Written agenda in advance
- Clear owner and outcomes
- Follow up with written summary

## Boundaries That Work

### Response Time Expectations
- Basecamp posts: Within 24 hours
- Non-urgent questions: Within a day
- Urgent issues: Call directly (rare)
- Client communication: Same day

### After Hours
No expectation of response after 7pm or on weekends. Real urgency is rare. Most "urgent" things can wait until morning.

### Vacation Means Vacation
When someone's off, they're off. No "quick questions." No "when you get back." True disconnection enables true recharge.

## Tools We Use

### Basecamp
Our home base for all work:
- Projects live here
- Updates happen here
- Decisions get documented here
- Knowledge accumulates here

### Video Messages
Sometimes showing is better than telling. Record quick Loom videos for:
- Complex explanations
- Feedback on visual work
- When personality helps

### Real-Time Chat
We have it but rarely use it. Reserve for:
- True emergencies
- Quick clarifications during deep work on same project
- Social connection

## Special Situations

### Client Communication
Clients get responses same day, even if just acknowledging receipt. Set expectations about our async culture early. Most clients love the thoughtful responses it enables.

### Onboarding New People
First week requires more synchronous time. Pair this with clear documentation so future onboarding needs less hand-holding.

### Crisis Management
When shit hits the fan, we go synchronous. But we define "crisis" narrowly. Most "fires" can wait for our normal rhythms.

## The Meta Rule

These rhythms serve us, we don't serve them. When something consistently doesn't work, we change it. The goal is sustainable productivity, not rigid process.

## The Bottom Line

Good communication rhythms are like breathing—natural, sustainable, life-giving. They should enable deep work, not interrupt it. They should create clarity, not busy work.

Protect your focus. Respect others' time. Write things down. These simple practices enable complex work.
