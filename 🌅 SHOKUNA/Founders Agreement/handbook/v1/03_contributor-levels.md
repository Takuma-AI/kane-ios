# Chapter 3: Contributor Levels

Not everyone starts at the bottom. We recognize experience and proven value.

## How Starting Levels Work

New contributors don't necessarily begin at Level 1. The current ownership partners assess each person's experience, track record, and immediate value to determine their starting level.

Founders may start at Level 4. Experienced operators might enter at Level 2 or 3. Those new to the field typically begin at Level 1. We match your starting point to your proven abilities.

## Level 1: Project Contributors

**Status:** Commission-based specialists working on specific projects.

**Examples:** Demand scouts who find interview candidates, workshop facilitators, implementation specialists.

**Compensation:** Project-specific commissions. For example, demand scouts typically earn 5-10% of project value.

**Rights:** No profit share or voting rights. You're paid for specific deliverables.

**Path Forward:** Prove your value through excellent work to advance to Level 2.

## Level 2: Profit Share Contributors

**Status:** Regular contributors without financial security.

**Compensation:** Pure quarterly profit share based on contribution. No guaranteed income.

**Rights:** Participate in profit distribution and attend quarterly reviews. No voting rights on company decisions.

**Requirements:** Invitation based on proven work quality or prior experience in similar roles.

**Path Forward:** Contribute approximately 75% of your desired annual insurance amount to qualify for Level 3.

## Level 3: Insurance-Eligible Contributors

**Status:** Proven contributors with security option.

**Compensation:** Annual insurance plus quarterly profit share based on contribution above insurance.

**Rights:** Can own Areas of Responsibility (AORs). Vote on operational decisions that affect day-to-day work. Attend all company meetings.

**Requirements:** Prior year contribution of approximately 75% of requested insurance amount.

**Accountability:** If contribution falls below insurance level, you receive a 6-month warning to improve. If the gap persists, insurance rights are revoked after 12 months.

## Level 4: Ownership Partners

**Status:** Co-owners of the business.

**Compensation:** Insurance rights from day one, profit share, and equity stake in the company.

**Rights:** Vote on all decisions. Veto power on critical items like taking investment, major strategy shifts, or new partner additions.

**Requirements:** Either founder status or multiple years of exceptional contribution that makes you irreplaceable to the business.

## How Levels Interact

**Decision Making:** Level 4 partners make strategic decisions. Level 3 contributors own operational decisions within their AORs. Level 2 contributors provide input during quarterly reviews. Level 1 contributors execute defined work.

**Meeting Access:** All levels attend quarterly reviews. Only Levels 3 and 4 attend weekly planning meetings. Level 4 partners have additional ownership meetings as needed.

**Advancement:** Moving up levels requires demonstrated value, not time served. A Level 1 demand scout who consistently delivers high-quality candidates might advance to Level 2 within months. A Level 2 contributor who doesn't increase their value might stay there indefinitely.

## The Non-Zero-Sum Approach

When the company grows from grape to watermelon, everyone benefits. Higher-level contributors coach lower levels to success. We're not competing for a fixed pie - we're growing the pie together.

This means:
- Level 4 partners actively help Level 3s become irreplaceable
- Level 3s train Level 2s to take on more responsibility
- Everyone shares knowledge freely
- Success is collective, not individual

## Special Considerations

**Remote Contributors:** All levels can work remotely. Geography doesn't determine your level.

**Part-Time Contributors:** You can be Level 2 or even Level 3 while working part-time, as long as your contribution justifies it.

**Skill Specialists:** Deep expertise in one area (like JTBD methodology) can qualify you for higher levels even without broad business experience.

## The Bottom Line

Your level reflects your proven contribution and the risk you're willing to take. Higher levels mean more security but also more accountability. Choose the level of commitment that matches your life circumstances and ambitions.
