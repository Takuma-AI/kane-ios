# Chapter 8: Project Management

Name projects for their deliverables, not their activities.

## Output-Driven Lists

Every project gets a Basecamp list named for what it will produce:

✓ "SocialInsider JTBD Report Delivered"  
✓ "Interview Synthesis Template Created"  
✓ "Q3 Financial Analysis Complete"

Not:
✗ "SocialInsider Project Tasks"  
✗ "Working on Templates"  
✗ "Finance Stuff"

When the output ships, archive the list. Progress is binary: not done or done.

## Clear Agreements

Every project starts with painfully specific objectives.

### The Objective Third Party Test

Could a stranger judge whether you succeeded? If not, your agreement isn't clear enough.

**Vague:** "We'll deliver insights next month"  
**Clear:** "We'll deliver a 15-page PDF with 3-5 validated jobs by March 31st"

**Vague:** "We'll improve the interview process"  
**Clear:** "We'll create a reusable interview guide template and test it on 3 projects"

### Elements of Clear Agreements

1. **Specific deliverable** - What exactly will exist when done?
2. **Quality bar** - What makes it good enough to ship?
3. **Due date** - When will it be in client's hands?
4. **Owner** - Who wakes up thinking about this?

Write these down in Basecamp. Reference them throughout the project. Update immediately if anything changes.

## Fixed Time, Variable Scope

Client projects have fixed timelines. Time doesn't extend. Scope does.

### Early Phase: Figuring Things Out
This is the uphill phase. You're solving problems, facing uncertainty, discovering complexities. This is normal. Feeling lost here doesn't mean you're behind.

### Middle Phase: Execution Mode  
Now you know the approach. You're building, creating, synthesizing. Work becomes predictable. Progress accelerates.

### Final Phase: Scope Hammering
Time pressure reveals what's essential. Cut everything that's nice-to-have. Ship the must-haves. Quality stays high by doing less, not by working more.

## Documentation Religion

### Say It Twice? Write It Down
The second time you explain something, stop. Document it immediately. The third explanation should be a link.

### Do It Twice? Create a Process
The second time you do something, document the steps. The third time should follow the playbook.

### Examples of What to Document
- Interview recruitment email templates
- Synthesis frameworks that worked
- Client communication patterns
- Tool configurations
- Anything you'd hate to figure out again

### Where Documentation Lives
- Project templates in Basecamp
- Process docs in our knowledge base
- Reusable assets in shared folders
- Never in chat or email

## Managing Client Projects

### Pre-Project Clarity
Before we start:
- Written objectives passing the third-party test
- Clear learning goals from the client
- Defined deliverables and dates
- Agreed communication cadence

### During the Project
- Weekly written updates (even if "still synthesizing")
- Flag problems immediately, not eventually
- Share work-in-progress for feedback
- Document all scope changes

### Project Completion
- Deliver what we promised
- Capture learnings for next time
- Update our templates and processes
- Celebrate what worked

## Internal Projects

### The Pitch
Internal projects need a one-page pitch:
- What problem does this solve?
- What's the appetite? (time investment)
- What's the output?
- What's not included?

### The Bet
Leadership reviews pitches and places bets. Not every idea gets resourced. That's intentional. Important ideas resurface naturally.

### The Build
Once bet on, projects run like client work:
- Clear owner
- Fixed timeline
- Variable scope
- Output-driven tracking

## Breaking Early, Not Late

### Communicate Immediately When:
- You realize you can't meet a deadline
- Scope needs to change
- Quality is at risk
- You need help

### The Earlier, The Better
Day 3: "I'm concerned about X" → Easy to address  
Week 5: "We can't deliver Y" → Crisis mode

First miss gets a clarification conversation. Pattern of late breaks indicates deeper issues.

## No Backlogs

We don't maintain lists of "someday" projects. If an idea is important, it will come up again. If it's not, we've saved the overhead of tracking it.

When planning work, we look at:
- What clients need now
- What would build our capability
- What excites us to work on

Then we commit to a few things and let the rest go.

## Tools and Artifacts

### Basecamp
- One project per client engagement
- Clear project names and descriptions
- All work visible in one place
- Comments for decisions and changes

### Templates That Evolve
- Interview guide templates
- Synthesis frameworks
- Report structures
- Email templates

Use them as starting points, not rigid rules. Update them when you learn something better.

### Progress Indicators
We don't count tasks or track hours. We ask:
- Is the work moving uphill or downhill?
- Will we ship on time?
- What needs to be cut?

## The Bottom Line

Good project management is invisible when it works. Projects ship on time. Clients are happy. Team isn't burned out. Knowledge accumulates.

Name it clearly. Own it completely. Ship it on time. Everything else is just technique.
