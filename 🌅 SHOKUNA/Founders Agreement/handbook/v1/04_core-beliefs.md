# Chapter 4: Core Beliefs

These beliefs shape how we work together.

## Work Doesn't Have to Be Crazy

**30 focused hours is plenty.** Sometimes more, sometimes less, but 30 hours of real focused work beats 80 hours of scattered activity every time.

We use AI to amplify our thinking, not to create more busywork. One hour of AI-enhanced synthesis can produce what used to take days. The goal is effectiveness, not activity.

If you can't fit your work into a reasonable week, we need to get better at choosing what to do, not work longer hours.

## Contribution Is Everything

You're valued for what you ship, not hours logged. Proactive innovation beats reactive execution. Own your area completely - no excuses, full accountability.

This isn't zero-sum thinking. When the company grows from grape to watermelon, everyone benefits. We all get better when any of us gets better. Everyone coaches everyone to success, always.

## The Trust Battery

Every working relationship has a charge level. Here's how it works:

**New relationships start at 50%.** Not zero - we give people the benefit of the doubt. Not 100% - trust is earned through actions.

**Delivering charges the battery.** Do what you say. Communicate problems early. Help others succeed. Each positive interaction adds charge.

**Breaking commitments drains it.** Miss deadlines without warning. Make excuses instead of owning mistakes. Hide problems until they explode. Each negative interaction reduces charge.

### How to Track Trust (A Recommendation)

We don't need a dashboard or spreadsheet. But awareness matters. Here's one simple method:

**Monthly Reflection.** On the last Friday of each month, take 10 minutes to consider:
- Who have I worked closely with this month?
- Where do I feel the trust battery sits? (High/Medium/Low)
- Any relationships below 30% that need attention?

**When Below 30%.** Have a direct conversation. Use the format:
- "I've noticed our collaboration has been challenging lately"
- "Here's what I've experienced..." (specific examples)
- "What's your perspective?"
- "How can we reset?"

This isn't about keeping score. It's about maintaining awareness so small issues don't become big problems.

## Direct Communication Culture

Say what you mean. No subtext, no politics, no reading between the lines.

**When asked for ideas, show up prepared.** Don't delegate your thinking. Come with proposals, not just problems.

**Call out patterns directly.** If something keeps happening, name it. "I've noticed we keep having this same discussion. What's really going on?"

**Nothing moves forward until it's clear.** If you're confused, say so. If others seem confused, check in. Clarity before action, always.

## Feedback as Fuel

We use the **Like/Wish That** framework:

**Like:** "I like how you handled the SocialInsider synthesis. You found patterns I hadn't seen."

**Wish That:** "I wish that you'd share your thinking earlier in the process so we could build on it together."

This keeps feedback specific, actionable, and constructive. No personal attacks, no vague complaints. Just clear observations about what works and what could work better.

## Everyone Coaches Everyone

Here's what this looks like in practice:

*Last week, our newest demand scout was struggling with interview recruitment. Instead of the founders jumping in to fix it, our experienced implementation specialist sat down with them for 30 minutes. "What's been your approach so far?" she asked. Through careful questions, she helped them realize they were sending generic emails instead of personalizing to each prospect. She shared her template but encouraged them to adapt it. By the end of the week, response rates had tripled.*

That's coaching at Shokuna. It's not about hierarchy or levels. It's about:
- Leading with curiosity
- Asking questions before giving answers  
- Sharing what works for you
- Helping others find their own way

Your zone of genius might be someone else's learning edge. Share it freely.

## Sustainable Excellence

We're building careers, not burning out. This means:

**Energy over hours.** Track what gives you energy vs. what drains it. Aim for 75% energizing work.

**Deep work over busy work.** Protect your focus time ruthlessly. Meetings and messages can wait.

**Progress over perfection.** Ship something good today rather than something perfect never.

**Rest as requirement.** Tired people make bad decisions. Take real weekends. Take real vacations.

## The Bottom Line

These aren't aspirational values posted on a wall. They're how we actually operate. When we drift from them, we call it out and correct course.

Work can be calm, trust can be high, feedback can be constructive, and everyone can keep learning. That's the company we're building.
