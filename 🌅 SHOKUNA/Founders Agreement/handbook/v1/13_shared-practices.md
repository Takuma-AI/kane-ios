# Chapter 13: Shared Practices

These aren't requirements. They're practices team members have found helpful. Try what resonates, ignore what doesn't, share what you discover.

## Energy Management

Some of us do monthly energy audits. Here's how:

### The Color-Coding Method
Review your calendar from last month:
- **Green**: Activities that energized you
- **Yellow**: Neutral tasks
- **Red**: Work that drained you

Aim for 75% green time. If you're below 50%, something needs to change.

### Energy Trading
When your red is someone else's green, trade:
- You hate synthesis, they love it
- They dread client calls, you thrive on them
- Swap work when possible
- Everyone wins

### Zone of Genius Mapping
Where do you operate?
1. **Incompetence**: Delegate immediately
2. **Competence**: Transition to others
3. **Excellence**: Do selectively  
4. **Genius**: Maximize time here

One person's zone of incompetence might be another's genius. Share openly about where you thrive.

## Deep Work Strategies

### The Morning Block
Many of us find 6-9am golden for deep work:
- Before the world wakes up
- Before messages arrive
- Before meetings start
- Pure creation time

Not a morning person? Find your equivalent window.

### The Phone Experiment
Try leaving your phone in another room for deep work blocks. The reduction in micro-distractions can be shocking. Some team members report 2x productivity.

### Batch Processing
Instead of constant task-switching:
- Monday mornings: All admin tasks
- Tuesday afternoons: All email responses  
- Friday mornings: All documentation
- Protect the rest for real work

## Learning Practices

### The Weekly Reflection
Every Friday, some of us ask:
- What did I learn this week?
- What patterns did I notice?
- What would I do differently?
- What will I try next week?

Five minutes of reflection beats hours of repeated mistakes.

### Synthesis Partnerships
After interviews, pair up for synthesis:
- Fresh eyes see new patterns
- Discussion surfaces insights
- Teaching deepens understanding
- Faster than solo work

### The Knowledge Cascade
When you learn something useful:
1. Apply it immediately
2. Document it in the wiki
3. Share in next team meeting
4. Teach someone else

Knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied.

## Communication Habits

### The Two-Minute Rule
If it takes less than two minutes:
- Do it now
- Don't add to a list
- Don't defer to later
- Just handle it

This prevents small tasks from becoming big backlogs.

### Write First, Meet Second
Before requesting a meeting:
- Write out your thoughts
- Share in Basecamp
- Let others respond async
- Meet only if still needed

Often the writing process solves the problem.

### The Loom Alternative
Sometimes showing beats telling:
- Record your screen
- Walk through the issue
- Share the video link
- Get better feedback

5-minute video > 30-minute meeting.

## Boundary Setting

### Lunch Is Sacred
Many protect lunch hour completely:
- No meetings
- No "quick calls"
- Real break from screens
- Actual food consumption

You're useless when hangry.

### Weekend Batching
If something "urgent" arrives Friday afternoon:
- Acknowledge receipt
- Set Monday expectation
- Batch with Monday morning work
- Enjoy your weekend

Real emergencies are rare. Most can wait.

### Vacation Discipline
When someone's out, they're out:
- Remove from email threads
- Don't text "quick questions"
- Handle their work or let it wait
- Model the behavior you want

Fake vacations create real burnout.

## Health Practices

### The Walking Meeting
For non-visual discussions:
- Take phone calls while walking
- Think better while moving
- Get exercise during work
- Return energized

Some of our best insights happen on walks.

### Screen Break Rhythms
Every hour:
- Stand up
- Look at something distant
- Move your body
- Breathe deeply

Simple but effective for sustainability.

### The 3pm Slump Solution
Instead of powering through:
- Take 15-minute power nap
- Do light admin tasks
- Go for quick walk
- Save deep work for recovery

Energy management beats time management.

## Financial Practices

### The Contribution Cushion
Some contributors maintain:
- 3-6 months expenses saved
- Lower insurance requests
- More profit share upside
- Reduced financial stress

Not required, but reduces pressure.

### Quarterly Financial Review
Beyond company reviews, some do personal:
- Track contribution trends
- Project next quarter
- Adjust insurance needs
- Plan for goals

Proactive beats reactive.

## Relationship Practices

### The Coffee Roulette
Monthly, some team members:
- Randomly pair up
- Have 30-minute coffee chat
- No agenda needed
- Build connections

Remote doesn't mean isolated.

### Appreciation Practices
End each week by:
- Thanking someone specifically
- Acknowledging help received
- Celebrating others' wins
- Building positive culture

Gratitude is free but valuable.

## Meta Practices

### Experiment Constantly
- Try new tools for a week
- Test different schedules
- Experiment with workflows
- Keep what works

### Share Liberally
When something works for you:
- Document it
- Share with team
- Help others adapt it
- Build collective wisdom

### Stay Curious
- Ask how others work
- Learn from different styles
- Adapt what resonates
- Ignore what doesn't

## The Most Important Practice

Whatever helps you do great work sustainably. That might be:
- 5am starts or 11am starts
- Music or silence
- Home office or coffee shops
- Paper notes or digital tools

The only wrong practice is blindly copying others without testing fit.

## The Bottom Line

These practices emerged from real experience, not theory. They work for some of us, sometimes. Your mileage will vary.

Take what serves you. Leave what doesn't. Add what you discover. The goal is sustainable excellence, not rigid conformity.
