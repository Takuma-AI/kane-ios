# Neal's Response to Lilliana (Concise)

Hey, I sent you this message in Basecamp to make sure my thoughts were clear.

There's no one else I'd rather build this with than you. Everything I do is because I believe in what we're creating together. That's always my starting point.

## We Need a CEO

We're at an impasse over a basic decision with no way to resolve it. Why? Because there's no leader.

The prompt I sent was simple: "If I were CEO, how would I run it?" A thought experiment. No equity promises. No commitments. Just "show us how you think."

The fact this triggered such a strong reaction proves my point. We need someone who can make the call when partners disagree, or we'll be stuck debating while opportunities pass by.

You even questioned whether we need a founders agreement—something I've required from every Techstars founder for six years. That gave me pause.

## Jake Has Earned Respect

Out of 322 founders across 160 companies, Jake is number one. The founder I'd most trust to build something with.

He's not some random third party:
- We were all students together seven years ago
- He's implemented jobs-to-be-done as an actual operator
- Bob Moesta trusts him more than any founder we've worked with
- He brings fresh operating experience we need

Yes, we have concerns about his incentives. That's fair. But respect and evaluation are different things. If there's any chance of working together, it starts with acknowledging what he brings to the table.

The window is closing. Jake's exploring other options. I asked him to share his vision—same as us. We'd be foolish not to see what he thinks.

## Trust Works Both Ways

You went straight to "betrayal" without asking why. No curiosity about my thinking. Just accusations.

Meanwhile, when you suggested treating Jake as an intern after I explicitly asked you not to—that was our first trust breach. Not this.

Trust means assuming good intent. It means respecting different perspectives. It means asking questions before rushing to judgment.

I made a strategic decision based on years of experience. Yes, I should have given you a heads up. But this reaction shows we have deeper issues to work through.

We have something special here. Three people who've grown together for seven years. The chance to build something extraordinary.

The question isn't whether we disagree—it's whether we can disagree productively and keep building. I know we can. Do you?
