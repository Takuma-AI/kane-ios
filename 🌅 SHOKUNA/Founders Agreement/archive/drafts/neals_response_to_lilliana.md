# Neal's Response to Lilliana

Hey, I sent you this message here in Basecamp because I wanted to think through my thoughts and refine them to make sure they were crystal clear.

First, I want to be absolutely clear: there's no one else in the world I'd rather be building this with than you. Every action I've taken, every risk I've shouldered, every hour I've invested has been because I believe in us and what we're creating together. That's my starting point for everything.

This is about three things I care about more than anything professionally: you, the opportunity for us to build something extraordinary together, and the chance to potentially bring in someone else who could help us make it even more extraordinary. The exploration of that possibility alone is worth taking seriously.

## 1. This Situation Proves We Need a CEO

The fact that we disagree so fundamentally on this decision is Exhibit A for why we need clear leadership. You say we don't need a CEO because it's "just the two of us." But look at where we are right now—at an impasse over a basic strategic decision with no protocol for resolution. 

Why? Because there hasn't been a leader to establish those protocols. 

The prompt I sent wasn't about equity or making Jake a cofounder. It was a simple exercise: "If I were CEO, how would I run it?" That's it. A thought experiment to see how each of us thinks about leadership, profit distribution, and keeping everyone motivated. The fact that this triggered such a strong reaction proves my point—we need someone who can make decisions when partners fundamentally disagree.

You even questioned the necessity of a founders agreement when I suggested it—something I've literally required from every single founder in every application cycle at Techstars over six years. That gave me pause. Given my history with companies that struggled through difficult times because we didn't have one, it showed me an opportunity for growth.

My years building companies have taught me that leadership structure matters from day one. Not in five years. Not when we hit ten employees. Day one.

## 2. Jake Deserves Our Respect, Not Our Suspicion

It bothers me deeply that we're treating Jake like some random outsider who needs to audition for us. Let me be clear: I met you and Jake the same year. You were both my students. I've watched both of you evolve over nearly seven years, take on my thinking and ideas, and teach me just as much in return.

Out of the 322 founders I've invested in across 160 companies—founders we've worked with together—Jake is number one. The founder I would most trust to build something great alongside us. He's not just someone who learned jobs-to-be-done in a classroom. He's Exhibit A of a founder who's actually implemented it as an operator in the real world.

Look, I know we've both had concerns about Jake's incentives and values. That's fair. Those concerns determine whether and how he gets involved. But if there's any chance of this working, it has to come from a place of respect. We need to acknowledge what he brings:
- Fresh operating experience building and running a real business
- One of the very few founders who established a deep connection with Bob Moesta independently—Bob trusts him more than any other founder we've worked with
- Battle-tested frameworks from his time at Zest
- Deep understanding of concepts like The Fifth Discipline—the same book I recommended when you were struggling as accelerator lead

We have a closing window here. Jake is actively seeking opportunities. This decision needed to be made fast. All I asked was for him to share his vision—the same thing I asked of you and myself. No commitments, no equity promises, just "show us how you think." And we'd be foolish not to leverage his strategic thinking while it's being offered freely.

## 3. You Judged My Decision Instead of Seeking Understanding

What hurt most wasn't your disagreement—it was that you went straight to "betrayal" without even asking why I made this choice. No curiosity. No "Help me understand your thinking." Just immediate accusations of breaking trust.

Partners don't work that way. We challenge each other, yes. We disagree, absolutely. But we start from assuming good intent, especially when one of us brings decades of experience to the table. The decisions I made came from years of watching companies succeed and fail based on these exact dynamics.

## 4. Trust Is a Two-Way Street

You say I broke your trust by not consulting you first. Fair point—I should have given you a heads up. But let's be honest about our trust history: when you suggested treating Jake as an intern after I explicitly asked you not to, that was our first breach. Not this.

Trust means respecting each other's perspectives, even when we disagree. It means not treating people as "less than" when your partner has asked otherwise. And it means assuming good intent rather than jumping to the worst conclusions.

---

Look, I'm all in on this partnership. I've demonstrated that through every action, every sacrifice, every strategic move I've made. It would be crazy to let this one tactical disagreement—born from my trying to strengthen our company—topple the trust we've built.

We have a unique opportunity here. After nearly seven years of growing together, learning from each other, and building trust, we have the chance to create something special with the three people I respect most in this space. The window is closing—Jake is exploring other options. But the potential is extraordinary.

I believe in us. I believe in what we're building. And I believe we're stronger when we face these challenges head-on rather than pretending they don't exist. That's all this exercise was meant to do—surface the tensions early so we can address them productively.

The question isn't whether we disagree. It's whether we can disagree constructively and keep building something extraordinary together. I want to take this as seriously as it deserves to be taken. I know we can. Do you?
