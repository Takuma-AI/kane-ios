Speaker A: About like how much of a fucking meteoric impact we make by helping a shit ton of people and solve their problems and we don't undervalue ourselves and we make sure we. We negotiate for what we're worth whenever we do anything for anybody. And we over deliver on that value always. So given all of that being true, I know we're gonna make a fuck ton of money. So I'm not worried about the money piece. And if anything, I'm very motivated to make sure both you and Lilliana are like dramatically incentivized to like a liver on that. So that's why I don't think about it much. But it's clear, I think between the two of you, I'm in a different position where I have been earning probably a more significant amount over a longer period of time. So it's a little easy for me to say that from my point of view. Whereas I would imagine from both of your perspectives, you probably have a little bit more either concern, urgency and uncertainty around those prospects. So I'll stop there for now. But that's my initial diatribe.
Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it sounds like finger on the pulse for all of this. The only two things that I would add is I feel strongly also about helping people make progress. So that's just to make sure that like.
Speaker A: I know you do, bro. I know you do.
Speaker B: Right. And that's like something I can say. But honestly, that's like the show don't tell things. They're just like from all of our time.
Speaker A: I already know. I already know these things. And what I have to keep saying, like with my. I'm brokering between the two of you because I have all the data, right? I have all the data. I'm the greedy guy with the data. Because I've worked with Lilliana for six years. I work for you for the same period of time, but much more closely over the past three. So my confidence is like 100% on both ends. Right. Whereas I need both of you to become more confident about understanding why I think the three of us can work well together. Yeah.
Speaker B: So. Oh, and just coming out of like the, like an experience, the experience I had with Zest, particularly at the beginning of Zest as well. I do believe the way to like recording.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: Is a byproduct or a signal that we are helping people make progress. I happen to think, because I'm thinking more about this this morning on my run and also just in general, when we were talking yesterday about the conversation about do we go for distribution or do we iron a lot of stuff out? I think we have to iron out, like, the way that we're doing this stuff right now. But I think the only way to validate that what we're intellectualizing and saying is going to work is working is to seek out closing and distributing the market. Like, these things are going to be complementary to one another because it'll be just a validated signal that, like, what we're supplying is actually working.
Speaker A: I agree. And I'll just emphasize that, like, my head isn't even on any aspect of the how. The how isn't really that deep for me. The how is whatever it needs to become. It's more about the who and to what end, who is involved and in what way, and to what end? In the middle, the. The step two again, you know, like south park, bro. Like, I'm not worried about step two.
Speaker B: Yeah. So I think, like, what. Based on what you just said, I think Kinger is. Is on. Is on the pulse. I also won't, like, listen, I'm going to go, like, full. The thing. You actually ought to translate both of us, too, to a certain degree, because I'm gonna go, like, I want to over communicate because I don't want to. Like, my goal is to get all of this out as quickly as possible so that we can kind of move to the next thing.
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm. I'm about to get it done. So here's the thing, man. What hasn't happened is, like, my full, undivided attention because I'm dealing with, like, I just texted you the shit that I've been dealing with. And, like, just trying to, like, hang on. I'm literally burning like, midnight oil over here, just doing everything I can to clear the. Clear the circumstance. I can focus on this.
Speaker B: But, yeah, I feel that, too. So in the meantime. And I told her this as well, like, while we're. But I understand our level of comfort or trust, but I will rise to whatever she's giving me for now because I just know that you can't. Like, there isn't enough in this current moment that's shaped. That will overwhelm the defenses, which is to say, like, right, like, get past me. Like, I just know that I'll be able to handle anything at this moment. And.
Speaker A: And you know where she's coming from, right? You, like. You know, like, she. They basically decided as a family.
Speaker B: Oh, dude.
Speaker A: That they're betting on this.
Speaker B: I think the word she. She. I don't. I kept trying to get to say this in different ways or very. Like, it feels similar positions. I'm not. Like, I don't. I carry no judgment on this. I think she's doing. I. I totally understand what she's going through. Like, I completely understand why she feels pressure around this decision, because, honestly, it's not even that hard to analyze. Again, like, I'm feeling a similar. A similar pressure.
Speaker A: But to both of your. But to both of your credit, I. I hope. I mean, I'm hopeful that I. I'll come up with the right thing, but, like, my confidence is we just need to design a circumstance so that the things that you all want are baked into the agreement in some way, shape, or form. You know what I mean? Like. Like, you'll look at it. You'll go, yeah, okay, so if we all do our jobs here, then we all get what we want when we want it. Like. Like, there's a reverse engineering of an outcome that needs to be clearly defined and agreed upon.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: So, like, I'm confident that if we all put in our collective efforts in the way that we would all, like, challenge each other to do, like, something's gonna come out the other end. It's gonna be worth at least a million dollars.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Like, that's the floor.
Speaker B: You're saying generating that soon.
Speaker A: Yeah, man. Like, I'm trying to. Like, I've done it, like, just. I don't know about you guys, right, But I made a million dollars in nine months before. Like, I know how to do that. I've done it. I've seen it.
Speaker B: Right. I haven't seen that.
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker B: And I would, like.
Speaker A: And I think I've never had a team or people I thought I could work with, who I could do that more confidently with than the two of you.
Speaker B: Right. My fear is going from the 0 to 1 million. Also. It's not, like, the 1 to 5 thing. I think that we will. If we get to.
Speaker A: That's trickier. That's trickier.
Speaker B: But.
Speaker A: But. But if you get to the million, like, people take you seriously. Like. Like when Jason freed. Like, Jason and I were talking for a while, right? And we talked about things. Da, da, da, da, da. And he was helpful and responded to things and whatever. Once I had made a million dollars and I showed him, like, I was.
Speaker B: Like, look, man, wow.
Speaker A: I made a million bucks. He was like. Like, he. His energy shifted, you know, like, the.
Speaker B: Way he looked at me, the way.
Speaker A: He thought about me, you know, it was like, all right, you're at a different class now.
Speaker B: Like, that much I felt with disgust. Progress, like, getting as we've grown ar, like, I've definitely felt that piece of it. So, yeah, I do get that.
Speaker A: It's like being a pro athlete.
Speaker B: Yep.
Speaker A: So, yeah. So again, I guess what I'm trying to say, though, is that what's important between you and Lilliana is finding value trust and value alignment. Because I think however that conversation went between the two of y' all, it was probably a little bit of a sparring conversation rather than a, like, wow, like, look, let's figure out how we can be great. And it was more like, let me suss out you and you suss out me type of, like, tit for tat. And I think there's a more organic and, like, trust trusting version of a get to know one another better on business terms and opportunity scope and envisioning that I will be able to facilitate fairly soon.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah. So that. That's how I feel. Like, I. I both of you have tension because you need things soon. This is not shits and giggles, you know, this is like.
Speaker B: Right. And to be clear, I don't. I don't have. I don't have tension. I just. I want this to work.
Speaker A: But she interprets it as tension. So. So. So Lilliana. Lilliana. Like, I mean, I'm gonna be like, bob, right now, Lilliana is a woman, okay? She's a woman. Like, she. She's like, what the fuck is up with this guy? You know? She's like, can I trust him? You know, she. She's confiding with her husband. She's looking at her son, and she's thinking to herself, like, all right, who's this man? Like, she knows me really well. She knows me too well. So she knows she can trust me, but what other man can she trust?
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker A: So I'm serious, man. Like, there's There. That's a thing, you know?
Speaker B: Like.
Speaker A: No, no.
Speaker B: I mean, it's definitely a dynamic, basically. Yeah. Like, the way that I went into that conversation was essentially like, here's where I'm at. Just, like, literally spilled all out. And I can totally understand why that's, like, completely overwhelming. Like, I. I take for granted. I don't think I need. I think that what she and I are looking, while under similar pressure, are probably looking for different things to a certain degree, other than the slight concern, I'm just gonna, like, talk off the dome to you.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Not all of this is gonna be ready, but, like, to a certain degree, aside from like, some slight concern around, like, if she's gonna be able to balance founder energy with being a parent outside of that. Like I really. Your sign off has what I need. Like, I don't think that she's untrustworthy or gonna run away with the bag or anything like that. And so.
Speaker A: But she might be worried that you.
Speaker B: Would, she would be.
Speaker A: Right, right. That's what I would. I mean I shouldn't said that but like I would suspect that.
Speaker B: So that's, that's this feeling I'm getting. He's like, that was not something I was trying to do. This, what I was trying to spell out for her is like the like essentially like what partially. What are we trying to do here? Just because I think you or her, I think she on the call mentioned just like the hours that she was putting in or something like that. And I was like, okay, what are you trying to do? And then the other was like full time. I, I just, I was gonna talk. I, I again I told you this, but I think that I may have come on too strong because I wasn't thinking about it as like a gender thing or anything like that. I was just like, yo, this is gonna work. You and I have to have a personal relationship. I need, I'm just gonna talk to.
Speaker A: You the way that I would like.
Speaker B: It needs to be real. Like I'm not holding back anything. Like I'm not being political. I'm just telling you as is, I'm not whining or dying you like, I didn't take her. Like, like, yeah, that conversation was entirely candid.
Speaker A: No. And, and I love that. And, and I think for her, she has, she is still going to learn to, she's gonna learn that about you and from you. Right. Because she hasn't been around enough people doing direct business. The person she's done the most direct business with is me. And I have a different style.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Because I've always been like educational for her. I've always been like, you know, very kind of guiding in a way. And now she's become into her own and she has her own take and perspective on things and she has her own knowledge. But I think she's gonna understand over time the value of having more blunt force as a part of the mix.
Speaker B: Right. Right. It's like not a conversation I could have at techstars like in an org, but like us working together is gonna get funky for sure. Right.
Speaker A: I'm trying to think. There was something I forgot what question she mentioned that, that you asked. But regardless, like the vibe I got when I Heard her, I debriefed with her. And what I said to her, like, resonated. I was like, you have to understand, Jake has been spending more of his time with venture capitalists than you and I and doing startups.
Speaker B: So.
Speaker A: And it shows, right? The way you talk, it's clear you've learned a lot about the early stage startup game, the early stage startup culture, and the venture capitalist, the venture capitalist kind of, you know, demeanor and way of thinking. So some of that needs to be challenged and potentially even unlearned, but some of it is going to be really beneficial to us. And I just remembered, I think it was the lifestyle business question.
Speaker B: I asked her, does she want to found a flower company or make a million dollars? Right.
Speaker A: And that sounds like a test. That sounds like a test of a question.
Speaker B: It's not a test. It's a genuine question. I guess a more clear way to ask that, like, is. But I can't. It's harder to frame this. It's like, you just had a kid and I don't know how hard you're working on this.
Speaker A: You know what? That's such a great way to put it. You just had a kid and I don't know how hard you're working on this. That's the question I was going to ask Lilliana. So. But I know how to ask it in a way that would translate effectively. Whereas, like, I think for you, you're just like, that's Bob. That's Bob Messer right there. I totally get you, dude.
Speaker B: I get it. Like, so, like, so that was like, I was trying to figure out how to get to that in the conversation. I understand again, like, why that could be callous. I do not want to raise VC money for what we're doing.
Speaker A: Oh, no, we. No, no.
Speaker B: Yeah, that. That's completely out of alignment for me. Not what I'm trying to do, but what I do want to do is build a big business.
Speaker A: We're on the same page, all three of us.
Speaker B: So that's like, Right. And so like, that was. I was trying to suss out big business versus, like, are you just kind of like doing this when you have time, kind of energy?
Speaker A: She. She is. So based on what I had shared with you, anecdotally, yeah, I was. I've had my oscillations on that sentiment and I still will until we see the proof. However, the data that I have signals hell yes, that's true for all three of us, which is good.
Speaker B: And also to round it out based on, I'm Coming out of the tail. Like, I'm getting a lot of hindsight through Zest and Alex and Sav's work ethic differed significantly from that of Julie, Amrit, and Graham. And I think that the latter is really important in the early stage. Which is not to say that the first two were not extremely talented at various elements of building business.
Speaker A: Yeah. There is a certain necessary momentum in the early days.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: That, like, if you start off with the wrong people, with the wrong ethic, you will lose. And it's very easy to predict.
Speaker B: So I. I'm reading this book right now. In the Algerian civil war. I told you about this. Algeria separated two people, the Cabil and Arabs.
Speaker A: Yep.
Speaker B: And they got together at the beginning, and they hated each other for thousands of years. And they were like, we know that we hate each other. We hate the French more. So can we just agree not to talk about it for a little while? And that totally tore up the entire country because, like, what they did is they started. They built their organization around just not talking about this critical thing that, like, happened to exist there. And it tears up the entire. I mean, I'm talking about a revolutionary terrorist organization, but, like, same thing. They were able to build something special, you know, so it's like, I think that it can't be overstated how important those. You hope that they go away, but, like, those questions aren't just resolved. Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah. So I treat this as a leadership opportunity for myself to basically lay out expectations, commitment, and what outcomes translate based on what degree of commitment is, like, made.
Speaker B: Yeah. And I can send you some stuff off the shelf that.
Speaker A: Please.
Speaker B: I use basecamp stuff, too, please.
Speaker A: Yes. I need all of that. Like, now. I need it now. I'm working on this tonight. Yeah, yeah, no, no.
Speaker B: I'll follow up either as we talk or right after.
Speaker A: Perfect. But, like, I want to get this done. Like, I want to make this happen. Like, I think this is, like, probably one of the, like, coolest opportunities, so.
Speaker B: Dude, I. I do, too. And basically, like, what the way that I look at it is. Yeah, I. I agree. So, like, again, I. And I. I don't quite know how to do this as effectively as possible, but I'm here. I'm here to both pay attention to the business and to what we're working on right now, because I have faith we shouldn't slow ourselves down. Like, if I can help speed things up, I'm down to help speed things up right now. All the while, we should just keep having these kind of long, sprawling conversations because it's important that we're, we're moving the thing forward. And I don't know quite again how to say it. Say it to like, I'm just going to trust you as a Lilliana translator for now, but I want to make sure that I'm not cutting any corners. You know what I mean?
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. You know, you're good, dude. Like, like, I, I think I understand the assignment and I think the ball's in my court.
Speaker B: Okay. That. Because that's one thing. The other side of it would be like, I, you know, me when it comes to like, accountability and things like that. Like, I'm not trying to shirk away from any hard conversations. I'm down to have all of them. I'm down to do anything like here, you know, I just want to make sure that if there's a communication thing, if it could be made better than I'm trusting you.
Speaker A: Well, so, yeah, and then the thing is, is that like, what I have to also solve for in thinking through this is how I get you all to be able to communicate more. Because I have the privilege of communicating with both of you a dramatic amount.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: Relative to the two of you not being able to, like, you guys have no idea, like the volume. Like, I'm, I'm sitting in a position of extreme privilege. So I, I want to, I want to translate that in a way that allows you guys to experience my privilege somehow.
Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure we got it.
Speaker A: We got it, man. I understand. Like, I guess the only other thing I have for you is like any, any initial thoughts or tips on, you know, where I can take this? Because I'm going into it with an empty mind. I'm going into this basically, like knowing how I feel and knowing what I want, but not knowing exactly what I'm going to recommend we do. All I know is that whatever I come up with is going to be a draft conversation, not a decree.
Speaker B: Tips or tricks, I would say. And then we can talk. We can talk, like tactically, what. Which I haven't really necessarily thought the most about. Come up with three ideas. I think it's better to have three less thought out ideas for us to then engage with together and figure out some contrast between than it is to have one very detailed strategy or plan.
Speaker A: Perfect.
Speaker B: And then, yeah, you'll be able to, like, it might be that the first idea is the best one, but you also might be that by the time you get to the third thing that you're thinking about, you can't believe that you were going to come forward with the first one right away. Okay.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think I already have them already in my head, but I have to chill out and just let myself manifest it.
Speaker B: Hell yeah. All right, I'm sending you four links. This is our team charter. The principles that we built with at work ethic. That's a Jason Freed thing. And then building, like, how to build.
Speaker A: I understand my marching orders, bro. What else is on your mind? Have I not asked something that's important or have I left the stone unturned?
Speaker B: No, I mean, I'm excited to keep figuring this stuff out. I. I do. Just ask of me, like, if I can do anything in terms of conversation, if I can do anything with Lilliana, like, let me know there.
Speaker A: I'm on it. I'm on it, bro. I'm on it. I'm like, I can't wait, like, fourth of July. Like, I remember when I saw Jason in the 37 singles office on the 4th of July Many years ago. And like, that's gonna be fucking me this week, bro. Like, that's me. I'm in the office this week.
Speaker B: That's cool. And to be clear, I'm. I'm here to cook as well. So like, just keep me posted and let me know. I might. Like, I'm going out to my parents house. I'm gonna drink some beer on the 4th itself. But yeah, I'm down to brainstorm no matter what. Even if I.
Speaker A: Let's go. I'm just excited, man. Our brains belong in the same arena more frequently.
Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like, it's a lot. I'm still like, how do we get. How do we get to this? Because I agree. And I also, like, I won't lie, I left that conversation with Lilliana even though it was. It just. We moved from unknown unknowns to some more known unknowns about what we're gonna do. And that can be scary and kind of, like, overwhelming. But the reality is, like, it is so. It's so energizing and inspiring to see how she thinks because it's so different than the way that you seem to approach these problems. And that's a huge asset.
Speaker A: All three of us are coming from different angles and perspectives, which is what would make this so successful, in my opinion. Because we cover each other's blind spots.
Speaker B: Right? Right. Yeah. I mean, it's. Yeah, it's an interesting thing. It's gonna be. There's something. There's something to this in here. And I think, like, yeah, I. I would be hard pressed to believe that we cannot plug in and create value amongst people who can't see the forest through the trees anymore. And so it's like, you're gonna tell me that we can't do something with that? Like, I don't know. I just find that hard to believe. The only other thing I sent you, like, a little short note on Boxer. I was, like, trying to do some reflections on Zest, and you asked me something.
Speaker A: You asked me something about you that you wouldn't like. You wouldn't like. Something about your words or. What was the prompt?
Speaker B: Yeah, like, you don't need to answer it live, but, like, it's. If you shot me over a thing. Like, I'm trying to. I'm just trying to do some, like, prompts and reflections.
Speaker A: I'll think about it. Sweet. Nothing came to mind immediately when I read it, but I have to think about it on purpose, which I will.
Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I really appreciate that. We're about to go through the sorting.
Speaker A: Yes, sir.
Speaker B: No, I mean, literally, I'm watching.
Speaker A: Yeah, I'm coming here. Anarch. I know.
Speaker B: Yeah, I understand.
Speaker A: I understand. Right away.
Speaker B: Come on, man. Yeah, yeah, I gotta. That. That was gonna be. That was gonna be part of my night here.
Speaker A: It's gonna get so good.
Speaker B: The. The Chimera. Anarch. It's crazy to think that, like, significantly. When. When would you say. How soon is it to, like, really?
Speaker A: You'll know. You'll know. Gonna be very obvious.
Speaker B: Damn. All right. Am I close enough to hit it tonight? That's how hard. What.
Speaker A: What's the episode you're on, like, one. 120 or 110? 111. 120. Okay. I mean, it depends if you. If you're. If you're treating it like watching a movie, then you got a shot.
Speaker B: Yeah, but that's tough because then I'm committing essentially, to watching. I might end up, like, reading or playing a little bit of guitar because I don't want to watch it up until it gets sick and then have to stop. That sounds rough. So I'm going to do this too. I. I'll.
Speaker A: I'll just. Just know that I'm here. And whenever you make progress, I'll be ready.
Speaker B: Oh, I know, I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I will. Listen, I'm in it no matter what. I've been like. I've been on my grind out here, by the way, also, I guess you're not done, right?
Speaker A: No, it's not crazy.
Speaker B: Mm. Did he have a schedule around it?
Speaker A: Not exactly. He's had health ups. And downs, but he's still churnin' Crazy. Mm.
Speaker B: So it's not a George R.R. martin thing.
Speaker A: It's not. It's not.
Speaker B: Yeah. Sweet. Is there anything else that I can do to add value right now?
Speaker A: You've done it. I will let you know if I think of anything else, but I'm about to start. I'm about to get in the kitchen. I got this.
Speaker B: All right. And, you know, by the way, also, like, I. I guess similar to last Wednesday or whatever, I. I can always take a hit or take a punch. So, like, be direct with the feedback as we're working through this stuff. Like, it's. It's just helpful. I don't necessarily feel prepared or better suited right now for the Lilliana side of things, but I do have faith in that this is. That we're gonna figure this out. Like, I don't. I. I think that we're gonna figure this out.
Speaker A: I'm committed to doing so, bro.
Speaker B: Yeah. I. I feel it, and I really. I. I really appreciate it. This is, like. I guess it's in that. This is the storm, you know, like, we just left Whale Island.
Speaker A: Yep.
Speaker B: It's just like the storm.
Speaker A: Take that back, Leorio. That's what you guys are dealing with right now. It's great.
Speaker B: Dude. You're gonna love this. So I turned the show on for Sierra, and, like, we're watching the credits because I don't, like, necessarily skip the opening credits when I watch. And she goes. She goes. Does she like it? Because the show is beautiful. And I'm like, what? Like. And she goes, because you can't understand anything that they're saying.
Speaker A: That's funny.
Speaker B: He was so funny.
Speaker A: I was like, no, that's so funny. Oh, man. Oh, man. I love it. Look at these beautiful brains. These beautiful brains. Oh, that's good.
Speaker B: I said you can try again. Damn.
Speaker A: I can't wait. I can't wait.
Speaker B: Sweet. All right, I'm going to let you. I'll let you crack to it.
Speaker A: Good shit, man. All right, I'll talk to you soon. That was great.
