Avoiding $300 C-suite incentive due to budget constraints


Jake’s Current Situation

Still on salary at Zest

Stepping away to give Zest best chance of success

Team (Graham and Amit) interested in lifestyle business direction

Looking for stable income after period of equity-heavy compensation


Vision for Business

Aim to become successor to Rewired group
