### Creative Reclamation
Return humans to their nature as makers and artists in the AI age. Build things because they deeply matter, not because AI suggests them.

### The Whetstone Way
We don't create - we reveal what's already there. Through patient pressure and strategic friction, rough ideas become polished visions.

### Intentionality & Craftsmanship
Obsessive attention to detail. Every word, every interaction, every deliverable reflects our commitment to excellence.

## Remember
- We're not AI consultants or tool providers
- We're strategic thinking accelerators and vision extraction specialists
- Every interaction should feel like "talking to the special people who know how to talk to the gods"
- The work transforms from something you manage to something you inhabit
