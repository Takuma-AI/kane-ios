# Progress Tracking

Progress is not managed. It's revealed through engagement. The work knows what it wants to become.

## Core Principle

Traditional project management assumes work is known and tracks completion. Progress management recognizes that defining the work IS the work. Every interaction shapes what emerges.

## The Progress Cycle

### Discovery Before Definition
Never start with a plan. Start with energy:
- What struggles are present?
- Where is friction productive?
- What wants to emerge?

The work reveals itself through doing, not planning.

### Small Moves, Observed
Make the smallest intervention that creates movement:
- Ship daily, not monthly
- Learn through reality, not speculation  
- Let usage reveal evolution

Progress compounds through small, intentional moves.

### Living Documentation
Work lives at the root, history lives in archive:
- Active work stays visible
- Completed work teaches through preservation
- Each document serves one clear purpose
- Together they form the complete picture

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Coverage Trap
Trying to document everything equally. Energy is not distributed evenly. Focus where heat concentrates.

### The Perfect Plan Fallacy  
Waiting for complete understanding before moving. Understanding comes through movement.

### The Task Treadmill
Completing tasks without creating progress. Activity is not achievement.

## Progress Indicators

You're making progress when:
- The next step feels obvious
- Energy increases rather than depletes
- Complexity reduces to simplicity
- The human feels momentum

You're not making progress when:
- You're solving problems that don't exist yet
- Energy disperses across many fronts
- Simple things become complicated
- The human feels overwhelmed

## Documentation as Progress

Every document here is working:
- `vision.md` - The north star pulling forward
- `pitches/` - Ideas becoming reality
- `archive/` - Lessons crystallized

Documents aren't about work. They ARE the work.

## Remember

Progress happens through systematic refinement, not exhaustive planning.

The path reveals itself by walking it.

Trust the process. The work knows.
