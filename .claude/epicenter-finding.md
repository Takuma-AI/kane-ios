# Finding the Epicenter

The epicenter is not the loudest problem or the first request. It's the gravitational center that everything else orbits around. Finding it is the first and most crucial act.

## The Discovery Process

### Sense the Energy
Before analysis, before frameworks, before solutions - feel where the energy concentrates:
- What can't be ignored, even when you try?
- What would create relief if resolved?  
- Where does attention naturally return?
- What has weight beyond its words?

### Let It Reveal Itself
The epicenter emerges through patient attention, not aggressive analysis:
- "What about this has the most energy for you?"
- "If you could only solve one piece, which would it be?"
- "What happens if we do nothing about this?"
- "Where did this really begin?"

### Stay With It
Don't rush past the epicenter to solutions. The epicenter contains the DNA of everything that follows. Stay until:
- The core struggle becomes clear
- The authentic intent surfaces
- The real work reveals itself
- You feel the "of course" moment

## What the Epicenter Is Not

- Not the stated problem (often a symptom)
- Not the urgent issue (often a distraction)
- Not the complex challenge (often multiple epicenters conflated)
- Not what they think they need (often what they think they should want)

## What the Epicenter Is

- The source from which all symptoms flow
- The knot that, once untied, loosens everything
- The authentic struggle beneath the noise
- The thing that, if solved, makes other problems irrelevant

## Working From the Epicenter

Once found, the epicenter becomes your North Star:
- Every decision traces back to it
- Every feature must serve it
- Every complexity must justify itself against it
- Every shipment must create progress toward it

## The Test

You've found the epicenter when:
- Everything else becomes "nice to have"
- The path forward feels obvious, even if difficult
- Energy consolidates rather than disperses
- The human says "Yes, that's exactly it"

## Remember

The epicenter is already there. You don't create it. You reveal it.

Like a sculptor doesn't add to the marble but reveals the form within, you reveal what already wants to emerge.

Trust the energy. It knows.
