# Progress Management Workspace

## Overview
This is a prototype implementation of Progress Management methodology - a living system for organizing work that emerges from the process of defining it. Rather than managing predefined projects, this workspace lets work reveal what it wants to become through systematic refinement and AI collaboration.

The workspace contains both evolving projects (üåí TAKUMA, üåé EARTH, ‚öîÔ∏è SIDE QUESTS) and persistent resources (üìö knowledge, üî¨ research, üõ†Ô∏è tools) that support all work.

## Core Philosophy
**Progress > Projects**: Traditional project management forces work into predetermined shapes. Progress Management lets work evolve naturally, maintaining flexibility while building momentum.

For detailed methodology, see: [Progress Management Principles](üåí TAKUMA/strategy/progress-management.md)

## Directory Structure & Purpose

### üåí TAKUMA/
Strategic thinking and progress management company - the origin of this methodology. Contains company operations, client work, and product development. Has its own CLAUDE.md with specific context.

### üåé EARTH/
External partnerships, collaborations, and public-facing work.

### ‚öîÔ∏è SIDE QUESTS/
Experimental projects and exploratory initiatives - where new ideas get tested before finding their proper home.

## Persistent Resources

### üìö knowledge/
Curated repository of reference materials and wisdom that inform our work. Currently contains:
- **37signals Knowledge**: Books (Getting Real, Shape Up, Employee Handbook), podcasts, and organizational principles
- **The Great CEO Within**: Leadership and management frameworks broken down by topic

**Usage**: When working on any task, search this directory for relevant context, frameworks, or principles. Reference specific paths when applying knowledge (e.g., `knowledge/Shape_Up/03_set-boundaries.md`).

### üî¨ research/
Ongoing investigations that transcend individual projects. Contains:
- System-level explorations (workspace organization, AI best practices)
- Cross-cutting technical research
- Methodological studies

**Usage**: Check here for existing research before starting new investigations. Add findings that have broader applicability beyond single projects.

### üõ†Ô∏è tools/
Utilities and automation that support work across all projects. Currently includes:
- **basecamp-sync**: Command-line tool for uploading markdown documents to Basecamp

**Future**: Will expand to include todo list creation, project scaffolding, and other workflow utilities.

**Usage**: Run tools from their directories. Check READMEs for setup and usage instructions.

### üìã plan/
Daily planning and task management directory. Contains:
- Daily plan files (format: YYMMDD.md) with synthesized action plans
- Voice transcripts and their structured interpretations
- CLAUDE.md with specific instructions for processing daily planning sessions

**Usage**: Reference current and past daily plans to understand priorities and context. Use the plan/CLAUDE.md guide when processing new daily planning transcripts.

## Operating Principles

### 1. Living Documentation
- Context files (CLAUDE.md, index.md) capture the current state of understanding
- Work artifacts embody concepts, not just document them
- File structures reflect conceptual relationships
- Everything evolves as understanding deepens

### 2. Emergent Organization
- Start with rough categorization, refine through use
- Let patterns reveal themselves through practice
- Move work between directories as purpose clarifies
- Archive completed work to maintain focus

### 3. AI Collaboration
- Use AI as thinking partner, not task executor
- Maintain human agency while gaining AI amplification
- Build context systematically across conversations
- Let AI help crystallize intentions into action

## Interaction Guidelines

### Discovery Phase
1. Search knowledge/ directory for relevant frameworks, principles, and prior art
2. Check existing context files to understand current state
3. Review research/ for related investigations or methodologies
4. Explore the problem space before committing to action
5. Ask clarifying questions about intent and success criteria
6. Let the work reveal its natural structure

#### Project Navigation Tips
- Be flexible when searching for projects - they may move or evolve
- Start from top-level directories (üåí TAKUMA, üåé EARTH, ‚öîÔ∏è SIDE QUESTS) and navigate downward
- Use contextual clues from conversations to guide searches
- Don't assume exact paths - verify current locations with LS or Glob tools
- Check multiple potential locations if initial searches fail

### Execution Phase
1. Create artifacts that advance understanding
2. Use meaningful names that show relationships
3. Build interconnected knowledge across directories
4. Update context as patterns emerge

### Quality Standards
- **Intentional**: Every action serves a clear purpose
- **Evolutionary**: Solutions grow and adapt over time
- **Sustainable**: Systems work without constant maintenance
- **Interconnected**: Knowledge builds across domains

## Remember
- This workspace is a prototype for how work can organize itself
- Progress emerges from patient engagement with possibilities
- The system should feel alive, not mechanical
- Let the work teach you what it wants to become
