# KANE: Comprehensive Architecture & Experience Design

## Executive Summary

KANE is a voice-first thought partner that helps users transform mental chaos into clear daily priorities through natural conversation. Unlike traditional task managers or AI assistants, KANE creates a collaborative experience where understanding emerges through dialogue and visual feedback, making the process of clarification feel like working with a thoughtful colleague at a whiteboard.

## Core Experience Vision

### The Fundamental Interaction

The user opens KANE and begins speaking naturally about their day - not structured commands, but messy, human thoughts. As they speak, they watch their chaos transform into structure on screen in real-time. The AI serves as a thought partner who knows when to ask questions, when to stay quiet, and when to help refine ideas. The result is not a task list, but clarity about what actually matters today.

### The Emotional Journey

**From:** Overwhelmed, scattered, uncertain about priorities
**Through:** Natural conversation with visual feedback that makes thinking visible
**To:** Clear, confident, focused on what matters most

### Key Differentiators

1. **Voice-first, not voice-added** - Speaking is the primary interaction, not a convenience feature
2. **Real-time visual thinking** - See thoughts structure themselves as you speak
3. **Collaborative intelligence** - AI as thought partner, not command executor
4. **Clarity over productivity** - Focus on what matters, not on doing more

## Architectural Philosophy

### The Streaming-First Principle

Traditional voice assistants operate in turns: speak → process → respond. KANE operates in streams: as you speak, the system processes, understands, and updates continuously. This creates a fundamentally different experience where the AI feels present and collaborative rather than reactive.

### The Dual-Speed Processing Model

The architecture operates at two speeds simultaneously:
- **Immediate Layer** (~50ms): Visual feedback, draft creation, acknowledgments
- **Thoughtful Layer** (~500ms-2s): Deep understanding, refinement, questions

This allows the interface to feel responsive while still providing intelligent assistance.

### The Progressive Refinement Pattern

Information moves through stages of confidence:
1. **Detected** - Something important was mentioned (low confidence)
2. **Drafted** - Structured into a quest card (medium confidence)
3. **Refined** - Enhanced through dialogue (high confidence)
4. **Confirmed** - User validates understanding (complete confidence)

## Technical Architecture

### Component Stack

**Voice Layer**
- WebRTC transport via LiveKit for reliable, low-latency audio streaming
- Deepgram for streaming speech-to-text (100ms chunks)
- Hume TTS for expressive voice synthesis (emotional awareness)

**Intelligence Layer**
- Groq-hosted Llama 3.1 for real-time processing (50ms to first token)
- Streaming tool calls for dynamic behavior
- Context accumulation for continuous understanding

**Orchestration Layer**
- Python-based agent managing parallel processes
- State synchronization between components
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

**Client Layer**
- Native iOS app with SwiftUI
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Local Core Data for offline-first operation

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Speech → Audio Stream → LiveKit Server
                ↓
    [Parallel Processing Pipeline]
    ├→ Streaming Transcription (Deepgram)
    ├→ Streaming Understanding (Groq LLM)
    └→ Streaming Synthesis (Hume TTS)
                ↓
    [Unified State Manager]
    ├→ Visual Updates (iOS)
    ├→ Voice Response (when needed)
    └→ Database Persistence (PostgreSQL)
```

### State Management Strategy

The system maintains three levels of state:

1. **Immediate State** - What's happening right now (in-memory)
2. **Session State** - Current conversation context (server cache)
3. **Persistent State** - Historical patterns and learning (database)

State updates flow optimistically: UI updates immediately, persistence follows, rollback if needed.

## Intelligence Design

### The Dynamic Decision Framework

The AI makes real-time decisions about how to respond based on user state detection:

**User States:**
- **Clear** - Knows what they want → Create cards, stay quiet
- **Uncertain** - Exploring priorities → Ask guiding questions
- **Overwhelmed** - Too much at once → Help find the epicenter
- **Correcting** - Refining previous thought → Update and acknowledge
- **Processing** - Thinking out loud → Listen without interrupting

### Tool Selection Intelligence

The AI has multiple tools available and chooses based on context:

**create_quest_card** - When user mentions a clear task
**ask_clarifying_question** - When critical information is missing
**acknowledge_silently** - When user is processing
**update_existing** - When user corrects themselves
**suggest_priority** - When user seems stuck

The AI doesn't rigidly follow rules but makes intelligent decisions based on the conversation flow.

### Conversation Management Principles

1. **Listen more than speak** - Default to silence, speak only when valuable
2. **Use their words** - Don't paraphrase unnecessarily
3. **Find the epicenter** - Focus on what really matters, not everything mentioned
4. **Progressive depth** - Start shallow, go deeper as needed
5. **Respect flow** - Don't interrupt productive thinking

## User Experience Design

### Visual Feedback Hierarchy

**Draft State** (Low Confidence)
- Appears immediately as user speaks
- Translucent, sketchy appearance
- Indicates "I'm hearing you"

**Refining State** (Medium Confidence)
- More solid but still adjustable
- Shows AI's current understanding
- Invites correction

**Confirmed State** (High Confidence)
- Solid, glowing appearance
- User has validated understanding
- Ready for action

### Voice Interaction Patterns

**Acknowledgments**
- Brief sounds ("mm-hmm") during natural pauses
- No interruption of user flow
- Indicates active listening

**Questions**
- Only when user seems stuck or uncertain
- Specific and guiding, not open-ended
- Timed for natural pauses

**Confirmations**
- Brief and natural ("Got it")
- Only when adding value
- Never repetitive or robotic

### Quest Structure Design

**Main Quest**
- The ONE thing that would make today successful
- Visually prominent, centered
- Maximum of 1-2 main quests

**Side Quests**
- Important but not primary focus
- Visually present but subordinate
- Maximum of 3-5 side quests

**Metadata** (Emergent, Not Forced)
- Why it matters (extracted from conversation)
- Deadline (if mentioned)
- Dependencies (if discussed)

### User Experience Principles
1. **Never make the user wait** - Something should always be happening
2. **Show thinking visually** - Make AI reasoning observable
3. **Fail gracefully** - Confusion should prompt clarification, not errors
4. **Preserve user agency** - AI suggests, user decides
5. **Respect attention** - Don't demand focus, support it

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Latency accumulation** → Parallel processing architecture
- **Streaming complexity** → Modular component design
- **State synchronization** → Event-driven updates with rollback
- **Scale bottlenecks** → Horizontal scaling from day one

### Experience Risks
- **Over-automation** → Keep human in the loop always
- **Under-intelligence** → Progressive enhancement approach
- **Conversation uncanny valley** → Embrace AI nature, don't fake human
- **Feature creep** → Maintain focus on core clarification experience

## Success Vision

A user opens KANE in the morning, speaks their tangled thoughts for 2-3 minutes, and watches as their mental chaos transforms into clear, actionable priorities on screen. The AI asks one or two clarifying questions at natural moments, helping them realize what really matters today. They end the session feeling clear, confident, and ready to focus on what's actually important. The entire experience feels less like using a tool and more like thinking with a trusted partner.

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **LiveKit over direct WebRTC** - Reliability and scalability from day one
2. **Groq over OpenAI** - 10x faster streaming for real-time experience
3. **Separated components over all-in-one** - Flexibility and control
4. **Streaming-first over request-response** - Fundamental to experience
5. **Progressive refinement over perfect understanding** - Matches human thinking
6. **Voice-first over multimodal** - Focus and simplicity
7. **Native iOS over web** - Performance and integration
8. **Python orchestration over Node.js** - AI ecosystem compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Validate streaming pipeline** - Confirm Groq + Hume + LiveKit integration
2. **Build minimal prototype** - Voice to quest creation with real-time updates
3. **Test with real users** - Focus on conversation quality over features
4. **Iterate on intelligence** - Refine decision-making and tool selection
5. **Scale gradually** - Start with single user, expand carefully

## The North Star

KANE succeeds when users stop thinking about tasks and start thinking about what matters. The technology should disappear into an experience that feels like having a thoughtful colleague who helps you see clearly what you already knew but couldn't quite articulate. Every architectural decision should serve this vision: making the process of finding clarity feel natural, supportive, and even enjoyable.
