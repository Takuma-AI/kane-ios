Speaker A: Okay, I'm going to start talking out what I'm envisioning in as much detail as possible around the whole Hashi system for turning systems of work into a more flexible agent sitting in my cloud code instance that has access to Basecamp and can manage progress with me as a companion for TACMO os. And what I'm envisioning is that I'm going to have a sub agent on CLAUDE called Hashi. And Hashi's job is the cognitive layer of reasoning through what are the tasks it takes in, it takes in context from the main agent and it reasons through what are the actual units of progress. And it uses a local MCP server, which is a lightweight API wrapper that basically just routes this sub agent towards being able to read to dos, create to dos and etc, etc. Now, as part of the MCP configuration, you're going to set which account you're working within for each instance of the MCP server. And then as for the tool or S4 des Hub agent, it's going to be drawn from the hashi prompt to get the formatting as well as principles of how to DOS should be named and et cetera. And what it should be able to do is to be able to list out the existing the existing projects on Basecamp list out their to do lists that are there, see where this new progress fits, and be able to manipulate tasks on Basecamp accordingly. And this includes checking off tasks, this includes creating new tasks, this includes editing tasks and et cetera, et cetera. We want to start with just an existing hashi functionality of creating to do lists with the next thing, being able to read existing to do lists and figure out if to do should be appended to existing lists rather than always starting new. The dependencies for being able to work on this includes one I need to fundamentally understand how MCP servers for Takuma OS is going to work. So I'm going to set off an agent to go off and just do the research on POD code implementations of local MCP servers, understand from the fundamentals and explain to me how that works. Like what does it mean to host a local MCP server? What does it take to run the server and have it be like start it? The architecture of where the code lives. More fundamentally, what it takes to connect quadcode to the MCP tool and then once that is ready, I'm going to set up or design that MCP server for Basecamp. And the ground truth or the moment of truth is is it able to create one task on basecamp now, if it's able to do that, then we're on the right track. Because after that I can have another cloud code agent go and study Hashi to understand the precise logic for Hashim, how groups and to dos are done and created on basecamp, as well as the prompt that currently exists with Gemini on how to reason through and think through what tasks need to be created. And then I can basically bake that prompt into a sub agent and then make it such that the main agent can know when to spin off Hashi. And Hashi will go off and reason through how to think about the to dos and for now. And that Hashi tool is going to have access to the read and write tools and then eventually also complete going to basically chisel that prompt to become so substantial that it's able to dynamically work with to do lists rather than simply creating new ones. And then as a result of that, we're going to be able to draw from the rich context that's on Takama OS to create the right to DOS on basecamp. The unanswered question here is where do we store the protocols for what kind of projects should go where? Which feels like something that should be separate from the master prompt of Hashi itself, because Hashi should be a reusable thing and instead it should live somewhere else that Hashi is able to draw from. For as I get important instructions that are talking about this company specific to start with, I could just prototype this by embedding those instructions inside the agent and worry about that later. And then eventually I'm going to be able to expand this MCP server to also be able to cover other tools such as creating a doc or creating a message post, etc. Such that my main agent and other sub agents are going to be able to use those tools to basically upload things to basecamp. With intelligence, it's not just a command line script uploaded to one place, but rather it's a dynamic intelligent agent that is prompted to know where to put things. For example, Thought Leadership articles should always be uploaded to. And then we should also have the posts on Basecamp always back reference to the link of that same document within the GitHub repository outside of just reveal. So the vision is that. Yeah, so that's, that's. The vision is that the Chakrama OS will intelligently manage the same artifacts on Basecamp as well. Okay, that makes sense. And then this philosophy or organization is also going to be part of a document that I'm going to upload to talk to my HQ specifying how this whole thing works with linking to installation instructions for the MCP server as well. And the MCP server is going to be a git sub module. Yes, but I think I just have some learning to do myself for how MCP servers even work and how to host it. Okay. The other thing I want to have fun with and investigate today is custom status lines on Claude and I'm going to do that within the ETC portal repository because I am going to have an I think it will be helpful for Chef for there to be some kind of custom status line there, but I'm not going to tell them about it. I'm just going to do it. Same with output styles. Well, output styles, I more so want it for myself. I want to experiment with the Texas beach or maybe. Yeah, let's see about that. Okay, that's it.
