# Knowledge Inbox

This is the landing zone for new transcripts and knowledge resources before they're organized into their final categories.

## Purpose

All YouTube transcriptions land here first, allowing for:
- Quick capture without overthinking organization
- Review and processing before final placement
- Batch organization when patterns emerge

## Processing Flow

1. New transcripts arrive here via YTE tool
2. Review content and identify appropriate category
3. Move to relevant knowledge subfolder (Pieces, Books, Courses, etc.)
4. Update any cross-references or indexes as needed

## Organization Tips

- Keep folder names descriptive but concise
- Preserve original metadata in transcript files
- Consider creating series folders for related content
- Archive processed items that don't fit current categories
