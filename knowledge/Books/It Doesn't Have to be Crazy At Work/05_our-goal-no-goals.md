## The Anti-Goal Company

"So imagine the response when we tell people that we don't do goals. At all. No customer-count goals, no sales goals, no retention goals, no revenue goals, no specific profitability goals (other than to be profitable). Seriously."

This radical stance makes Basecamp an outlier. While the business world obsesses over OKRs, KPIs, and BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals), they simply focus on doing good work.

## What They Care About Instead

The authors clarify they're not against improvement:

> "Are we interested in increasing profits? Yes. Revenues? Yes. Being more effective? Yes. Making our products easier, faster, and more useful? Yes. Making our customers and employees happier? Yes, absolutely. Do we love iterating and improving? Yup!"

The difference: They want these things without the artificial pressure of arbitrary targets.

## The Brief Experiment

"But there was a brief moment when we changed our mind. We pinned up a big round revenue targetâ€”one of those fat nine-digit numbers."

They tried goal-setting once. The result was telling:

> "Because (1) it's disingenuous for us to pretend we care about a number we just made up, and (2) because we aren't willing to make the cultural compromises it'll take to get there."

## The Fundamental Problem with Goals

"Goals are fake. Nearly all of them are artificial targets set for the sake of setting targets. These made-up numbers then function as a source of unnecessary stress until they're either achieved or abandoned."

The cycle never ends:
- Set arbitrary target
- Stress about hitting it
- Either achieve or abandon
- Set new arbitrary target
- Repeat forever

## The Dark Side of Targets

> "Chasing goals often leads companies to compromise their morals, honesty, and integrity to reach those fake numbers. The best intentions slip when you're behind."

Examples of goal-driven compromises:
- Turning a blind eye to quality
- Making refunds harder
- Cell phone companies making cancellation difficult
- Hidden fees and deceptive practices

## Their Own Temptation

"In the few months that we tried reaching for the big nine-digit goal, we ended up launching several projects that at best we had misgivings about and at worst made us feel a little dirty."

Even Basecamp wasn't immune. They found themselves:
- Spending big on Facebook, Twitter, and Google ads
- Compromising on privacy principles
- Doing things that felt "icky" for the numbers

## The Alternative Approach

> "How about something really audacious: No targets, no goals?"

Instead, focus on:
- Staying in business
- Serving customers well
- Being a delightful place to work
- Doing the best work possible daily

"Just because these goals are harder to quantify does not make them any less important."

## Mental Model: Process Over Outcomes

Without arbitrary goals, focus shifts to:

1. **Quality of Daily Work**: Is today's work something to be proud of?
2. **Sustainable Practices**: Can we maintain this indefinitely?
3. **Intrinsic Motivation**: Do we believe in what we're doing?
4. **Natural Growth**: Let success emerge from good work

## The Freedom of No Goals

Without goals, you gain:
- Freedom to make ethical decisions
- Focus on actual work quality
- Reduced stress and pressure
- Flexibility to adapt
- Authentic motivation

## Practical Implementation

1. **Replace Goals with Principles**: Instead of "Increase revenue 25%", try "Serve customers exceptionally well"
2. **Track Health, Not Targets**: Monitor whether the business is sustainable, not whether it hit a made-up number
3. **Celebrate Good Work**: Recognize quality and effort, not just outcomes
4. **Question Every Metric**: Ask "Would we compromise our values to improve this number?"
