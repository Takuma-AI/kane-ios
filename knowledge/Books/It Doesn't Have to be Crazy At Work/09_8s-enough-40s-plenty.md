## Core Philosophy

Working 40 hours a week is plenty. Plenty of time to do great work, plenty of time to be competitive, plenty of time to get the important stuff done. At Basecamp, that's the standard - no more, often less. During summer, they even take Fridays off and still accomplish meaningful work in just 32 hours.

The key insight: 8 hours is actually a long time - it's like flying from Chicago to London. The flight feels long because it's uninterrupted, continuous time. But your workday feels shorter because it's sliced into fragments by meetings, calls, and distractions.

## The Reality of Fractured Time

Most people don't actually have 8 hours a day to work - they have a couple of hours. The rest is stolen by:
- Meetings
- Conference calls  
- Random interruptions
- Context switching

So while you may be at the office for 8 hours, it feels like just a few productive hours.

## The Sustainable Approach

Working within 40 hours isn't stressful when you:
- Don't cram
- Don't rush
- Work at a relaxed, sustainable pace
- Let unfinished work pick up Monday morning

If you can't fit everything into 40 hours, you need to get better at picking what to do, not work longer hours. Most of what we think we have to do, we don't have to do at all.

## Mental Models

**Time Quality vs. Quantity**: 40 focused hours beats 80 fractured hours. The constraint forces prioritization.

**Work as a Container**: Work expands to fill available time. Limiting the container forces you to cut what's unnecessary.

**Sustainability Over Sprints**: Consistent 40-hour weeks outperform cycles of burnout and recovery.

## Practical Application

1. **No overtime culture**: No all-nighters, no weekends, no "crunch time" 70-80 hour weeks
2. **Protect the 8**: Make those 8 hours count by eliminating interruptions
3. **Cut the unnecessary**: When you remove what doesn't matter, 40 hours is plenty
4. **Trust the constraint**: What doesn't get done by Friday at 5 picks up Monday at 9

## The Bottom Line

When you cut out what's unnecessary, you're left with what you need. And all you need is 8 hours a day for about 5 days a week. The constraint isn't a limitation - it's a tool for focus and sustainability.
