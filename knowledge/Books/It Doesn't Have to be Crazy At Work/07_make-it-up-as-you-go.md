## No Grand Plans

"We don't do grand plans at Basecamp—not for the company, not for the product. There's no five-year plan. No three-year plan. No one-year plan. Nada."

After nearly 20 years in business, they still operate without long-term plans. This isn't accident or oversight—it's philosophy.

## The Power of Short Sight

> "For some that may seem shortsighted. They'd be right. We're literally looking at what's in front of us, not at everything we could possibly imagine."

They embrace the label. Being shortsighted means:
- Focusing on immediate reality
- Making decisions with current information
- Avoiding imaginary problems
- Staying flexible

## Six-Week Horizons

"Every six weeks or so, we decide what we'll be working on next. And that's the only plan we have. Anything further out is considered a 'maybe, we'll see.'"

This cycle provides:
- Regular decision points
- Manageable planning horizons
- Flexibility to change course
- Reduced planning overhead

## The Relief of Revision

> "When you stick with planning for the short term, you get to change your mind often. And that's a huge relief! This eliminates the pressure for perfect planning and all the stress that comes with it."

Benefits of frequent course correction:
- No perfect planning pressure
- Quick adaptation to new information
- Lower cost of being wrong
- Continuous learning

## Steering vs. Plotting

"We simply believe that you're better off steering the ship with a thousand little inputs as you go rather than a few grand sweeping movements made way ahead of time."

Navigation metaphor:
- Long-term plans = Plotting a course through unknown waters
- Short-term planning = Constant small adjustments based on conditions

## The Security Illusion

> "Furthermore, long-term planning instills a false sense of security. The sooner you admit you have no idea what the world will look like in five years, three years, or even one year, the sooner you'll be able to move forward without the fear of making the wrong big decision years in advance."

Accepting uncertainty is liberating:
- No fear of major miscalculations
- No sunk cost in outdated plans
- Freedom to respond to reality
- Honest assessment of capabilities

## The Plan Trap

"Much corporate anxiety comes from the realization that the company has been doing the wrong thing, but it's too late to change direction because of the 'Plan.' 'We've got to see it through!'"

The sunk cost of planning:
- Emotional investment in decisions
- Political capital spent on buy-in
- Resources already committed
- Face-saving over effectiveness

## Information Quality

> "The further away you are from something, the fuzzier it becomes. The future is a major abstraction, riddled with a million vibrating variables you can't control. The best information you'll ever have about a decision is at the moment of execution."

Decision-making principle:
- Delay decisions until necessary
- Use the freshest information
- Avoid premature optimization
- Trust emergence over prediction

## Mental Model: Just-in-Time Decision Making

Like just-in-time manufacturing, make decisions when you have:
1. **Maximum Information**: The most current data
2. **Clear Context**: Understanding of actual conditions
3. **Real Constraints**: Actual vs. imagined limitations
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Quick validation of choices

## Practical Implementation

1. **Replace Annual Planning**: Use quarterly or 6-week cycles
2. **Maintain a "Maybe List"**: Ideas without commitments
3. **Regular Reviews**: Assess and adjust frequently
4. **Embrace Pivots**: Change direction without shame
5. **Communicate Flexibility**: Set expectations about planning horizons

## The Paradox of Progress

Without long-term plans, Basecamp has:
- Stayed in business nearly 20 years
- Remained profitable throughout
- Built products used by millions
- Maintained company culture
- Adapted to massive tech changes

Sometimes the best way forward is one step at a time.
