## The Core Philosophy

"It's crazy at work" has become the default state for too many organizations. This isn't natural, necessary, or beneficial—it's a perversion of what work should be. The modern workplace has become sick with chaos, anxiety, and unsustainable practices that destroy both productivity and people.

**The central insight:** The answer isn't more hours, it's less bullshit. Less waste, not more production. And far fewer distractions, less always-on anxiety, and avoiding stress.

## The Two Primary Culprits

### 1. Fragmented Attention
The workday is being sliced into tiny, fleeting work moments by an onslaught of physical and virtual distractions. People can't get work done at work anymore because there's hardly any uninterrupted, dedicated time to do it.

### 2. Growth Obsession
An unhealthy obsession with growth at any cost sets towering, unrealistic expectations that stress people out. Ego-driven goals and artificial targets create a culture of perpetual emergency.

## The Human Cost

### The Badge of Stupidity
"Long hours, excessive busyness, and lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for many people these days. Sustained exhaustion is not a badge of honor, it's a mark of stupidity."

### The Spillover Effect
- Work becomes all-consuming, turning life into work's leftovers—"the doggie bag"
- People work longer, earlier, later, on weekends, whenever they have a spare moment
- Stress is passed from organization to employee, from employee to employee, and then from employee to customer
- "Stress never stops at the border of work. It bleeds into life. It infects your relationships with your friends, your family, your kids."

## The Paradox of Modern Work

Despite all the promises of new technologies and time-management hacks:
- People are working more but getting less done
- The load is getting heavier, not lighter
- Out of 60-80 hour work weeks, the bulk of hours are "tossed away in meetings, lost to distraction, and withered away by inefficient business practices"

**Key realization:** "There's not more work to be done all of a sudden. The problem is that there's hardly any uninterrupted, dedicated time to do it."

## The Alternative: Calm

### What Calm Looks Like
- Protecting people's time and attention
- About 40 hours of work a week
- Reasonable expectations
- Ample time off
- Smaller
- A visible horizon
- Meetings as a last resort
- Asynchronous first, real-time second
- More independence, less interdependence
- Sustainable practices for the long term
- Profitability

### The Basecamp Model
For nearly 20 years, Basecamp has operated as a calm company:
- No growth-at-all-costs
- No false busyness
- No ego-driven goals
- No keeping up with the Joneses Corporation
- No hair on fire
- Profitable every year in business

Despite being in one of the most competitive industries, competing against venture-backed startups and tech giants, Basecamp has thrived with:
- 40-hour weeks (32 in summer)
- Month-long sabbaticals every three years
- Fully distributed team across 30 cities
- Zero venture capital funding

## The Manifesto

**"If it's constantly crazy at work, we have two words for you: Fuck that. And two more: Enough already."**

It's time to:
- Stop asking employees to breathlessly chase ever-higher, ever-more-artificial targets set by ego
- Give people the uninterrupted time that great work demands
- Stop celebrating crazy at work
- Recognize that chaos should not be the natural state at work
- Understand that anxiety isn't a prerequisite for progress
- Accept that sitting in meetings all day isn't required for success

## The Choice

"We've designed our company differently. We're here to tell you about the choices we've made and why we've made many of them. There's a path for any company willing to make similar choices. You've got to want it, but if you do you'll realize it's much nicer over here. You can have a calm company, too."

The modern workplace doesn't have to be sick. These are all "perversions of work—side effects of broken models and follow-the-lemming-off-the-cliff worst practices. Step aside and let the suckers jump."

## Mental Model: The Calm Company Framework

**Calm is intentional:** It's a choice, a practice, a series of deliberate decisions that go against the grain of modern workplace culture. It requires:

1. **Rejection of false urgency:** "No, not 9 p.m. Wednesday night. It can wait until 9 a.m. Thursday morning. No, not Sunday. Monday."

2. **Protection over production:** Protecting time and attention matters more than maximizing output

3. **Sustainability over sprints:** Long-term thinking beats short-term hustle

4. **Reality over rhetoric:** Acknowledging that occasional stress is part of life, but ensuring it remains the exception, not the rule
