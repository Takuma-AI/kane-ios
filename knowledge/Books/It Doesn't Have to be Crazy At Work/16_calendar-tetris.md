## The Most Destructive Invention

The shared work calendar is one of the most destructive inventions of modern times. So much orbits around it, so much hinges on it, and so much is wrong because of it.

At Basecamp, getting on someone's schedule is:
- A tedious, direct negotiation
- Not an easy, automated convenience
- Requires making your case
- Can't just plant your flag in an open slot

**Why? Because no one can see anyone else's calendar at Basecamp.**

## The Transparency Trap

In most companies:
- Everyone can see everyone else's day
- Calendars are completely transparent
- They're optimized to be filled by anyone
- People are encouraged to slice others' days into 30-minute chunks
- Calendar blocks become a Tetris game of fitting meetings

Ask yourself:
- How many things did YOU put on your calendar?
- How many things did OTHER PEOPLE put there?

## The Perverse Optimization

When you optimize calendars for effortless carving:
- Don't be surprised when time gets sliced up
- Software finds slots that work for everyone
- Six-person meetings proliferate
- Days become fragmented rainbow blocks
- Deep work becomes impossible

**If you make it easy to take someone's time, people will take it.**

## The Core Principle

**Taking someone's time should be a pain in the ass.**

Taking many people's time should be so cumbersome that most people won't even bother unless it's REALLY IMPORTANT!

Meetings should be a last resort, especially big ones.

## The Asymmetric Cost

When someone takes your time:
- **It doesn't cost them anything**
- **It costs you everything**

You can only do great work with adequate quality time. When someone takes that, they crush:
- Your feeling of accomplishment
- Your ability to make progress
- Your deep satisfaction from actual work
- Your ownership of your day

## The Ownership Test

If you don't own the vast majority of your own time, it's impossible to be calm. You'll always be:
- Stressed out
- Feeling robbed of ability to do your job
- Reactive instead of proactive
- Playing calendar Tetris instead of doing work

## The "Just an Invitation" Excuse

"But it's just an invitation!"

Nobody ever declines in good conscience. No one wants to be seen as:
- Difficult
- Inaccessible
- Not a team player
- Uncooperative

So they let the blocks drop until their day is crushed and the game is over.

## Mental Models

**Time Ownership**: You should control your calendar, not be controlled by it.

**Friction as Feature**: Difficulty in scheduling protects time for real work.

**The Invitation Trap**: Social pressure makes "optional" meetings mandatory.

## The Basecamp Alternative

1. **No shared calendars**: Privacy protects autonomy
2. **Direct negotiation**: Important meetings require conversation
3. **High friction**: Effort required matches meeting importance
4. **Individual control**: You decide how to spend your time

## The Ultimate Test

If you can't be bothered to schedule a meeting without software to do the work, just don't bother at all. **It probably wasn't necessary in the first place.**

## Reclaiming Your Calendar

1. **Block deep work time** as "busy"—no details needed
2. **Decline by default**—meetings must justify themselves
3. **Batch similar meetings** to protect continuous time
4. **Question recurring meetings**—most can be emails
5. **Make scheduling harder**—friction reduces frivolous meetings

## The Goal

Your calendar should be mostly empty space for real work, not a Tetris board of other people's priorities. When you control your time, you control your ability to produce meaningful work.
