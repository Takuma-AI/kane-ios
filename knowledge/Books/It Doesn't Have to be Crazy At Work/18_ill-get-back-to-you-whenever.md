## The Escalation Pattern

The expectation of immediate response ignites fires at work:

1. Someone emails you
2. No response in minutes? They text you
3. Still nothing? They call you
4. Then they ask someone else where you are
5. That person goes through the same steps

Suddenly you're pulled from your work. For what? A crisis? Almost never.

## The Unreasonable Expectation

In almost every situation, the expectation of immediate response is unreasonable. Yet with real-time tools creeping into work—especially instant messaging and group chat—immediate response has become the new normal.

**This is not progress.**

## The Flawed Logic

Common thinking: "If I can write you quickly, you can get back to me quickly, right?"

- **Technically**: Right
- **Practically**: Wrong

How fast someone can reach you has nothing to do with how quickly they need a response. **The content of the communication dictates that.**

## The Response Priority Matrix

**Immediate** (True emergencies only):
- Actual crises
- Time-sensitive with real consequences

**Can Wait** (Almost everything):
- Resending last week's document
- Questions you can find answers to yourself
- Meeting times for three days from now
- General updates and FYIs

**Almost everything can wait. And almost everything should.**

## The Basecamp Culture

At Basecamp: **Eventual response rather than immediate response**

This means:
- No one loses it if answers arrive three hours later
- Long stretches without checking messages are encouraged
- Deep work takes priority over quick responses
- Calm replaces panic

## The Right Approach

1. **Say something, then get back to work**
2. **Don't expect anything immediate**
3. **You'll get a response when they're free**
4. **Trust the system**

If someone doesn't respond quickly:
- It's NOT because they're ignoring you
- It's probably because they're working
- Respect their focus
- Find something else to do while waiting

## Mental Models

**Response Time ≠ Message Speed**: Fast sending doesn't require fast responding.

**The Urgency Illusion**: Most "urgent" requests are just impatience in disguise.

**Asynchronous by Default**: Assume delay, be surprised by speed.

## The Benefits of Waiting

**For the sender**:
- Forces prioritization
- Encourages self-sufficiency
- Reduces dependency
- Improves planning

**For the receiver**:
- Protects focus time
- Reduces stress
- Enables deep work
- Maintains autonomy

## Creating the Culture

1. **Set expectations explicitly**: "I'll respond within 24 hours"
2. **Model the behavior**: Don't respond immediately yourself
3. **Praise delayed responses**: "Thanks for getting back when you could"
4. **Question urgency**: "When do you actually need this by?"
5. **Use the right tools**: Email over instant messaging

## The Waiting Test

Don't you have other work to do while you wait? If not, the problem isn't their response time—it's your workflow.

## The Ultimate Outcome

Waiting it out is fine. The sky won't fall. The company won't fold. 

It'll just be a calmer, cooler, more comfortable place to work. For everyone.
