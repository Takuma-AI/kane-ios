## The Expert's Dilemma

Basecamp has all sorts of experts:
- Statistics specialists
- JavaScript event handling gurus
- Database optimization masters
- Network diagnostics experts
- Tricky copyediting professionals

Having instant access to experts is wonderful. And terrible.

## The Hidden Cost of Instant Access

**Wonderful when**: The right answer unlocks insight or progress

**Terrible when**: That expert fields their fifth random question of the day and suddenly the day is done

The person with the question gets what they need. The person with the answer had to stop what they were doing. **That's rarely a fair trade.**

## The Interruption Problem

Making it too easy to ask any question immediately creates problems:
- Most questions aren't that pressing
- The urge to ask immediately is irresistible  
- Experts can't predict or plan their days
- Random questions destroy deep work
- Expertise becomes a burden, not an asset

The expert's day becomes:
- None, a handful, or a dozen questions—who knows?
- No ability to plan
- Constant context switching
- Their own work suffering

## The Academic Solution

Basecamp borrowed from academia: **office hours**.

All subject-matter experts publish office hours:
- Some offer an open afternoon every Tuesday
- Others might provide one hour daily
- Each expert decides their availability
- Questions wait until office hours

## The Waiting Game

"But what if you have a question on Monday and office hours aren't until Thursday?"

**You wait.** You either:
- Work on something else until Thursday
- Figure it out yourself before Thursday
- Realize it wasn't that important

Just like you would with a professor.

## Unexpected Benefits

This might seem inefficient or bureaucratic at first, but office hours have been a huge success:

### For the Expert
- **Regained control** over their schedule
- **Longer stretches** of uninterrupted time  
- **Planned moments** for teaching mode
- **Protected time** for their own work
- **Reduced stress** from unpredictability

### For the Organization
- **Better questions** (people think before asking)
- **Self-sufficiency** increases  
- **Knowledge sharing** becomes intentional
- **Expertise scales** better
- **Calmer environment** overall

## Mental Models

**Synchronous Cost**: Every interruption costs two people's time and focus.

**The Professor Model**: Expertise should be accessible but not on-demand.

**Batching Benefits**: Grouping similar activities (teaching/helping) improves both efficiency and quality.

## Implementation Strategies

1. **Let experts set hours**: They know their work rhythms best
2. **Publish clearly**: Make office hours visible and respected
3. **Enforce boundaries**: No exceptions except true emergencies
4. **Encourage self-service**: Often people can find answers themselves
5. **Rotate availability**: Different experts on different days

## The Mindset Shift

From: "I need an answer now"  
To: "I'll get an answer at the right time"

From: "Always available"  
To: "Available with intention"

## The Ultimate Benefit

It's something to look forward to and something to put behind you. Office hours create:
- Dedicated time for helping
- Protected time for working
- Clear boundaries for everyone
- Sustainable expertise sharing

Keep the office door open—but only on Tuesdays from nine to noon!
