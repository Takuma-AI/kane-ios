## The Modern Affliction

FOMO—The Fear Of Missing Out. It's what drives obsessive checking of:
- Twitter feeds
- Facebook updates  
- Instagram stories
- WhatsApp groups
- News apps
- Slack channels

People pick up phones dozens of times daily when notifications buzz because WHAT IF IT WAS SOMETHING SUPER IMPORTANT!

(It just about never is.)

## From Social to Work

FOMO is no longer contained to social media—it's seeping into work. As if email wasn't bad enough at cultivating FOMO, we now have real-time tools like chat stoking it. Yet another thing demanding continuous partial attention all day, insisting you can't miss out.

**Fuck that.**

## The Radical Truth

**People should be missing out!**

Most people should miss out on most things most of the time.

That's what Basecamp encourages: **JOMO! The Joy Of Missing Out.**

## What JOMO Enables

JOMO lets you:
- Turn off the information firehose
- Stop the chatter and interruptions
- Actually get the right shit done
- Focus deeply on what matters
- Find calm in the silence

## The Better Way

Instead of real-time drip-drip-drip feeds throughout the day:
- Catch up with a single summary email tomorrow morning
- Read consolidated updates when convenient
- Process information in batches
- Maintain control over your attention

**JOMO, baby, JOMO.**

## The Company Reality

There's absolutely no reason everyone needs to know everything happening at the company. Especially not in real time!

**If it's important, you'll find out.**

Most of it isn't. Most day-to-day work inside a company's walls is mundane. And that's beautiful. It's work, not news.

## The News Ticker Problem

We must stop treating every little thing at work like it's on a breaking-news ticker. Work isn't:
- Entertainment
- A reality show
- A social feed
- A competition for attention

## The Heartbeat Solution

Basecamp pushes back with monthly "Heartbeats":
- Summaries of work and progress by teams
- Written by team leads to the entire company
- Minutiae boiled down to essential points
- Just enough to keep people in the loop
- No need to internalize dozens of irrelevant details

## The Pop Quiz Mentality

Many companies create cultures where people treat every detail like there's going to be a pop quiz:
- Must know every fact
- Every figure
- Every name  
- Every event

This is a waste of brain power and an egregious waste of attention.

## Mental Models

**Selective Ignorance**: Not knowing most things is a superpower, not a weakness.

**Information Diet**: Like food, information should be consumed intentionally, not constantly.

**The Essential Filter**: If it matters, it will find you. If it doesn't find you, it didn't matter.

## Practicing JOMO

1. **Turn off notifications** except for true emergencies
2. **Check messages on your schedule**, not theirs
3. **Unsubscribe liberally** from updates that don't serve you
4. **Batch information consumption** into dedicated times
5. **Celebrate not knowing** things that don't matter

## The Focus Directive

**Focus on your work at hand. That's all we ask. That's all we require.**

If there's anything you must know, we promise you'll hear about it. If curious, follow what you want—but feel the oblivious joy of focus rather than the frantic fear of missing something that didn't matter anyway.

## The Ultimate Freedom

JOMO is freedom from:
- Information anxiety
- Constant vigilance
- Fractured attention
- The tyranny of the urgent
- The burden of omniscience

It's permission to be blissfully unaware of most things so you can be deeply aware of the right things.
