## The Freedom of Not Knowing

As a general rule, nobody at Basecamp really knows where anyone else is at any given moment:
- Are they working? Dunno.
- Are they taking a break? Dunno.
- Are they at lunch? Dunno.
- Are they picking up their kid from school? Dunno.

**Don't care.**

No butts-in-seats requirement for office workers. No virtual status indicators for remote workers. No surveillance.

## The Flawed Question

"But how do you know if someone's working if you can't see them?"

Same answer as: "How do you know if someone's working if you CAN see them?"

**You don't.**

The only way to know if work is getting done is by looking at the actual work. That's the boss's job. If they can't do that job, they should find another one.

## Technology Makes It Worse

Now it's not just the boss who wants to know where you areâ€”it's everyone else too. With chat tools invading the workplace, people are asked to broadcast their real-time status constantly.

They're chained to the dot:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green for available
- ðŸ”´ Red for away

## The Availability Trap

When everyone knows you're "available," it's an invitation to be interrupted. You might as well have a neon sign flashing **BOTHER ME!** above your head.

**Try this experiment:**
- Be "available" for three hours
- Then be "away" for three hours
- Compare productivity

Bet you get more work done when marked "away."

## The Right Way to Connect

What if you need something from someone and don't know their availability?

**Just ask them!**
- If they respond, you have what you need
- If they don't, they're working on something else
- Respect that!
- Assume people are focused on their own work

## The Exception Rule

Are there exceptions? Of course. It might be good to know who's around in a true emergency.

But 1% occasions shouldn't drive policy 99% of the time.

## Mental Models

**Work vs. Presence**: Being present doesn't equal being productive.

**Trust Through Output**: Judge by results, not surveillance.

**The Green Dot Trap**: Availability indicators invite interruption.

## The Implicit Status

Everyone's status should be implicit: **"I'm trying to do my job, please respect my time and attention."**

This creates:
- Freedom to work when most effective
- Flexibility for life's demands
- Trust between colleagues
- Focus on outcomes over optics

## Breaking Free from the Prison

1. **Eliminate status indicators** in communication tools
2. **Stop tracking location** or availability
3. **Judge by output**, not hours or presence
4. **Trust by default** rather than surveilling
5. **Respect the unknown**â€”not knowing is okay

## The Management Shift

From: "I need to see you working"  
To: "I need to see your work"

From: "Where are you?"  
To: "What did you accomplish?"

From: "Are you available?"  
To: "Is the work getting done?"

## The Benefits of Freedom

When people aren't imprisoned by presence requirements:
- They work when most effective
- They handle life without guilt
- They focus without performing
- They produce better results
- They feel trusted and respected

## The Ultimate Goal

Take a step toward calm: relieve people from needing to broadcast their whereabouts and status. Create an environment where work quality matters more than the appearance of working.
