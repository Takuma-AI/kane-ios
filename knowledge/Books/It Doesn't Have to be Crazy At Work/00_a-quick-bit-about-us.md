## Who We Are

We're Jason and David. We've been running Basecamp together since 2003. Jason is CEO, David is CTO, and we're the only two Cs at the company.

## What We Do

Basecamp is both the name of our company and the name of our product. The Basecamp product is a unique cloud-based application that helps companies organize all their projects and internal communications in one place. 

**The promise of Basecamp:**
- People know what they need to do
- Everyone knows where everything is
- It's easy to see where things stand
- Nothing slips through the cracks

## Our Approach

### Experimentation as Philosophy
"We've experimented a lot with how we run our business. In this book we share what's worked for us, along with observations and realizations about what makes for a healthy, long-term, sustainable business."

### Not Divine Doctrine
**Important caveat:** "As with all advice, your mileage may vary. Take these ideas as inspiration for change, not as some sort of divine doctrine."

This acknowledgment is crucial—what works for Basecamp may need adaptation for other contexts. The principles are meant to inspire experimentation, not blind adherence.

## A Note on Language

"We use the word 'crazy' in this book in the same way people use crazy to describe the crazy traffic at rush hour, the crazy weather outside, and the crazy line at the airport. When we say crazy, we're calling situations crazy, not people."

This clarification sets the tone: the critique is of systems and practices, not individuals caught within them.

## Mental Model: Practice What You Preach

The credibility of the advice in this book comes from lived experience:

1. **Duration:** Nearly 20 years of refining these practices
2. **Scale:** Managing a successful software company in a hyper-competitive industry
3. **Sustainability:** Profitable every year without venture capital
4. **Innovation:** Continuously experimenting with better ways to work

The authors aren't theorists—they're practitioners sharing what has actually worked in building and maintaining a calm, profitable, sustainable business.
