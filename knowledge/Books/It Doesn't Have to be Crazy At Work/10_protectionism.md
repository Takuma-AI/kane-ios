## The Paradox of Protection

Companies love to protect:
- Their brand with trademarks and lawsuits
- Their data and secrets with NDAs and policies  
- Their money with budgets and CFOs

Yet they fail to protect what's both most vulnerable and most precious: their employees' time and attention.

## The Hidden Cost

Companies spend employees' time and attention as if there were an infinite supply of both. As if they cost nothing. Yet these are among the scarcest resources we have.

At Basecamp, protecting employees' time and attention is the top responsibility. You can't expect great work without a full day's attention to devote to it. **Partial attention is barely attention at all.**

## Case Study: Status Meetings

Traditional status meetings seem efficient - get everyone together, each person shares updates. But the math reveals the truth:

**Eight people in a room for an hour doesn't cost one hour, it costs eight hours.**

### The Better Way
Instead of status meetings, Basecamp uses:
- Written updates (daily or weekly)
- Asynchronous reading when people have free moments
- This saves dozens of hours per week
- Creates larger blocks of uninterrupted time

## The Currency of Attention

Time and attention are best spent in large bills, not spare coins. You need big chunks of time to do thorough, wonderful work. When you don't get that, you're forced to:
- Scrounge for focused time
- Squeeze project work between mandated distractions
- Work late nights and weekends to find uninterrupted time

It's sad that some people crave their commute - it's the only time they have to themselves.

## Mental Models

**Time as Currency**: Spend time in large bills for meaningful work, not small change on distractions.

**The True Cost Equation**: Meeting cost = number of people Ã— time. Always calculate the total human hours.

**Attention Integrity**: Partial attention produces partial results. Protect whole blocks of focus.

## Practical Implementation

1. **Eliminate status meetings**: Replace with asynchronous written updates
2. **Calculate true costs**: Before scheduling, multiply attendees by duration
3. **Create boundaries**: Establish meeting-free zones and times
4. **Default to writing**: Documentation beats synchronous communication

## The Protectionist Mandate

Be a protectionist, but remember to protect what matters most. Your employees' time and attention are irreplaceable resources that, once spent, can never be recovered.
