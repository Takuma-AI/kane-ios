## Core Concept: Seeing Through Others' Eyes

Imagine planning a long car trip with your family. Before leaving, you think through each person's needs: How often will the kids need restroom stops? Where can everyone agree to eat? How long can they sit without difficulty? What entertainment do they need?

You imagine each family member from their perspective, then figure out how to avoid conflicts as you play it out over space and time. **This is empathetic perspective.**

The most successful innovators see subtle differences between many perspectives within both supply and demand, enabling them to foresee problems and make tradeoffs. They have night vision goggles that allow them to:

- **See around corners**: 360-degree perspective of everyone interacting with your creation
- **See through space and time**: Play out events before they occur to anticipate problems

## Mental Model: Empathy vs. Sympathy

**Sympathy**: Detached and theoretical understanding. You're not in their shoes, feeling what they feel.

**Empathy**: Understanding and sharing the feelings of another. Disconnecting from your own perspective—emotionally and socially—to see, hear, and feel from another's viewpoint without judgment.

**Key Distinction**: You're not trying to convince your kid they shouldn't need rest stops or arguing about restaurant choices. You're accepting their perspective without judgment and planning accordingly.

## Uncovering Demand Through Empathetic Perspective

### The Art and Science of Interviewing

Interviewing is the most valuable way to learn empathetic perspective. The key: approach as an **"empty vessel"**—leave yourself out of the equation.

### Ten Interview Techniques for Success

#### 1. The Setup
Create a casual, documentary-like tone where there's no right or wrong answer.

**Do**: "I'm doing early research to understand why people change jobs. There's no right or wrong answer. I don't have a long list of questions."

**Don't**: "I'm doing research. Tell me why you changed jobs."

#### 2. Details, Details, Details
Use tangible details to jog memory. The brain remembers vast details when prompted.

**Do**: "Did you lose an account that day?" "Did you tell your boss?" "What was the weather?"

**Don't**: "Tell me about the day." (Too general)

#### 3. Context Creates Meaning
The irrational becomes rational with context. When answers feel irrational, you don't know the whole story.

**Accept**: "I switched because my boss didn't trust me. They second-guessed my work. I no longer felt valued. My future promotability was limited."

**Don't Accept**: "I didn't like my boss." ("Like" is not a cause)

#### 4. Contrast Creates Value
Use bracketing techniques where neither option is right, forcing elaboration.

**Do**: "Why switch employers? Why not find another role within the organization?"

**Don't**: "Why did you switch employers?"

#### 5. Unpack Vague Words
Everything is bounded. There's no "fast," only "faster than..."

**Accept**: "I wanted to promote faster. I'd been in my role two years without moving up."

**Don't Accept**: "I wanted to promote faster."

#### 6. Energy Matters
Listen for how they say things, not just what they say.

**Question This**: "We had our THIRD baby." "[Sigh] We had our third baby."

**Don't Question**: "We had our third baby." (Said normally)

#### 7. Play "Dumb"
Frame challenging questions as your own naivety to avoid defensiveness.

**Do**: "I get that it's important but hard to describe, right? Did something make you feel icky?"

**Don't**: "Why don't you know why social justice matters to you?"

#### 8. Set-Up Bad Questions
Disarm potentially awkward questions by acknowledging them upfront.

**Do**: "I've got a personal question, and you don't have to answer..."

**Don't**: "Why were you in over your head?"

#### 9. Good Cop, Bad Cop
Interview in pairs to create productive tension and check importance.

**Do**: Argue with each other to fuel conversation

**Don't**: Argue with the interviewee

#### 10. Use Analogies
When they hit a wall, help build language through comparison.

**Do**: "How is getting a new boss like starting over?"

**Don't**: Continue pushing the same way when they're stuck

### Unpacking Interview Results

From 22 interviews about job changes, 1,000+ individual pushes and pulls condensed to 14 core causes:

1. Don't respect/trust people I work with
2. Work has little impact
3. Day-to-day wearing me down
4. Company struggling, end near
5. New manager feels like starting over
6. Feel disrespected and not trusted
7. Personal life milestone (turned 30, had child)
8. Job/career milestone (MBA, 10 years)
9. Work dominating life and family
10. Trusted advisor guides next step
11. Challenged beyond abilities/ethics
12. Not challenged or bored
13. Can't see growth path
14. Feel alone, ignored, unsupported

**Key Finding**: Any five of these pushes typically trigger job search.

### The Croquet Analogy

Visualize people as balls and life events as wickets in croquet. Because you understand what they see, hear, and mean, you can predict when they'll hit new wickets (birth of child, degree, etc.) and how it will impact decisions—even before they see it.

## Managing Supply-Side with Empathetic Perspective

### Identifying Key Players

Ask yourself:
- Who's involved? Why?
- What do they do?
- Internal roles: marketing, finance, manufacturing, production
- External influencers: suppliers, partners

Each person occupies different sides of the equation and sees differently. Skilled innovators see the whole.

### Mental Model: Become the Molecule

Dr. Willie Moore's radical teaching method emerged while Bob struggled with the rearview mirror problem. She said: "I want you to become the molecule, that becomes the plastic, that then becomes the mirror." Like the Schoolhouse Rock episode "I'm Just a Bill," but for manufacturing.

**Bob's Journey as the Molecule**:
"I'm the molecule. I'm made at Dow Chemicals, where they formulate me into pellets and then ship me to various plants via train. Once I arrive, I sit in the plant hopper and wait my turn. It may take days, weeks, or months, but suddenly, I get poured into a buffer that starts to heat me up. There are different pressures and temperatures as I make my way through the machine melding together. Then I'm placed into a dye mold where I sit and dry for twenty seconds, then I get popped out, cooled for a minute before getting shaped and placed into a box. That box goes to the assembly line at the plant where I'm then placed into a car, shipped to dealers, and bought by customers."

**The Revelation**: This exercise forced Bob to answer critical questions:
- Who's involved? Why are they involved? What do they do?
- Not just from people's perspective but from the thing itself
- See the broader picture to frame what's going on
- Understand what to do

**Why This Works**:
- Moves from one problem/one solution to many problems/many solutions
- Creates humbleness—realize you don't have the answer
- Stops assuming a solution and chasing one hypothesis
- Forces you to see complexity at right level

**The Deeper Insight**: "Oftentimes when people go to design a product, they think there's an objectively 'best' way to do it because they lack empathetic perspective on the supply-side. They don't understand the context or perspective wrapped around their product or service, so they're trying to find the absolute best way to build it. But there's no such thing as a 'best' way, you must make tradeoffs."

### Understanding Flow

When businesses describe themselves, they talk products. They should think **flow**:
- Flow of information
- Flow of money  
- Flow of finished goods

When you understand flow, perspectives become objectively visible.

### Teaching Others to See the Whole

Red line organizations work in silos, assuming common understanding. This costs years in development and millions in revenue.

**Solution**: Rotation
- Marketing understands engineering
- Engineering understands assembly line
- Not just talking—genuine time in others' shoes

**Young Bob's Mistake**: "I'd listen, but I'd use that information to try to convince them of my perspective. I wanted to show them they were wrong."

**True Empathetic Perspective**:
- Not trying to convince others
- Understanding where they're coming from
- Recognizing you might be wrong
- Requires humbleness and curiosity

## Decision Framework

When developing empathetic perspective:

1. **Empty yourself** - Leave your perspective behind
2. **Listen for energy** - How things are said matters
3. **Seek context** - Irrational becomes rational with full story
4. **Use contrast** - Help people articulate through comparison
5. **Accept complexity** - Multiple perspectives exist simultaneously
6. **Map the flow** - Understand movement through systems

## Applications

### Customer Research
- Master interview techniques
- Unpack for core causes, not surface symptoms
- Map customer journey through space and time
- Predict future needs based on life events

### Organizational Design
- Implement rotation programs
- Create genuine cross-functional understanding
- Focus on flow, not static structures
- Build systems that see around corners

### Product Development
- Become your product through its lifecycle
- Understand all stakeholder perspectives
- Anticipate integration problems early
- Make informed tradeoffs

### Personal Development
- Practice with family disagreements
- Immerse in unfamiliar contexts
- Take improv classes for role-playing
- Read stories from different times/places

## Key Insights

1. **Empathy requires emptying yourself** - You can't understand while defending your view

2. **Details unlock memory** - Specific questions trigger broader recollection

3. **Energy reveals importance** - How people say things matters as much as what

4. **Context transforms meaning** - The irrational becomes rational with full story

5. **Flow reveals perspective** - Understanding movement shows all viewpoints

6. **Humbleness enables sight** - Knowing you don't know opens understanding

## Willie Moore's Teaching Legacy

Dr. Willie Moore—the first female African American to earn a doctorate in physics—taught empathetic perspective through radical methods. As a Black woman in 1980s car manufacturing (where women represented only 20% of workforce), she possessed unique perspective on seeing from others' viewpoints.

**Her Standards**: "I have to be better than everybody else, because they've already prejudged me as a black woman." This drove her to push Bob equally hard.

**The Volunteer Story**: Three weeks into Bob's fulltime employment, heading into a management meeting, Willie said: "When they ask for a volunteer to take responsibility for this project, I want you to raise your hand."

When no one else volunteered (everyone lowering heads, avoiding eye contact), terrified Bob obeyed. Management was shocked: "Wait, you're taking it?"

After the meeting, Willie explained: "Now you have all the power. No one's going to fire a twenty-five-year-old engineer who's willing to step into the burning building, especially when none of the tenured engineers would volunteer." 

She saw only upside: Solve it and you're the hero; fail and nothing lost. Plus, tenured engineers would rush to help—they didn't want it coming back to them.

**Her Empathetic Methods**:
- Always entered plants through employee entrance, not visitor parking
- "If you park in front, the plant manager will escort you. We need to observe unnoticed; we need to look like one of them."
- Connected dots between Deming/Taguchi theory and frontline practice
- Saw situations from multiple angles others missed

**Her Character**: 
- Animal spirit: Mama bear—protective but fierce when needed
- Hated typos and apathy equally
- Glass half full despite multiple cancer battles
- Like Olivia Benson from Law & Order: tenacious, always peeling back layers

Willie attended Bob's wedding and remained friends until her death from cancer. Her legacy: teaching that empathetic perspective requires both humbleness to learn and courage to act on what you see.
