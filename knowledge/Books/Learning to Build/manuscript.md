Introduction
“After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in
Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.”	
Morpheus, fictional character The Matrix
Be prepared, this book is the red pill of innovation. You can never unsee what I’m going to
reveal. The real world of innovation is not what it seems and certainly not what I'd been
taught in school…	
My story of unraveling The Matrix began the summer of my junior year in college when I
had the opportunity to do an engineering internship at a major car manufacturer about
developing better products. At the time in 1985, the manufacturer was launching a new
version of a popular car line and they’d discovered a problem: Forty percent of the newly
designed rearview mirrors would pop out of their holder when the weather got too hot and
humid.	
The key culprit seemed to be the shrinkage rate of the polymer case holding the mirror; it
was sensitive to swings in the ambient temperature. The problem started during the
manufacturing of the cases: The polymer base would trap moisture from the surrounding
environment when it was being molded, and then when the temperatures got too hot this
would cause the case to expand too much and the mirrors would drop out. You'd get into
the car, go to start the engine, look up, and the mirror would be missing; it was sitting on
the dashboard. A simple solution would have been a more expensive polymer, but the
manufacturer did not want to spend the extra twenty-five cents.	
By the time the manufacturer had discovered the problem, cars were already on the
assembly line and in the customer’s hands; now they were getting warranty claims. When
2
my internship started, the engineers had been working on the issue for about a year
without any real success, so they decided to use it as a case study for the interns. My job, as
I saw it, was to identify the problem and find the solution—simple enough.	
Immediately, I started looking at the problem in terms of the exception to the rule: What
was different in the forty percent of the cars where this anomaly occurred?	
The Atlanta plant was having a significant problem because of the humid climate. Can we
air condition the plant? No. Doing this would increase the costs significantly, negating the
manufacturer’s original purpose of cost savings.
Next, I toured the plant developing the mirrors. They had a huge injection molding machine
the size of a half-ton truck that melted plastic pellets and cast them into molds. Then the
mirrors came out of the machine sixteen at a time, were hand inspected, trimmed for flash,
and hit the assembly line where they were popped into their cases by workers on the
production line. I realized that the mirrors were popped into their cases while they were
still warm. So, I suggested a longer drying process, but this created assembly line issues and
again increased costs.	
There was a lot of back and forth on my part, a lot of trial and error.	
Finally, I thought I had a solution. I adjusted the chemical composition of the plastic, so the
petroleum stopped receding so much in the face of the moisture. Eureka! It seemed that I
had a solution. Right away the mirrors stopped popping out of their cases in the humidity.
My success was short lived; now when the weather got too cold the mirrors contracted and
cracked.	
Why couldn’t I solve this problem? What was I doing wrong?
It seemed every new solution created a new problem or added a new procedure that made
the price skyrocket. I was chasing my tail. Each time I solved one problem, I caused
3
another. Every time I felt like I’d made progress I realized, “Oh my God, I've traded one
problem for another.” It always felt like I was one prototype away from the answer, yet I
never got any closer to solving the problem.	
My problem was unclear to me at the time: the training I relied on hampered any real
innovation.	
What’s the Difference Between an Inventor and an Innovator?
An inventor discovers something completely new. It’s patentable. It solves one problem for one
person. An inventor creates something that has never been done before. Inventors tend to be
academically smart, and they value the uniqueness of their idea above all else. But they have no
idea how their invention is going to help anybody. A Segway is a good example of an invention.
It’s a completely new idea, but it hasn’t been widely adopted or accepted, because it doesn’t
solve a problem on a large scale.
An innovator on the other hand focuses on society as a whole, looking for ways to help people
do better. An innovator says, “I know there are tons of email programs, but I'm going to build a
better one because the existing programs suck for these reasons…” Innovators want to help
people be unstuck. The iPhone is a good example of an innovation. If you think about it, nothing
in the iPhone was new, but it fundamentally changed the world. It’s been adopted by hundreds
of millions of people.
Whether you're an entrepreneur, a software developer, or somebody who likes to tinker
innovation is the notion of solving a struggling moment and helping people at scale.
My Real Education Began
It’s at this pivotal moment that I was introduced to an entirely new worldview of problemsolving by three key innovators hired by the car giant to get to the root of several
manufacturing problems. Leading the effort was Dr. Genichi Taguchi—Japanese business
theorist, engineer, and statistician, Dr. W. Edward Deming—management consultant,
4
engineer, and statistician, and Dr. Willie Moore—the first female, African American
physicist, and engineer. I was fortunate enough as an intern to be placed on their team. And
little did I know at the time, but their mentorship would become a catalyst for my life’s
work in innovation.	
“Problems are the wrong view of the world,” Taguchi would say. “All problems are problems
about the variation of function.”	
Taguchi told me that I needed to look at the issue differently. Instead of focusing on the
problem, I should have been looking at the function of the mirror case and the variation of
function that caused the problem. I was struggling to find a solution because I was focused
on the problem—the humidity. By focusing on the humidity, I only saw half the issue and I
did not think about the other problems my solution could cause, such as making the
mirrors crack.	
I needed to change my perspective and look at the situation more broadly: How do we make
cases for the mirrors that do not grow and shrink in different temperatures? How do we
build a case that's stable in extremely different climates? How do we make the mirror case
dimensions "robust" to the environment it was going to perform in?
Rather than frame the problem and search for the solution like a needle in a haystack, I
needed to look at the problem as a system with functions. What are the systems in the
mirror case that are not performing the way that they should? Then I needed to unpack
those systems into control factors and noise factors.	
• Control factors are the things you can change that influence the system. In the
manufacturing of our mirror case, we could change machine settings—injection
pressure, barrel temperature, screw speed, hold time, etc.—and measure the
dimensions molded against different temperatures and climates.	
5
• Noise factors are the things that influence the system that you cannot control,
choose not to control, or are too expensive to control. We did not have control over
the humidity inside the plants or on the roads where the cars would be eventually
driven. By only talking about this limited view of the “problem,” aka the humidity, we
were focused on something we could neither control nor change.	
We needed to ask ourselves the following questions:	
• How can we change the things that we have control over, control factors, to make us
less sensitive to the things we cannot control, noise factors? (Taguchi defined this as
robustness.)	
• How do we set the control factors, so that the noise factors no longer affect the
output and get us the low-cost solution?	
Once we answered these questions, we designed our experiment and tested only the things
that were in our control—injection pressure, barrel temperature, screw speed, hold time,
etc. But we did not test one factor at a time; we used math to create an array that would test
thousands of combinations through only a few dozen tests at strategically different points.
(Yes, I learned design of experiments for prototyping at nineteen.) Not trying to guess or
build a great case but letting the math work for us and enable the system to teach us what
factors affected dimensional stability. Then we measured how the adjustments impacted
the way that the cases were influenced by their environment.	
After just two weeks, we solved the problem that had eluded the experts for over a year.	
Suddenly, I realized that I’d been taught the wrong way to solve problems. In engineering
school, they call them problem sets; everything is a problem. And you are always just one
solution away from solving the problem. When I finally got to work with real innovators,
they taught me that it’s not just one problem, it is many problems which relate to a function
6
and many different solutions. By only framing the problem, we just framed the symptom.
We didn’t actually understand the underlying causal mechanism of the problem.
Returning to School
Going back to school was hard after learning this lesson from the dream team. Here I was a
junior in college who had just learned all these new problem-solving techniques, and then I
returned to school where they pushed me to think like all of the other engineers.	
Almost immediately, I was asked to design an experiment with a catapult, rubber band, ball,
and cup: “How many degrees do you need to pull back this rubber band, to make that ball
fly ten feet away, and land in this cup?” my professor asked.	
It was a basic question with a simple solution, but I no longer saw it that way. I imagined
the catapult in the real world. What happens when the ball size changes? What about wind
friction? What about when the rubber band stretches from overuse. How does the catapult
height figure into the equation? How does cup size factor in?	
My professor had provided one problem and wanted one solution—the rubber band angle.
Academically, I knew what he was trying to do, but I wanted to make the best catapult. I
wanted to know how it worked in the real world.	
So, I designed an experiment to test a variety of different features and concluded that there
were eighteen different ways to get the ball from the catapult and into the cup. I picked the
most effective of the eighteen designs and presented my solution to the class.	
I found that if I doubled the number of rubber bands, made the catapult shorter, and pulled
the rubber band thirty-two degrees my ball would land in the cup with one-hundred
percent accuracy. Whereas the standard solution—twenty-two degrees—that my professor
expected, the “right” answer, only landed the ball in the cup thirty percent of the time.
7
“No, no, no!” my professor said to me. “You are making it too complicated.” In the end, I
received a D for failing to follow the instructions.	
They wanted me to frame the problem, think about the problem, and design a solution
around the problem. They wanted me to do traditional A/B testing where you create a
hypothesis and test that hypothesis. Yet now I knew that there was another way forward
and I could not unsee it.	
Under the leadership of Taguchi, Deming, and Moore I had learned to assume that I knew
nothing, test a set of different factors simultaneously to understand how the system
worked, and only then to form a hypothesis, empirically through data and observation.
When you realize that you do not know, it causes you to look at the system as
interdependent and create a test that considers a bunch of different factors simultaneously.
It’s about taking a step back and seeing the big picture.
The traditional problem-solving techniques being taught in school were not only inefficient
and ineffective, but they were also putting blinders on me. I could only see the problem, be
the problem, solve the problem. I was looking for the solution like a needle in a haystack.
And then, “Oh, shit! I’ve got another problem.”
I no longer wanted to focus on the problem. I wanted to know: What is it supposed to do?
Applying the New Methodology
The next summer I was pleased to escape the confines of the classroom and return to the
same internship program and leadership team where I’d be able to apply these new
problem-solving techniques.
I sat in the back of a conference room side-by-side with Taguchi and Moore—a surreal
moment in time as a young, curious student surrounded by intellectual heavyweights—
facing another production-line dilemma. The car manufacturer was just beginning to use
8
robots rather than people to paint cars, and they’d run into a problem. At the time, the
robots that they were using to paint the cars weren’t capable of applying the paint in a
uniform way.
The system worked by taking the paint down the arm of the robot where it hit a spinning
wheel that sprayed droplets over the vehicle. The droplets were positively charged with
high voltage, the cars had a negative charge. This caused the paint to be attracted to the
vehicle. But as the droplets hit the surface of the vehicle certain areas, depending on
whether or not they were horizontal or vertical, would have drips; the paint was too thick.
But when scientists adjusted the thickness of the paint, it resulted in an orange peel effect,
because now the paint was too thin.	
There was a lot of back and forth and prototyping but no solution to the problem had been
found. It caused significant rework, which was costing the manufacturer about $150 million
annually.	
Sitting in a room full of experts I was acutely aware that I probably understood the least
about paint systems of anyone, so I sat and listened. They talked at length about the
laborious process they’d gone through to solve the issue, addressing factors such as
humidity, paint color, and direction (horizontal versus vertical surfaces). They were focused
on the problem, paint thickness, and the noise factors that were out of their control:
humidity, paint color, and direction. Taguchi turned to me and said, "They are measuring
the wrong thing. It's about the function not the problem." I could see it clearly this time;
they needed to flip the lens.	
“This is your project. We need you to see if you can reduce the rework.” Taguchi said. Finally,
my chance!	
Immediately, I got to work framing the issue differently. I took a step back and looked at the
fundamentals: How does the system work? What function is it supposed to do? What's the
9
variation that's causing the problems? How do I design a test to control the things I can
control?	
We needed paint that would cover the surface of cars evenly regardless of the noise factors
like humidity, color, or direction. Therefore, I looked at the control factors: underlying base
paint, paint thickness, spinning speed of the internal bell, speed of the robot arm, charge on
the car, and charge on the paint. In essence, I looked at the entire system rather than
focusing on the presumed problem: variation in thickness of paint.	
By focusing only on the problems (drips and orange peel) the experts were literally trying
to find the needle in the haystack: What's the one thing that causes all these
problems? Additionally, they talked about the orange peel and drips as two separate issues,
whereas Taguchi had taught me to see them as two sides of the same function—paint
thickness. They never talked about them as the same problem. They simply said, “What's
the problem that we're trying to solve? What are the root causes to it?	
Conversely, I asked a different set of questions: What is it supposed to be doing? Where's
the variation? What's causing it? How can I make myself least sensitive to those things I
can't control?	
Similar to the rearview mirror, I designed a small focus experiment that analyzed a variety
of factors in painting a complex test piece, I never painted an entire car. Ultimately, I created
eighteen focus tests, that represented thousands of permutations, which ran over a
weekend. Quickly, I learned some of the better settings for reducing drips and orange peel
at the same time. Meanwhile, the engineering team singularly focused on one problem at a
time would cautiously change one factor at a time and paint a whole car. By only testing one
factor at a time and painting an entire car they approached the problem too carefully, after
all, they had a lot to more to lose each time their experiment failed. I, on the other hand, felt
free to test more factors and explore the unknowns.	
10
But when I came back and showed them my results they balked: “You can't do that; that’s
not how the math works. You’d have to test all five thousand combinations to find the best
one.” So, I showed them what Taguchi, Deming, and Moore had taught me.	
“I'm doing these eighteen tests, but they're spaced out in such a way that I can actually
predict what the other test results would be,” I explained. I knew I was not necessarily
getting the perfect run, but it got us in the top ninety percent.	
The reason that I was able to quickly solve the problem that had eluded the engineers for
the past year was not because I was the smartest person in the room, but because I viewed
the problem from a different perspective. It felt like Taguchi, Deming, and Moore had given
me a superpower; I’d swallowed the red pill and now I could dodge virtual bullets.
The Five Skills of Innovators and Entrepreneurs
Throughout my thirty-year career developing and launching more than 3,500 products and
services I've come across thousands of other innovators and entrepreneurs. The top ten
stand out to me, just as my key mentors stood out. One day I intentionally took a step back
and asked myself, "What do these people have in common? What traits do they possess?" I
narrowed it down to five, subtle characteristics that set them apart. These are the hidden
parts of innovation that nobody seems to teach in an in-depth way—the stuff in between
innovation tools and processes—and I believe that they are the things that differentiate me
and other key innovators and entrepreneurs I've met along the way, from being a typical
engineer, software developer, or CEO.	
• Uncovering demand	
• Empathetic perspective
• Causal structures	
11
• Prototyping to learn	
• Making tradeoffs	
The goal of this book is to take an in-depth look at these five hidden skills and why they are
so important. On the surface, they feel like concepts that you already grasp. It's true, the
ideas presented in this book are not new. For instance, I’m sure you’ve heard that having an
empathetic perspective is important when innovating. But like The Matrix, what you think
you know, and what you know, are two different things. You need to be humble enough to
realize that there's way more here than you recognize.
By calling out these five skills I want to impart the importance of the role that they play; it's
the rigor and depth behind them that I wish to convey. Most people perform these five skills
too shallowly. And those who do understand the importance of their depth didn’t acquire
that knowledge in a classroom or a book, they did so through experience. My hope is to
pave an easier path for you.	
I also want to pay homage to my key mentors Taguchi, Deming, Moore, as well as another
great, Clay Christiansen of the Harvard business school with whom I architected a theory
called “Jobs to Be Done” (JTBD). It’s the notion that people don’t buy products they hire
them to make progress in their life. It gets to the root of supply versus demand. All four of
these innovation giants shaped me, I was a receptacle for their knowledge; it became a part
of me, and I want to pass their wisdom along.
In a lot of ways innovation and entrepreneurship is like riding a bike: Individually the
pieces seem simple: balance, steering, peddling, brakes, and so on. You theoretically
understand how to do it, you study it first, but putting those theories into practice is an
entirely different thing. If you don't nail balance, the rest of it doesn't work. And the first
time that you try to pull it all together you find that it’s way more complex than you
expected; you don’t want to fall and hit the ground.
12
The five skills of innovators and entrepreneurs that are taught in this book are the things
that helped me get past those first moments of panic; they gave me a process for innovation
and allowed me to adapt. Now I have no fear. When I walk into a situation, I’m humble
enough to know that I don’t have the answers, but these five skills provide me the
confidence to know that I will find the answer.	
Today I am now in my seventh startup—Rewired—with my partner and co-founder Greg
Engle. Greg and I have worked on developing and launching products together for
seventeen years. At Rewired, we provide management consulting services that help
companies develop and launch new products. Greg and I work side-by-side with our clients
to help them understand buyer behaviors and build better products. As a result, the stories
and ideas presented in this book are a combination of our collective experiences. We are
thinking partners, and I couldn’t have written this book without Greg.
Are You Struggling to Innovate?
Someone recently told me that I reminded them of Doc Brown the fictional character from
Back to the Future, who invents time travel. I hope that we have time travel at some point.
How great would that be to go back in time and teach the younger version of ourselves the
lifetime of wisdom that we learned along the way? This book is akin to that. It’s the notion
of passing it forward. Of showing you the world as it was seen through “young Bob’s” eyes
and how that world ultimately transformed into the innovator that “old Bob” is today.
Does this sound familiar?	
• Are you always one prototype away from a solution but never seem to get there?	
• Do you spend most of your time fixing problems that you did not anticipate?	
• Does it seem like everything is going well right up until launch when it all falls apart?
13
• Are you getting very little return on the resources you deploy?	
• Does the performance of your product in the market rarely meet the predicted targets?	
If you answered “yes” then you are like young Bob. Let me teach you the art to innovation.
Once you pull together the fundamental pieces, it will spin you up in a way that allows you
to see the world nobody else can see—The Matrix—and building will become your
superpower too.

Chapter One
What’s an Innovator?
By 1988, now a graduate, I found myself working fulltime at the car manufacturer, still
under the leadership of Taguchi, Deming, and Moore. Despite the establishment of many
better problem-solving techniques, we still weren’t keeping up with our Japanese
competition and neither were our American counterparts. In Japan, industry leaders were
creating new cars at twice the speed—three years from conception to release, compared to
our six—and they were doing this at half the cost—$5 billion versus $10 billion.
If we wanted to disrupt the industry, we’d need to make drastic changes. That’s when
Deming and I ventured to Japan on a recognizance mission. After a careful analysis we
noticed significant differences between our development process and our Japanese
counterparts. We came to refer to this as “red line” versus “green line” development.
Let’s contrast the two approaches. On the red line, our process started with an early
concept design that was readily accepted. The design would be committed to paper where
we would spell out the details—engine, transmission, body, etc. At this early stage, we’d
make only slight modifications. Then each team would break off into their individual silos
and begin working on their element. The engine designer would make the best engine, the
transmission designer built the ideal transmission, and so on. Agreement and common
understanding were assumed, and the early process would run relatively smoothly—
changes were in the thousands.	
But as we got closer and closer to launch, design changes would skyrocket into the millions.
Our teams worked in silos that were extremely independent, so they never consulted one
another in an in-depth or meaningful fashion as they built out their components. As a
result, when we got close to launch and finally started to pull everything together, there
15
would be problems; the car did not connect perfectly. For instance, we’d put the
transmission and the engine together then something would break.
From a cost perspective, discovering these conflicts and differences late is disastrous. Now
it would take massive effort and significant time and money to fix them. In the beginning of
the design, changes are negligible; it’s on paper only. On the backend however, changes run
in the millions. There are custom steel tools that now must be replaced costing in the
millions each. Plus, each change impacts another element, which then must also be
adjusted.	
It felt like a high-stakes game of whack-a-mole, with a very real, looming deadline just
around the corner. In the end we would have to freeze the design and launch the car then go
back and patch up problems after launch—like the rearview mirror. The red line was a very
reactive process!
When I laid out the graph of changes over time for our green line competition, I saw
something quite different...
For starters, the Japanese manufacturer did not start with one readily accepted concept
design. Instead, they had multiple prototypes and made tons of changes in the early stages
when the design was still on paper—ten times the prototypes. Then when they eventually
broke off into their individual silos there was a lot of communication to ensure their
components worked together and that they understood each other’s perspectives. Nothing
was assumed. In essence, they pushed their product to fail early in the process before they
ever pulled the entire design together, dramatically reducing time and money spent.
In the end, the Japanese manufacturer got to the finish line with a lot less drama. And oh, by
the way, their cars actually performed better in the marketplace too. We needed to change
our approach.	
A Better Way to Innovate
16
As a young engineer I was beginning to realize that there was a behavioral side to
successful innovation; it wasn’t enough to simply know how to build, the approach to the
process mattered too.
On the red line our process was very prescribed, standardized; it removed thinking. We
simply followed the process—it worked (or so we thought)—think “best practices.” But we
were planning when we were the stupidest; I call this simplicity on the wrong side of
complexity. It’s easy to develop the best engine if you don’t need to consider the
transmission.
The green line developers approached their process from a different perspective. They took
a step back and viewed the whole which caused them to do the right things at the right
time. Rather than using their process to remove thinking, their process created the space
for thinking, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
This isn’t just the story of two commercial car companies: it’s the story of two development
teams and their approach to the process of creating new things. Throughout my career I’ve
found that eighty percent of organizations create new products on the red line. What kind
of company are you? Young Bob was a red line innovator, but I’ve evolved and so can you.
Through tens of thousands of hours of innovation, and through interactions with some of
the top innovators in the world, I’ve boiled down the difference between red line innovation
and green line innovation into the five skills of innovators and entrepreneurs. They are the
unwritten skills that I’ve developed over the years after first trying, failing, learning, and
finally succeeding. Throughout the upcoming chapters I will teach you how to build these
critical skills, but first, let’s take a brief look.
Uncovering Demand
When I was young and developing products on the red line I thought, “Build it and people
will come.” Demand was the number of people in a certain age group and demographic set;
17
I could have everybody. The market was an amazingly simple notion. It was attributes and
correlative demographics in very superficial way.
But what causes someone to buy? The fact that I'm fifty-five, live in this zip code, and have
that income, does not cause me to buy the New York Times. Something happened that
caused me to say, “Today’s the day that I’m going to subscribe to the New York Times.” What?
Green line innovators understand what causes people to buy. Specific things had to happen
in my life before I said, “Today’s the day…” Value is in the eye of the buyer, and
undercovering demand is about understanding where your buyer’s value is created. And to
be clear, profit is not value; creating value for the company is different than creating value
for the customer. Ultimately, uncovering demand is about broadening your worldview and
realizing that innovation is about helping people. It’s not about you or your product’s
features and benefits.	
Empathetic Perspective
When you’re on the red line your own perspective is the most important one. If I'm the
engine guy, I need to make sure that I explain my perspective to the person building the
transmission, but I’m less sensitive to their perspective. I don’t truly consider the
transmission designer’s point of view when building my design. I may imagine what they
think, but that’s vastly different than knowing; it’s very superficial.
Whereas on the green line, I see the situation from multiple perspectives: the customer
buying the product, the designer developing the transmission, the people on the assembly
line, etc. I get out of the conference room, or the engine lab, and seek out their perspective. I
walk the assembly line, I talk to the transmission designer, I utterly understand the many
perspectives that could impact my design. Then when I go back to build I do so with that in
mind, so that I can see the conflicts before they arise.
Causal Structures
18
On the red line people tend to focus on problems and solutions. It’s very reactionary. They
wait for a problem to arise then react. They focus myopically on one aspect or feature but
fail to see the whole. People on the red line chase their tails like young Bob with the
rearview mirror. Every solution creates another problem, and they are always one problem
away from the answer, yet they never get any closer to a solution.
Whereas on the green line people see the big picture and understand how the entire system
works. People who are good at causal structures understand that a problem is a derivative
of functions and variations of functions within a system. They have a deep understanding of
how things work—a broad, big picture view as opposed to a myopic, singularly focused
view.
For example, think of the robot paint problem from the Introduction. When scientists
focused on fixing orange peel, they got runs, and when they focused on runs, they got
orange peel. Each solution created a new problem because they were working in the
“problem space.” When I eventually solved the problem, I did so primarily because I focused
on the “function space”—thickness of paint. There are always two sides to every problem.
People good at causal structures take a step back and see the whole.
Prototyping to Learn
On the red line, people do a lot of A/B testing. This is a direct result of looking at the world
through the “problem space” as opposed to the “function space.” Because they think in
terms of one problem and one solution, they go looking for answers like a needle in a
haystack. What’s the one thing that will solve our problem? It’s the notion of testing one
factor at a time. Results on the red line are not typically reproducible.
Whereas on the green line, because they are in the “function space,” they design
experiments that change many variables at once to learn how the system works, assuming
nothing. They are prototyping to understand the possible ways it can fail. Constantly asking,
19
“What are the failure modes?” This understanding allows them to reduce costs while
solving problems because they can see the whole.	
On the green line you’re focused on learning. Whereas on the red line you are testing to
prove a hypothesis, to verify.	
Making Tradeoffs
On the red line people are not taking the time to see tradeoffs. Let’s say for instance that
you are creating a mobile app of a desktop application. If you try to do everything on the
mobile app that’s available on the desktop, the system will run slow. You can have it all, but
you will lose functionality, or you can strip it back to only the pieces that people would use
a mobile app for. It’ll be faster but not fully functional.
On the red line people are focused on making everything perfect, so they do not see the big
picture and therefore can’t make tradeoffs. They usually end up way over budget only to
find that their product isn’t that well received in the marketplace. Whereas on the green
line they can see the whole and understand where to make explicit tradeoffs. They have an
eye on cost and demand, so the tradeoffs are easy.	
The Myth about Failure and Innovation
There’s a mantra in the world of innovation that says, “If you're not failing, then you're not
innovating.” But failure by itself is not a rite of passage to becoming an innovator. It’s the
learning that comes from failing that makes someone an innovator.
If I leave a failure on the table without uncovering why, then it’s a waste—making failure useful
is the hard part of innovation. In my experience, great innovators are obsessed with
understanding why they failed; it's the opportunity to learn.
When I fail, I turn to the five skills taught in this book and ask myself, “What was I missing?”
Then I get up and try again differently.
20
You can probably already identify areas of strengths and weaknesses after those brief
descriptions. Luckily, these skills are not innate; they can be learned. Before we dig deep
into each, let’s look at green line development process from an individual perspective—a
dear friend who’s already mastered of the five hidden skills of innovators and
entrepreneurs.	
Applying the Five Skills of an Innovator
“When an innovator doesn’t know what to do, they actually know exactly what to do.”
Ryan Singer, Basecamp	
How does a product developer write a book?
My good friend Ryan Singer—product strategist and developer at Basecamp—asked
himself that question not too long ago. You see his boss, Jason Fried, a four-time New York
Times bestselling author and CEO of Basecamp, had recently asked him to do just that—
write a book about how Basecamp develops their products. By the time Ryan and I sat
down for coffee later that week, his mind was spinning.
“What the hell?” Ryan lamented. “I don't have any idea how to write a book! Every time I sit
down to write my mind draws a blank. What am I going to do? What do people even want to
know?” That was his turning point. Ryan realized that he simply needed to apply the same
skills as an innovator developing products at Basecamp, to writing a book and it all started
with uncovering demand.	
So, the next day Ryan created a basic invitation to a one-day, $1,000 workshop, billing it as a
masterclass in Basecamp product management techniques. He gave people five days to
apply and created a list of hellacious essay questions that would get to the route of his
question: What do people want to know?
21
Just five days later Ryan had 200 applicants, he chose twenty—those who articulated their
struggle the best—and got to work creating the content. The class was just two weeks away.
As I sat down to help him flush out the content, we realized that he had more than enough
for a one-day workshop, he could’ve spent the entire week teaching.
The essay questions helped us along, but to completely understand his potential reader the
one-on-one interaction with other industry professionals would be critical. What “job” did
they hire the workshop to do? After the class’s conclusion, Ryan reached out to each of the
twenty participants and conducted detailed interviews. Where did they find value? Then he
returned the $1,000 fee, after all they’d helped him as much as he’d helped them.
Armed with a good understanding of demand and empathetic perspective, Ryan created the
structure of the book. Because Ryan now understood value from his customer’s perspective,
he could step back, see the whole, and outline the book effectively—think systems and
causal structures. Finally, he sat down to write. Now this time rather than drawing a blank
the material flowed.
However, after finishing the book, he didn’t immediately go on to find himself an editor or
publisher, instead he went in search of several businesses to apply the book. Does it make
sense in practice? Is the Basecamp language applicable across industry? Ryan was
prototyping to learn, pushing his book to fail. Done, right? Nope.	
Ryan then ran a second, two-day workshop and asked me to assist. This was nine months
after the first. This time however, out of the 400 applicants he chose twenty-five whose
“job” matched the material in the book. From there, he was able to further refine his content
and finally publish. Phew! So, how did the book perform?
Well in true innovator fashion Ryan used the process of disseminating the book to continue
to prototype. You see, he did not publish the book in print. He set up a unique webpage that
22
didn’t even allow downloads, so that he could watch people read the book in real-time and
see where they struggled.
Within a few months Ryan had almost 400,000 unique visitors to the book. After making his
finally changes, he finally made it available for download into a PDF format. As of
September 2020, one year after its initial release, it was downloaded by 580,000 readers.
Currently, he’s launching the book in print format: Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and
Ship Work that Matters.	
Ryan took a step back, understood that he did not know and used the five skills of
innovators and entrepreneurs to make sense of the task of writing a book.
Making It Real
At this point you may have an inkling of where you’re already succeeding or failing with the
five skills. Here’s a set of questions to ask yourself…
• Uncovering Demand: Do I understand what causes demand for my product? What
dominoes must fall before someone says, “Today’s the day…” What causes someone
to fire another product and hire mine?
• Empathetic Perspective: Do I deeply understand other people’s perspectives—
external customers and vendors, as well as internal designers and assembly line
workers? Do I get where they are coming from? Can I play it all out through time?
• Causal Structures: Am I curious? Do I constantly want to figure out how things
work, even when they’re illogical or irrational? Do I believe in randomness?
(Randomness is the opposite of causal structures.) Do I take the time to frame
questions before building my prototypes?
23
• Prototyping to Learn: Am I building sets of prototypes, as opposed to prototyping
two aspects at a time, A/B testing? Am I causing things to fail or waiting for them to
fail and reacting?
• Making Tradeoffs: Am I striving for perfection, or can I see the whole and
understand that I can’t have everything? Do I understand how to frame my tradeoffs
from both the supply side and the demand side? Do I err on the side of the customer
or the company?
Throughout the next five chapters I will delve deeply into each of the five skills of
innovators and entrepreneurs and offer tools and techniques for you to practice in your
own life. It’s not a shortcut to innovation, rather a roadmap and it all starts with uncovering
demand.

Chapter Two
Uncovering Demand
“What people in business think they know about the customer and the market is likely
to be more wrong than right…the customer rarely buys what the business thinks it
sells.”
Peter Drucker, Father of Modern Management	
What’s the difference between a Snickers and a Milky Way? On the surface these two
products seem similar. They’re both candy bars that are made in the same plant with
chocolatey ingredients and sit side-by-side in the candy isle. When viewed from the supplyside they seem to compete with one another. So, why would someone buy a Snickers versus
a Milky Way? As it turns out, the who, what, when, where and why—the context in which
people buy a Snickers versus a Milky Way—is completely different.
Typically, people buy a Snickers when they’re hungry, running out of energy, and short on
time; they need a boost. Snickers fits this situation quite well because it feels like food—the
nougat, caramel, and peanuts form a ball, it’s hard. As the Snickers hits your stomach the
growling and hunger pangs stop. If you go to almost any vending machine at a Silicon Valley
startup, the Snickers is usually gone. Snickers competes with a cup of coffee, a red bull, or a
sandwich.	
Conversely, a Milky Way slides down your throat, coating your mouth with chocolate and
endorphins. It takes twenty minutes to eat, and you savor the experience; it’s a candy bar.
People usually eat it alone, after an emotional event, good or bad, and it helps them feel
better or acts as a reward. Milky Way competes with ice cream, brownies, and a glass of
wine.
25
Snickers and Milky Way are fundamentally different in terms of the struggling moment that
they solve and therefore the demand that they fulfill.
Understanding this dynamic was a game changer for Snickers. They launched a commercial
that spoke to people in this struggling moment. The advertisement opened on a field with a
group of young men playing football with Betty White. Betty’s struggling, everyone’s yelling
at her. Then someone hands a Snickers bar to her, she takes a bite and transforms back into
himself —another one of the young men. “You’re not YOU when you’re hungry,” the narrator
says. “Snickers satisfies!”
Once Snickers uncovered the demand and began marketing to people in their struggling
moment sales skyrocketed. Snickers is now the bestselling candy bar in its category with
over $4 billion in sales.
The Difference Between Supply and Demand
To uncover demand, you must understand your customer. What’s causing them to make a
purchase? It’s understanding value from the customer-side of the world, as opposed to the
product-side of the world. It’s about realizing the progress that people are trying to make
based on their context. Your product or services are merely part of their solution. Demand
is caused by a struggling moment and the thought, “Maybe I can do better…” Without the
struggling moment there is no demand.
The problem arises when you are solely focused on the supply-side view of your product or
service and see everything through that lens: How do I make it? How do I position it? How
do I measure it? How profitable is it? In this scenario, the consumer is nebulous—an
imagined personified version of the customer—an aggregated set of demographic and
psychographic information. You aggregate and triangulate the consumer around the
product through correlative data. You think of your creation in terms of competitive sets
within a category or industry. If Mars, Inc. had viewed Snickers from the supply-side they
would have focused on Milky Way as the competition and taken an entirely different
26
approach than the Betty White commercial. They would have zeroed in on making Snickers
more delicious—taste-testing Milky Way and Snickers side-by-side, comparing ingredients,
and tweaking the contents. In the end, they would have had two candy bars that were a
parody of each other, missing a $4 billion opportunity.	
When you innovate from the demand side you realize that the customer has a completely
different perspective. They don't have a competitive reference point of your product. Their
context revolves around the outcomes they seek, and their competitive sets aren’t actually
competitive sets, but candidate sets: “I can do this, or I can do that.” The customer has no
idea how Snickers are made, and they don’t care. In most cases, they can’t tell you that a
Snickers would even solve their struggling moment until they’ve tried it or until you step in
let them know.	
Both supply and demand are important perspectives. In fact, as an innovator or
entrepreneur you need both, but in my experience most innovators and entrepreneurs are
more focused and skilled at the supply-side. It’s critical that you understand how demand
works. How does your product or service fit into people’s lives?
The Problem with Supply-Side Only Thinking
What are the consequences of taking a wholly supply-side approach?
Let’s take a trip back in time for this example. The year is 2010 and I’m sitting on the cold,
metal bleachers at my daughter’s ice hockey game, she’s poised to take a slap shot and I
quickly snap a picture. “It’s blurry again,” I say to my wife Julie in utter frustration. All I
want is an action shot of my daughter on the rink but each time I try the results are the
same, crap.	
That afternoon I decide it’s time to buy a new camera, so I get online and pull up Canon’s
website. They have dozens of cameras to choose from, pictured side-by-side, showcasing
27
each camera’s image processing, megapixels, and flutter speed. Then there are software
options for developing the pictures. It’s confusing. I don’t understand this lingo, and I have
no interest in taking the time to learn it. I just want to take great pictures.
Frustrated, I turn to Nikon and Sony, only to find that their websites are virtual mirror
images of Canon’s. Ugh! I don’t have time for this.
Thankfully, along comes Apple. They make a high-quality camera, attach it to my phone so
that it’s always with me, and make it easy to take great pictures—point and click. They
don’t talk to me about image processing, megapixels, or flutter speed and they even include
the software.
Now Canon would say that they know photography the best. Yet Apple walked in the door
and with one button took their business away. In 2010 camera sales were 121 million units,
by 2018 they’d sunk to nineteen million units but during the same timeframe demand for
taking pictures actually skyrocketed with social media.	
Canon, Nikon, and Sony were so focused on competing—the supply-side— that they just
kept adding more and more capabilities making their product more complicated. Then they
tried to force their customers to learn their language. The market rejected all three. They
missed the point; people simply wanted to take great pictures. Apple on the other hand
understood the struggling moment, saw the progress that people were trying to make, and
disrupted the industry.	
So, how do you uncover demand?	
The Keys to Uncovering Demand
Uncovering demand starts with interviewing customers who’ve used your product before
and made progress. You need them to tell you the story of how they got here. What
dominoes had to fall for them to say, “Today’s the day…”
28
Recently my friend Michelle bought a Peloton and Greg and I sat down to understand why.
Michelle is a busy, successful technology executive, in her forties, who lives in Toronto,
Canada with her husband Bill. They own a beautiful 800 sq. ft. condo in an upscale building
that includes a gym, but when Covid hit Michelle found herself quarantined in her condo
and the gym closed, so she bought a $3,000 Peloton. Greg and I wanted to uncover the
framework for how Michelle made the decision to buy. The following is a brief snippet of
our hour-long conversation.	
Bob: Can you tell us a little about your exercise background?
Michelle: My days are busy. I’ve struggled for a while to find enough time to exercise. I
used to be a long-distance runner; I loved running; I was “addicted” to it. But now my
body feels different, and it’s become more uncomfortable to run.
Bob: How long is a while?	
Michelle: At least four years. I kept starting and stopping; I’d start running then stop.
I’d try a class but drop it. I haven’t gotten over that hump and really gotten back into
shape.	
Greg: Why is exercise important to you? What does exercise do for you?
Michelle: I would say out of vanity, for sure; I want to be a certain weight and size.
Slowly, over the recent years I’ve put on weight. Also, after I turned forty, I became
more conscious of the importance of maintaining a healthy life.
Greg: You said a “healthy” life. Everyone defines healthy differently. Can you describe to
me what that means to you?	
Michelle: I work with a lot of people who are much younger than me. I find that if we
are doing a team activity, hiking for instance, I’m conscious of the fact that I am not in
29
as good of physical condition as they are. I also want to avoid the problems that come
with aging when you are too sedentary.	
Greg: Is putting on weight and keeping up with others the same or different issues?	
Michelle: I think they are related. My weight impacts my comfort. When I was twenty
pounds lighter it was easier. But I would say it’s the long-term health that I’m focused
on and feeling good about the clothes that I’m wearing. I love clothes and fashion and
I’m not used to my body being this shape. It limits my options.	
Bob: When did you buy the Peloton?	
Michelle: Last week. About a month before that I asked my husband, Bill, “Do you think
we should get an exercise bike?” And he said, “No.” He felt like our condo was too small
and pointed out that we already had a gym in the building, even though it’s Covid and
the gym is closed. I dropped the idea and instead decided to buy a TRX. It’s a piece of
exercise equipment that you can hang on your doorframe, so it doesn’t take up much
space, and it’s good for strength training.
Bob: When the TRX came were you excited?	
Michelle: Yes, I thought it would be a great way to get exercise without leaving my
condo. I was new to the TRX, so I googled a few exercises.	
Greg: Before Covid, what kind of exercises did you do at the gym?	
Michelle: I would usually run a little on the treadmill and then walk or do some
strength training with weights.
Greg: So, the TRX gave you the strength training but it didn’t give you the cardio?
30
Michelle: Exactly. I missed the treadmill as a way to have my “me” time and just be with
my own thoughts. The TRX was helpful but it wasn’t enough.	
Bob: So, why not get a treadmill if you know that you like that?	
Michelle: Right, I don’t normally even go on an exercise bike, but my husband does. I
thought that if I got a bike, he would be more likely to use it too. And I didn’t think a
treadmill would even fit in our condo. There’s no place to put something that big. Plus,
for a while now running has not been working for me. I wanted to find something that
I could get addicted to again like the running.
Bob: So, what happened in the days leading up to the purchase that brought you back
to the Peloton?	
Michelle: For weeks I had seen friends on social media post about their Pelotons and
how addicted they were to them. Then the day before I bought it, I was scrolling
Instagram and my friend who is similar in age and fitness level posted about her
Peloton: “I love being able to get a quick twenty-minute workout between meetings.”
As soon as I saw it, I knew that I wanted to buy one.
Bob: So, what happened next?	
Michelle: I was concerned that there wasn’t space for the Peloton. But I have this trunk
sitting in my office that was a gift from my father-in-law. I realized that if we moved
the trunk to Bill’s office, I could put the Peloton there.
Bob: How did Bill get swung from a no to a yes?
Michelle: We were sitting watching TV and I pointed out that we hadn’t been getting
our exercise for a while now and that I thought a bike would be a good idea. Plus, we
were saving $2,000 from a vacation that needed to be canceled due to Covid. I
suggested moving the trunk and he said okay, so I bought it.	
31
People might say what happened here is just the perfect storm, but it's very predictable.
Let’s unpack this interview into the three key frameworks for how people buy.
1. The three sources of energy or motivations (functional, emotional, and social).
2. The four forces of progress (push, pull, anxiety, and habit forces).
3. The Job To Be Done (JTBD) timeline (sequence of events and actions to make
progress).	
The Three Sources of Energy or Motivations
There are three different categories of motivation: functional, emotional, and social. Let’s
discuss how each of the three play out in Michele’s buying process. Think of it as the energy
or fuel to make the buying process happen.
1. Functional Motivation: How cumbersome is the purchasing process for the buyer
—time, effort, and speed? I think of mechanical things here: speed, effort, steps, etc.
Peloton made the purchase easy. Although I didn’t include this portion of the
interview, Michelle told us that she had one conversation with Peloton before
making the purchase and setting up the bike was included in the delivery. Michelle
just needed to find a place for the bike in her home—move that trunk.	
2. Emotional Motivation: What positive, or negative, internal thoughts are driving my
purchase—fears, frustrations, and desires? For Michelle, this purchase was driven by
her emotional motivations more than anything else. She had insecurity about her
weight and physical ability to keep up. Michelle missed her alone time that the
treadmill provided, and she also longed for that feeling of being addicted to exercise,
like running.
3. Social Motivations: How do other people perceive, respect, trust, or acknowledge
me? Michelle chooses a bike in great part to get Bill from a “no” to a “yes.” She knows
that he likes to bike, so it increases her chance of his buy-in. Michelle also talked
about the live classes with Peloton (not included in the portion shared) and how she
longed for that community support to help her get back into regular exercise.
Overall, the goal is to reduce the negative functional, emotional, and social motivations,
which are causing anxiety and serving as a barrier. While at the same time, amplifying the
positive motivations to create pull for the product or service.	
32
The Four Forces of Progress
One of the methods that I use to unpack causality are the forces of progress. The forces at
play determine whether people can move from A to B and make progress. Will it be
business as usual or a new path forward? Within the forces are things that pull people
toward change and frictions that push them back to the old. When we talk about people’s
decisions, we’ve found there are ultimately four forces driving their progress.
1. The push of the situation. Think about the struggling moment for Michelle. What
forces were pushing her toward buying a Peloton? The gym closed and Michelle was
facing a long period of time without access to exercise equipment. Lately she’d been
feeling older, not able to keep up physically, or fit into clothes like she used to.
Additionally, Michelle was no longer able to run as exercise.
2. The magnetism of the new solution. The moment she realized that something
might get her back to a fitter lifestyle, help her make progress, the solution created
magnetism; she started to imagine a better life where she felt and looked more like
her younger self. She started noticing her friends rave on social media about being
“addicted” and getting in a quick twenty-minute workout between meetings. This
spoke to Michelle—the pull towards progress.
3. The anxiety of the new solution. Despite her struggle and the pull the new
solution created, there’s anxiety. Can she get Bill to agree to the bike? How can she
justify the cost? Where is she going to put the Peloton in an 800 sq. ft. apartment?
These anxieties are important because they hold people back from making the
progress that they need.
4. The habit of the present. Her current gym is closed but eventually it will open. Will
she decide later that she wants to go back to the gym and regret the Peloton? Will
she love biking as much as she loved running?
Any time I talk to people about a purchase or switch that they made, I’m constantly probing
for the forces of progress. The push of the situation and the magnetism of the new solution
need to be stronger than their anxieties and habits before people will buy. In Michelle’s
circumstance all of her habits turned into pushes because she couldn’t do them anymore.
So, she only needed to get past the anxieties.
33
As innovators and entrepreneurs, we think about the first two forces—the push and the
magnetism of our product—a lot. We imagine the next big feature we’re going to bolt onto
our product, which everyone will love. But we ignore everything else—the anxieties and the
pull of habit. My experience has taught me that the money is made on the anxiety side of
the equation.
The Timeline for Progress
The forces and the motivations drive decisions, but not in a vacuum. Ultimately, you need to
see the way that people buy as a system that plays out over time. People must be in the
right time and place in their life. Nothing is random! Through the years I’ve uncovered the
six stages a buyer must walk through before making a purchase:
1. First Thought—creating the space in the brain.	
2. Passive Looking—learning.
3. Active Looking—seeing the possibilities.
4. Deciding—making the trade-offs and establishing value.
5. Onboarding—the act of doing the JTBD, meeting expectations and delivering
satisfaction and value.	
6. Ongoing Use—building the habit.	
Imagine the events that Michelle detailed in her interview like huge dominoes falling. What
made her say “Today’s the day…”? You need to understand causality. What are the events,
which pushed and pulled her to move forward or backward?	
First Thought
When you finally have that first thought: “I’m not fitting into my clothes,” or “I can’t keep up
with others physically.” Whether you say it out loud, or you have it in your head, it’s the
critical first step for people to buy. Before this first step, there’s not a place in your mind to
file the information about treadmills or bikes.
34
Michelle realized for a long time that she needed to take action and exercise, but it wasn’t
until she could no longer go to the gym and didn’t have an outlet that she thought of owning
exercise equipment. She briefly imagined a bike but when Bill vetoed the idea, she quickly
moved on to the TRX. Michelle’s actual first thought about a bike happened when the TRX
arrived and did not provide her the cardio outlet.	
Once you have the first thought you’ve opened-up the space in your mind for the
information. Without this first thought there is no demand. But once you have it, you notice
things you didn’t notice before, which causes you to transition to passive looking.
Passive Looking
“Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the
question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You
have to ask the question—you have to want to know—in order to open up the space
for the answer to fit.”
Clay Christensen	
The first thought is how you create the space. Passive looking is how you start to fill the
space. Because Michelle had the first thought, she noticed her friends’ Instagram posts
about the Peloton. She remembered feeling addicted to running and saw that same energy
in their posts. Then Michelle’s friend posted, “I love being able to get a quick twenty-minute
workout between meetings.” The clincher!	
People can passively look for years if there’s no event pushing them to the next step on the
timeline. Whatever the event it acts like a domino falling in your life that moves you along
the timeline to active looking. Now Michelle was in active looking.	
Active Looking
35
Active looking is when people plan, spend time, and even money figuring out what’s next—
the solution to their struggling moment. Here’s where Michelle went on the Peloton website
to try and figure out cost, delivery, and setup. At this stage, Michele is understanding the
discrete, independent features and attributes of the Peloton and starts connecting the dots
to frame future tradeoffs.
Deciding
This is where people make their tradeoffs and ultimately decide what they want. When
buying, there’s no ideal solution, every customer makes tradeoffs. Part of the journey is
understanding the tradeoffs people are willing to make.
Michelle needs to figure out how to fit the Peloton into her 800 sq. ft. apartment. She
decides that she can fit the Peloton in her office if she finds a place for the trunk which was
a gift from her father-in-law. Michelle also needs to rationalize the $3,000 cost. The fact that
she needs to cancel a $2,000 vacation fits this narrative perfectly.
Onboarding
Onboarding is where the rubber hits the road. It’s where the consumer determines if you’ve
met the expectations set when they decided to lock-in and buy your product or service.
Whatever expectations were set are now poured in concrete. In onboarding, the consumer
is having their first use of the product or service and measuring that against their
expectations to see if they bought what they think they bought. When I interviewed
Michelle, the Peloton had not arrived yet, but she will likely compare it to the TRX and judge
if she is getting a good cardio workout. She will also critique those first live classes and
measure whether or not they provide the community support she craved.
Ongoing Use
There’s a difference between buying and onboarding a product or service and using a
product or service everyday—ongoing use. How well did you satisfy expectations? The
satisfaction is determined by the expectations set. If Peloton did not set expectations well,
36
Michelle will have new struggling moments. Ongoing use is where the jobs get done and the
progress is achieved. Does Michelle get addicted to the Peloton? Does she fit into her
clothes better overtime? Can she keep up on a hike? These are likely the metrics Michelle
will use to measure progress.	
What’s Your Customer’s Value Code?
Oftentimes innovators talk to people but do so through the lens of their product and its
features and benefits: Why is this feature important? What does it help you do? And then
they think they understand the buyer. You hear things like, it’s easy to use, I love the
interface, etc. They go deeper and deeper into the product with you. That’s not uncovering
demand.
Uncovering demand is about you going into their lives. It’s about uncovering their
struggling moment, the outcome they seek, and the progress that they are trying to make.
Does it help them? It’s about the who, what, when, where, and why of how your product
helps them; the job they are hiring your product to do.	
If I asked, “Do you like steak or do you like pizza?” You might say, “I like both,” right? So, let's
talk about a steak situation versus a pizza situation. Typically, you're having a steak when
it's been a rough week and you want to reward yourself, or you're celebrating a special
occasion. You're going to cook it a special way, maybe have guests; it’s an event. A pizza
situation looks entirely different: I've got four kids; I need to feed them, drive to soccer, get
homework done. If you try to stick steak into that scenario, it's horrible and vice versa.
What you realize is that you like both steak and pizza, but if you take the pizza and put it in
the steak situation, the value changes. Value is a function of the context, outcome, progress,
and effort. Uncovering demand is seeing value from the customer's perspective as opposed
to value from the product perspective. And it's not about what people value it's about who,
what, when, where, and why people value.
37
Once you can see value from the customer’s perspective you realize that value is not a
feature or a benefit. It’s a tradeoff people make depending on the context they are in. You
can’t understand tradeoffs unless you know your customer’s value code. Once you
understand that people value pizza in certain situations, you can see that they will not pay a
lot more for better pizza. But steak, now that’s a different story.
As an innovator or entrepreneur, you need to understand how your product or service fits
into people's lives—demand. But you still need to understand the supply-side: How do I
make it? How do I position it? How do I measure it? How profitable is it? Innovators and
entrepreneurs need to understand both sides, but I’ve found the supply-side tends to come
easily—it’s almost a given. Successful innovators and entrepreneurs understand how to
separate the demand-side from the supply-side. As a result, they can manage tradeoffs.
Making It Real
Where are you on the journey to uncovering demand? Maybe you’ve nailed it, maybe you
still need some help. Ask yourself these clarifying questions:	
• Do I understand how my product or service fits into people's lives?
• Do I understand how my customer’s context can add value?
• Am I defining value as the progress that people are trying to make?
• What are the tradeoffs my customers are willing to make for that progress?
Here are some resources to help continue your education into uncovering demand:	
• Demand-Side Sales 101 by Bob Moesta and Greg Engle
• Competing Against Luck by Clayton Christensen
38
• Little Red Book? (Need Reference)
As we move on to chapter three, Empathetic Perspective, you will see that there is overlap
with Uncovering Demand. I’ve separated the five skills of innovators and entrepreneurs to
make the material more digestible but in truth they are interconnected. Without
empathetic perspective you can’t frame demand.
But first let me introduce my mentor Dr. Clayton Christensen, a master at uncovering
demand.	
39
Meet Dr. Clayton Christensen
Of my four mentors, I met Dr. Clayton Christensen last. I had branched out on my own,
leaving the car giant, to build new products but there was a vacuum in the place that
Taguchi, Deming, and Moore had once held. That’s precisely when I was introduced to Clay,
who was in his first-year teaching at Harvard. Clay had just gotten his PhD at forty-two, a
father of five.	
Clay was a giant of a man standing at 6’10” tall but as kind as they come; he matched the
definition of a gentle giant. The first time I shook his hand mine just disappeared—that’s
how big he was. Clay loved to talk to people who were not afraid to ask him questions, so in
that respect we were a perfect match; I’m endlessly curious. At our first meeting we sat
down and talked at length about our combined passion for building products that could
help people. But we came at it from different vantage points: Clay was an academic
passionate about building better management theory, whereas I was an engineer—a
practitioner—I’d rather go learn by building.
In the beginning, I saw Clay as an advisor, teacher, and mentor. Once every quarter I’d take
the trip from Detroit to Boston and spend four uninterrupted hours learning from him.
Over time—our relationship spanned twenty-seven years—I considered him to be my best
friend and brother.
Clay taught me about disruptive innovation, which I will detail in the next chapter, and we
helped each other make progress. Every time I saw him, he’d ask, “What can I do to help
you?” He wanted to delve into my struggling moments, and I wanted to do the same for him.
I became his ear to the ground, by finding him businesses and people to talk to that helped
advance his research.
Together, over fourteen months, Clay and I architected “Jobs To Be Done” (JTBD) theory,
which is a framework that helps you understand why and how people buy the products
they do. He was the theory builder, and I was the practitioner. He then brought the theory to
40
life for the world when he published Competing Against Luck. It turned concepts that I
sometimes still struggle to explain, into something people can understand and adopt.
Clay taught me how to take the foundation from Taguchi, Deming, and Moore and think
about it more broadly—apply theory to it. I'm an engineer; I just build things. Until that
point, I didn’t quite grasp the notion of theory. I could connect dots between my problem
solving, see the similarities, but I didn't recognize it as a theory. Clay was all about building
new management theory. That’s what he set out to do in this world.
Q&A: My Personal Perspective of Clay	
What was Clay’s superpower? Clay had a curiosity and the ability to ask incredibly unique
questions in a way that framed very complex problems. Then he could turn around and
translate that complexity in a simple way so that everyone could understand. Think
empathetic perspective and causal structures, he was masterful at piecing it all together.
He was also a great storyteller. He would connect your problem to a story and at first it
would seem totally unrelated, but when he wrapped it all up you got clarity: “Oh, that's why
I have this problem.” Clay would get people to discover their problems and solutions
through his story telling.
What’s a favorite memory of Clay? We would be talking about something, I'd be writing on
the whiteboard, and I'd turn around and there he would be sitting with his legs crisscrossed
on top of his desk, like a giant five-year-old. The academic world can be very stuffy, and I
think he saw me as a breath of fresh air: “Oh good, Bob’s here to play.” He was giddy like a
kid when we got together.
What mattered the most to Clay in this world? Clay was Mormon and I believe that his
religion was the most important thing to him: God and then family. After that he loved being
a teacher, at thirty-nine he went back to school for his PhD.	
41
If Clay was an animal what animal would he be? An owl: He’s the type of person who sits
and observes, sees what’s going on, then he’d go off at night and think about it before
coming back and telling you what he thought. He was a deep thinker, very observant.	
Is there a TV or movie character that reminds you of Clay? I think Sherlock Holmes. Clay was
very curious. He wanted to understand why things happened. He always had all the facts.
What three words describe Clay? Deep thinker, massive interrogator, and articulate but in a
folksy way.	
42
Chapter Three
Empathetic Perspective
Imagine you’re planning a long car trip with your spouse and children. Before you leave,
you start to think through the steps involved in getting from point A to point B with the
least resistance: How often will the kids need to stop for the restroom? Where are the
restrooms? When and where will you stop for lunch? If you pick the one place that you and
your spouse want to eat, the kids may mutiny. How many hours can the kids be in the car
without too much difficulty? What will you bring to entertain them?	
As you think about the trip, you imagine each of your kids and your spouse from their
perspective. Then you figure out how to avoid conflicts as you play it out over space and
time. This is empathetic perspective.	
Empathetic perspective encapsulates the notion that there’s not just the supply-side and
the demand-side but there are many different perspectives within both supply and demand.
The most successful innovators can see the subtle differences between the many different
perspectives, which enables them to foresee problems and make tradeoffs. In many ways,
people skilled at empathetic perspective have night vision goggles: They can see around
corners and see through space and time.
• Seeing around corners happens when you have a 360-degree perspective of everyone
interacting with your creation; it’s all encompassing, almost omniscient.
• Seeing through space and time is about placing yourself in another person’s shoes,
which allows you to play out events before they’ve occurred and therefore anticipate
problems.
43
Think sympathy versus empathy: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the
feelings of another, whereas sympathy is more detached and theoretical, you’re not in the
other person’s shoes, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see. Innovators and
entrepreneurs skilled at empathetic perspective have the ability to disconnect from their
own perspective—emotionally and socially—and see, hear, listen, and feel from another’s
point of view without judgement. You’re not trying to convince your kid that they shouldn’t
need so many rest stops; you’re not arguing about McDonald’s versus Cracker Barrel; you’re
accepting their perspective without judgement and planning the trip, making tradeoffs
along the way.	
It’s easy to see the importance of empathetic perspective in parenting and personal
relationships, but where’s the value for innovators and entrepreneurs? It starts with
uncovering demand, remember: the five skills are very intertwined.
Uncovering Demand Through Empathetic
Perspective
Currently, I'm teaching a class at Harvard about managing human capital. What causes
people to change jobs? How do you manage people better, so that you retain them? And
how do you attract the best people to your organization? Empathetic perspective starts
with interviewing people and seeing, hearing, and feeling from their perspective the sets of
causes that led them to say, “Today’s the day…” so that a I can design a path to help them
make progress.
How Do You Interview for Cause?
Interviewing is by far the most valuable way to learn empathetic perspective. But it is part
art (learned through experience) and part science. The key is to approach interviews as an
“empty vessel”—meaning leave yourself out of the equation. Now talk, listen, and be
engaged. Over the years I developed ten tips for ensuring interview success. Here’s how I
44
employed those tips to understanding the pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits driving
people’s decisions to change employers.
The setup
I start by setting a casual, conversational tone from the beginning. Almost like I want to
shoot a documentary.	
It’s important that the interviewee doesn’t feel like there’s a right or wrong answer. When
setup correctly the conversation becomes more casual. I truly do not bring a list of
questions; I follow the interview where it takes me and fill in the timeline as we go along. At
the start, I ask the names of key players—spouse or kids. Then I use those names later in
the interview when I ask a follow-up question. Suddenly, I’m at a different level of
familiarity.
Details, details, details
Yes, you’re digging for the details, but the details are also how you jog their memory.
Do this: “I’m doing some early research to
understand why people change jobs.
There’s no right or wrong answer. I don’t
have a long list of questions. This is about
helping me understand how you made the
decision to switch.”
Don’t do that: “I’m doing research. Tell me
why you changed jobs.”
45
Asking detailed, specific questions about tangible aspects is a trick to jog an interviewee’s
memory. Asking innocuous details triggers bigger pieces of the puzzle to fall into place. “It
was snowing! Oh, now I remember...” The brain can remember vast details when prompted
or surrounded by details.
Context creates meaning
The irrational becomes rational with context. When the answers feel irrational, it’s typically
because you don’t know the whole story. “Hold on I am confused…”
Many people don’t “like” their boss. What specifically made this boss unacceptable? When
you dig deeper you realize it wasn’t just a personality conflict, that dislike led to other
concerns about value and promotability.
Do this: “Did you lose an account that day?”
“Did you get passed for a promotion?” “Did
you tell your boss that you were unhappy?”
Even ask them about the weather outside.
Don’t do that: “Tell me about the day.”
General high-level questions do not work.
Accept this: “I switched jobs because my
boss didn’t trust me. They were constantly
second guessing my work and decisions. I
no longer felt valued. Therefore, I knew my
future promotability was limited at the
organization.”
Don’t accept that: “I switched jobs because
I didn’t like my boss.” “Like” is not a cause, it
is an excuse of not knowing why.
46
Contrast creates value
Providing an interviewee with contrast leads to greater understanding. Have them tell you
why they decided against an alternative path. I use a bracketing technique to help provide
contrast where neither option is right, and they need to elaborate.	
Without giving an interviewee contrast they often can’t figure out why they did what they
did. Ask people to tell you what it’s not. Most people can eliminate or tell you what it’s not
easier than they can tell you what it is.	
Unpack vague words
Everything is bound. You are trying to figure out the interviewee’s reference point.
One person’s definition of the word fast may be entirely different than another’s. There’s no
fast, only faster than... There’s no healthy, just healthier than...
Do this: “Why did you switch employers?
Why not just find another role within the
organization?”
Don’t do that: “Why did you switch
employers?”
Accept this: “I wanted to promote faster. I
had been in my current role for two years
and still hadn’t moved up within the
organization.”
Don’t accept that “I wanted to promote
faster.”
47
Energy matters
Listen for the energy. It’s not just what they say but how they say it.
Do they accentuate words? Does the intonation go up or down? Downward intonation
implies there’s something wrong. Listen for pauses and sighs. Did you hear a comma, but
there is no comma? Did you hear all caps, but there’s no caps? As soon as you hear this
emotional energy stop and ask further questions. “Wait, tell me more about that. Why is
that important?” When I interview, I focus on how people say things as much as what they
say.	
Play “dumb”
When you want to question what they’re saying, put it as your own stupidity or your
naivety. “Why is social justice important in an employer?” you might ask. “Well, it just is,”
they might respond. In this scenario you need to be able to delve into the topic without
making them feel dumb or defensive. “I am confused” is one of my favorite sayings…but you
have to mean it when you say it.	
Question this: “We had our THIRD baby.”
“[Sigh] We had our third baby.”
Don’t question that: “We had our third
baby.”
Do this: “I get that; it’s important to believe
in what you’re doing but hard to describe,
right? Did something about this role make
you feel icky?”
Don’t do that: “Why don’t you know why
social justice matters to you?”
48
The moment someone feels stupid they shut down. The moment they think you are judging
them they feel insecure. Sometimes interviewees set up a response by saying: “This is
really stupid but….” And I will respond: “Oh, I do that all the time.”
Set-up bad questions
A lot of times there’s a question that is either a little bit too personal or a little too close to
the vest. You know that if you don’t ask, they will never tell you, so set it up: “Okay, this is a
bad question, don’t feel you need to answer it and please make it better.”
When you set it up as a bad question, they are always expecting the worst, much worse than
the actual question. It disarms them from what might have been a negative or awkward
response.
Good cop, bad cop
It always helps to interview in pairs. You don’t have to, but when you do, you can play good
cop, bad cop.
Do this: “I’ve got a personal question, and if
you don’t want to answer it you don’t have
to, but you said you felt in over your head in
the current role. Can you explain why?”
Don’t do that: “Why were you in over your
head?”
49
Or I play back the story wrong, and Greg and I argue with each other over the details. It’s a
good way to check what’s most important to the interviewee.
Use analogies
Often the interviewee will hit a wall and not have the language to express their thoughts
completely. Don’t push, instead use analogies to help build language.
Sometimes asking people to compare two things that are not similar at all works well. It
forces them to think and use better language.	
How Do You Unpack Interviews?
Overall, I conducted twenty-two interviews and found over a thousand individual pushes
and pulls for why people changed employers. Then I took those reasons and grouped them
into fourteen core, underlying causes:
• When I don't respect or trust the people I work with.	
• When I feel that the work has little or no impact on the company, world, or my life.	
Do this: Argue with each other to fuel the
conversation.
Don’t do that: Argue with the interviewee.
Do this: “How is getting a new boss like
starting over?”
Don’t do that: Continue to push in the
same way when they are at a loss for words.
50
• When the day-to-day is wearing me down.	
• When my current company is struggling, and I feel the end is near.	
• When I end up with a new manager, and I feel like I'm starting over.
• When I feel disrespected and not trusted.
• When I realize I'm at a personal life-event or milestone, i.e., I just turned thirty, had a
child, etc.
• When I reach a milestone at my job or career, i.e., I received my MBA, celebrated ten
years at the company.
• When my work is dominating my life and I’m sacrificing myself and my family to get
things done.	
• When a trusted advisor/mentor guides me to my next step.
• When I am challenged beyond my abilities, logic, or ethics.
• When I feel like I'm not challenged, or I’m bored, in my current work.
• When I can't see a place for me to go or grow in my current organization, or it will be
too long/too hard.
• When I feel I'm on my own, ignored, and not supported.	
After unpacking the interviews, I realized that if any five of these pushes happened, people
were likely to look for a new job. Now I have the empathetic perspective to be able to see
around corners and see through space and time.	
51
I use the analogy of balls and rickets in a game of croquet to help me visualize people as
they move through space and time. The balls represent the people, and the rickets are the
events in their life. There are spaces and times in people’s lives that will cause them to need
to make progress in specific ways. Because I see what they see, hear what they hear, and
understand what they mean I can now predict how future events will impact their
decisions…even before they can see it. I can predict when they're going to hit a new ricket:
birth of a child, advanced degree, etc. I understand the future dominoes that need to fall
based on what people tell me today: “This is where you're headed…” I can say with some
certainty.
Managing the Supply-Side with Empathetic
Perspective
In order for innovators and entrepreneurs to see around corners and see through space and
time they must also have supply-side empathetic perspective, demand-side alone is not
enough. This starts with identifying the key players. Ask yourself: Who’s involved? Why are
they involved? What do they do? Internally there are likely a multitude of roles, everything
from marketing and finance, to manufacturing and production surrounding your thing.
Then there are external influencers, such as suppliers and partners. Each of these people
occupy roles on different sides of the equation, and as a result, see differently. Innovators
and entrepreneurs skilled at empathetic perspective can see the whole.	
How Do You See the Whole?
My education in supply-side empathetic perspective began while struggling to find an
answer to the rearview mirror problem from the Introduction. My mentor, Dr. Willie Moore,
said, “I want you to become the molecule, that becomes the plastic, that then becomes the
mirror.” Remember the Schoolhouse Rock! episode I’m Just a Bill? It’s like that.
On the surface it may seem like an unusual exercise, but it’s an incredibly brilliant way to
gain supply-side empathetic perspective. Instead of asking, “What’s the problem? What’s
52
the solution?” I took a step back and I became the molecule and uncovered its journey. In
doing so, I answered the critical who, what, when, where, and why, which were the first
steps towards seeing the whole…
I’m the molecule. I’m made at Dow Chemicals, where they formulate me into pellets and
then ship me to various plants via train. Once I arrive, I sit in the plant hopper and wait my
turn. It may take days, weeks, or months, but suddenly, I get poured into a buffer that starts
to heat me up. There are different pressures and temperatures as I make my way through
the machine melding together. Then I’m placed into a dye mold where I sit and dry for
twenty seconds, then I get popped out, cooled for a minute before getting shaped and
placed into a box. That box goes to the assembly line at the plant where I’m then placed into
a car, shipped to dealers, and bought by customers.
Becoming your creation will help answer key questions: Who’s involved? Why are they
involved? What do they do? And not just from the perspective of the people but from the
thing itself. It forces you to see the broader picture, which allows you to frame what’s going
on and understand what to do. Seeing this complexity quickly moves you from one
problem/one solution to many problems and many solutions. It creates a humbleness; you
realize that you don’t have the answer, which stops you from assuming a solution and
chasing after one hypothesis.	
Oftentimes when people go to design a product, they think there's an objectively “best” way
to do it because they lack empathetic perspective on the supply-side. They don't
understand the context or perspective that’s wrapped around their product or service, so
they're trying to find the absolute best way in which to build it. But there’s no such thing as
a “best” way, you must make tradeoffs. Empathetic perspective enables you to see around
corners, project into the future, and therefore manage the necessary tradeoffs. Without
empathetic perspective these tradeoffs become impossible.
53
When I sit down to help a business make progress I say, “Tell me about your business.”
Invariably, they tell me about the product or service that they sell. But they need to be
thinking in terms of flow: The flow of information; the flow of money, the flow of finished
goods? When you understand the flow, it becomes objectively easy to see the various
perspectives involved.
How Do You Teach Others to See the Whole?
It’s not just the leader who needs empathetic perspective, your people need it as well.
Remember the red line/green line comparison in Chapter One for developing new cars. The
manufacturer on the red line worked in individual silos. The engine designer made the best
engine, the transmission designer built the optimal transmission. They assumed that there
was common understanding and agreement. The people on the red line lacked empathetic
perspective and as they got closer to launch, this played out in a very costly way.
As an innovator or entrepreneur your people’s blind spots can cost you years in
development and millions in lost revenue. They need to talk to each other, in deep,
meaningful ways, early, and often. Most organizations don’t take the time to do this and
therefore, they lose site of the bigger picture.
The first step is to have everyone within your organization rotate: Marketing needs to
understand engineering; engineering needs to understand the assembly line, etc. Most
people do not take the time to genuinely see things from other people’s perspectives. It’s
not enough to simply talk to each other either, people need time to genuinely put
themselves in each other’s shoes.
Young Bob, as a fairly green engineer, thought that he had empathetic perspective. I would
walk around the plant, see the assembly-line workers, talk to the engine designers, and so
on, but I wasn’t truly putting myself in their shoes. I’d listen, but I’d use that information to
54
try to convince them of my perspective. I wanted to show them that they were wrong: “If we
just did this my way, then that would work.”
That’s not empathetic perspective, it’s a direct assault type of view.
A person with empathetic perspective doesn’t initiate conversation and then go head-tohead trying to convince other people to change their mind. People with empathetic
perspective try to see where other people are coming from to understand them better. And
they recognize that they might be the one who is wrong.	
There's a humbleness and curiosity to empathetic perspective.	
Making It Real
If you want to advance your ability to see empathetically, I recommend practicing the
interview techniques taught above. Remember your goal is to be an empty vessel: talk,
interact, unpack, and see what they are trying to do.
• Pick a family member and try to understand their perspective on any topic.
o Talk to your child and uncover the progress that they want to make with school
or a sport. What are their goals? It’s been a long time since you were a kid, and
the reality of their perspective is completely different than what you
experienced.
o Talk to a grandparent to uncover a big moment in their life. Try to empathetically
understand why that moment was important.	
o The next time that you have a disagreement, pull out this tool and make sure that
you understand the situation from the other person’s perspective without
judgement or attempting to change their mind.	
55
• Now, go to a place where you are unfamiliar, maybe a vacation in a city or country
very dissimilar to where you live and interact with people. Immersing yourself in
different scenarios enables you to see empathetically.	
Aside from interviews, you can also consider taking an improv class; playing different roles
and being in different contexts helps immensely. Also, you can read a story from a different
time and place, like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and try to understand the main
character’s motivations and emotions.
Here are some resources to help continue your education into empathetic perspective:	
• Principles of Systems by Jay Wright Forrester	
• Six Thinking Hats by Edward de Bono	
• Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman
Empathetic perspective naturally drives you into causal structures and the notion of
systems thinking: What are the things I can control? What are the things that I can't
control? You quickly see that there are so many things wrapped around your product or
service that it becomes natural to ask, “Where is my sphere of influence?”
But first let me introduce my mentor Dr. Willie Moore, a person who taught me a great deal
about empathetic perspective.
56
Meet Dr. Willie Moore
When I met Dr. Willie Moore at the car giant, she was a manager under Taguchi and Deming
—the person who made stuff happen—and I was the grunt who was assigned to work with
her. As an engineer and the first female African American to earn a doctorate in physics,
Willie pushed the limits society set for her when it came to race and gender. This was the
1980s and even today women only represent about twenty percent of the workforce in car
manufacturing. So, Willie had a unique perspective on the world.	
She set extremely high standards for herself and had high expectations of me as well. She
would tell me, “I have to be better than everybody else, because they’ve already prejudged
me as a black woman.” There are very few people who I’ve come across either before or
after Willie who possessed such high, personal standards, and as a result, she pushed me
extremely hard too.
Just three weeks into my fulltime employment, Willie turned to me as we headed into a
management meeting and said, “When they ask for a volunteer to take responsibility for
this project, I want you to raise your hand.”	
“Me!” I said questioningly.
“Trust me,” she said. “I know how it’s going to play out.”
When management asked, “Who will take on this project,” you could hear a pin drop,
everyone lowered their head and tried not to make eye contact—no one wanted this
responsibility. Terrified that this move would lead to the shortest employment history ever,
I dutifully obeyed and raised my hand.
“Wait, you’re taking it?” the executive said in disbelief.
57
When we left the room Willie said, “Now you have all the power.” In her view me taking the
project had nothing but upside. “No one’s going to fire a twenty-five-year-old engineer
who’s willing to step into the burning building,” she said. “Especially when none of the
tenured engineers would even volunteer.” In her view, if I solved it, I was the hero; if I failed
there was nothing lost. Further, the tenured engineers wanted me to succeed, they didn’t
want it to back on them, so everyone rushed in to help.
In the end Willie was right and her approach allowed me to fast track. People saw me as the
person who was never afraid to take on a problem. Throughout the years Willie and I
developed a great friendship, she even attended my wedding.	
Q&A: My Personal Perspective of Willie
What was Willie’s superpower? Willie could connect the dots. She knew how to take what
Deming and Taguchi were saying and go to the front lines and make it work. Deming had
processes, whereas Willie ran the process; she put theory into practice.	
Like Clay, Willie had an extraordinary empathetic perspective. Once when we were visiting
a plant, we drove around back to the massive employee lot—two square miles long—rather
than parking up front. “Always go to the employee entrance where the workers go in,” Willie
said. “If you park in front, the plant manager will meet you and escort you to the floor. We’re
trying to fix something; we want to observe unnoticed; we need to look like one of them.”	
What’s something Willie hated? Willie hated typos, which I learned because I never told her
that I was dyslexic. So, my writing drove her crazy. I always made an excuse for it: “Oh, my
head was somewhere else.”
She also hated apathy. If someone sat in a meeting and did nothing that bothered her. “Why
are they even here?” she’d question. She wanted everyone to lean in.
58
Was Willie a glass half empty or half full kind of person? Glass half full: She had cancer
several times and ultimately died of cancer, but she valued her time and wanted to make the
most of her life. She was always trying to pass forward what she’d learned.
If Willie were an animal what kind of animal would she be? A bear: She was a mama bear
who always had my back. If I screwed up, she wouldn’t hang me out, she’d protect me. She
was also strong, always plowing ahead and if needed, she’d fight.
Is there a TV or movie character that reminds you of Willie? Mariska Hargitay’s character,
Olivia Benson, from Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. Willie never gave up; she had a
tenacious attitude. She was always peeling back the onion, finding facts, piecing information
together, and finding the underlying problem.
What three words would you use to describe Willie? Driven, creative, and compassionate.	
59
Chapter Four
Causal Structures
“Do you know the difference between correlation and causation?” Taguchi asked me one
morning as we shared breakfast while traveling for work. These were still the days of
“young Bob,” and I relished the opportunity to pick his brain.
“They're pretty much the same thing, right?” I responded.
“No. They're very different and if you confuse them you may end up doing more harm than
good.” Then he proceeded to tell me an old story about the Japanese and the wind…	
Apparently, for more than five hundred years the Japanese believed that trees caused the
wind. Because they needed the wind for fishing, they prohibited people from cutting down
any trees, for any reason. It was not until they understood that it was in fact the wind that
caused the trees to move, that they could move forward and make progress. That’s
correlation versus causation. The wind and the trees moving together is correlative, but
which comes first—the cause—is way more important.
Causal structures are the notion of cause and effect.
The Importance of Cause and Effect
There’s a mystic quality to seeing cause and effect, especially for innovators and
entrepreneurs. People will say, “You’re a fortune teller.” The truth is I have no magic; I don’t
have telepathy. But I do have a framework for seeing causal structures, which allows me to
put the bright pieces together and say, “When this and that happen, here’s the effect…”
For many years, for instance, I have studied how people and companies respond to major
events where they have no idea what’s going to happen next: Gulf War, 9/11, etc. Then
60
Covid hit and the country locked down. Because I understood cause and effect in similar
scenarios, it became easy to predict responses even before the events unfolded.	
I knew that businesses would first, undoubtedly, hunker down: “This is going to be over in
three months,” they’d think as they sat and waited for someone else to react. But they’d
miss the details behind the scenes: What would happen when the lockdown ended? People
certainly would not go back to business as usual because they would be afraid. That anxiety
and apprehension would drive their decisions. For instance, it was predictable that when
restaurants reopened people would suddenly be concerned about crowds. Whether or not
state governments restricted capacity and to what extent, restaurants needed to operate at
fifty percent capacity for their own good. If they didn’t, people would go home, but most
businesses waited for instruction and watched their competition. They could not see the
causal structures.
Similarly, during lockdown people had to work from home. As a result, companies had to
put systems in place to make remote work possible. Before this, many companies feared
their people could not be trusted to work from home. Then businesses kept moving despite
remote work. Suddenly, it was clear that people could be trusted. Now, when the crisis
dissipates, there will new a new normal; it might be helpful to gather as a company
sometimes, but the notion that it must be five days a week will change.
Causal mechanisms also predict the rise and fall of certain businesses during Covid. The
adoption of virtual meetings taught everyone how to share their screen. Gone are the days
of printing materials and handing them out. Will printers become obsolete? Likely.
Meanwhile, sales for green screens, computers, video cameras, etc. have gone up. People are
working from home, they need to look professional, green screens allow them to take their
remote conferences to the next level by putting up digital images behind them. But few
companies will focus on the cause of the change, just the effect: People are buying green
screens. They will continue to speak to their customers about the features and benefits of
their green screen over the competition as opposed to meeting them in their struggling
61
moment: Why do people need a green screen? What are the causal structures that led them
to buy a green screen in the first place?	
Innovators and entrepreneurs skilled at causal structures understand the cause and the
effect, as well as the sequence of events that need to happen. If I were to build an icon for
causal structures, it would be dominoes falling. What are the dominoes that have to fall
before people say, “Today’s the day…” Innovators and entrepreneurs skilled at causal
structures don’t panic in uncertain times, because they can see what others can’t, and
therefore, can reasonably predict how events will unfold. They may not know exactly when
things will happen, but they understand how. They’re not anxious, they’re confident and
able to make better decisions as a result.
Causal structures are so embedded in my thought process that I apply them to everything in
my life.
Last weekend, for instance, my wife Julie and I were preparing to have dinner at a friend’s
house. When she came down the stairs, she looked gorgeous; she was dressed to the nines.
“Wow, you look beautiful!” I exclaimed. She smiled but said nothing, barely acknowledged
the compliment. When we got to our friend John’s house, he opened the door and
exclaimed, “Julie, you look gorgeous!” That’s basically what I said, right? But this time Julie
took notice, beaming she turned to me and said, “See!”
“What did I do?” I asked defensively.
“You’re supposed to say it, so I don’t know if you’re being serious. When John says it that
means more.”	
Now, on one level this could bother me, right? But I understand the underlying causal
structure. When you get familiar with people, they discount your responses because they
know what you're going to say. I call it the spousal discount. It’s the same reason we have
62
outside consultants in business. I can go into a company, say what somebody on the inside
has been saying forever, but when I say it people respond like it’s new and novel, “That’s
amazing!” It has nothing to do with me and everything to do with the relationship. Once you
recognize a causal structure you can use it to your advantage. John and I started taking each
other’s kids out to breakfast and giving them advice. John will say exactly what I’ve said all
along, but when he says it my kids will come home and say, “Oh my God, Dr. Hackenberg
told me blah, blah, blah.” I’ve only been telling them that forever!
Innovators and entrepreneurs skilled at causal structures observe the cause-and-effect
phenomenon and utilize it to help them make progress.
Using Frameworks to Unpack Cause and Effect
“I would not give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity, but I would give my life
for the simplicity on the other side of complexity.”	
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court	
Causality is at the heart of getting through complexity. The problem is that most people
don’t have a mechanism to sort through it. People skilled at causal structures have a way to
say, “This goes here; that goes there. This is relevant; that’s irrelevant.” But when you don’t
have a framework based in cause and effect you fundamentally pick up on the wrong things
and as a result you cannot see causality. Instead, you see what people bought.	
Being able to see causal structures is largely about frameworks. For me, that’s the four
forces of progress and the timeline detailed in Chapter Two.
• The four forces of progress answer the who, what, when, where, and why.
• The timeline shows the space between things: What moves people along? That leads
to the how and how much.
63
These frameworks allow me to see cause and effect as a system with inputs and outputs
and it gives me a method for sorting through the data. What causes the inputs that create
the outputs? What do I measure?
The Forces of Progress and Timeline
In 2010 I had the opportunity to work with Paul LeBlanc, President of Southern New
Hampshire University (SNHU), about expanding his online school. At the time, SNHU’s
marketing and sales message was simple: “We’ve got online classes; you can take them at
any time.” Like most, SNHU sold their school to prospective students by focusing on their
product and services—classes offered and a university degree. But what causes a student to
choose online classes versus a brick-and-mortar school? I sat down and conducted
interviews with student’s who’d used SNHU’s online school to understand why. What
caused them to say, “Today’s the day…”? As I listened to the stories, I imagined the dominoes
that had to fall to move from A to B and make progress, then I applied the results to my
forces of progress and timeline.
Forces of Progress
The push of the situation. We found that the typical online student was over thirty,
working a day job, and often supporting a family in some way. They wanted to secure a
better life for their families; a step-up—a career—not just a job. The online students were
motivated internally, because they knew they had to change their station in life.
The magnetism of the new solution. The moment that they realized it was possible to
work a day job and go back to school online they started to imagine a better life for their
families. They envisioned themselves with their diploma in hand and the pride that they
would feel. The pull toward progress.
64
The anxiety of the new solution. It quickly became clear that the application itself was a
stumbling block. The average, prospective student couldn’t figure out how to even apply.
The traditional path, SAT/ACT scores, securing transcripts, and writing an essay served as a
barrier. Most had no idea where to find their transcripts; they were not coming directly
from high school with a system to help funnel them through admissions.
The habit of the present. We realized that these students all had busy lives already with
families and jobs that made notion of adding another responsibility intimidating.
When you see the causal mechanisms laid out within the forces or progress you understand
the situation people are in and the things that cause them to move forward and backward,
which moves you away from designing you process around the effect—your product or
service. Now we could design a process that helped them make progress.
The Timeline
Now imagine the forces at play as you go through time. What causal mechanisms push and
pull people along the timeline forward and backward toward progress?
First Thought: LeBlanc launched an ad campaign targeting these potential students in this
moment of their life. It took an emotional approach, resonating with the message of, “It’s
possible.” The ad started with a single parent, working a hard, hourly job, struggling to meet
the financial needs of their family—wanting more. It showed the sacrifices, late nights and
weekends studying, contrasted against the feeling of pride. It’s the emotional story of the
satisfaction they’d feel in this accomplishment. You see the character’s struggles and feel
their success when they finally start their new job—a new chapter in their life. The ad was
not about what they’d study, or how the university ranked, but about the journey the online
student would go through. It almost contradicted traditional advertising, which says, “We
have the highest graduation rate, the best stats.” It said, “We can help you get to where you
want to go.”
65
Passive Looking: SNHU was one of the first schools to strategically target this online
market. Their competition was nothing. When prospective students saw the ad they
thought, “I’m either going to do this or nothing; do I go or not go?” The ad ran for a month
and SNHU received thousands of applications—at least ten-times their normal volume at
that time!
Active Looking: LeBlanc and our team recognized that the application itself was a
stumbling block. So, rather than having students submit test results and transcripts, the
online process started with an interview, where admissions verbally gathered the pertinent
details—past academics and financials. Then admissions would gather the documents
themselves. This solved a struggling moment for prospective students. Remember, these
were working people; they didn’t have much free time, and they didn’t even know where to
find the documentation. The schools already knew exactly what to do.
Deciding: But once SNHU received all these applications, there was a problem. They
couldn’t process the high quantities fast enough. It took months. They didn’t have enough
staff to quickly verify them. The prospective students would see the ad, have a gut response,
and sign up on a Friday and by Monday morning they were asking, “When will I know if I
got in?” Months later when the university would finally get back to these people, they had
changed their mind. The energy behind the emotional response to the ad was gone. We
realized they needed to figure out how to process the applications faster—in days not
months. So, we put a small admissions team together to design a new application process
that fit the unique needs of the online students, while dramatically increasing the response
time.
Onboarding: As SNHU built the process out, more and more people were attracted to the
program. Within seven days of applying, they were able to tell prospective students their
options—academically and financially—and enroll them. It kept the momentum going!
Ongoing Use: But another problem emerged. The retention rate started to drop. They
found that about halfway through the school year life would get in the way and students
66
would start to drop out. They started with the right intentions but couldn’t sustain it. So, we
spent quite a bit of time and energy trying to figure out how to help them get through the
rough patches. This time LeBlanc turned to the academic advisors, whose typical job
includes helping students pick classes, and flipped them into life coaches. They would
monitor the students as they went through the process reminding them exactly why they
were doing this. They became the angel sitting on their shoulder, seeing when they hit a
rough spot, and providing a bit of confidence or a helping hand: tutor, work group, or
somebody to help them through it. It cut the dropout rate by almost ninety percent.	
In 2010, there were five hundred online students at SNHU. In a short ten years, LeBlanc’s
online enrollment ballooned to a hundred and thirty thousand students. He went from a
$100-million university to over a billion-dollar university! That’s the power of a causal
structure.	
The Disruption Theory
I’m not alone in relying on frameworks to see causal structures. All the successful
innovators and entrepreneurs that I’ve met along the way have two or three dominant
causal structures that they use to help them unpack cause and effect.
My friend and mentor, Clay Christensen, had a framework for causal mechanisms called
“disruption.” It’s the idea that as companies grow, they add more and more features and
benefits making their prices increase exponentially until eventually people at the low-end
of the market are priced out. They want to buy their product, but they can’t afford to, which
leaves the company vulnerable to disruption. Clay would use the story of US Steel to
explain…
At one point, US Steel was by far the leader in the steel market. They manufactured a
variety of different products, ranging from low-end rebar that priced at roughly $10 per
pound to high-end steel that ran up to $100,000 per pound. They made all their revenue on
the high-end of the market. Then along came Nucor who designed an innovative method for
67
melting old scrap metal and producing rebar at much cheaper costs. US Steel was more
than happy to let the rebar business go; after all, they made no revenue off it. At the time, it
seemed like a win-win.
Nucor with their low overhead and innovative technology started making huge returns on
the rebar. And as they did, they continued to creep up market taking more and more of US
Steel’s business. During the course of about eight years Nucor was able to eat away at
eighty percent of US Steel’s revenue, boxing US Steel into a high-end corner of the market
until they were forced to declare bankruptcy.
When companies would come to Clay as they struggled to grow their markets, he would tell
them the US Steel story and ask, “Are you US Steel? Have you boxed yourself into the upper
corner in a way that makes you vulnerable to disruption? Do you need to reinvent yourself
and figure out how to be in the low-end?”
No accountant or finance expert will tell you to build products with smaller margins but if
you understand the causal mechanisms of disruption, you realize that if you don’t your
business will die.
Creating New Frameworks Through Anomalies
Most people would look at US Steel and think that’s an anomaly, right? But anomalies are the
way in which you build new frameworks for unpacking causal structures. Anomalies show you
what you don’t know. This goes back to the notion of failing and learning from Chapter One.
When you fail, you create an anomaly that helps build better models for the future.
When I build something, I'm designing it using what I believe are the right causal structures. So,
when it does not work the way I expect it too, it’s an opportunity to say, “What am I missing?
What else is important that I did not see before?” Anomalies help add to your field of view.
68
Successful innovators and entrepreneurs, because they are grounded in cause and effect,
consider and study anomalies with great interest; they recognize patterns.
The Problem with an Effect Only Approach
I’ve found that nine times out of ten, people tend to focus on the effect side of the equation,
not the cause, and they do so with vague language. I’ll be in a meeting and someone will say,
“We need to build trust with the customer.” Trust is an outcome—an effect—and it’s a vague
word. So, first we must define trust.
“What’s trust?” I’ll ask. Because if we don’t define it, how can we cause it? So, we will start
to unpack trust and people will use a lot of generic, abstract language. So, I’ll start to ask
them to explain trust within a greater context: “Does trust already exist and we’re building
more trust? Are we creating new trust? How do we know if someone trusts us? How do we
measure trust?	
It quickly becomes clear that trust by itself is a very abstract concept; you can’t organize
around trust. Trust depends on the context, it’s subtle.
“How do you trust a salesperson?” I’ll ask to demonstrate my point.
“I don’t,” they’ll say.
“If you don’t trust salespeople, how do you buy from anybody?” I’ll ask.
“I need to vet people,” they’ll respond.
“What do you do to vet a salesperson?” I’ll ask.
69
As I walk through this exercise, it becomes clear that when trust exists there are things that
had to happen to enable it. Now you're in a completely different realm: To build trust you
have to do this and to earn trust you have to do that. Oftentimes people struggle because
they are focused on the effect rather than the cause; they’re not thinking deeply enough.
When I’m conducting interviews, I know that if I get people to talk about cause and effect, I
can predict the future. It’s the bright pieces that allow me to connect the dots. Ultimately,
everything is built on cause and effect. Greg and I listen for those dominoes to fall when we
interview people, the things that cause them to move from A to B and make a change. But
most people miss the cause because they focus on the effect instead of the cause. When
people start talking about the future you have to understand why they want what they
want. You have to be able to decipher the causal mechanisms behind their statements.	
Everything can be seen this way. Look at the US education system, it’s largely an effect only
approach.	
First there’s no empathetic perspective: we push material into students and test them, but
we never give the context that would create the pull for learning. How is math applicable to
their life? Why care? We recognize on one level that people have different strengthens and
goals but then push the same generic content into everyone. Students struggle to make
progress because they don’t understand why they are learning half of what’s being taught.
There’s no pull.
The education system is caught up in the process of teaching and not the process of
learning. They believe their job is to supply knowledge, as opposed to helping people learn.
Why? They’re not seeing the whole picture and therefore they focus on the wrong things.
They want students to learn—the effect—but what causes that to happen? They focus on
making the teacher better but fail to understand how the student learns. If the teacher
improves but the student still fails, is the system any more useful?
70
Innovators and entrepreneurs skilled at causal structures see the many layers to the
problem—empathetic perspective—and they have a framework to see cause and effect
which allows them to connect the dots between teachers, students, administrators, and
parents. Causal structures are about seeing supply and demand, understanding the
different perspectives, and connecting the dots into a causal framework.
Causal Structures Versus Categorical Models
Young Bob didn’t understand the difference between correlation and causation, so he would try
to build categories to explain people. But people are different because of the context they're in,
not because of a model they fit. There's a big difference between a causal structure and a
categorical model.
Myers-Briggs is a categorical model. You take the test and you’re labeled a certain personality
type; I’m an INTJ but when the situation calls for it, I’m an ENTJ. Categorical models remove
causation because they don’t account for context. We are each hardwired to be a certain way
but that’s not who you are in every circumstance. The needs of the situation dictate the
response.
Similarly, people are labeled based on their generation: millennial, gen-x, boomer, etc. Being a
millennial is not a causal mechanism. It’s a phenomenon that has no outcomes. It can help
describe who you are but it’s not a complete picture.
Using Causal Structures to Navigate Change
If I were advising my younger self today, I’d say, “Study how things change and evolve over
time.” Oftentimes, people view the world in a static way looking for absolute truths. You
need to go from a static worldview to a dynamic worldview. How do things change
overtime?
For instance, I’m a male, and that’s a static state for me—I will always be a male. But I was
once a kid, then I became a student turned engineer; I was once single, then I married and
71
became a father. You need to view your innovation through time. Most people think of truth
as a constant across time and that limits their view.
Skilled innovators and entrepreneurs know that things will never be static; change is
guaranteed. That’s why part of learning to innovate must include causal structures so that
you have a mechanism to respond to change. You won’t always know what’s going to
happen next but having a framework to help you navigate change is key. When your
approach is static you can’t figure out how to move and adjust. People skilled at causal
structures are comfortable in the messy middle; they can operate in a very conceptual way.
And they don’t spend a lot of time worrying about right or wrong because they are making
decisions from an empathetic perspective: How would Bob view this? Then applying this
perspective to their set of frameworks to help them make progress.

The essence of causal structures is about being curious and understanding how things
work. Once you have that perspective, you need to ask yourself, “How do I play with this
thing?” That’s prototyping to learn.
But first, let me introduce Dr. W. Edward Deming, someone who taught me a great deal
about causal structures.	
73
Meet Dr. William Edwards Deming
I first met Deming shortly before my internship at the car manufacturer in 1985. It felt
random at the time, although today I don’t believe in randomness. I was at a function that
he attended and sat down next to him and we talked. When the conversation began, I didn’t
have any idea who he was. I think I asked him fifty-two questions in twenty minutes. At the
end of the conversation, he turned to me and said, “You’re a curious kid, what are you doing
this summer?” That’s how I initially got that summer internship at the car giant; Deming
was a consultant there and recommended me for the role.
When I eventually went to work under him, my education into how to build and launch new
products began. Deming was a big proponent of case studies, he believed there was no
equivalent to hands-on learning to help people understand the things that needed to
happen for a solution to come about. For him, it was always about the application as
opposed to the theory.
I thought of Deming as a teacher and a mentor and while he was a pivotal person in my
education, I’m not sure that he would even remember my name if he were alive today; it
wasn’t a personal relationship. In fact, I was a little intimidated by him. He was eighty-five
and hard of hearing, so whenever he spoke to me, he screamed at me. The whole time I
didn’t realize that he was deaf and hard of hearing; I thought he was just screaming at me
because I wasn’t doing it right.
He’d yell, “Don’t ever confuse correlation with causation.” And I’d think, “Okay, okay. I’m
sorry.”
He had a saying called SIPOC, which stood for supplier, input, process, output, and
consequences. The consequences were the outcomes for the customer. He’d talk about how
there’s a difference between the output of something—the metric which you measure—
and the outcome—the desired result. For instance, when Michelle bought the Peloton, she
74
wanted an outcome of fitting into more clothes, but the output would be the time and effort
she put into riding the bike to get that result. When we only measure outputs we don’t
know if it relates to the outcomes that people seek. His goal was to help people, so even
though he talked a great deal about statistics he was actually more about empowering
workers.	
Q&A: My Personal Perspective of Dr. Deming
What was Deming’s superpower? Fundamentally understanding how a system worked. He
was data driven and could measure and frame a system or process and be able to
fundamentally see the sets of processes. He believed that all problems were system
problems, not people problems. Whenever he saw what appeared to be a people problem,
he would look at the system wrapped around that person. “A bad system can crush a good
person every time,” he’d say. He believed people were always trying to do their best.
What motivated Deming? He believed that management’s job was to build an environment
where people could love their work. Therefore, he was motivated to help people have
fulfilled lives where the work that they did was meaningful.	
Was Deming ahead of his time? Yes, I think even for today. I don’t think we teach
management anymore. People talk about leadership, but we don't talk about daily
management: How to hold people accountable? How to make sure the work is shaped the
right way, so that people are doing meaningful things. He thought about how to enable the
worker to be better, not from a profit perspective, but from a fulfillment perspective. We see
this attitude emerging today with a lot of startups, but Deming was doing these things back
in the fifties. He was ahead of his time in terms of building culture and holding management
accountable for its culture, fighting against the church of finance.
75
What job would Deming have been terrible at? A toll booth attendant because it's so
repetitive. He would have spent the whole time trying to figure out how to automate it. He
would have hated seeing a bunch of people all day but not being able to interact.
If Deming were an animal what animal would he be? A badger: He was very factual and
tenacious. He stayed low to the ground on the front line with the workers.	
Did you have any specific memories of Deming? Deming and I would travel together, and I’d
pull the rental car into the gas station and not remember which side of the car to fill the
tank. This drove Deming nuts. “This is a quality problem. We need to solve this,” he said. So,
he put me to work on adding a little arrow into the dashboard that pointed to the side of the
car with the gas tank.	
76
Chapter Five
Prototyping to Learn
Many years ago, I was brought on as a consultant at a major cookie and cracker
manufacturer. My job was to help them speed up their production line for two popular
cookies, but as I rolled up my sleeves and got to work people kept saying, “You should visit
the chip guy, he’s struggling with an issue.” So, I went over to see if I could help.
“I’m just have a little fragility problem,” he told me as he brushed aside my assistance. “I'm
redesigning the system, and I just have to run one more test to confirm it, then we'll be
ready to go.”	
“Okay,” I said. But about six weeks later, people started prodding me again: “You really need
to visit the chip guy.” So, once again I went over to see if I could help.	
“What seems to be the problem?” I asked.
“Well, I fixed the fragility problem, but now it’s too big and feels wrong when you bite into
it, so I’m fixing that; I almost have it, just one more test,” he told me as he sent me away.
Now, fast forward six months, and the chip guy was still struggling. After all those tests he
was still no closer to getting the job done; every time he solved one problem, he just created
another. Remind you of someone? It reminded me of young Bob trying to fix the rearview
mirror all those years ago, and I felt for the man. I would be so euphoric each time I thought
I’d solved the problem and then equally as miserable when a new problem emerged.
I couldn’t solve the rearview mirror problem all those years ago because I wasn’t thinking
about it broadly enough: In my mind it was one problem, one solution, and therefore, I
focused on the humidity rather than the system as a whole. The chip guy had fallen into the
77
same trap. When you don’t look at a situation broadly enough, you conduct A/B testing—
testing one factor, then another, and so on. You are always one prototype away from solving
the problem, but you never get any closer to the solution.
Rather than frame the problem and search for the solution like a needle in a haystack, you
need to look at the problem as a system. What are the systems that are not performing the
way that they should? Then you need to unpack those systems into control factors and
noise factors? To recap from the Introduction:	
• Control factors are the things you can change that influence the system.
• Noise factors are the things that influence the system that you cannot control, choose
not to control, or are too expensive to control.	
By the time, the chip guy and I sat down, he had already conducted almost a thousand
experiments. He never planned to do a thousand, only one more. Together we prototyped
using an orthogonal array testing thousands of points through only a handful of tests,
solving the problem in just weeks.
That’s the power of prototyping to learn.
How Do You Prototype to Learn?
Let’s break down the process of prototyping to learn by walking through a project I worked
on designing dish soap in Argentina. The company had been developing the soap for about
a year and they were stuck; every time they got a status update from the designers, they’d
hear the same thing: “We’re almost there, just one more thing to fix.” And each time they’d
fix the problem something else would break.	
“How many prototypes have you built?” I asked at our first meeting.
78
“Oh, not that many, maybe a hundred throughout the whole year,” they said.
“So, what did you learn?” I asked.
“We don’t know why it’s not working,” they said exasperated. Then they started to list the
litany issues that they’d run into, including costs. Now, let’s be clear, I don’t know what to
do; I know nothing about dish soap, but I have a step-by-step process for approaching
problems just like this one. Here’s a broad overview:
1. System Design: How does the thing work?
2. Prioritization: What are the critical systems that drive overall performance and
cost?	
3. Functionality: What are the things that I can change?
4. Testing: How can I use an orthogonal array to help me build an efficient set of
prototypes that will maximize learning?
System Design
How does dish soap work? What’s its job? Obviously, dish soap cleans dishes, that’s not
what I mean. I needed to figure out how dish soap does the job of cleaning dishes. What’s
the mechanism by which the soap works? And how does the customer know it’s working?
So, I learned about the cleaning system, which involves surfactants that attack both fat and
carbohydrates breaking them down into smaller pieces. Then I realized that the soap
needed to create foam, without foam the customer wouldn’t get the feedback that it’s
working. You can actually make dish soap without foam that does an excellent job of
79
cleaning, but people won’t realize it’s cleaning and keep adding more and more soap. I also
found that the majority of people use dish soap with a sponge, therefore if it’s too thin the
soap runs straight through the sponge and down the drain. Next, I needed to consider smell
and color. Finally, the dish soap needed to do all of these jobs while staying within a
competitive cost structure. As you lay out all the systems, you suddenly realize that there
are six different functions for dish soap.
Prioritization
Now I needed to prioritize those functions. What are the critical systems that are driving
overall performance and cost? For instance, the fragrance and color are fairly independent
and not where you are going to spend a lot of time and money. However, the bubbles,
thickness, and cleaning system are critical components.	
Functionality
Next, I broke down those functions into parameters with control factors and noise factors.
How can I change the things that I have control over, to make me less sensitive to the things
I cannot control? How do I set the control factors, so that the noise factors no longer affect
the output?	
The dish soap would be used in Argentina where there’s both hard and soft water.
Therefore, we needed to create a dish soap that worked in both scenarios. Most people
don’t even know what kind of water they have, so you can’t create and sell dish soap based
on water type. Additionally, the detergent must work on both very greasy foods—like olive
oil—and carbohydrates—like rice—that gets caked onto pots and pans. These were all
noise factors that influenced the system.
We needed to play with the chemical makeup of the cleaning mechanism, our control factor,
to determine how it impacted the outputs in the system: foam, thickness, etc.
Testing
80
Now it was time to build a method for measuring the critical systems:
• To test the foam, I designed a study using a George Foreman grill where I put a
specific amount of dish soap on the grill with a set amount of water. Then I would
measure how many times I needed to scrub the grill before the soap started to foam
and how long that foam lasted.	
• I measured the thickness of the soap in a tube and then looked at the length of time
the soap stuck to the top of the sponge rather than just running through it.
Now, I played with the chemical formula. There were different actives in the surfactants, so
as I adjusted the percent of actives, I looked at the impact on the overall cleaning
mechanism as well as changes to foaming and thickness. I knew that I did not have control
over the context in which the customer would use the soap, so those were the noise factors
that I tested each of the control factors against.	
• Hard versus soft water.	
• Grease versus caked food.	
Once I understood how many factors I was playing with, I knew how many tests I needed to
run by simply plugging the numbers into one of Dr. Genichi Taguchi’s arrays from his book
Taguchi Methods: Orthogonal Arrays and Linear Graphs. These arrays allow me to measure
multiple factors simultaneously and understand how a thing works over sets of tests,
within sets of conditions. The opposite of A/B testing or solving one problem at a time. And
the tests are fully balanced. With the dish soap for instance, nine tests were performed with
the color yellow and nine with blue. We didn’t expect the color to have any impact at all but
as it turns out blue is an oil-based color and yellow is a water-based color. Therefore, the
81
blue didn’t work as well because the surfactant used some of its energy to break down the
color rather than clean the greasy dishes.
As you can see, the key to this approach is that it does not rely on my theory of what’s the
“best” dish soap. I don’t have any idea how the experiments are going to turn out, I’m letting
the dish soap tell me which one’s the best. It’s based entirely on empirical data.
We ended up building eighteen prototypes that we measured against all these different
dimensions, which answered a ton of questions: How well does it stay on the sponge? How
well does it cut grease? If the water’s dirty, does it still foam? What’s the foam height?
What’s the cost? By the end, I had a whole understanding about what makes the best dish
soap. For instance, I knew that when I increased the magnesium chloride it increased foam
height without adding to the cost, but it made the soap thinner. Prototyping to learn allows
me to see these tradeoffs.
Whenever I prototype, I know that some things are going to work, and others will not but
all of it helps me learn. Too often people get singularly focused: “I want to make a dish soap
with the most foam.” Prototyping will show which dish soap has the best foam, but it will
also detail tradeoffs like cost. You start to realize that you can’t make the “best” soap
because you will lose money. You are able to make the tradeoffs in real time.	
The Problem with Relying on Theory
Most people don’t prototype to learn; they prototype to confirm a theory with A/B testing.
Why? Because we’re taught that we should already have the answer based on theory. As
engineers we’re taught that we have an expertise in a certain vertical—electrical
engineering, mechanical engineering, etc.—and therefore we think in terms of content.
With this mindset, you look at a problem and believe that you should have the answer
82
based on your knowledge base. Therefore, you assume certain knowns and run
experiments based on theoretical knowledge. You think that you only need to change one
factor. It’s a false notion.
Theory alone only gets you to a certain point; it’s relative to context. When you build on
theory and problems arise, you focus on trying to change the context rather than looking at
the system and asking, “What are the systems that are not performing the way that they
should?” Prototyping to learn is not about confirming a theory or hypothesis, it’s about
empirically getting to the limits of theory to understand how to build better. You’re pushing
the limits of your thing and therefore you know where it fails. You’re not surprised like
young Bob with the rearview mirror.
I’m not advocating throwing theory out the window but acknowledging that theory only
gets you in the game; it’s the minor leagues because it’s based in the past. You need present,
empirical data to innovate for the future.	
Do PhDs Make the Best Innovators?
In school I was taught that to be an innovator you needed to be the smartest person in the
room on a particular subject. Great innovators had depth of knowledge. But over time I realized
that experts were overly biased, and it actually got in the way of innovation because it caused
them to assume aspects were understood to a greater extent than the reality. The truth is that
there's more unknown on almost any subject than is known.
Ultimately, I’ve found that the key to successful innovation is not a solid base knowledge on the
subject matter but rather methods, tools, and frameworks for problem solving, combined with
hard work. In my experience this will get you farther than a PhD when trying to innovate.
83
Part of what made Taguchi, Deming, and Moore so successful was their humbleness to know
that they did not know.
The Limits of Theory
I had the good fortune to learn prototyping from a master like Taguchi as a young engineer.
He used to tell a story that underscored the importance of prototyping to learn and the
limits of existing theory…
For one hundred years tile manufacturers everywhere struggled to produce uniform tiles.
By the 1950s, they’d largely reached the point where they accepted the problem as
unchangeable. But Taguchi set out to test that theory.
First, he went to the production line to figure out how the system worked. The tiles came
out of the kiln by the thousands, went down the production line, and were stacked into
enormous piles to use the space efficiently. As the tiles dried, the ones sitting on the outside
dried faster, shrank, and got brittle causing them to crack easily. The tiles in the center
couldn’t drive off the moisture well and therefore wouldn’t shrink as much and crack.
Because of this, tile manufacturers couldn’t produce uniform tiles, which led to a major
sorting endeavor after each day’s run involving scores of people who grouped the tiles into
three to four size categories.
So, Taguchi looked at the control factors and noise factors. How could he design an
experiment that changed the things he had control over so that the tiles would be less
sensitive to the context in which they dried? He began by experimenting with the kiln: What
distance did the tiles travel? What temperatures were they subjected to? How fast did the
temperatures ramp up and down? How long did they hold temperatures? Taguchi found
that by playing with the kiln alone he was able to solve the problem that had plagued tile
manufacturers for one-hundred years. They never had to sort again. This not only solved
the size issue but increased capacity tenfold.
84
It underscores the power of obtaining present, empirical data—prototyping to learn—as
opposed to relying on past theory. The problem with relying on existing theory alone is that
it causes you to assume certain aspects are known.
Accepting the Unknowns
There's way more unknown than known in this world! Successful innovators and
entrepreneurs have humility; they know that they don’t know, and as a result they use
prototyping to learn. This tweet perfectly encapsulates this notion of the unknown…
“Sometimes I think of how cakes are a miracle. Take a pound cake: it's made of equal
amounts, one pound each, of four ingredients. Sounds simple, right? To get the first
ingredient, you need to find some species of grass that grows in the Middle East. When
the grass is ripe and golden, you harvest the greens, then you grind them to get the fine
powder. You remove the dark parts of the powder to just keep the white. That was the
easiest ingredient.
You'll need another plant: a large grass that grows in tropical areas. The part you need
is some sweet juice in the stocks after a lot of labor-intensive processing and refining.
You turn this juice into thousands of tiny white crystals. You're not done yet.	
For the next ordeal you must hunt this flightless bird from the jungles of Asia. Don't kill
it though. Just take the weird round things the females lay, crack the weird round thing
open. It's slimy and fat and bright yellow. That's exactly what you want.
The last one's tough. You need the female of this massive, but peaceful beast. You need
it to have just given birth. You need to take the white liquid it wanted to give its baby.
Then you need to extract the fat from the liquid and mix it until it becomes a yellowish
solid.
85
Now combine these four things in a very specific order before you apply a very simple,
specific amount of heat for a very specific amount of time. And you have a pound cake.
Maybe you'd like to add some flavor: Perhaps the tiny fragrant seeds of an expansive
orchid, or the bitter processed fat from a central American fruit, or the dried bark from
some tree in India. Maybe we shouldn't get too fancy.
The reason cakes exist of course, is that we had centuries to domesticate the plants and
animals and to create culinary innovations. Complex things can come into being with
time and mechanisms, like culture or natural selection, but make no mistake cakes are
a miracle.”	
Attribution Needed	
As you go through time, a poundcake seems simple, but it’s taken knowledge, experience,
and evolution to make a poundcake easy—a lot of innovation. Now think of the world at
large, there are so many possibilities, so many unknowns; we still have a lot more to do.
That’s why prototyping to learn is so important, everything evolves overtime, we just need
to find the next evolution. Prototyping creates possibilities.	
Innovators and entrepreneurs should be doing a lot more prototyping. In foresight A/B
testing looks easier and faster but in hindsight, it's actually longer and less effective.
Taguchi would always say, “A/B testing is job security for engineers.” It’s a shotgun
approach where you throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. The problem: You
don’t understand where your thing fails; you can’t see around corners, so it’s like building
on a house of cards; it will ultimately collapse in the long term. It’s simplicity on the wrong
side of complexity because it's not based in empirical data.
Successful innovators and entrepreneurs understand that they need to frame and build
around knowns and they are humble enough to know that they don’t know. Therefore, they
use prototyping to help them discover what works.
86
Making It Real
Now think about your product and ask yourself a few questions:
• What are the critical unknowns or rabbit holes that exist in your product that you
think you understand but now realize you don’t?	
(Add more practical steps)	
Now, here are some resources to help continue your education into prototyping to learn:	
• Prototyping: A Practitioner's Guide by Todd Warfel.
• Product Design and Development by Karl Ulrich and Steven Eppinger.	
• Total Quality Development by Don Clausing.	
• Taguchi Methods: Orthogonal Arrays and Linear Graphs by Dr. Genichi Taguchi.	
• Taguchi’s Quality Engineering Handbook by Dr. Genichi Taguchi.	
When prototyping there’s never just one answer, there are always tradeoffs. Optimization at
its essence is about a series of tradeoffs, which leads us into our next chapter Making
Tradeoffs.
But first let me introduce Dr. Genichi Taguchi, probably the best that there’s ever been when
it comes to prototyping to learn.	
87
Meet Dr. Genichi Taguchi
I met Dr. Genichi Taguchi during that first internship at the car manufacturer, he was in his
sixties, I was all of twenty. I was the person in the front row asking all the questions while
everyone else remained silent: “Wait a second, I don’t understand…” As a result, he knew
exactly who I was because everyone else was either afraid to question him or thought it was
not appropriate to do so. Instead, Taguchi loved my questions, and it solidified our
relationship.
Taguchi was the equivalent of the Dalai Lama for innovation in my opinion. He was smart in
a practical way. People would tell him he couldn't do something, and he'd figure out a way;
he'd take a pair of pliers and use them as a hammer. People would say, “You can't do that.”
But suddenly the pliers became not just a hammer but a better hammer. He was
resourceful.
Learning from Taguchi was the beginning of night vision goggles for me. He taught me how
to form questions, so that I could get to intent then take that intent and turn it into action.
For instance, when you drive a car you may have the intent to turn, but that intent starts in
your head. It’s the action of turning the wheel that brings your intent to life. Taguchi would
say that if you talk to most people about turning a car, they’d say you need a steering wheel
but without a steering wheel we might be able to innovate four hundred other ways to turn
a car. His point was that the consumers intent was way more important than knowing how
they wanted their steering wheel built. “Don’t get caught up in the solution, get caught up in
the problem,” he’d say. “A well-framed problem is ten times easier to solve than a solution
looking for a problem.”
Taguchi was always obsessed with measurement. He would say, “How do you make
something better if you can't measure the variation?” He believed that all innovation must
start with better measurement—and measurement of the “right” things. He would always
tell me, “You’re measuring the wrong thing; you’re not thinking about this right.” When we
88
were painting the cars, it was about reducing rework. He’d say, “You've got to measure the
functional thing that's not happening. Where's the variation?” this would force me to go
down to the right level. I learned the importance and utility of metrics and structure.
I worked side-by-side with Taguchi from 1985-1993 at the car manufacturer. Then again for
several more years on two other projects.
Q&A: My Personal Perspective of Taguchi	
What was Taguchi’s superpower? Dr. Taguchi’s superpower was his ability to figure out how
things worked. Whether it was a problem with the steering wheel, or the braking system
Taguchi would always say, “All problems are problems of variation of function.” He could
look at a problem and see the system and that enabled him to redistribute the problem
back to the sources within the system that weren’t doing what they should be doing.
He also had this way of being able to maximize something; he would never ask for more.
Rather he would always try to get the most out of what he had. He was probably the best
engineer that I've ever worked with.	
Did you and Taguchi have any inside jokes? He had analogies that were basically inside jokes
between the two of us: “That works just like a spring,” he would say. “What?” that’s nothing
like a spring. He would be referring the act of displacement that the spring’s force created.
It became an inside joke between the two of us. We’d be talking about a steering wheel
problem and he would turn to me and say, “Just like a spring,” and we’d both laugh. Then I’d
have to explain what he meant because it made no sense to anyone else in the room.
What was Taguchi’s proudest accomplishment? I think the concept of robustness, which is
the idea that when you’re building something, say a transmission, you need to make sure
89
that that it works in hot and cold weather, etc. Taguchi would say, “How do I make myself
‘robust’ to the problems—least sensitive?”
What job would Taguchi have been terrible at? A short order cook: He wanted to think
everything through, and he needed time to do that, similar to Clay. He would have struggled
if somebody asked him to think on his feet and move very quickly.
If Taguchi was an animal what animal would he be? An eagle: A big bird that swoops in and
grabs the tools that he needs to go where he needs to go with confidence—very much an
active, predatory animal.	
Is there a TV or movie character that reminds you of Taguchi? Mr. Miyagi from The Karate Kid
—wax on, wax off. You’d wonder, “Why am I doing this?” And next thing you’d know you
actually had the tools to go solve the problem.

Chapter Six
Making Tradeoffs
“You’re better off with a kick-ass half than a half-assed whole.”
Jason Freed, Entrepreneur, CEO and Co-founder of Basecamp	
Trade-offs are the key to making progress. You must be able to define what you are willing
to give up, to move forward. I think of tradeoffs as, you can have it this way; you can have it
that way; or you cannot have it at all.	
For instance, I’m building a dating app and during interviews I talked to an impressive
woman in her early thirties—Harvard law degree, employed at a big Washington, DC law
firm—who was struggling to find a partner. As we talked, I realized the problem: she
couldn’t make tradeoffs. She saw the dating pool as infinite, and therefore just kept swiping
right looking for the perfect match. “I don’t want to settle,” she told me. But she failed to
realize that nobody’s perfect; marriage is about compromise.
People struggle with tradeoffs when they view them as settling. Tradeoffs are not about
settling; they are about making progress by determining what’s most important. When you
can’t make tradeoffs, you get stuck in decision hell.
Why Tradeoffs Matter for Innovators and
Entrepreneurs
When Basecamp first started to think about an app for the phone, they initially tried to put
everything in it to replicate their web-based platform. Then they realized that it made the
app way too slow. So, they asked themselves, “What are the types of things people would do
on the phone versus the computer?” You’re not going to create a new account or a new
91
project on your phone. But you will respond to comments and check your lists. So, they
stripped the app down to the point where it does only the things you might do while
standing in line at the grocery store or taking the train home from work.
When the app was packed full and too slow people downloaded it but never used it. Now
usage has skyrocketed because they managed tradeoffs. They recognized that they couldn’t
have everything, so they only kept what was most important.
Tradeoffs are just as much about cost as functionality. What’s good enough?
Taguchi used to talk about how Mercedes had it easy because they made their
specifications so tight; everything fit perfectly. But the reality is to make it perfect you’ve
got to build ten parts and throw away nine, dramatically increasing costs. It’s like French
cooking: If you use a lot of high-quality ingredients it’s hard to make a bad thing. Skilled
innovators and entrepreneurs can take a product that’s not perfect and make something
great out of it by making the right tradeoffs. Thereby reducing costs while maintaining
enough quality.
The red line/green line story from Chapter One is a perfect example of the power in
managing tradeoffs well. When I compared the systems of the American design to the
Japanese, the American was superior on a microscopic level. Take the exhaust system for
example, each component used to build our version was higher quality, but when I
compared the two-exhaust systems side-by-side in their entirety the Japanese version
outperformed, and it did so at half the cost. Innovators and entrepreneurs skilled at
managing tradeoffs understand this complexity. And as a result, they frame tradeoffs within
the context of the whole system. What’s the economic impact of failure? For instance, one
screw falling out is not a big deal, a hundred screws on the other hand, now that’s a big
deal.
92
Tradeoffs are the key to great decision making. It’s critical to being a good consumer and
even more critical to becoming a skilled innovator and entrepreneur. You can’t have it all so
you must look at the totality, understand how it’s interconnected, and determine what’s
good enough.
Tools for Learning to Mange Tradeoffs
There are several tricks that I employ which force me to see tradeoffs and thereby swiftly
move me through the design process:	
• Setting constraints.	
• Seeing the big picture.	
Setting Constraints
One of the keys to forcing tradeoffs in innovation, as well as selling, is a time wall. A time
wall can be artificial, or not, but it’s the fabricated notion that you must complete
something by a certain date. If there’s no time wall you might innovate forever, rather than
bring your thing to market. But the moment a time wall is established it forces you to make
tradeoffs. What’s most important? What’s least important? It sets your priorities. It’s a
triangulation between time, cost, and quality. No one can have it all! A time wall pushes you
to decide, rather than endlessly tweak and expand your thing. Think of an hourglass, it’s
always running out of time.
When innovating I give myself what I call a time box: I have this much time, to do that much
work. After I set the time box, I shape the work to fit into that box. When you innovate
without a time box you end up continually playing with your thing, adding on features and
benefits. As a result, you fail to make explicit tradeoffs. When you hold the time box
constant you give yourself a time wall that puts pressure on the situation. It allows you to
see what’s really important.
93
Many years ago, I decided to expand the notion of a time wall to my life expectancy. You see,
I’d recently conducted interviews with industry leaders who had emerged from out of
nowhere—dark horses—and done amazing things. One of their key characteristics was that
they all valued time and viewed their life as precious. Eighty percent told me that it
stemmed from a near-death experience that rocked them to their core and changed their
perspective. They became more intentional in their choices and stopped putting up with
crap. To outsiders, their decisiveness came across as brash and overly confident, but for
them it became the key to their success. It shaped their decision making; they stopped
wasting time.
And so, I asked myself, “How do I manufacture this mindset without actually having a near
death experience?”
Immediately, I thought of my mom. She worked hard her whole life as a Detroit area public
school teacher and never really took anytime to enjoy herself. “I’ll do that when I retire,”
she’d always say. She saved all her money; she didn’t vacation. Shortly after retiring at sixtytwo she received a devastating diagnoses of colon cancer and died just four months later. I
saw my own mortality in her story. My mom had no idea what was coming, but I’ve been
blessed with the foresight to realize that maybe I only have until I’m sixty-two as well.
So, I picked my death date based on my mom’s lifespan. Obviously, I don’t really know when
I’m going to die but I know that it’s possible. That means today I have less than seven years
left to live. What am I going to do? What am I not going to do? By living with an expiration
date, it forces me to make very conscious tradeoffs about what I’m willing to put up with
even at the simplest level. For instance, I go to two baseball games every year. If I only have
seven years to live that’s fourteen more games. When I view it through that lens, I realize I
don’t want to see the Mariners and the Tigers; I want to see the Yankees and the White
Socks.
94
Creating a time wall for my life causes me to shape what I want to do intentionally. And the
reality is, what do I lose if I live beyond that day? Nothing. Now I have bonus days. But by
living with this mindset, I force myself to make tradeoffs, and therefore, I make better
decisions. I’m not waiting until I retire to do the things that I enjoy, I do those things now.
People ask me all the time, “How in the world can you write a book, work on three products,
and volunteer?” But how can I not? I know what I want to accomplish in my life, and I’ve
faced my mortality. In a hundred years we will all be forgotten, just specs in the timeline of
the universe. It’s why I’m writing this book. The minimum that I can do is pass on the
knowledge that others have shared before my time is up.
Another effective constraint is a dollar wall: I can’t spend more than this amount of money
to get that accomplished. Again, it forces you to make explicit tradeoffs by placing yet
another set of constraints on your thing. The dollar wall forces you to scope the work and
de-risk.
Seeing the Big Picture
Forcing yourself to view the whole so that you can see how the pieces are interconnected is
another way to help manage tradeoffs. In my office for instance, I have a room lined with
boards that represent categories of work: suspects, prospects, proposals, etc. Then within
each board are cards for the work within that category. It allows me to see the whole while
realizing that I have a limited capacity. Therefore, I can shift my priorities and easily make
tradeoffs.
So, in September I could see the number of projects coming in and subsequently how that
would fill my calendar. Now the tradeoffs are clear: I’m prepared to lose these clients
because they need something tomorrow. My online classes needed to be pushed back to
satisfy incoming demand. But writing the books and building new products are a priority,
so I’ll only take on the new clients to the extent that it fits that priority. It gets back to the
notion of being explicit about decisions. Now when I look at my calendar it represents the
progress that I want to make. And I’ve made explicit tradeoffs: I want to help people, but I
95
recognize that with the books I can help more people, so I defer my time to that versus
individual work.
This intentional mindset goes back to the time wall that I’ve established for my life. If I only
have 2,587 days left, what do I want to do with that time? Tradeoffs become very clear
when viewed from this perspective.	
Playing with hypothetical scenarios is an excellent way to see the big picture. When a
company comes to me for advice, I’ll use this technique to help flush out potential
opportunities and weaknesses:	
• Imagine that I just bought you. Here’s what I would do…	
• If I was your competitor, what should I do?	
• If I’m a startup trying to disrupt your industry, what should I do?
Similarly, when someone comes to me for help building their thing, I’ll present several
hypothetical scenarios to flush out what’s important:
• If I wanted that done in half the time, what would you change? How much would it
cost?
• If I gave you unlimited money, what would you do? How long would it take?
• If I gave you unlimited time to make your thing perfect, how much time would you
need?	
Setting different types of hypothetical scenarios forces you to think about your thing
differently. Remember, you can’t have it all. Do you value time or money? What’s good
enough? What does perfect look like? It also helps you see the next iteration of your thing.
96
Then try to think of everything as a draft; nothing is final: In the first round we do this, in
the second round we do that. You’re not saying that you’ll never do it, you’re just
prioritizing.
Most people plan horribly because they can’t see the big picture; they plan for what they
know, but they don’t plan for the unknowns. And therefore, they are building their thing off
assumptions. To see the trade-offs, you've got to see the whole so that you can make
connections, and therefore, make better decisions in whatever you’re trying to do. Instead
of making isolated decisions and asking, “Do I do this, or do I do that?” you are now taking a
step back, seeing the bigger picture, and understanding the cost, time, and performance
implications of your decisions.
Successful innovators and entrepreneurs do not view tradeoffs as a compromise. Rather
they see them as necessary tools for managing the speed at which they move forward.
When you can’t see tradeoffs, you get stuck. It’s like continually trying to put ten pounds of
crap, into a five-pound bag. Overstuffing the bag never works. You’re just left with
unintended consequences, where you solve one problem just to create another. Ultimately,
tradeoffs are about understanding which problems you’re going to care about. But you need
to be able to see tradeoffs, not just from the supply-side but from the demand-side as well.
Ethical Tradeoffs
Tradeoffs impact every aspect of your business. Recently, I was brought on to do project at a
company and I quoted $320,000 for the project. They came back and negotiated me down to
$280,000—a $40,000 sway. But somehow when the contract got drawn up there was a
miscommunication, and it had the original price, $320,000, which the client signed before I
noticed the mistake. On my part there was no delay. I didn’t care that they’d signed it,
immediately I corrected the situation because my word is my reputation. It’s taken me a long
time to build my reputation, but it can be broken with one mistake. Your reputation is one of
97
those things that you need to be able to stand by. In my mind, reputation versus dollars is a very
easy tradeoff.
How Do Tradeoffs Influence Your Customer?
Everyone makes tradeoffs to make progress: “I’m willing to give up this, so I can get that.”
No one can have everything. What tradeoffs is your customer willing to make? What’s most
important? What’s least important? Tradeoffs happen when people are in the “deciding”
stage of the timeline from Chapter Two. This is where priorities are set, and value codes are
determined. It’s a triangle between time, cost, and quality. No one can have it all! People set
their expectations here and will base their satisfaction on the criteria they set.
It’s important that you identify the tradeoffs. Don’t talk features, benefits, and cost because
people are willing to make tradeoffs. What makes your product or service kick ass? Where
do you say no? Basically, choose what to suck at. This goes back to the quote at the
beginning of the chapter: “You’re better off with a kick-ass half than a half-assed whole.”
Recently a friend came to me and asked if I could help her get a family member unstuck
during the decisions making process for buying a new condo. John had recently lost his wife
and was consolidating from two homes to one. He and his wife spent half the year up north
and the other half in Palm Beach, Florida. John wanted to move to Florida fulltime. His
children however worried that he didn’t have any family in Palm Beach and wanted him to
relocate closer to family that already lived in Florida.
Eager, John jumped into home hunting from afar as he was still settling the New York
property, so his family in Florida started to preview properties on his behalf via video
conferencing. Immediately, John saw a condo that he loved and made an offer. But as he
waited for the seller’s response, he got nervous and started to over analyze the property:
the building was too close to the one next door and parking was too limited. When sellers
tried to negotiate price, John haggled with his objections in mind and lost the sale.
98
Just a week later John saw another condo that looked perfect and sent his family to go look.
Again, John made an offer almost immediately, but this time his offer was accepted. Again,
he started to stress over the details: closeness to the street, security system, recycling, and
pool maintenance. When the sellers refused to fix an issue with the air conditioning John
pulled out of the deal.	
When he finally arrived in Florida to look in person John saw nothing he liked; everything
had at least one or two little details out of place. At this point he’d looked with my friend at
over thirty properties, and none were acceptable.
“What is he afraid of?” I asked.
Often when people can’t make a choice it’s because they are afraid of something. I
suspected that there was some anxiety force that was manifesting through objections.
“You need to take him out to lunch and ask, ‘What are you really afraid of?” I told her. Maybe
he’s unsure about relocating. “You’ve got to attack the old.”
Then I’d play a game with him: “Imagine that there are only three condos left and these are
the three condos, which one would you pick and why?” It forces him to make a choice at
least in a hypothetical scenario and it will help you determine what’s really important.
Then I would take him out to view a wider range of condos, including condos he won’t
consider buying because they are either above or below his price range. Let him see what it
costs to get the security features, pool maintenance, distance from the street, etc. he needs
to see the tradeoff he’d make on price to get those amenities.
Finally, I would apply a time wall. It’s one of the most valuable tools for framing tradeoffs.
Tell John that he needs to make a decision by a certain date, December 1, because otherwise
you run into the holidays. Then tell him that if he doesn’t decide by then he should take a
99
few months off and start again in the Spring when the inventory is high. By putting a time
all on it you force him to either make the decision or not make the decision.
Consumers need help to make tradeoffs. Attacking the forces of progress—pushes, pulls,
anxieties, and habits—then applying a time wall is a very effective way to help people move
forward and make progress.
Making It Real
In the end you’re looking for balance between quality, cost, and time, think better, faster,
cheaper. You can have two but never all three. Here are a few steps that you can take to start
practicing the skills taught in this chapter:
• Look at a problem that you’re trying to solve. Where do you feel like you’re chasing
your tail—solving one problem only to create another? Now take a step back and
explicitly identify the tradeoffs that you could make to solve the problem. What
problems are and aren’t acceptable?
• Go back to the hypothetical questions that I detailed above and ask yourself those
same questions. For example, if I had to go faster, what would I change? If I had more
money, what would I do differently? Now, are the decisions that you’re making in
alignment with your priorities? What levers can you pull to frame your situation
better?
Here are some resources to help continue your education into making tradeoffs:
• Uncommon Service by Frances Frei.	
• Introduction to Quality Engineering by Dr. Genichi Taguchi.	
• The Innovator's Dilemma by Dr. Clayton Christensen.
100
By now you can probably see how the five skills of innovators and entrepreneurs fit
together. The most skilled innovators and entrepreneurs I’ve met along the way have the
ability to weave all five skills together. Let’s take a step back and look at the whole.
101
Chapter Seven
Integrating the Five Skills
These five skills are not for the masses: It’s going to be hard. There’s not one predictable
way to innovate, but these skills are a method for building a reliable process for how to
think in virtually any situation. No one of these skills in isolation will make you a great
innovator or entrepreneur, the challenge lies in applying all five. They’re interdependent.
For the book, I’ve just artificially separated them. In fact, you’re better off doing a half-assed
job at all five than being excellent at any one of these skills. It’s not about the parts, it’s
about the whole.	
As a young engineer I didn’t understand that, so when I started to realize some of these
skills, like prototyping, I became obsessed; I wanted to teach everyone. “Let me show you
how I solved this problem,” I would say after my first successful prototype solving the paint
problem in cars. As my process evolved, I realized that successful innovators and
entrepreneurs understood uncovering demand, empathetic perspective, causal structures,
prototyping to learn, and making tradeoffs. It wasn’t about any single skill.
When people come to me, they usually don’t really want to know how to solve the problem;
they just want the problem solved. But out of the thousands there are hundreds who ask,
“How did you do that?” with genuine interest. This book is for them. It’s not a simple
conversation where I can sit down and teach them prototyping and suddenly, they can
change the world. It’s a complex, layered process that takes time and practice. Sometimes
the easiest way to understand the complex is to make it simple, so let’s first tie it all
together by making dinner using the five skills of innovators and entrepreneurs, then I’ll
show you how I used it to write this book.
Applying the Five Skills to Life
102
There are numerous, mundane tasks in everyday life where you already use the five skills of
innovators and entrepreneurs without even realizing it. My goal is to make that explicit, so
that you start to become more conscious and take it to the next level. Take dinner, for
instance, it’s something you produce every day and without even realizing it, you’re
utilizing the five skills.
Most of the time dinner starts the week before, right? You need to go grocery shopping, so
you think about the meals that you’ll want to make for that week and the ingredients that
you’ll need.
As you do so, you’re thinking about the context for each meal: Who are you feeding—
spouse, kids, company? You are looking into the future and deciding, will I be busy that day
and need a quick meal that gets the job done or something more elaborate? What meal did I
have the night before? After all you want variety, not chicken five nights in a row. This
planning where you unpack the context for dinner is uncovering demand.
As you’re planning you are also thinking about everybody else. What kid’s going to
complain? Are there allergies to contend with? Maybe you decide to accept not satisfying
one of the kids to make the dinner that you want. Or maybe you strive to please everyone
and therefore you’re willing to make something everyone will eat but no one will really
love. You’re making tradeoffs that you’re identifying through empathetic perspective as you
go through the process of planning dinner.
Next, you need to figure out how you’re going to cook the meal. Do you need a side dish—
salad or vegetable? What about dessert? Is there an appetizer because there’s a football
game on? How many things are you going to serve? What sequence do you need to cook
them in? Does dinner need to start at a certain time? When do you need to start cooking?
That’s causal structures.
103
Wrapped within causal structures is the notion of prototyping to learn. Maybe you need to
cook one thing faster to make room in the oven. If you cook it at a hotter temperature, it’ll
be done faster but the meat might be drier. What’s more important? So, you start making
tradeoffs. Maybe you’re missing an ingredient. Do you send someone to the store, which
would delay dinner or make a substitution? You are prototyping the best way to cook
dinner while managing tradeoffs because you are playing out the consequence of each
decision.
As you cook dinner every night you are practicing the five skills of innovators and
entrepreneurs simultaneously. You make decisions through this unconscious process. You
are deciding what progress means for you as the cook, versus the people eating. And it all
plays a role in designing dinner. These are the skills that you need to cultivate to be a
successful innovator and entrepreneur.	
Now, let’s unpack the five skills in a more complex setting: How I wrote this book?
Applying the Five Skills to Innovation
I hired Scribe Media to help me write this book, and they have a process which they detail
for you at the start of the journey. It’s the steps involved in writing the book from the
beginning to the end, laid out in a brochure: manuscript interviews, manuscript writing,
cover design, editing, etc. Most people would look at this journey and think that the work is
the process, the steps, but that’s more of a task list telling you how you’ll get there. The
process itself tells you nothing about the experience of innovating as an author. Think of it
as macro level versus micro level. The steps are at the macro level, but the real work
happens at the micro level where the five skills become critical.
Uncovering Demand
First, they assigned me a scribe, a writer, who would take all of my ideas, knowledge and
content and put it into the book. That started with uncovering demand: the who, when,
104
where, and why, would somebody pick up this book and fit it into their lives? What are the
struggling moments people have wrapped around this book? What are the outcomes that
this book will help them achieve? And then what other books, classes, etc. might do the
same “job?”
So, we built a persona based off real people who’ve come to me over the years struggling
with innovation and wanting help—a “job” story that represented many, real struggling
moments—as part of Scribe Media’s document called the North Star.
Our “job” story started with Mary who is the head of an innovation group at her company.
She has a ton of money and a lot of responsibility and freedom to go build products, but
she’s had little success. Mary knows the mechanics of product development, she’s followed
the rules and processes from an academic perspective, but she cannot figure out the
missing ingredient. She feels like she did not do anything wrong yet is still failing.
I know from talking to people that many resonate with this experience. They keep putting
more and more money into innovation, but they are not getting any return on the
investment and they cannot figure out why. They keep expecting the process to fix their
innovation problem, but they haven’t invested in any of the skills. It’s not hard to see the
forces at play.
• Pushes: When we've been trying to do something, and it hasn't worked; when we've
gone through all the right steps, but we haven't gotten the results; when my team is
not working on the right things; when we feel like we are spinning our wheels.	
• Pulls: Help me read a book, so I can uncover the problem; so I can change the way
that we think about things; so I can modify our process and launch good
innovations; so my team can have a common language; so we can build frameworks
that take us to the next level.
105
Those real struggling moments lead people to seek help oftentimes through a consultant
like myself. And while that fixes the problem in the moment, it does not help them really
develop the skills internally that they need to be successful the next time. People end up
replicating the same behavior as opposed to understanding the underlying skills needed for
success. I wanted this book to be the “a-ha” moment: “I’ve been looking at all the wrong
things; I’ve been looking at the symptoms, but I never understood the underlying causal
reasons of what I needed to do differently.”	
Before we started talking about the book’s content, we framed demand from the buyer/
reader part of the world—the context that they are in and the outcomes that they seek. I
think of it as drilling down into that box, so that I can understand the different cases of why
readers would pick up this book. We also considered the fact that in some cases the buyer
and the reader are different people: companies to employees, professors to students. We
did not build the book and then search for an audience, rather we uncovered demand and
then built the book.	
Empathetic Perspective
As an innovator, I needed to recognize the many different perspectives involved in creating
my book: the reader, myself (the author), the scribe, the cover designer, the editor, the
project manager, promotions, Amazon, etc. Empathetic perspective is understanding the
people and things that are wrapped around my ability to produce the book.
Now, Scribe Media manages those relationships for me, but I still need to have an
empathetic perspective, particularly as it relates to the critical roles: the reader, myself, and
my scribe. My scribe and I need to be aligned to create a successful book. Don’t get me
wrong, Scribe Media has a great process for book writing, but it’s not their process that
makes it all work; it’s the interaction between myself and my scribe and how we collaborate
on the common vision for the reader that makes the difference.	
106
For instance, when I’m talking through the content, I’m recognizing that it’s new to my
scribe. For her to write it well, she needs to truly grasp the material. And so, I’m trying to
teach her, so that she can teach the reader. She’s not my assistant who’s regurgitating the
material, she’s the one who will design the reader’s experience. Because of that, I’ll usually
provide five examples where the reader may only need three, then I’m not dictating which
examples she’ll use I’m leaving that to her to make those tradeoffs. I’m not trying to
prescribe the solution; I’m giving her the latitude to pick the stories that work best and
design the experience for the reader. My dyslexia may actually be an advantage in this
situation because I know that I can’t write the book, so I leave it to the expert. But therefore,
I need an empathetic perspective toward my scribe.
To that end, on the welcome call we talked about my workload, at the time I was just
launching Demand-Side Sales 101, and we discussed my priorities, but I also wanted to
understand her situation as well: How many other books is she working on? What types of
deadlines does she have? This helps me identify tradeoffs from both of our perspectives. I
knew that I’d rather push the book out than sacrifice quality. I don’t want her to rush
writing it at the same time she’s writing another manuscript, I’d rather space our calls so
that my book lands at an ideal time for her to write.
Most people believe that it’s the process that makes something work, but really, it’s these
micro behaviors that have the biggest impact. It’s the freedom for her to do what she is
good at and me to do what I am good at. She’s not asking me to spell and I’m not asking her
to engineer something. We are sensitive to each other’s strengths and weaknesses, as well
as the kind of energy it takes to write a good book.
Causal Structures
Now that I know the customer and understand the things wrapped around my book, we
had to slow things way down, take a step back and look at the whole so we could design a
process for the reader. We had a pile of components, like a complex jigsaw puzzle, that we
107
basically dumped on the table and said, “Okay, here it is. How are we going to pull it all
together, so it’s logical for the reader?” This was all about the cause-and-effect structure of
the book.
• There was an introduction and conclusion.	
• The five skills: uncovering demand, empathetic perspective, causal structures,
prototyping to learn, and making tradeoffs.	
• My four mentors: Drs. Genichi Taguchi, Edward Deming, Willie Moore, and Clayton
Christensen.	
• The concept of young Bob versus old Bob.
• A compilation of stories.	
• Content that we needed to teach.	
Ultimately, we built a system that became the chapters of the book with the reader’s
outcomes in mind. Causal structures are the ability to see all of that and make sense of the
pieces in a way that designs a path to the outcomes you seek. It’s the notion of being able to
bucket things and then figure out how to build to get the desired outcomes. When we meet
the outcomes, we are really meeting demand. Causal structures are about getting from the
mess into a linear process. It’s about understanding how things work and how they connect
to each other. Scribe Media calls this portion the Roadmap.
Prototyping to Learn
Once we saw the whole, we needed to play with how we were going to lay it out in the book.
That’s prototyping. For instance, the five skills are so intertwined, but we needed to
separate them and develop the most logical sequence for the reader. How will each skill
build on the next? How do they help each other? How do we make sure they are modular
108
enough? What stories teach which content the best? In fact, we went back and forth a bit
about whether we should have uncovering demand or empathetic perspective first.
Then we needed to layer in my mentors in a logical, digestible manner but each of them
taught me multiple skills, so where would they go? We talked about delving into each of
them in the introduction or chapter one but that bogged down the pace too much for the
reader. We played with putting one mentor within each chapter, but they each taught me
multiple skills, plus we had five skills and four mentors. Then talked about creating an
appendix of my mentors. Ultimately, we decided that dividing up their stories would be
more interesting than the back-to-back pace the appendix would create, so we developed
chapter interludes plus included additional stories with the chapters where they naturally
fit the content. We prototyped by playing with the sequence of events.	
Making Tradeoffs
Ultimately, we had to make tradeoffs about what to include and what to leave out. And part
of that was recognizing the amount of progress a book can make versus the consulting I
traditionally do. I could see there was a gap between what I wanted to give the reader and
what was possible. You can’t fit twenty pounds of crap into a five-pound bag. I needed to
make tradeoffs: “You’re better off with a kickass half than a half-assed whole.” So, we
recognized that the book would be more about getting people started than helping
everybody become an expert. Our goal was to create a jumping off point that would take the
reader from level ten to a twenty-five, or level thirty to fifty, but we did not expect the book
to take anyone to one hundred.
Scribe Media’s process created a set of constraints that forced us to stay within those limits.
We interviewed for the introduction first, even though it’s the hardest chapter. Initially, I felt
like it would be so much easier to do it last and struggled to zero in on the “right” level of
material. It actually took us two calls to interview for that chapter, instead of the typical one
call. My scribe and I talked at length about how introductions are always the hardest part.
And she told me that they are the hardest part of the book to write as well; they always take
109
her at least twice as long as any other chapter. Why not do the introduction last, so she and
I mentally prototyped that question?
We both concluded that producing that chapter first, while hard, serves a larger purpose. It
sets the entire framework for the book, which gives you boundaries. These boundaries help
us make tradeoffs as we go through the rest of the manuscript: what’s in and what’s out.
Doing the hard work first makes everything else easier. And when you think about it,
constraints also make good economic sense because without them the book could go on
forever. The constraint shows you when you’ve gone too far.
The work of the book was also broken into parts, we interviewed from September through
December, but I knew that once those calls ended the content locked, so it forced me to
prototype in that time box. These constraints forced me to say, “Here's what I can put in and
here's where I’ve got to make a tradeoff.” And without those constraints I guarantee the
book would be no better, there would actually be more risk that it would be worse.	
How the Five Skills Make Life Better
It doesn't matter if you’re trying to make dinner, write a book, or even buy a house these
five skills are at the core of making life better. Yet they are the things that are in between
that no one seems to talk about. Most people consider this the “art” of innovation. The
reason that these skills are so elusive is precisely because they are so intertwined; they
happen so quickly that people don’t even recognize them as separate things. But when you
separate the five skills and make them explicit, they enable you to take everything to the
next level.
There’s not one skill that’s more important than another but different circumstances may
draw more on one skill than another. For instance, if you’re a salesperson, empathetic
perspective is even more important. Additionally, some of these skills build on each other:
Empathetic perspective is the thing that allows you to see demand, helps you manage
110
tradeoffs, see the causal structures, and therefore prototype to learn. If you do not have
empathetic perspective, it’s nearly impossible to master any of the other skills because they
build upon it. Causal structures are the other skill that’s critical to master before you’ll be
able to achieve success with the rest. If you're weak in empathetic perspective and causal
structures, you end up weak in the others as well. Those two are the most foundational of
the five skills.
Overall, I see these skills not just as the key to innovation and entrepreneurship but as the
foundational skills to a happy life. They help you make progress, they help you help others
make progress, which in turn makes you happy. Life is about a series of tradeoffs that you
make, not the magic of getting it all. No one has everything.

Conclusion
“I’m trying to free your mind…But I can only show you the door. You’re the one that has
to walk through it.”	
Morpheus, fictional character The Matrix
The simplest thing you can do at this point is close the book. You’re done, right? The
problem: You can’t unsee it; it’s powerful stuff. This book is the red pill of innovation and
now that you’ve consumed it, you won’t look at innovation and entrepreneurship the same.
You’re like me—prone to overthinking—I’m sorry. But I believe that the world would be
better off if more of us over-thought life. Imagine the impact on society as a whole.
Hopefully, I’ve inspired you to take the five skills to the next level. So, what next? Ask
yourself the following questions:	
• What progress do I want to make because I read this book?
• What did I hire this book to do?
I’ve categorized the reasons that people would hire this book into four “jobs” categories:
1. Help me extend myself, so I can better myself. I am a lifelong learner. Reading this
book was more of a personal quest to better myself and learn new skills. While I’m
interested, I don’t need to apply this material in an accountable way. It’s similar to a
hobby, like gardening or learning to play chess. Progress for this “job” is about
ongoing, continuous self-improvement.	
2. Help me take a deep dive into areas where I’m lacking, so that I can improve
the way I design and innovate. I’m an innovator. Reading this book opened my eyes
to my strengths and weaknesses. I can see now where I excel and where I need to
112
improve to take my innovations to the next level. There’s work that I need to do but
I’m approaching it as an individual.
3. Help me add these skills to my organization, so that my teams can successfully
innovate. I run an organization. Reading this book showed me that as an
organization we need to work on developing these skills. We have the tools and the
processes to innovate, but we are missing the ingredients in between; I can see that
we are not clicking on all cylinders.
4. Help me learn these skills, so that I can run my small business more
successfully. We are not in the business of innovation but reading this book showed
me that learning to flex these innovation muscles could help me respond better to
changing markets and help me advance my small business.
Now let’s take a deep dive into each of the four “jobs” and I’ll outline what’s next for taking
the five skills to the next level.
Job One
Jay is a lifelong learner. He's one of these people who picks up every self-improvement or
productivity book, because he’s always trying to better himself. He’s looking for that one
nugget that’s going to help him be better. He’s not trying to tell anybody about it; he’s not
reading it for anybody else. It’s about self-improvement. This book showed Jay where he
could work on strengthening his skills. What next?
I recommend Jay start by picking one of the skills, not all five at once. You need to master
each separately, before practicing them collectively. It’s like swimming: I'm going to teach
you arms, breathing, and kicking first but separately, only then are we going to pull it all
together in the pool. Once you pick a skill to practice, I want you to find an everyday
situation where you can apply it. Take cooking for example. Let’s plan a meal and zero in on
the skill that needs honing.
113
• Uncovering Demand: What do the people eating your meal like? What does
progress look like for the people you are cooking for?
• Empathetic Perspective: Look at the entire journey of planning a week’s worth of
dinners. What are the many different perspectives wrapped around meal planning?
Think of every stage from grocery shopping and food storage, to cooking, clean up
and putting the dishes away.
• Causal Structures: You could go in multiple different directions here, but I suggest
thinking about how the cooking works. Remember the pound cake story? If you’re
making Chicken Parmesan, where did the ingredients come from? What are the key
ingredients? What are twenty different recipes for Chicken Parmesan? How do you
understand the key steps in the process?
• Prototyping to Learn: How can you modify or change someone’s recipe to fit the
demand? For example, you might be able to cook it slower. What variables can you
play with that enable you to understand, not only how it works, but ways in which
you could drive demand higher?
• Making Tradeoffs: As you frame it, be very explicit about what you will and won’t
do. For example, the situation when you’re going to cook it: “I’m not going to cook
this Tuesday night; I’m not going to cook this when the kids have after school
sports.” Identify the tradeoffs and understand how to make the best set of decisions
so that you can be successful. It’s the notion that you can’t do it all.
You don’t have to apply this to cooking. You could apply it to planning a vacation, buying a
car, volunteering at church, etc. The key is to practice the skills one at a time in an everyday
scenario and learn how to take it to the next level.
Job Two
114
Justin is an innovator or entrepreneur. He’s been building products for a while, but he
recognizes that he’s not perfect. He reads books to help him round out his perspective and
grow individually, so that he can build better products. While reading this book he has
identified two of the five skills where he feels he needs to better himself. What next?	
I recommend that Justin start with a post-mortem. A post-mortem is a way in which to look
back at a recent innovation and conduct somewhat of a JTBD interview where you unpack
what happened and why it happened. I do this exact thing when consulting, here’s how I
walk people through the process:
• Warmup: What was the best part of the project? What was the worst part of the
project?	
• Timeline: Draw the project in pictures, no words from start to finish. What was the
sequence of events? What dominoes fell along the way? This is about getting you to
remember what happened.
• Label Events: Then I have them go through the drawn timeline and place letters (F,
W, H, U, R, P) that indicated their feelings in each stage. Where were you frustrated
(F)? Where did the road wash out (W)? Where did you get help (H)? Where were you
unsure (U)? Where did you resent an action that you took (R)? Where did you get
pushed onto a path that you didn’t want to take (P)? You’re trying to overlay the
emotional and social aspects of the project.	
• Talk: Now it’s time to discuss the drawing. And ultimately the goal is to be able to
understand what you learned. If you could go back and take the red pill of
innovation before this project, what would you do differently that would have the
greatest impact? What actions would you start, stop, or continue?
By looking backwards in this way, you can then project forward to the next project and
know where and when you need to apply the five skills, not just how to do the skill. Now,
115
look forward two or three weeks, how can you inject these skills into your current project? I
call this reflective learning. If you only look forward, you’re likely to continue to strengthen
the skills that you’re already good at, rather than work on your weaknesses.
Job Three
Susan’s a leader who runs a company or a department and has a team that she’s
responsible for. She may have started reading the book with “Job One” or “Job Two” in mind
but after its conclusion she realizes that she needs to build these skills within her team.
They excel with processes and tools, but she can see some of the gaps in the five skills. What
next?	
In this scenario, I recommend starting with a Learning to Build book club for the crossfunctional team. Then, once everyone understands the five skills, I’d do a post-mortem as
descried in “Job Two” for your most recent innovation. What skills are you the weakest in?
Where do you excel? Now prioritize the weak skills for overall improvement. To start,
assign one person to the job of mastering each of the skills where you are weak. For
example, it’s somebody’s job to do a deep dive into prototyping to learn and someone else’s
job to investigate empathetic perspective. Then once a week carve out two to three hours of
project time to discuss how the team will apply the skills to the timeline for the current
project.	
Job Four
Ashley is running a small business, say an accounting organization that's been around for
twenty years. They've been doing their tasks the same way forever. After reading this book,
she realizes that they’ve been reacting to changes rather than being proactive. She realizes
that they need to innovate but they don't have any of the skills. She wants to use the book to
introduce everyone to some new ideas, so that they can figure out how to evolve better.
116
I recommend that they first take a deep dive on uncovering demand. There are two good
signs to look for when identifying a struggling moment:
1. Non-consumption: Where do people want to make progress, but they can't. You see
this where people keep complaining but don’t act. They want to do something, they
want to reach for something, but they either don't feel they can, or they don't feel
that it's possible. For example, nobody spends time finding a better bank because
they think they are all the same. Find the places where people are complacent, so
they’re just accepting inferiority.	
2. Work arounds: Figure out where people are doing work arounds? For example, “I
export this, I put that here, then I do this…” They have five extra steps for getting
something done that should be possible to streamline. Those are struggling
moments. Where are the workarounds in your business?
Once you’ve uncovered demand through identifying the struggling moments, either
internally or externally, start applying the five skills of innovators and entrepreneurs to two
of the struggles.	
• Empathetic Perspective: What are the different perspectives wrapped around that
struggling moment?
• Causal Structures: What’s the cause-and-effect relationship behind the struggling
moment? What’s not happening? Or what’s happening that should not be
happening?	
• Prototyping to Learn: How can I play with the system to help people make
progress?
• Managing Tradeoffs: What are the tradeoffs that I can make to improve the
struggling moment?
117
Last Thoughts…
“The only metrics that will truly matter to my life are the individuals whom I have been
able to help, one by one, to become better people.”	
Clayton Christensen, How Will You Measure Your Life	
Innovation and entrepreneurship are entirely about helping people make progress. That’s
the purpose of this book—to pass forward the lessons taught to me by giants in innovation
and entrepreneurship, so that you can make progress and in turn help others.
I recognize that this book may cause you to have more questions than answers; it’s a
jumping off point for digging deeper. Are you ready? It’s not going to be easy, but it’ll be
worth it. Once you pull together the fundamental pieces, it will spin you up in a way that
allows you to see the world nobody else can see—The Matrix. You will swallow the red pill
of innovation and become more choiceful and thoughtful, and in turn, you will have the
power to change the world.	
Now, go make progress! Learn to build!
