## Core Concept: The Wind and the Trees

For 500 years, the Japanese believed trees caused the wind. Needing wind for fishing, they prohibited cutting trees. Only when they understood that wind caused trees to move could they make progress.

**This is correlation versus causation.** The wind and trees moving together is correlative, but which comes first—the cause—is way more important.

Causal structures are the notion of cause and effect. People skilled at this have no magic or telepathy, but a framework for seeing how dominoes fall: "When this and that happen, here's the effect..."

## Mental Model: Seeing the Dominoes

**Traditional Thinking:** Focus on what happened (the effect)

**Causal Thinking:** Understand what causes things to happen (the cause)

### The Icon of Causality
If causal structures had an icon, it would be **dominoes falling**. What dominoes must fall before people say "Today's the day..."? Innovators skilled at causal structures:
- Don't panic in uncertain times
- See what others can't
- Predict how events will unfold (not when, but how)
- Make confident decisions

## Predicting Through Causal Mechanisms

### The COVID-19 Case Study

Understanding how people respond to major uncertainty (Gulf War, 9/11), Bob predicted COVID responses:

1. **Businesses hunker down**: "This will be over in 3 months"
2. **Missing the details**: When lockdown ends, people won't return to normal due to anxiety
3. **Restaurant capacity**: Even without restrictions, need 50% capacity or people leave
4. **Remote work revelation**: Forced remote work proves people can be trusted
5. **New normal emerges**: 5-day office weeks become obsolete
6. **Business rises/falls**: Screen-sharing kills printing; green screens, cameras surge

**Key Insight**: Companies focus on effects (people buying green screens) not causes (why they need them in struggling moments).

## The Spousal Discount Phenomenon

When Julie dressed up, Bob's compliment barely registered. Friend John's identical compliment made her beam.

**The Causal Structure**: When you get familiar with people, they discount your responses because they know what you're going to say.

**Applications**:
- Why outside consultants get heard saying same things as employees
- Why kids listen to family friends over parents
- How to use this structure to your advantage

## Using Frameworks to Unpack Cause and Effect

> "I would not give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity, but I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity."
> — Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.

### The Problem Without Frameworks

Without mechanisms to sort through complexity, people:
- Pick up on wrong things
- Can't see causality
- Focus on effects, not causes
- Use vague language

### Core Frameworks for Causality

1. **Four Forces of Progress** - Answers who, what, when, where, why
2. **Timeline** - Shows space between things, reveals how and how much

These frameworks reveal systems with inputs/outputs and methods for sorting data.

## SNHU Case Study: Applying Causal Frameworks

Southern New Hampshire University grew from 500 to 130,000 online students in 10 years by understanding causality.

### Forces Analysis

**Push of Situation**:
- Over 30, working day jobs
- Supporting families
- Want careers, not just jobs
- Internally motivated to change station

**Pull of New Solution**:
- Possibility of education while working
- Envisioning diploma and pride
- Better life for family

**Anxiety Barriers**:
- Complex application process
- Can't find transcripts
- Not coming from high school system

**Habit of Present**:
- Already busy with families and jobs
- Adding responsibility intimidating

### Timeline Interventions

1. **First Thought**: Emotional ad campaign showing journey, not features
2. **Passive Looking**: Competition was "nothing" - do this or nothing
3. **Active Looking**: Interview-first admissions, school gathers documents
4. **Deciding**: Speed up processing from months to days
5. **Onboarding**: 7-day turnaround maintains momentum
6. **Ongoing Use**: Academic advisors become life coaches, cut dropout 90%

**Result**: $100M to $1B+ university through causal understanding.

## The Disruption Theory Framework

Clay Christensen's framework for causal mechanisms revealed how markets evolve through predictable patterns.

### The US Steel Story

At one point, US Steel dominated the steel market, manufacturing products ranging from low-end rebar at roughly $10 per pound to high-end specialty steel running up to $100,000 per pound. They made all their revenue on the high-end of the market.

Then along came Nucor with an innovative method: melting old scrap metal to produce rebar at much cheaper costs. US Steel was more than happy to let the rebar business go—after all, they made no revenue off it. At the time, it seemed like a win-win.

**The Predictable Pattern**:
1. Nucor's low overhead and innovative technology generated huge returns on rebar
2. As they succeeded, they crept upmarket, taking more of US Steel's business
3. Over 8 years, Nucor ate away at 80% of US Steel's revenue
4. US Steel became boxed into high-end corner of market
5. Eventually forced to declare bankruptcy

**Clay's Consulting Approach**: When companies came to Clay struggling to grow markets, he'd tell the US Steel story and ask: "Are you US Steel? Have you boxed yourself into the upper corner in a way that makes you vulnerable to disruption? Do you need to reinvent yourself and figure out how to be in the low-end?"

**The Counter-Intuitive Insight**: "No accountant or finance expert will tell you to build products with smaller margins but if you understand the causal mechanisms of disruption, you realize that if you don't your business will die."

### Clay Christensen: The Theory Builder

Bob met Clay last among his four mentors, finding him just as Clay began his first year teaching at Harvard. At 42, a father of five who'd just earned his PhD, Clay stood 6'10" tall—a gentle giant whose hand made Bob's disappear when they shook.

**Their Dynamic**: Clay loved talking to people unafraid to ask questions. Bob was endlessly curious. They were a perfect match, meeting quarterly for 4-hour uninterrupted learning sessions that spanned 27 years.

**The Complementary Relationship**:
- Clay: Academic passionate about building better management theory
- Bob: Engineer-practitioner who learned by building
- Clay: Theory builder
- Bob: Ear to the ground, finding businesses and people for research

**Clay's Childlike Quality**: Would sit cross-legged on his desk "like a giant five-year-old," seeing Bob as a breath of fresh air in the stuffy academic world. "Oh good, Bob's here to play," he'd say.

**Their Greatest Collaboration**: Over 14 months, they architected Jobs to Be Done theory together—Clay as theory builder, Bob as practitioner. Clay brought it to life for the world through "Competing Against Luck," turning concepts Bob struggled to explain into something people could understand and adopt.

**Clay's Teaching**: Helped Bob take the foundation from Taguchi, Deming, and Moore and think more broadly—apply theory to practice. "I'm an engineer; I just build things. Until that point, I didn't quite grasp the notion of theory."

## Mental Model: Effect-Only Thinking

### The Trust Example

Meeting: "We need to build trust with customers"

**The Problem**: Trust is an outcome (effect), not actionable.

**Unpacking Process**:
1. "What's trust?"
2. "How do we know if someone trusts us?"
3. "How do you trust a salesperson?" → "I don't"
4. "Then how do you buy?" → "I vet people"
5. "What do you do to vet?"

**Result**: To build trust do X, to earn trust do Y. Now you have causality.

### Education System Example

**Effect-Only Approach**:
- Push material and test
- No context creating pull for learning
- Same content for everyone
- Focus on teaching process, not learning process

**What's Missing**:
- How is math applicable to life?
- What causes students to learn?
- Understanding different perspectives
- Connecting dots between all stakeholders

## Causal Structures vs. Categorical Models

**Categorical Models** (Myers-Briggs, Generational Labels):
- Remove causation
- Don't account for context
- Label people statically
- Describe but don't predict

**Causal Structures**:
- Context determines behavior
- Situations dictate responses
- Dynamic, not static
- Predict based on circumstances

## Creating New Frameworks Through Anomalies

Anomalies aren't failures—they're opportunities to build better models:

1. Design using believed causal structures
2. When it doesn't work as expected, ask "What am I missing?"
3. Anomalies add to field of view
4. Successful innovators study anomalies with great interest
5. Recognize patterns others miss

## Navigating Change with Causal Thinking

### From Static to Dynamic Worldview

**Static View**: Absolute truths, unchanging states

**Dynamic View**: Everything evolves over time
- Male (static) but kid→student→engineer→husband→father (dynamic)
- Innovation must be viewed through time
- Change is guaranteed

**Skilled Innovators**:
- Comfortable in messy middle
- Operate conceptually
- Don't worry about right/wrong
- Make decisions from empathetic perspective
- Apply frameworks to make progress

## Decision Framework

When applying causal structures:

1. **Identify the effect** people talk about
2. **Ask what causes it** - unpack vague language
3. **Look for dominoes** - what must happen first?
4. **Apply frameworks** - forces and timeline
5. **Study anomalies** - what doesn't fit?
6. **Think dynamically** - how will this evolve?

## Applications

### Business Strategy
- Don't abandon low-margin products (disruption vulnerability)
- Understand why customers buy, not what they buy
- Design processes around causes, not effects
- Use anomalies to build better models

### Product Development
- Focus on struggling moments creating demand
- Address anxiety barriers, not just benefits
- Speed up decision timelines
- Convert features to progress enablers

### Organizational Design
- Build systems assuming people try their best
- Bad systems crush good people
- Enable meaningful work
- Measure outcomes, not just outputs

### Personal Development
- Study how things change over time
- Build frameworks for navigating uncertainty
- Use familiar relationships strategically
- See patterns others miss

## Key Insights

1. **Correlation isn't causation** - Moving together doesn't mean one causes the other

2. **Frameworks enable sight** - Without them, you pick up wrong signals

3. **Anomalies teach** - What doesn't fit shows what you don't know

4. **Effects distract from causes** - Focus upstream for real understanding

5. **Context determines behavior** - People aren't categories, they're responding to situations

6. **Change is the only constant** - Dynamic thinking beats static truth

## Deming's Teaching Legacy

Bob first met Deming at a random function before his 1985 internship. Sitting next to this older gentleman, Bob asked "fifty-two questions in twenty minutes." At conversation's end, Deming said: "You're a curious kid, what are you doing this summer?" That's how Bob got the internship at the car manufacturer—Deming was a consultant there.

**Deming's Teaching Style**:
- Big proponent of case studies
- Believed in hands-on learning over theory
- Always about application vs. abstraction
- At 85 and hard of hearing, he screamed everything
- Bob initially thought Deming was yelling at him for doing things wrong

**His Core Framework - SIPOC**:
- **S**upplier
- **I**nput  
- **P**rocess
- **O**utput
- **C**onsequences (outcomes for customer)

**Key Distinction**: "There's a difference between the output of something—the metric which you measure—and the outcome—the desired result." Example: Michelle's Peloton output = time/effort riding; outcome = fitting into clothes.

**Deming's Philosophy**:
- All problems are system problems, not people problems
- "A bad system can crush a good person every time"
- People are always trying to do their best
- Management's job: build environment where people love their work
- Motivated by helping people have fulfilled, meaningful lives

**Ahead of His Time**: "Even for today. We don't teach management anymore. People talk about leadership, but not daily management: How to hold people accountable? How to shape work so people do meaningful things?"

**The Gas Tank Arrow Story**: Traveling together, Bob would forget which side of rental cars had the gas tank. Deming: "This is a quality problem. We need to solve this." Put Bob to work adding the little arrow to dashboards—practical solutions to everyday problems.

**His Character**:
- Animal: Badger—factual, tenacious, stayed low to ground with workers
- Would hate being toll booth attendant—too repetitive, would automate it
- Fought against "the church of finance"
- Empowered workers over profits

Deming's legacy: seeing systems clearly and believing people want to do good work if the system allows it.
