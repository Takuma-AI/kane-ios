## Core Concept: Jobs to Be Done

> "What people in business think they know about the customer and the market is likely to be more wrong than right…the customer rarely buys what the business thinks it sells."

What's the difference between a Snickers and a Milky Way? On the surface these two products seem similar. They're both candy bars made in the same plant with chocolatey ingredients and sit side-by-side in the candy aisle. When viewed from the supply-side they seem to compete with one another. So why would someone buy a Snickers versus a Milky Way?

**The Context Discovery**: The who, what, when, where and why—the context in which people buy—is completely different.

**Snickers**: 
- **When**: Hungry, running out of energy, short on time
- **Why**: Need a boost
- **How it works**: Feels like food—nougat, caramel, and peanuts form a ball, it's hard
- **Physical response**: As it hits your stomach, growling and hunger pangs stop
- **Where found**: Almost any Silicon Valley startup vending machine—usually gone first
- **Competes with**: Cup of coffee, Red Bull, or a sandwich

**Milky Way**:
- **When**: After an emotional event, good or bad
- **Why**: Need comfort or reward
- **How it works**: Slides down throat, coating mouth with chocolate and endorphins
- **Experience**: Takes 20 minutes to eat, you savor it
- **Context**: Usually eaten alone
- **Competes with**: Ice cream, brownies, glass of wine

**The Game-Changing Commercial**: Once Snickers uncovered the demand, they launched an ad speaking directly to the struggling moment. Young men playing football with Betty White, who's struggling. Someone hands her a Snickers, she transforms back into one of the young men. "You're not YOU when you're hungry. Snickers satisfies!"

**Result**: Snickers became the bestselling candy bar in its category with over $4 billion in sales—not by making a better candy bar, but by understanding the job customers hired it to do.

## The Problem with Supply-Side Only Thinking

### The Camera Industry Collapse

In 2010, Canon, Nikon, and Sony websites showcased dozens of cameras with technical specs—megapixels, flutter speed, image processing. They forced customers to learn their language and navigate complex choices.

Apple walked in with a simple camera attached to a phone: point and click. No jargon, always with you, software included.

**Result**: Camera sales plummeted from 121 million units (2010) to 19 million (2018), while demand for taking pictures skyrocketed with social media.

**The Fatal Flaw**: "Canon, Nikon, and Sony were so focused on competing—the supply-side—that they just kept adding more and more capabilities making their product more complicated."

## Mental Model: Supply vs. Demand Perspectives

**Supply-Side Thinking:**
- How do I make it?
- How do I position it?
- How profitable is it?
- Customer is an aggregated demographic
- Focused on competitive sets
- Product features and benefits

**Demand-Side Thinking:**
- What progress are people trying to make?
- What's their struggling moment?
- How does it fit into their life?
- Customer has unique context
- Focused on candidate sets ("I can do this, or that")
- Progress and outcomes

**Key Insight**: "Demand is caused by a struggling moment and the thought, 'Maybe I can do better…' Without the struggling moment there is no demand."

## The Three Sources of Energy (Motivations)

Every purchase is driven by three types of motivation that create the energy for change:

### 1. Functional Motivation
How cumbersome is the process—time, effort, speed?
- Mechanical aspects: steps, complexity, accessibility
- Example: Peloton's easy purchase process and included setup

### 2. Emotional Motivation
What internal thoughts drive the purchase—fears, frustrations, desires?
- Personal insecurities and aspirations
- Example: Michelle's weight concerns, missing "me time," longing to feel addicted to exercise again

### 3. Social Motivation
How do others perceive, respect, or acknowledge me?
- External validation and relationships
- Example: Getting spouse buy-in, desire for community support in live classes

**Goal**: Reduce negative motivations (anxiety barriers) while amplifying positive motivations (creating pull).

## The Four Forces of Progress

Whether people move from their current state to a new solution depends on four forces:

### 1. Push of the Situation
The struggling moments pushing toward change:
- Gym closed due to Covid
- Feeling older, not keeping up physically
- Clothes not fitting
- Can no longer run for exercise

### 2. Magnetism of New Solution
The pull toward a better future:
- Friends raving about being "addicted" to Peloton
- "Quick 20-minute workout between meetings"
- Imagining feeling and looking younger

### 3. Anxiety of New Solution
Fears holding people back:
- Will spouse agree?
- How to justify $3,000 cost?
- Where to put it in 800 sq ft apartment?

### 4. Habit of the Present
The inertia of current solutions:
- Gym will eventually reopen
- Will I regret not waiting?
- Will I love biking like I loved running?

**Critical Formula**: Push + Pull must be > Anxiety + Habit for change to occur

**Key Insight**: "My experience has taught me that the money is made on the anxiety side of the equation."

## The Timeline for Progress

People move through six predictable stages when making progress:

### 1. First Thought
Creating space in the brain for change
- "I'm not fitting into my clothes"
- "I can't keep up physically"
- Without this, no demand exists

### 2. Passive Looking
Learning and noticing what you ignored before
- Seeing friends' Instagram posts about Peloton
- Remembering the feeling of being addicted to exercise
- Can last years without triggering event

> "Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven't asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go."
> — Clay Christensen

### 3. Active Looking
Planning, spending time and money on solutions
- Visiting Peloton website
- Understanding features and costs
- Connecting dots to frame future tradeoffs

### 4. Deciding
Making tradeoffs and establishing value
- Moving trunk to fit Peloton
- Using cancelled $2,000 vacation to justify cost
- No ideal solution—every customer makes tradeoffs

### 5. Onboarding
First use measuring against expectations
- Comparing to previous solutions (TRX)
- Judging if promises are met
- Expectations now "poured in concrete"

### 6. Ongoing Use
Daily habit and progress measurement
- Does she get addicted?
- Do clothes fit better?
- Can she keep up on hikes?

## Mental Model: Context-Dependent Value

**Traditional Thinking**: Value is inherent in product features and benefits

**JTBD Thinking**: Value is a function of context, outcome, progress, and effort

### The Steak vs. Pizza Framework

**Steak Situation**: 
- Rough week needing reward
- Special occasion celebration
- Cooking becomes an event
- Guests and special preparation

**Pizza Situation**:
- Four kids to feed
- Soccer practice to attend
- Homework to supervise
- Speed and convenience critical

**Key Insight**: "If you take the pizza and put it in the steak situation, the value changes."

### Understanding Customer's Value Code

- Value isn't a feature—it's a tradeoff based on context
- Can't understand tradeoffs without knowing value code
- Pizza context = won't pay much more for "better"
- Steak context = willing to pay premium

## Uncovering Demand in Practice

### What It's NOT:
- Asking about product features
- Going deeper into product benefits
- Hearing "easy to use" or "love the interface"

### What It IS:
- Going into customers' lives
- Uncovering struggling moments
- Understanding desired progress
- Learning who, what, when, where, and why

### Key Interview Techniques:
1. Have customers tell the story of "how they got here"
2. Understand what dominoes had to fall
3. Probe for forces of progress
4. Map the timeline of events
5. Uncover the job they hired your product to do

## Decision Framework

When uncovering demand, ask:
1. What struggling moment creates the need?
2. What progress is the customer trying to make?
3. What forces are at play (push, pull, anxiety, habit)?
4. Where is the customer on the progress timeline?
5. What's their value code in this context?
6. What tradeoffs are they willing to make?

## Applications

### Product Development
- Stop adding features for feature's sake
- Design for struggling moments, not demographics
- Address anxieties, not just benefits
- Understand competitive alternatives (not just competitors)

### Marketing & Sales
- Speak to specific struggling moments
- Show the progress people can make
- Address anxieties explicitly
- Use language from customer's world, not yours

### Business Strategy
- Both supply and demand perspectives needed
- Demand-side often missing in organizations
- Success comes from managing both sides
- Value defined by customer progress, not company profit

## Key Insights

1. **Products don't have jobs, people do** - Understand the progress people are trying to make

2. **Context determines value** - Same product has different value in different situations

3. **Anxieties kill more sales than features win** - Address what holds people back

4. **Progress happens over time** - Respect the six-stage journey

5. **Struggling moments create demand** - No struggle, no demand
