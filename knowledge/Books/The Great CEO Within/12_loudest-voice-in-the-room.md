## The Core Philosophy

*(This chapter was inspired by a conversation with Anthony Ghosn, CEO of Shogun.)*

"Whenever you choose to use Method 3 to get full buy-in, know that, as CEO, your voice will be the 'loudest in the room'. In order to get full buy-in, you will have to elicit people's truest thoughts."

This chapter addresses a critical but often invisible dynamic: how the CEO's position inherently distorts group decision-making, and specific techniques to counteract this effect.

## The Invisible Distortion

### The Authority Bias

Once people hear your perspective as CEO, some percentage will naturally alter their own views to more closely match yours. **This percentage is much higher than you might imagine.**

### Why This Happens

People assume that as CEO you have:
- More information than they do
- Better judgment from experience
- A more complete picture

Therefore, they conclude your perspective is probably more correct.

### The Hidden Cost

Later, these same people will not feel fully bought-in to the outcome, because **internally they will know that their true thought was not actually heard**.

This creates:
- Passive resistance to implementation
- Lack of ownership over decisions
- Reduced creativity in execution
- Eventual resentment

## The Solution: Don't Tip Your Hand

### The Core Principle

"In order to get the full benefit of your team's knowledge and to make sure that they get to full buy-in, be careful not to 'tip your hand' before all others have shared theirs."

### Two Effective Methods

#### 1. Written Votes/Thoughts
Have people write down their vote or thoughts **prior to you sharing your perspective**.

Benefits:
- Captures authentic thinking
- Creates permanent record
- Allows simultaneous sharing
- Prevents real-time influence

#### 2. Simultaneous Physical Voting
Have everyone give a simultaneous thumbs-up/thumbs down vote.

Benefits:
- Immediate and visceral
- No time for adjustment
- Clear binary decisions
- Visible to all at once

## Historical Precedent: The Cuban Missile Crisis

### The 13 Days Example

CJ Reim of Amity Ventures points to Robert F. Kennedy's "13 Days" about the Cuban Missile Crisis as an excellent example of this phenomenon and its solution.

During the crisis, President Kennedy would:
- Deliberately absent himself from initial discussions
- Allow advisors to debate freely without his presence
- Only join after positions were formed
- Prevent his authority from skewing deliberation

This approach allowed for:
- More creative solutions
- Honest assessment of options
- True buy-in from advisors
- Better final decisions

## The Amazon Innovation

### Junior Voices First

From Peter Reinhardt, CEO and co-founder of Segment: "Apparently at Amazon they require the most junior people to speak and ask questions first."

### Multiple Benefits

This practice:
- **Prevents cascade effect** - Senior opinions don't influence juniors
- **Shows off junior talent** - Gives visibility to rising stars
- **Provides feedback opportunity** - Seniors observe and coach
- **Surfaces fresh perspectives** - Unfiltered by organizational orthodoxy
- **Builds confidence** - Juniors learn their voice matters

## Implementation Strategies

### For Regular Meetings

1. **Establish speaking order** - Junior to senior
2. **Use written proposals** - Everyone reads before discussing
3. **CEO speaks last** - After all perspectives shared
4. **Document all positions** - Before revealing your view

### For Major Decisions

1. **Absent yourself** from initial discussions
2. **Appoint a facilitator** to gather perspectives
3. **Review written summaries** of all positions
4. **Join only for final deliberation**

### For Quick Decisions

1. **Ask for simultaneous votes** before sharing view
2. **Use anonymous polling tools** for sensitive topics
3. **Explicitly ask for dissent** before revealing position
4. **Celebrate contrarian thinking** when it emerges

## The Cultural Shift

### From Authority-Based to Idea-Based

Moving from:
- "What does the CEO think?"
- "How can I align with leadership?"
- "What answer do they want?"

To:
- "What do I actually think?"
- "What does the data suggest?"
- "What's best for the company?"

### Creating Psychological Safety

The CEO must:
- **Explicitly invite dissent**
- **Reward challenging ideas**
- **Admit uncertainty frequently**
- **Change mind publicly when convinced**
- **Thank people for disagreement**

## Common Mistakes

### Speaking Too Early
Even casual comments can anchor the discussion before it begins.

### Subtle Signals
Body language, facial expressions, and tone can reveal preferences without words.

### Asking Leading Questions
"Don't you think we should..." immediately reveals your position.

### False Democracy
Going through the motions but having already decided undermines trust.

## Advanced Techniques

### The Devil's Advocate
Assign someone to argue against your known position to surface counterarguments.

### The Red Team
Create a group specifically tasked with finding flaws in the prevailing wisdom.

### The Silent Start
Begin meetings with 5 minutes of silent written reflection before any discussion.

### The Rotation System
Rotate who presents issues to prevent presenter bias.

## Measuring Success

### Indicators You're Succeeding

1. **Genuine surprises** in team positions
2. **Healthy debate** before consensus
3. **Team members changing minds** based on discussion
4. **Your own mind changing** from team input
5. **Strong execution** after decisions

### Warning Signs

1. **Too much immediate agreement**
2. **Silence when asking for other views**
3. **Private concerns shared later**
4. **Weak implementation energy**
5. **"I knew that wouldn't work" comments**

## The Leadership Paradox

### The Challenge

The more successful you become as CEO:
- The louder your voice becomes
- The more people defer to you
- The harder it is to get truth

### The Discipline Required

This requires constant vigilance:
- **Active humility** about your ideas
- **Genuine curiosity** about others' thinking
- **Patience** to wait for authentic input
- **Courage** to be influenced
- **Wisdom** to know when to decide

## Integration with Other Practices

### With Decision-Making (Chapter 11)
- Written proposals reduce voice influence
- RAPID framework clarifies decision rights
- Method 3 buy-in requires careful facilitation

### With Transparency (Chapter 14)
- Open information reduces information asymmetry
- Shared context enables better input
- Clear process builds trust

### With Conflict Resolution (Chapter 15)
- Power dynamics affect conflict expression
- Junior members need safe channels
- Authority can suppress honest feedback

## Decision Framework

When facilitating group decisions:
1. **Have I revealed my position?** (Don't)
2. **Who should speak first?** (Most junior)
3. **How can I capture authentic thoughts?** (Writing/voting)
4. **When should I enter the discussion?** (Last)
5. **How will I signal openness to influence?** (Explicitly)

## Key Insights

- **CEO authority unconsciously distorts every group discussion**
- **People change their authentic views to match perceived CEO preference**
- **This undermines both decision quality and buy-in**
- **Speaking order mattersâ€”juniors first prevents cascade effects**
- **Written capture and simultaneous voting preserve authentic thinking**
- **The most powerful CEOs deliberately constrain their own influence**
