## The Core Philosophy

"Culture is the unspoken set of rules that people in a group follow when interacting with each other. You act differently when you're in a bar than when you're at a family dinner. That's because the rules that run the interactions between the different nodes in the networks have changed. Culture is the name for those rules."

This chapter provides a comprehensive framework for intentionally building and maintaining company culture through values, fun, celebration, and practical policies.

## Values: The Foundation of Culture

*By Alex MacCaw*

### The Critical Role of Values

"Values are a critical element in your company's culture, and your company will function at its most efficient if your employees understand and share them."

Values enable:
- **Autonomous decision-making**: Team members can decide without you
- **Culture fit evaluation**: Clear criteria for hiring
- **Values dissemination**: New hires learn from established culture
- **Consistent behavior**: Predictable interactions across the organization

### The Values Reality Check

"One misnomer CEOs sometimes have is thinking they get to choose the values. By the time you're 30 or so employees your company has a set of values whether you like it or not. It's now your job to codify what's already there."

Key insights:
- Values already exist in behavior
- Your job is recognition, not creation
- Changing values takes enormous work
- Authenticity matters more than aspiration

### The Values Discovery Process

"Agreeing on what your values are is the kind of statement that needs maximum buy-in, so it should involve your whole company."

**The systematic approach**:
1. **Send out a survey** to gather contributions from everyone
2. **Ask for both**:
   - A value
   - The name of an employee who exemplifies it
3. **Arrange suggestions** into common themes
4. **Leadership team votes** on the final cut

### Living the Values

"Once you have agreed upon your values, use them to guide your hiring and firing. Bring in people who want to live by these principles and let go of people who don't. Otherwise, your values will have no meaning."

**Implementation imperatives**:
- **Distribute** your values
- **Print them out**
- **Repeat them** until your team knows them back-to-front
- **Weekly highlight**: At all-hands, highlight a value and person exemplifying it

### Clearbit's Values Example

The following demonstrate effective values - combining memorable statements with clear descriptions:

1. **Care (Give a shit)**: Empathize with customers. Take the time to understand their frustrations, needs, and desires.

2. **Craft (Master it)**: Own your craft. Never stop learning and improving.

3. **Team (Work together)**: Teamwork makes the dream work. Fill gaps. There's no such thing as "it's not my job."

4. **Truth (Say it)**: Be upfront and candid. Say it like it is. Hold yourself and others accountable.

5. **Initiative (Be resourceful)**: Don't wait for permission. Figure it out — or figure out who can.

6. **Fun (Have it)**: Don't take yourself too seriously — life is short.

## Fun: The Performance Multiplier

### The Business Case for Fun

"When creating company culture, do not underestimate the value of fun. If people are having fun, they spend more time, energy, and awareness at the company. This leads to better problem-solving and collaboration, which leads to a stronger company that creates more value."

The fun cascade:
1. People have fun
2. They spend more time at work
3. Energy and awareness increase
4. Problem-solving improves
5. Collaboration strengthens
6. Company creates more value

### Creating Fun Authentically

"Host events that you enjoy, and then invite (but don't require) your teammates to join you."

Key principles:
- Start with what you genuinely enjoy
- Make participation optional
- Variety accommodates different preferences
- Consistency builds anticipation

### The Litmus Test

"Your litmus test is whether your teammates are hanging out with you and each other outside of work."
- **If yes**: You are likely creating good culture
- **If not**: Increase efforts in Conscious Leadership and values buy-in

### MacCaw's Favorite Company Activities

1. **Boozy Fridays**: Take the team out for lunch at a local restaurant
2. **Suggested lunch times**: With calendar event for coordination
3. **International offsites**: Really awesome locations (e.g., Tulum)
4. **Team sports**: Dodgeball & soccer
5. **Movie theater rentals**: Morning screenings are almost always available

## Celebration: Acknowledging Progress

### The Celebration Gap

"Most companies are so focused on improving that they forget to celebrate. But celebration, like fun, is a key to building positive morale."

### Redefining Celebration

"Celebration doesn't mean lavish drunken parties. Quite the opposite. Celebration means taking a moment to appreciate the good that the company has achieved, as well as the good that departments, teams and individuals have achieved."

### Systematic Celebration

**To celebrate effectively**:

1. **Publicly acknowledge** achievements at All Hands and team meetings
2. **Remember overlooked teams** on the core product
3. **Create a rotation** - Don't need to celebrate every team at every meeting
4. **Demo meetings** - Teams show off recent creations
   - Not required attendance
   - Over meals (lunch) or drinks (Friday afternoon)

## Working Hours: Output Over Input

### The Hours Question

"The question of working hours is inevitable in every company. Should you enforce specific starting and ending times? Total number of hours?"

### The Key Insight

"Remember, the key metric is output, not hours."

The problem with enforced hours:
- People put in required time
- Without effort or enthusiasm
- Little progress is made

### The Motivation Solution

"The key is to inspire and motivate your team so that long, hard-working hours are not an imposition, but a choice."

When properly motivated through:
- Clear goals and tracking
- Open feedback loops
- Fun culture
- People naturally work hard

### Results-Based Flexibility

"If your team are hitting their individual goals and OKRs, ask yourself does enforcing set times in the office really matter, or are you just enforcing them for appearance sake?"

This applies to:
- Office hours
- Work from home
- Location flexibility

### Leadership by Example

"Remember to always lead by example. Be the first one to show up each day. Be the last one to leave."

Extension to leadership:
- Department heads set example for departments
- Don't hire leaders unwilling to do this
- Model the behavior you want

### Core Collaboration Hours

"Whatever your teams' working hours end up being, make sure there is a core period of the day when everybody shows up in the office so that collaboration can occur. Set a regular meeting (a short stand-up) in the morning at the beginning of this core set of hours."

## Meals: Building Bonds

### The Hidden Value of Shared Meals

"Offering meals is a particularly positive benefit. It allows team members to bond organically and with a wide range of people."

### The Subgroup Problem

"Having people go out to get their own food usually causes them to stick with the same small subgroup each day."

Shared meals solve this by:
- Creating mixing opportunities
- Breaking down silos
- Fostering unexpected connections

### Meal Benefits Beyond Food

**Lunch**: Creates a more bonded overall team
**Breakfast and dinner**: Allows people to easefully extend their work day

### The Pre-Tax Calculus

"The pre-tax calculus is that meals are a commodity. If you provide the meals company-wide, then you can deduct the expense as a business expense. If you do not, your teammates must use post-tax dollars to buy those meals."

Financial efficiency:
- Company: Tax-deductible expense
- Employees: Save post-tax dollars
- Win-win financially

### Meal Culture Guidelines

**Encourage presence**:
- No electronics at the table
- Phones and laptops away
- Shared calendar event for meal times
- Consistent timing daily

Results:
- Improved team bonding
- Increased trust
- Better communication

## Cross-Team Communication

### The Silo Problem

"As your company grows you'll find that communication between members of disparate teams slows to a halt. This is especially prevalent between engineers and the rest of the company. This is only amplified if a good portion of your team is remote."

### The Random Connection Solution

"One solution that I've seen work is to randomly assign team members every week to meet, get a coffee, or hang-out virtually."

Implementation:
- Use tools like Donut
- Weekly random pairings
- Virtual or in-person options
- Track participation

## Politics: The Culture Killer

### Defining Workplace Politics

"In this context, 'politics' means lobbying to gain personal benefit."

### The Poison Effect

"Politics are poison for a company. They direct energy away from customer problem-solving, and once they take hold the result is a quick race to the bottom."

The destruction sequence:
1. Energy diverts from customers
2. Internal competition increases
3. Trust erodes
4. Talent leaves
5. Company fails

### Prevention Strategies

While not explicitly stated, preventing politics requires:
- Clear values enforcement
- Transparent decision-making
- Merit-based recognition
- Swift action on violations

## Building Cultural Resilience

### The Integration Effect

Strong culture creates:
- Self-reinforcing behaviors
- Peer accountability
- Natural selection
- Sustained performance

### Cultural Evolution

As companies grow:
- Values codification becomes critical
- Fun must be intentional
- Celebration needs systems
- Policies require thought

## Measuring Cultural Health

### Quantitative Metrics
- Employee retention
- Internal referrals
- Engagement scores
- Participation rates

### Qualitative Indicators
- After-work socializing
- Cross-team collaboration
- Energy in the office
- Problem-solving creativity

## Decision Framework

For culture decisions:
1. **Does this align with our stated values?**
2. **Will this increase fun and engagement?**
3. **Are we celebrating enough?**
4. **Does this policy focus on output or input?**
5. **Will this reduce or increase politics?**

## Key Insights

- **Culture is the unspoken rules of group interaction**
- **Values already exist by 30 employees—codify them, don't create them**
- **Fun drives performance through increased engagement**
- **Celebration is appreciation, not parties**
- **Output matters more than hours**
- **Shared meals create unexpected connections**
- **Politics is poison—prevent it actively**
