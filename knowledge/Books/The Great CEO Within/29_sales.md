## The Core Philosophy

*Written with Misha Talavera, Co-founder of NeoReach*

"In this section, I assume that you are selling a product and have found an initial version of product market fit. I assume that you have successfully closed your initial paying customers, and these customers are satisfied enough with your product that a significant portion of them will become recurring customers."

The essence of sales is fundamentally about building trust, understanding specific pain, and selling results rather than features.

## Making a Sale: The Three Pillars

### 1. Build Trust

**The parallel to fundraising and recruiting**: Building trust is the primary goal, achieved in the same way across all relationships.

The trust-building process:
- **Ask about them** - Focus entirely on the customer
- **Listen actively** - Give full attention
- **Reflect back** - "I think I heard you say..."
- **Remember and reference** - Show you retained information

### Getting Trust-Building Meetings

The challenge: How to get meetings where you aren't required to pitch?

**Effective approaches**:

1. **Be explicit about not talking about your company**
   - "Before we talk about what we do, I'd like to start by getting to know your situation, to know if we're even the right solution for you."

2. **Ask for minimal time commitment**
   - "Let's have a short introductory call for 10 minutes."
   - "Let's get together for a quick coffee."

3. **Invite to purely social events**
   - "We're hosting drinks at ____ on ____. Please join us."
   - "We've got seats at the US Open. Please join us."

### 2. Identify the Customer's Specific Pain

#### Customer Development Framework

**The three things to understand**:
1. What are their goals?
2. What are the challenges preventing them from reaching those goals?
3. What are their ideal solutions to overcoming those obstacles?

**Benefits of proper discovery**:
- Know what customer wants → Present in their terms
- Customer sees solution as specific to their challenge
- Weed out poor-fit customers → Focus on good fits

#### The Discovery Conversation

**Real-world example structure**:

**Opening**:
```
"Hi Stacey! It's good to have you on the phone. I'm looking forward to giving you a demo of NeoReach. Before I go ahead and do so I would love to learn more about you and [company]. Can I ask you a couple questions?"
```

**Goals exploration**:
- "So tell me Stacey, what are you responsible for at [company]?"
- "Please tell me more about your influencer marketing."
- "What are the goals of your influencer marketing and how do you measure success?"

**Challenges identification**:
- "And what are your biggest obstacles/challenges with influencer marketing?"
- "[Repeat what they said]. Please tell me more about that."
- "[Repeat what they said]. Is that right?"

**Ideal solution discovery**:
- "What would the ideal solution to your problem be?"
- "[Repeat what they said]. And why is this important to you?"

**Decision process understanding**:
- "How would a product like that be vetted and purchased at [company]?"

### Building Problem/Solution Inventory

Over time, categorize knowledge:

**Problem Statement Example**:
"For Directors of Social Media that oversee influencer marketing at Fortune 1000 consumer brands who need a better way to track their influencer marketing activities, spend, and results."

**Solution Statement Example**:
"NeoReach is an influencer marketing SaaS platform that enables marketing managers to scale their influencer marketing by seamlessly tracking their influencer marketing activities, spend, and results; unlike spreadsheets which are disorganized and scattered."

### 3. Sell Results, Not Features

#### The Founder's Classic Mistake

"It's a classic founder issue to dive directly into the product functionality. After all, you've spent countless hours slaving over this product, thinking through every feature and technical challenge."

**The reality**: "Most people don't care about your product functionality. They don't care about your features. They care only about their business results."

#### The MacBook Analogy

"You don't buy the new MacBook because of its new chip. No, you buy the new MacBook because it allows you to achieve more due to its increased speed."

**The distinction**:
- The chip is the **how**
- Achieving more is the **why**
- Focus on the **why**

#### The DocuSign Transformation

**Before**: Selling software that enabled virtual contract signing
- Result: Struggling to close enterprise deals
- Problem: Nobody cared about signing contracts virtually

**After**: "We can increase your revenue by getting your customers to sign their contracts in under half the time"
- Result: 2015 - Raised $233M at $3B valuation

## Integrity & The Dangers of Overselling

### The Temptation

"As a startup founder, it is very tempting to be a 'yes' man to potential customers. After all, shouldn't you be trying to do everything possible to get revenue through the door?"

### The Quantifiable Consequences

1. **Reputation**
   - Customers talk to each other
   - Limited bridges to burn
   - Market reputation destroyed

2. **Development Team**
   - Exorbitant pressure applied
   - Stress on engineering
   - Unrealistic expectations

3. **Culture**
   - Founders set the example
   - Sales hires adopt from the top
   - Overselling culture is hard to reverse

**The better way**: "Overselling is a form of laziness. Instead, take the time to build trust. Then your customer will buy from you even though your product does not yet solve every one of their challenges."

## Building a Sales Team & Pipeline

### When to Hire Sales

**Common misconception**: Revenue problems → Hire salespeople → Revenue solved

**The reality**: "In most cases, salespeople will never be able to sell better than the founders and they won't be able to sell the product if you are not able to."

### The Two Prerequisites

Only hire a sales team when:

1. **Product-Market Fit achieved**
   - Significant proportion of customers renewing
   - Proven value delivery

2. **Clear definition established**
   - What you are selling
   - Who you are selling to

**Remember**: "As you grow your sales, you also need to grow the infrastructure to meet the need... This includes the onboarding process, customer support, etc."

## The Structure of a Sales Team

*Based on Aaron Ross' Predictable Revenue*

### The Core Insight

"Most executives think that the way to grow revenue is by adding salespeople. However, most often the main obstacle to growth is not growing the team but generating more leads."

**The key progression**:
1. Predictable lead generation
2. Predictable revenue
3. True scale

### The Three Functions

#### 1. Qualifiers (Sales Development Reps)

**Focus**: Generating qualified leads and handoff to Closers

**Types**:
- **Outbound Reps**: Proactive outreach (email, LinkedIn)
- **Inbound Reps**: Qualify incoming leads

**Compensation**: Base + bonus per qualified lead

#### 2. Closers (Account Executives)

**Focus**: Closing qualified leads from Qualifiers

**Key principle**: "Senior salespeople are expensive, so their time is best spent focusing on the most high-value activity: closing deals."

**Compensation**: Base + commission

#### 3. Farmers (Customer Success)

**Focus**: 
- Tend existing customers
- Ensure renewals
- Grow account value

**Importance**: "It's important to keep a good balance between generating new customers and tending to existing customers."

**Compensation**: Base + quarterly bonus (retention) or commission (growth)

### The Hiring Sequence

"Only start hiring AEs once you have a predictable flow of leads being generated and have farmers in place to tend to your customers."

**Recommended order**:
1. Hire a qualifier
2. Hire a farmer
3. Founder acts as closer
4. System runs smoothly
5. Then hire Account Executive

## Common Misconceptions About Hiring Salespeople

### 1. Overlooking Integrity and Culture Fit

**The myth**: "Salespeople are heartless mercenaries"

**The reality**: "It is true that salespeople are generally more motivated by money than product people. However, that does not diminish the importance of hiring salespeople with integrity, culture fit, and mission alignment."

### 2. Not Investing in Training

**The requirement**: "The best sales teams put their new recruits through an intensive training program, which includes working with the product, customer success, and sales development teams."

### 3. Must Hire Senior AEs with Track Record

**The truth**: "Many of the best sales teams are built from young, previously inexperienced closers."

**What matters more**:
- Sales DNA (relationship-building skills)
- Attention to process
- Commitment to company vision

### 4. Solo Contributor vs. Manager

**Critical distinction**: "The best closers are most often not the best managers... there is practically no overlap between the skillset required to run a team and manage a sales pipeline and those required for closing individual deals."

## Lead Generation

### The Three Types of Leads

#### 1. Seeds
- **Source**: Word-of-mouth, referrals, prior relationships
- **Pros**: Close fast, high win rates, best customers
- **Cons**: Hard to proactively grow
- **Strategy**: Build awesome product and Customer Success

#### 2. Nets
- **Source**: Marketing (events, SEO, white papers, ads)
- **Philosophy**: "Quantity over quality"
- **Pros**: Scalable and cost-effective if done well
- **Cons**: Serious costs and time to build/maintain

#### 3. Spears
- **Source**: Direct outbound by SDRs
- **Philosophy**: "Quality over quantity"
- **Pros**: Predictable, hyper-targeted, immediate results
- **Cons**: Requires full-time reps, unprofitable if deals <$10K

### The Evolution Pattern

"Generally, startups get their first customers from Seeds... As you start to scale, it is recommended to next focus on Spears."

**Why Spears before Nets**:
- Hyper-targeted leads
- Immediate results
- Nets take time to set up

## Qualifying Leads & Handoff

### The Qualification Checklist

A qualified lead must:
1. **Feel the pain** your product solves
2. **Have desire** to solve that pain
3. **Have power** to purchase

### The Handoff Process

Best practices:
- Introduce AE in email thread
- Have AE join next call
- AE decides if truly qualified
- AE marks as "Qualified" in CRM

### Compensation Alignment

Qualifiers compensated on either:
- Flat fee per qualified lead
- Percentage of closed deals

## Key Performance Indicators

### Essential Metrics to Track

1. **Average deal size** - Dollar amount per customer
2. **New revenue per month** - Split by channel and customer type
3. **Average sales cycle length** - Qualified to closed time
4. **Number of SQLs per month** - Qualified leads to AEs
5. **Cost per lead** - Average per qualified lead
6. **CAC** - Total acquisition cost including all expenses
7. **Customer churn rate** - % not renewing monthly
8. **Revenue churn rate** - % revenue not renewing

**Remember**: "Create counter-metrics as well."

### CRM Selection

- **10+ salespeople**: Salesforce recommended
- **Under 10**: Lighter-weight CRM to save setup time

## Decision Framework

For sales excellence:
1. **Have I built trust first?** → No pitching without relationship
2. **Do I understand their specific pain?** → Discovery before demo
3. **Am I selling results or features?** → Focus on business outcomes
4. **Should I hire salespeople yet?** → PMF and clarity required first
5. **Is my sales structure correct?** → Qualifiers → Farmers → Then Closers

## Key Insights

- **Trust-building in sales mirrors fundraising and recruiting processes**
- **Discovery questions reveal goals, challenges, and ideal solutions**
- **Sell the why (results) not the how (features)**
- **Overselling destroys reputation, team morale, and culture**
- **Lead generation, not salespeople, is usually the growth bottleneck**
- **Hire qualifiers and farmers before account executives**
