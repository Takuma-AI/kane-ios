## The Core Philosophy

"Inside your company's walls you've got your key personnel in place and functioning effectively, your data systems up and running, and information is flowing easily from your managers to your team members and vice-versa. The last piece of the puzzle, of course, is your dealings with the outside world—with investors, recruits, and customers."

Fundraising is fundamentally about building trusting relationships where someone decides to invest in you and your company.

## Pick a Partner, Not a Firm

### The Individual Matters Most

"When you raise money, you also get an investor. Make sure you get the partner that you believe will add value and be good to work with."

Key principles:
- **Don't let the firm choose** - You pick the partner
- **Do your research** - Find out from other founders who's good
- **Check longevity** - Ensure they'll be with firm long-term
- **Be proactive** - Approach them directly

## The Triangulation Method for Introductions

### Creating Compelling Interest

"The introduction is a key part of the fundraising process, and you only get one chance at it."

**The process**:
1. Find 3-5 people in your network who know the target investor
2. Ask each to send an email recommending you
3. Stack all referrals within one week
4. Investor receives multiple recommendations
5. They conclude you must be exceptional
6. They reach out proactively, already inclined to invest

### Critical Implementation Details

- **Timing is key**: All referrals within one week to rise above noise
- **Vary the language**: Don't give referrers identical text
- **Let authenticity shine**: Either different suggestions or none at all
- **Avoid orchestration appearance**: Natural recommendations work best

## Two Fundraising Methods

### The Traditional Method

The typical approach:
- Pitch with slide deck
- Customer problem and solution
- Market size and unit economics
- Financial projections
- Competition analysis
- Team and traction
- Go-to-market strategy

**The reality**: "You might run through your presentation dozens of times before you find a spark of interest."

### The Relationship Method

The superior approach:
- Build trusting, friendly relationship first
- Never discuss company initially
- Takes more time but dramatically higher close rate
- Works because humans are emotional, not just rational

**The key insight**: "The very first time you talk about your company, the investor will make a decision about whether or not she wants to invest. If she does not yet like or trust you, then your company had better be optically perfect—and more often than not it isn't."

## Building Trust and Like

### The Four Keys

#### 1. Ask About Their Lives
Get genuinely curious about:
- Their work experiences
- Personal interests
- Family and hobbies
- Career journey
- Investment philosophy

#### 2. Prove You Heard
Use the powerful phrase: "I think I heard you say..."
- Repeat back highlights
- Show active listening
- Create connection
- Build trust

#### 3. Prove You Remember
At next meeting: "The last time we talked, you said..."
- Shows you care
- Demonstrates attention
- Creates warmth
- Deepens relationship

#### 4. Express Appreciation
Let them know what you appreciate:
- Their time
- Their insights
- Their experience
- Specific things they've done

### The Meeting Strategy

**Getting the first meeting**:
- Use Triangulation Method if possible
- Otherwise, be explicit: "We only want to work with investors with whom we have a good relationship. So let's start with a coffee to get to know each other personally."

**Building the relationship**:
- First meeting: Just listen and learn
- Second meeting: Continue building rapport
- Can be 15-minute calls or hour-long meals
- Wait for clear signals of trust

**The signal to proceed**: "I really like you. I want to invest in you. Now tell me what your company does."

## Common Reactions and Reality

### Initial CEO Resistance

"When most CEOs hear of this method for the first time, they have a strong negative reaction. This method feels unnatural, and goes against their instincts to close quickly."

### The Transformation

"Later, once they have tried the method, and it works like a charm, they become raving fans."

**The advice**: Try it on a few prospective investors and compare effectiveness.

## Strengthening the Relationship

### Ongoing Connection

After initial meetings:
- Continue showing curiosity
- Send quick messages
- Share relevant articles
- Remember personal details
- 3-5 rounds solidify relationship

### The Power of Appreciation

Example from a Managing Partner at a top firm:
```
Hey Matt,

Just wanted to drop a note of thanks. I really enjoyed our 
talk on Tuesday and brief ones since. Also greatly appreciate 
you treating me to lunch. Talk soon!

Bill
```

### The Handwritten Note Secret

Andy Bromberg (CoinList): "At the risk of giving up my secrets, I'd suggest handwritten thank you notes. The response I get to my handwritten notes is incredible. People are floored. And often remember me as 'the handwritten note guy.'"

**Implementation**: "Every day I review all my interactions and send (or schedule) thank you's as appropriate. It ensures I don't miss anyone and am prompt. And it takes literally a few minutes."

## Sell Yourself, Not Your Company

### The Lifetime Investor Strategy

Cliff Weitzman (Speechify) realized: Sell yourself to gain investors who follow you through every pivot and company.

### The Humble Brag Structure

Tyler Weitzman's research-based storytelling method:

1. **Credit**: "It could not have happened without [name the others involved]."
2. **Hard Work**: "We had to put in so much to make it happen, for example, [describe the hard work]."
3. **Vulnerability**: "It was most difficult for me when..."
4. **Duty**: "We were driven by our dream to [noble motive]."
5. **Gratitude**: "I am so proud and thankful that..."

## Fundraising Timing

### The Stair-Step Value Pattern

Company value doesn't rise linearly but in steps at inflection points.

**Key inflection points**:
- Hiring capable engineering team
- First 3 paying customers
- $1M ARR (Product-Market Fit)
- Hiring capable sales team
- $5M ARR (Sales effectiveness)
- Senior managers for all departments

**The strategy**: "The best time to raise money is just after you've hit an inflection point."

## SAFEs vs. Priced Equity

### When to Use Each

**SAFEs/Convertible Notes**:
- Amount too small for priced round
- No institutional lead investor
- Legal fees <$10,000
- Quick and simple

**Priced Equity Rounds**:
- Raising >$2M (preferably >$5M)
- Institutional investors leading
- More complex terms
- Legal fees often >$100,000

### The Continuous SAFE Strategy

1. Start with $2-5M SAFE
2. At PMF, raise Series A (SAFE converts)
3. Immediately open new SAFE
4. Continue pattern through growth

**Benefits**: Family offices and strategics prefer SAFEs, extends runway between priced rounds.

## Priced Rounds

### The Information Asymmetry

"Investors have a huge informational advantage over you. They sign these term-sheets all the time. They're experts at controlling companies as minority shareholders."

### Critical Precautions

1. **Don't rush** - Artificial deadlines are tactics
2. **Understand everything** - Every clause matters
3. **Treat as irreversible** - Mistakes haunt you
4. **Get second opinions** - From other founders
5. **Watch special provisions** - Hidden control mechanisms

### The Legal Process Innovation

**Traditional approach problems**:
- 45-60 days for final documents
- $100,000+ legal bills each side
- Endless back-and-forth
- Billable hour inflation

**The efficient alternative**:
- Final documents in <1 week
- Legal bills <$15,000 each side
- Single decision-maker meeting

### The Efficient Legal Process

**Required attendees**:
- Company decision-maker (CEO)
- Lead investor decision-maker
- Company lawyer
- Investor lawyer

**The process**:
1. One side drafts documents
2. Other side provides written comments
3. 4-8 hour meeting scheduled
4. Review paragraph by paragraph
5. Decision-makers negotiate directly
6. Lawyers only advise on meaning
7. Real-time agreement on wording
8. Final language written immediately

**Lawyer billing limit**:
- Write base documents: 4 hours
- Read comments: 1 hour
- Attend meeting: 8 hours
- Write final language: 4 hours
- Total: 17 hours @ $800/hr = $13,600
