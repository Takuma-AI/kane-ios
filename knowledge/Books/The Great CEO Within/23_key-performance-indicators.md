## The Core Philosophy

"It is critical to objectively measure the performance of the company. You can only manage what you can measure. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) allow you to do this."

This chapter provides a framework for selecting, tracking, and displaying the metrics that matter most for organizational success.

## Understanding KPIs

### The Definition

"KPIs are the one or two significant metrics for each major function that show the entire team in an instant how the company is doing, and where the issues are."

Key characteristics:
- **One or two per function** - Focus over comprehensiveness
- **Significant** - Actually drive decisions
- **Instant clarity** - No interpretation needed
- **Issue identification** - Problems become visible

## Sample KPI Framework

### Examples by Department

| Department | Metric |
|------------|---------|
| Finance | Monthly Cash Burn; Cash in the Bank |
| Sales | Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) |
| Engineering | Percentage of tickets closed |
| Recruiting | Percentage of offers accepted |

### The Selection Criteria

Good KPIs are:
- **Leading indicators** when possible
- **Directly controllable** by the department
- **Simply measured** and understood
- **Frequently updated** (daily/weekly)
- **Action-driving** when off-track

## The Company-Level Focus

### The Magnificent Five or Six

"It is important to determine the company's five or six most significant KPIs"

Why this number:
- More than six → Information overload
- Less than five → Missing critical areas
- Five-six → Comprehensive but digestible

### The Three Commitments

Once selected:
1. **Track them religiously**
2. **Make them available for the entire company to easily see**
3. **On a daily basis**

## The Visibility Imperative

### Physical Display

"Post the metrics on a TV screen in a central place in the office, using a tool such as Geckoboard."

Benefits of physical display:
- Constant awareness
- Cultural reinforcement
- Immediate issue visibility
- Team alignment
- Celebration opportunities

### The Dashboard Design

Effective dashboards show:
- Current value
- Trend line
- Target/benchmark
- Status (green/yellow/red)
- Last updated

## The Andy Grove Principle

### Counter-Metrics for Context

"As we learn from Andy Grove, former Intel CEO and author of the book High Output Management, it is also important to define and track counter-metrics to provide necessary context, because metrics are sometimes optimized to a fault."

### Understanding Counter-Metrics

Counter-metrics prevent:
- Gaming the system
- Unintended consequences
- Quality sacrifices
- Short-term thinking

## Counter-Metric Examples

### Engineering Example

**Primary metric**: Percentage of tickets closed

**The risk**: "Engineering tickets will vary in importance, so if your engineers have closed the critical tickets, they're doing better than if they close most tickets but only the easiest ones."

**Counter-metrics**:
- Average ticket complexity
- Critical ticket resolution time
- Bug recurrence rate
- Customer satisfaction score

### Recruiting Example

**Primary metric**: Percentage of offers accepted

**The risk**: "If the half of candidates that accept your job offers are less skilled than the half that decline, then you're doing worse than the raw percentage indicates."

**Counter-metrics**:
- Quality score of accepted candidates
- Performance ratings after 6 months
- Referral quality from new hires
- Retention rate of new hires

## Creating Balanced KPIs

### The Warning

"Create and measure your metrics carefully and in context to give your team the best possible view of your company's health."

### The Balance Framework

For each primary KPI, consider:
1. **What behavior does this incentivize?**
2. **How could this be gamed?**
3. **What quality aspect might suffer?**
4. **What counter-metric provides balance?**

## Common KPI Mistakes

### Too Many Metrics
Tracking everything → Focusing on nothing

### Vanity Metrics
Impressive numbers that don't drive decisions

### Lagging-Only Indicators
Only seeing problems after they've happened

### No Counter-Metrics
Optimizing one thing at the expense of others

### Infrequent Updates
Monthly updates for daily business

## Department-Specific KPI Guidelines

### Finance KPIs
- **Primary**: Cash burn, runway
- **Counter**: Revenue growth rate
- **Context**: Burn efficiency

### Sales KPIs
- **Primary**: New MRR, total MRR
- **Counter**: Customer acquisition cost
- **Context**: Sales efficiency

### Product KPIs
- **Primary**: User engagement, feature adoption
- **Counter**: Technical debt accumulation
- **Context**: Quality vs. speed

### Customer Success KPIs
- **Primary**: Churn rate, NPS
- **Counter**: Support cost per customer
- **Context**: Satisfaction vs. efficiency

## The Weekly KPI Review

### Making KPIs Actionable

Weekly rhythm:
1. **Review all KPIs** - What's off track?
2. **Identify root causes** - Why are we missing?
3. **Create action plans** - What will we do?
4. **Assign owners** - Who will fix it?
5. **Set deadlines** - When will it improve?

### The Stand-Up Format

Daily KPI stand-up:
- 5 minutes at start of day
- Review dashboard together
- Call out significant changes
- Quick wins or concerns
- Energy for the day

## Advanced KPI Strategies

### The North Star Metric

One metric above all others that:
- Captures core value delivery
- Aligns entire company
- Drives all other metrics
- Simply understood

### Cohort-Based Metrics

Moving beyond averages to:
- Time-based cohorts
- Behavior-based segments
- Predictive indicators
- Trend identification

### The Experimentation Layer

Using KPIs to:
- Set experiment hypotheses
- Measure test results
- Make data-driven decisions
- Scale what works

## Building KPI Culture

### Data Literacy

Everyone should understand:
- What each KPI means
- How their work affects KPIs
- When to escalate issues
- How to read trends

### Celebration and Accountability

- Celebrate when KPIs improve
- Investigate when they decline
- No blame, just curiosity
- Learn from both directions

## Technology and Tools

### Dashboard Solutions
- **Geckoboard**: Simple and visual
- **Tableau**: Powerful analytics
- **Looker**: Data modeling
- **PowerBI**: Microsoft integration
- **Custom**: Build your own

### Data Pipeline
- Automated collection

### Growing Sophistication
Evolve to:
- Automated systems
- Real-time dashboards
- Predictive metrics
- AI-driven insights

## Decision Framework

For KPI selection:
1. **Does this metric drive action?** → Include it
2. **Can we influence it directly?** → Track it
3. **Would everyone understand it?** → Simplify it
4. **Could optimizing this hurt something else?** → Add counter-metric
5. **Will we look at this daily?** → Make it visible

## Key Insights

- **You can only manage what you can measure—KPIs make performance objective**
- **One or two metrics per function maintains focus while providing coverage**
- **Company-wide visibility on 5-6 KPIs aligns everyone instantly**
- **Counter-metrics prevent gaming and provide essential context**
- **Physical dashboards in common areas reinforce data-driven culture**
- **The best KPIs drive immediate action when they're off track**
