# Chapter 7: When You Say It Twice, Write It Down

**Mental Model:** Knowledge Capture

## The Core Philosophy

"Whenever you find yourself saying something for a second time (to a second audience, or in a second situation), it is highly likely that you will end up saying it again and again in the future. To vastly improve the quality of the communication, and reduce the amount of time that you spend communicating it â€¦ write it down."

This simple principle becomes a powerful force multiplier for CEO effectiveness and organizational scaling.

## The Pattern Recognition

### The Second-Time Signal

The moment you catch yourself explaining something for the second time, you've identified a piece of institutional knowledge that needs to be captured. This could be:
- An explanation of company strategy
- A process or procedure
- A decision framework
- A piece of cultural wisdom
- An answer to a common question

### The Future Prediction

If you've said it twice, the probability approaches 100% that you'll need to say it again. And again. And again.

## The Documentation Solution

### The Simple Process

When you recognize the pattern:
1. **Write it down** immediately after the second occurrence
2. **Refine it** to be clearer than your verbal explanation
3. **Share it** in written form the next time it's needed

### Where to Document

**For team-wide knowledge**: Put it in a company-wide Wiki
**For cultural foundations**: Post it on a wall for all to see
**For process documentation**: Add to relevant playbooks
**For decision frameworks**: Include in management systems

## The Quality Multiplier

### Why Written is Better Than Verbal

Written documentation:
- **Forces clarity**: You must think through the complete explanation
- **Ensures consistency**: Everyone gets the same information
- **Enables async consumption**: People can access when needed
- **Allows refinement**: Can be improved over time
- **Scales infinitely**: One document can serve thousands

### The Compound Effect

Each piece of documentation:
- Saves time on every future explanation
- Reduces misunderstandings and variations
- Builds institutional knowledge
- Enables delegation and scaling
- Frees you for higher-value work

## The MacCaw Extension

Alex MacCaw, Founder and CEO of Clearbit, adds a crucial dimension:

"Once you see this system working for yourself, start encouraging others in your company to do likewise. Every time you see a question answered on Slack (for example), prompt the questioner to document the response in your company wiki."

### The Cultural Transformation

This creates a documentation culture where:
- Knowledge capture becomes everyone's responsibility
- Information flows efficiently across the organization
- Onboarding accelerates dramatically
- Institutional knowledge persists through personnel changes

## Common Documentation Opportunities

### Strategic Communications
- Vision and mission explanations
- Strategic priorities reasoning
- Market opportunity descriptions
- Competitive positioning

### Operational Procedures
- How to submit expenses
- How to request time off
- How to access systems
- How to handle common scenarios

### Decision Frameworks
- How we evaluate features
- How we prioritize work
- How we make hiring decisions
- How we handle conflicts

### Cultural Elements
- Our values in action
- Expected behaviors
- Meeting norms
- Communication standards

## Implementation Strategies

### The Trigger System

Create triggers to notice documentation opportunities:
- Keep a "said twice" notebook
- Add a Slack emoji for "should be documented"
- End meetings with "What should we write down?"
- Weekly review of repeated communications

### The Documentation Sprint

Periodically:
1. List everything you've explained multiple times
2. Block 2 hours to write them all down
3. Share in appropriate locations
4. Announce availability to team

### The Wiki Architecture

Organize documentation for findability:
- Clear categories
- Search optimization
- Regular maintenance
- Usage analytics

## Overcoming Resistance

### "I Don't Have Time to Write"
**Reality**: You don't have time NOT to write. Every documentation hour saves 10+ hours of future repetition.

### "Things Change Too Fast"
**Reality**: Document current state with version control. Updates are easier than creation from scratch.

### "No One Will Read It"
**Reality**: Build the habit by directing people to docs. They'll learn to check first.

### "I Explain Better Verbally"
**Reality**: Use your verbal explanation as a first draft, then refine in writing.

## The CEO's Unique Position

### Why This Matters More for CEOs

As CEO, you:
- Are asked the same questions repeatedly
- Set strategic context others need
- Define cultural norms
- Make decisions others must understand
- Have the least time to waste on repetition

### The Leverage Point

Every piece of CEO documentation:
- Aligns the entire organization
- Reduces decision bottlenecks
- Empowers autonomous action
- Preserves institutional wisdom

## Advanced Applications

### The Pre-emptive Documentation

Don't wait for the second time:
- Document important decisions immediately
- Write down new processes as created
- Capture strategic thinking in real-time

### The Living Document

Treat documentation as living:
- Version control everything
- Encourage edits and improvements
- Review and update regularly
- Measure usage and effectiveness

### The Documentation Review

In one-on-ones, ask:
- "What have you explained multiple times?"
- "What questions do you keep getting?"
- "What should be documented?"

## Measuring Impact

### Time Metrics
- Hours saved on repeated explanations
- Reduction in similar questions
- Speed of onboarding new employees

### Quality Metrics
- Consistency of execution
- Reduction in misunderstandings
- Increase in autonomous decisions

### Cultural Metrics
- Documentation contributions per person
- Wiki usage statistics
- Self-service problem resolution

## The Network Effect

As documentation grows:
1. **People expect to find answers in writing**
2. **Documentation-first becomes the norm**
3. **Quality improves through iteration**
4. **Organizational IQ increases**
5. **Scaling becomes possible**

## Integration with Other Systems

### With Company Wiki (Chapter 19)
- This principle drives wiki content
- Creates the knowledge base
- Enables self-service information

### With Transparency (Chapter 14)
- Written documentation enables transparency
- Information becomes accessible
- Context is preserved

### With Scaling
- Documentation enables growth
- New hires can self-educate
- Processes remain consistent

## Decision Framework

When communicating, ask:
1. **Have I said this before?**
2. **Will I likely say it again?**
3. **Would others benefit from this knowledge?**
4. **Where should this live permanently?**
5. **How can I make this clearer in writing?**

## Key Insights

- **The second time you say something is the signal to write it down**
- **Written communication scales infinitely, verbal doesn't**
- **Documentation time is an investment that pays compound returns**
- **Creating a documentation culture multiplies the effect**
- **CEOs have the highest leverage from this practice**
- **Living documents beat perfect but static ones**
