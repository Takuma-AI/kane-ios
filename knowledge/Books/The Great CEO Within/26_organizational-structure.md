## The Core Philosophy

"In the early stage of a company, before Product Market Fit, when your team is 6 people or less, there is little value in creating a formal organizational structure, or in creating a distinction among co-founders as to who the CEO is. But when Product Market Fit is achieved, it is time to scale rapidly."

This chapter provides frameworks for creating and evolving organizational structure as companies grow from 6 to thousands of employees.

## The Scaling Inflection Point

### Before Product-Market Fit
- 6 people or less
- No formal structure needed
- No CEO distinction necessary
- Everyone in one team meeting
- Organic information flow

### After Product-Market Fit
- Rapid scaling required
- Multiple functions needed (Sales, Engineering, Customer Success)
- Can't fit everyone in one meeting
- Separate teams required
- Each needs a manager
- Structure becomes mandatory

## Creating Initial Structure

### The Two Requirements

"The answer is to both identify the CEO and create a written organizational structure."

1. **Identify the CEO** - Clear ultimate decision maker
2. **Written org structure** - No ambiguity about reporting

### The Meeting-Based Definition

"The org structure should be determined by who attends what team meeting."

This practical approach:
- Makes reporting relationships clear
- Defines communication flows
- Prevents meeting bloat
- Creates natural boundaries

## The Standard Leadership Team

### Typical Composition

The Leadership Team typically includes:
- **CEO**
- **Head of Product**
- **Head of Engineering**
- **Head of Sales**
- **Head of Marketing**
- **Head of Customer Success**
- **Head of Operations** (People [Recruiting/HR], Finance, Legal and Office)

### Department Structure

"Each of these department heads then has a team that they manage."

### The Transparency Requirement

"Once you adopt an organizational structure, write it down and make it public to the company. There should be no confusion about who reports to whom, and what team meeting each person attends."

## Titles: The Hidden Danger

*By Alex MacCaw*

### The Title Trap

"When you're first starting out, it can be quite tempting to hand out titles without much process; after all they're free. However a misplaced title can come back to haunt you."

### The Demotion Problem

Example scenario:
1. Give existing employee fancy title
2. Need to hire senior person above them
3. Existing employee must now report to new hire
4. Viewed as demotion
5. Risk losing the employee

### The Simple Solution

"One easy solution is just to call everyone 'Head of X'. That way when it's finally time to hire senior VPs, they can slot easily into the organization without 'demoting' anyone."

Benefits:
- Flexibility for future hires
- No perceived demotions
- Clear growth path
- Easier senior recruiting

## Leadership Team vs. VPs Meeting

### The Growth Challenge

As the company grows:
- Each team becomes large
- New teams emerge (Design, Communications, Compliance)
- Individual products may need GMs
- Many VP-level executives
- Temptation to expand Leadership Team

**The warning**: "There will be a temptation to invite them to attend the Leadership Team meeting. Do not."

### The Information Fallacy

"If someone needs to attend a meeting in order to be informed about what occurs in that meeting, then you have not yet created a transparent system."

Proper transparency means:
- Clear notes from all meetings
- All decisions documented
- Published to company (except compensation/performance)
- Everyone knows without attending

### The True Purpose of Meetings

"The meeting then just becomes a way of making good and fast decisions."

### Leadership Meeting Criteria

Attendees should be your "Brain Trust":
- Key minds for great decisions
- Leaders of major business units
- Those who need unblocking
- Not for ego satisfaction
- Efficiency over inclusion

### The VPs Meeting Solution

For all other Department and Team Leads:
1. **Decisions announced** from Leadership Meeting
2. **"Speak now or forever hold your peace"** moment
3. **Raise concerns** about unintended consequences
4. **Kick to RAPID** if issues arise
5. **Publish to company** if approved

### Meeting Scale Guidelines

**Leadership Team**: 
- Should remain ~8 people (6-10 range)
- Doesn't grow with company size

**VPs Meeting**:
- Grows as company scales
- 15 attendees at 1,000 employees
- 150+ at Microsoft scale

## Re-organizations

### The Disruption Reality

"Re-orgs, like terminations, are always disruptive and cause people angst, even if the logic for them is glaringly obvious."

Key principles:
- Full buy-in impossible
- Can't solicit wide opinions beforehand
- Becomes "group crisis therapy"

### The Re-org Process

1. **Consult Department Heads** ahead of time
2. **Keep consultation period short** to minimize leaks
3. **Announce decisively**
4. **Immediate explanation and Q&A**:
   - First in All Hands
   - Then Departments
   - Finally individual teams

### The Batching Principle

"A second key is to batch organizational changes."

Timing guidelines:
- Organization needs time to heal
- Even if changes needed 6 weeks later, wait
- **Minimum**: 3 months between org changes
- **Better**: 6 months between changes

## Organizational Design Principles

### Structure Follows Strategy
- Define what you're building
- Determine needed functions
- Create minimal viable structure
- Expand as needed

### Conway's Law Awareness
"Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structures"
- Product architecture often reflects org structure
- Design org to enable desired outcomes
- Cross-functional teams for integrated products

### Span of Control
Factors affecting manager bandwidth:
- Experience level of reports
- Complexity of work
- Need for coordination
- Geographic distribution
- Cultural alignment

## Common Organizational Pitfalls

### Title Inflation
- Giving big titles too early
- Creating nowhere to grow
- Making senior hires difficult
- Causing perceived demotions

### Meeting Bloat
- Adding people for inclusion
- Losing decision efficiency
- Information vs. decision confusion
- Ego-driven attendance

### Frequent Re-orgs
- Constant disruption
- Change fatigue
- Lack of stability
- Decreased performance

### Shadow Organizations
- Informal power structures
- Unclear decision rights
- Bypassed formal channels
- Confusion and conflict

## Evolution Patterns

### 6 → 20 People
- First formal structure
- Department heads identified
- CEO role clarified
- Team meetings separate

### 20 → 100 People
- Layers emerge
- Specialized roles
- Cross-functional challenges
- Communication systems critical

### 100 → 1,000 People
- Multiple organizational layers
- Business units possible
- Formal processes mandatory
- Culture preservation challenging

### 1,000+ People
- Complex matrix possibilities
- Geographic distribution
- Multiple product lines
- Careful coordination required

## Measuring Organizational Health

### Effectiveness Indicators
- Decision speed
- Information flow
- Role clarity
- Meeting efficiency
- Cross-functional collaboration

### Warning Signs
- Unclear reporting relationships
- Slow decision-making
- Information bottlenecks
- Title confusion
- Frequent re-orgs

## Integration with Other Systems

### With Meetings (Chapter 24)
- Org structure determines meeting attendance
- Meeting structure reinforces org design
- Clear boundaries prevent bloat

### With AORs (Chapter 21)
- Roles within structure
- Clear ownership
- Prevents gaps/overlaps

### With Communication
- Structure defines information flows
- Transparency prevents attendance inflation
- Written documentation crucial

## Decision Framework

For organizational decisions:
1. **Have we achieved PMF?** → Time for structure
2. **Can everyone fit in one meeting?** → Still informal
3. **Are roles crystal clear?** → Write and publish
4. **Are we adding for ego or efficiency?** → Keep Leadership Team small
5. **Has the org settled?** → Wait before next change

## Key Insights

- **No structure needed until PMF; then it becomes mandatory**
- **Meeting attendance defines organizational structure practically**
- **"Head of X" titles provide flexibility for senior hires later**
- **Leadership Team stays small (8 people) regardless of company size**
- **Never attend meetings just for information—that's a transparency failure**
- **Batch re-orgs with 3-6 month gaps for organizational healing**
