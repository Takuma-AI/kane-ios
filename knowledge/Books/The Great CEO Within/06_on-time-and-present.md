## The Core Philosophy

"It is critical to be on time for every appointment that you have made, or to let the others involved in the meeting know that you will be late as soon as you realize it. This is common decency, yes, but it has a greater importance."

Being on time and present isn't just about politeness—it's about respecting others' productivity, building trust, and maximizing the value of every interaction. For a CEO, this habit sets the cultural tone for the entire organization.

## The Hidden Cost of Lateness

### The Other Side of Your Agreement

There is someone else on the other side of your agreement to start the meeting at a certain time. They have:
- Stopped what they were working on to attend the meeting on time
- Cannot start the meeting without you
- Cannot leave, because they don't know if you'll show up the next minute or not

**Each minute that they are away from their work is a minute of productivity that you have stolen from them.** This is not only disrespectful but also counterproductive.

### The Cascade Effect

The consequences extend far beyond lost time:
- **If they are a customer, investor, or recruit**: They will not engage with your company
- **If they report to you**: They will keep quiet but resent you
- **There is no winning scenario when you waste someone's time**

## The Reality-Based Solution

### Life Happens

Mochary acknowledges the reality:
- A previous call or meeting may run late
- Traffic doesn't always cooperate
- Even with careful planning, it's not possible to be on time for every meeting

**The good news is that you don't need to be.**

### The Critical Distinction

**It is only critical to let the other members of the meeting know that you will be late as soon as you realize that you will be.**

Key requirements:
- You must come to this realization **before the meeting starts**
- You must communicate through whatever channel will reach them fastest
- Ideally, let them know about the delay **before they have to break away** from whatever they are doing before the meeting

## Being Present: The Second Requirement

### What Presence Means

Being present means that you are:
- **Composed**: Mentally calm and ready
- **Prepared**: Have reviewed relevant materials
- **Focused**: Attention fully on the subject matter

### The Transition Time Reality

It can take a few minutes to "get present":
- Prepare for the meeting
- Research the topic and the attendees
- Go to the bathroom between back-to-back meetings
- Get a drink/snack
- Mentally transition from the previous topic

### The Time Buffer Strategy

**For outside meetings**: Plan to arrive fifteen minutes before scheduled start
**For office meetings**: Wrap up your current project or previous meeting five to ten minutes prior

## The Calendar Solution

### The 25/50 Minute Meeting Standard

To make this easy, Mochary recommends scheduling:
- **25 minute meetings** (instead of 30)
- **50 minute meetings** (instead of 60)

**Google Calendar even has an automated setting for this.**

Benefits:
- 5 minutes each half-hour for transitions
- 10 minutes each hour for maintenance
- Natural buffer for running slightly over
- Time for mental transitions

## The Phone Discipline

### The Modern Distraction

"When in the meeting, I often see CEOs making the mistake of constantly checking their messages. They cannot get away from being 'on,' if even for a second."

### The Damage Done

This behavior is:
- **Disrespectful**: Sends message that the meeting's content is unimportant
- **Self-defeating**: Defeats the purpose of collaboration
- **Culture-destroying**: Breeds bad habits throughout the company
- **Hard to reverse**: Difficult, if not impossible, to break down the line

### The Simple Rule

**During every meeting, leave your phone in your pocket or face-down.**

Supporting strategies:
- Stick with Inbox Zero (Chapter 4) to reduce anxiety
- Trust that urgent matters will find you
- If the meeting is not efficient, make it so (see Chapter 24)

## The CEO Multiplier Effect

### Setting the Standard

As CEO, your behavior around time and presence:
- **Models expectations** for the entire organization
- **Shapes culture** around respect and productivity
- **Demonstrates values** through actions, not words
- **Builds trust** through reliability

### The Organizational Impact

When the CEO is consistently on time and present:
1. **Meetings start on time** throughout the organization
2. **People come prepared** knowing time won't be wasted
3. **Efficiency increases** as transition time is built in
4. **Respect deepens** as everyone's time is valued

## Common Excuses and Reality Checks

### "I'm Too Busy"
**Reality**: Everyone is busy. Respecting others' time makes everyone more efficient.

### "My Previous Meeting Ran Over"
**Reality**: Build in transition time. End meetings 5-10 minutes early.

### "I Need to Be Constantly Available"
**Reality**: 25-50 minutes of focus won't cause catastrophe. True emergencies are rare.

### "This Meeting Isn't That Important"
**Reality**: Then why did you schedule it? Either make it important or cancel it.

## Implementation Strategies

### Week 1: Awareness
- Track your on-time rate
- Notice when you check your phone
- Observe the impact on others

### Week 2: Structural Changes
- Implement 25/50 minute meetings
- Add 15-minute buffers for external meetings
- Put phone face-down in meetings

### Week 3: Communication
- Alert others as soon as you know you'll be late
- Explain the new meeting duration standard
- Model full presence in every interaction

### Ongoing: Cultural Embedding
- Celebrate punctuality in others
- Address lateness patterns directly
- Make presence a company value

## The Preparation Checklist

Before each meeting:
1. **Review agenda and materials** (during transition time)
2. **Clear mental space** from previous topic
3. **Set phone to do not disturb**
4. **Arrive physically and mentally ready**
5. **Open with full attention**

## Advanced Practices

### The Check-In
Start meetings with 30-second check-ins from each person to ensure mental presence

### The Tech Stack
- Calendar apps with automatic buffers
- Meeting reminder systems
- Status communication tools for delays

### The Energy Audit
Notice which meetings drain vs. energize you, and structure your calendar accordingly

## Measuring Impact

### Personal Metrics
- On-time percentage
- Average delay when late
- Phone-check frequency
- Meeting effectiveness scores

### Organizational Metrics
- Company-wide meeting punctuality
- Meeting satisfaction scores
- Time spent in meetings
- Decision velocity

## Decision Framework

For every meeting:
1. **Can I arrive with a 15-minute buffer?** (external)
2. **Have I blocked 5-10 minutes before?** (internal)
3. **Will I know 10+ minutes early if I'm running late?**
4. **Is my phone put away?**
5. **Am I mentally present, not just physically here?**

## The Compound Effect

Being on time and present:
- **Saves hours weekly** through efficient meetings
- **Builds trust** that accelerates all interactions
- **Models behavior** that scales throughout the organization
- **Reduces stress** through better planning
- **Increases impact** through full engagement

## Key Insights

- **Presence requires transition time—build it into your schedule**
- **25/50 minute meetings create natural buffers for sustainability**
