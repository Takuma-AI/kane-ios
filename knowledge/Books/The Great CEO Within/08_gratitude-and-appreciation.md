## The Core Philosophy

"Confirmation bias is the phenomenon that whatever belief we start out with, we will discover evidence to support it. A corollary to this is that whatever question we ask, we will focus on the answer."

This chapter reveals how gratitude and appreciation aren't just feel-good practices—they're performance enhancers that fundamentally change how we see situations and how others perform around us.

## The Question That Shapes Reality

### The Fundamental Choice

In any situation, we can ask ourselves:
- "What is wrong here?" 
- OR "What is right here?"

From an early age, our parents, teachers, and employers have taught us to ask the former question. They cannot be faulted—they had the best intentions. In the earliest years of our life, they were trying to keep us alive.

### The Unintended Consequence

Unfortunately, we learned to focus on the negative, and so we continually see the negative. This leads to objectively very successful people being not fully satisfied with their lives, themselves, etc.

**But it doesn't end there.**

## The Performance Connection

### The Shocking Truth

"It turns out that we perform our best when we are having fun and feeling good about ourselves."

This isn't just motivational speaking—it's observable, repeatable science.

### The Kid Sports Experiment

Mochary provides a powerful proof:

Go to any kid sports event where you know the names of the kids. Start cheering positively for the team that is losing, with specific compliments to specific kids:
- "Great pass Jimmy."
- "Way to be in position, George."
- When a kid takes a shot but misses: "Good idea Joey, it was the right thing to do."

**Result**: Within 5-10 minutes, the tide of the game will start to change toward the team that you are giving specific compliments to.

"I have done this many times. And it has worked every time!"

### Adult Application

If you don't have access to kid sports, try the same technique at adult sports games. **It works just as well (actually, often better) with adults.**

## The Gratitude Practice

### The Right Question

How do we take advantage of this knowledge to generate a good feeling in ourselves? We ask the right question:
- "What is good about this situation?"
- "What is good about this team member?"
- "What is good about my company?"
- "What is good about my life?"

Or, we simply fill in the overarching statement: **"I am grateful for ________."**

### The Specificity Principle

**Be as specific as possible**:
- Names of people
- Specific actions they did
- Particular moments or outcomes
- Concrete details that bring the gratitude to life

## Creating the Daily Practice

### The Trigger System

To remember to do it, create a trigger for yourself. A trigger is something that you will see at the time that you want to do the action.

**Simple trigger options**:
- A piece of paper with the word "Gratitude" printed on it
- Taped to your night-table
- On wall by your bed
- On mirror in your bathroom

### The Morning Ritual

When you see it each morning:
- Say the phrase "I am grateful for ______" five times
- Use a different ending each time
- Be as specific as possible
- You don't have to say it out loud (can be silent)

### The Journal Option

Another way to make this a regular habit is to use a journal like The Five-Minute Journal:
- Keep the book by your bedside (the book itself becomes the trigger)
- You'll see it when you wake up
- And just before you go to sleep

## The Transformation Effect

### The Promise

"If you do this gratitude practice regularly (don't worry if you miss days here and there), your view of your life and yourself will begin to change for the better. And soon afterward you will begin to perform better in life as well, just like the kids on the sports field."

### Addressing the Cynics

"Being grateful doesn't mean that you will suddenly ignore all of the areas of your life or your company that could use improvement. Just the opposite. It only means that you will bring an attitude of joy, as opposed to desperation, when addressing those areas."

### The Core Truth

**"Life and company-building don't have to be hard or painful. Daily gratitude helps us realize that."**

## Appreciation: The Outward Extension

### The Distinction

- **Gratitude**: You speak to yourself
- **Appreciation**: You speak to others
- **The content is the same**

### The Practice

When you catch yourself feeling grateful about someone or something that they have done, **let them know**.

When you hear something nice said about someone, **let them know**.

### The Triple Benefit

The benefits of this practice are threefold:

1. **The recipient will feel better about themselves**
   - And we now know what happens when people feel better about themselves

2. **The recipient will feel connected and appreciative to you**
   - For having brought them this good feeling

3. **You will start to view the recipient more positively**
   - Since you are now focusing on a positive aspect about them

## The Fralic Method

Chris Fralic of First Round Capital, in his iconic blogpost on networking, says that he **reserves one hour each week for follow-ups and outreach**, most of which include appreciations.

Mochary's recommendation: **Do the same.**

### The Specificity Rule (Again)

Just as with gratitude, giving appreciation should be as specific as possible:

**Example**: "John, I appreciate you for writing down our sales process and adding it to the wiki. Thank you."

Not: "John, good job today."

## Implementation Strategies

### Week 1: Personal Gratitude
- Set up your trigger
- Practice 5 gratitudes each morning
- Notice the shift in perspective

### Week 2: Add Appreciation
- Share one appreciation daily
- Be specific in your recognition
- Observe the recipient's response

### Week 3: The Fralic Hour
- Block one hour weekly
- Send appreciation messages
- Include external stakeholders

### Ongoing: Cultural Embedding
- Start meetings with appreciation
- Model the behavior consistently
- Encourage peer appreciation

## The CEO Multiplier

### Why This Matters More for CEOs

As CEO, your mindset:
- **Sets the organizational tone**
- **Influences everyone's performance**
- **Creates cultural norms**
- **Determines company energy**

### The Cascade Effect

When the CEO practices gratitude and appreciation:
1. **Direct reports feel valued** → Perform better
2. **They appreciate their teams** → Performance cascades
3. **Culture shifts to positive** → Everyone thrives
4. **Results improve** → More to be grateful for
5. **Virtuous cycle continues** → Sustainable success

## Common Resistance and Responses

### "This Feels Fake"
**Reality**: Authenticity comes from specificity. Generic praise feels fake; specific appreciation feels real.

### "I Don't Have Time"
**Reality**: Five minutes of gratitude in the morning. One hour of appreciation weekly. The ROI is massive.

### "My Culture Isn't Like This"
**Reality**: Culture is what leaders repeatedly do. Start the change.

### "What About Accountability?"
**Reality**: You can appreciate people AND hold high standards. They're not mutually exclusive.
