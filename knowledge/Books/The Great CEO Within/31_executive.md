## The Core Philosophy

The executive function is about creating leverage through strategic support roles that extend the CEO's capacity and solve organizational scaling challenges. Two key roles emerge: Chief of Staff for individual leverage and Business Operations for organizational problem-solving.

## Chief of Staff

### When You Need One

"If you find that you are simply not completing the goals you set for yourself each week, or you do so but some or many of the tasks are energy-draining, then it is time to hire a Chief of Staff (COS)."

**The indicators**:
- Goals consistently incomplete
- Tasks completed but energy-draining
- Bandwidth limitations
- Strategic work suffering

### The Two Priorities

"To me, the two priorities in creating a great COS are:
1. Their background
2. How you train them"

### Background Requirements

"The best COS that I have seen are highly-organized, excellent communicators (both written and oral), and have broad strategic business knowledge."

**The ideal profile**:
- **Experience**: 4-8 years at top management consulting firm
- **Firms**: Bain, BCG, McKinsey
- **Preference**: Bain consultants for financial modeling skills
- **Skills gained**: Similar to investment banking associates

**Why consultants excel**:
- Highly organized approach
- Excellent communication (written and oral)
- Broad strategic knowledge
- Strong analytical capabilities
- Financial modeling expertise

### The Training Process

"The key is to give your COS unfettered access to all the information that you receive."

**The immersion method**:
1. **Physical proximity** - Sit beside you morning till night
2. **Full access** to:
   - All emails
   - All calls
   - All meetings
   - All decisions
3. **Observation period** - Several weeks watching
4. **Gradual delegation** - Start taking tasks
5. **Full capability** - Handle all non-energizing tasks

**The transformation**: "By seeing what decisions you make, based on what information you receive, she will soon be able to think like you, and then she can truly be an extension of you (and magic will happen)."

### The Progression Timeline

- **Weeks 1-4**: Pure observation and learning
- **Months 2-3**: Taking on initial tasks
- **Months 4-6**: Handling all energy-draining work
- **Beyond**: True extension of the CEO

### Recruiting Challenges and Solutions

"Most senior candidates are not attracted to the COS role because they view it as an 'assistant' role (and in many companies it is)."

**The recruitment pitch**:
- Show full information access
- Emphasize decision-making exposure
- Position as CEO training
- "This is the single best training to becoming a CEO (or head of any department) that exists"

## Business Operations

### The Scaling Challenge

"As your company quickly scales, the young people you hired early in the company's life-cycle will be asked to manage bigger and bigger teams. Some will learn to be good managers fast enough. Others won't."

### The Layering Dilemma

When early employees can't scale:

**The difficult situation**:
1. Need transparency about performance
2. Need to inform about layering decision
3. Risk demotivation or departure
4. But need immediate improvement
5. External hiring takes too long

**The insight**: "This fear is usually overblown, as most young managers look forward to learning from someone more experienced."

### The Business Operations Solution

"In Silicon Valley, major tech companies such as Google and LinkedIn built up functions called Business Operations."

**The model**:
- Staffed by top-tier consultants
- From Bain, McKinsey, BCG
- Example: Emilie Choi at Coinbase during hypergrowth

### The Five Functions of Biz Ops

#### 1. Problem Solving
"Parachute into any problem area and dig in and fix it."

#### 2. Process Building
"Generally help build and drive processes that help the company scale, including running quarterly business reviews, OKRs, etc."

#### 3. Performance Support
When a manager isn't succeeding:
- Join the team temporarily
- Take over project and people management
- Keep original manager as architect/SME
- Original defines the roadmap
- Biz Ops ensures execution

#### 4. Meeting Excellence
"Effectively run any meeting, and train managers how to do so."

#### 5. Executive Support
"Act as Chief of Staff to the CEO."

### The Architect Model

**How it works**:
- **Struggling manager** = Subject Matter Expert
- **Defines**: "These are the things that we need to get done, and this is how to do them"
- **Biz Ops person** = Execution manager
- **Ensures**: Team completes the roadmap

**Benefits**:
- Preserves institutional knowledge
- Provides learning opportunity
- Improves performance immediately
- Builds bench strength

## Building Executive Leverage

### Individual Leverage (Chief of Staff)

**Purpose**: Extend CEO's personal capacity

**Key activities**:
- Handle energy-draining tasks
- Manage routine decisions
- Prepare materials and analysis
- Interface with teams
- Drive follow-through

### Organizational Leverage (Biz Ops)

**Purpose**: Solve systemic scaling challenges

**Key activities**:
- Fix broken processes
- Support struggling managers
- Drive company-wide initiatives
- Build operational excellence
- Create management systems

## Common Executive Function Mistakes

### Chief of Staff Mistakes
- Hiring as glorified assistant
- Not providing full access
- Skipping observation period
- Delegating without context
- Undervaluing the role

### Business Operations Mistakes
- Creating ivory tower function
- Not embedding in teams
- Focusing only on analysis
- Missing execution component
- Competing with line managers

## Integration with Other Functions

### With Product
- COS can manage product reviews
- Biz Ops can fix product processes

### With Engineering
- Support technical project management
- Help engineering managers scale

### With Sales
- Drive sales operations excellence
- Support territory planning

### With All Functions
- Create cross-functional alignment
- Drive company-wide initiatives

## Decision Framework

For executive support:
1. **Am I completing my goals?** → If not, need COS
2. **Are tasks draining my energy?** → COS handles these
3. **Are managers struggling to scale?** → Deploy Biz Ops
4. **Do we have process gaps?** → Biz Ops builds systems
5. **Is execution suffering?** → Both roles can help

## Key Insights

- **Chief of Staff is an extension of the CEO through full information access**
- **4-8 years at top consulting firms provides ideal COS background**
- **Training requires complete immersion and observation before delegation**
- **Position COS as CEO training, not assistant role, to attract talent**
- **Business Operations solves the scaling challenge of early employees**
- **Biz Ops allows struggling managers to remain as architects while improving execution**
