## The Core Philosophy

"Great companies are made up of great individual performers who work well together as a team. As CEO, you are both the architect of the culture and the central hub in the wheel of information flow that enables the team to function effectively. Your example inspires your team, and your efficiency determines the efficiency of the team. Therefore, the first thing to optimize is yourself."

Everyone needs an organizational system to track goals, priorities, and tasks. The majority of successful CEOs that Mochary knows use the system outlined in David Allen's "Getting Things Done: The art of stress-free productivity."

## The GTD System Essence

While Allen's book is dense and worth reading in its entirety, the essence of his system is elegantly simple yet profoundly effective:

**Each day, process every single item in your Inbox** (defined broadly as all Inboxes [email, Slack, text] and all to-do's). 

The two-minute rule:
- If the action takes <2 minutes to complete, do it immediately
- If not, write down what the required action is, and place it on one of the following lists

## The Six Lists That Run Your Life

### 1. Next Actions

These are the next tasks on your priority list separated into areas of context. The key innovation is **context-based organization**:

**Computer** (actions where you need access to your computer)
- Write first draft of 10-year Company Vision and 3-month Roadmap
- Write first draft of Sales Playbook

**Calls** (phone calls that can be completed when you don't have access to a computer, eg- riding in a car)
- John 650-555-3452 - schedule company offsite
- Mary 415-555-1234 - review draft financing docs, paragraph by paragraph

**Outside** (actions that can only be completed outside, such as errands)
- Walgreens - pick up prescription

**Home** (actions that can only be completed at home)
- Clean out garage

**The Critical Principle**: Tasks should be written as single actions (as opposed to broad goals). The key is to not have to think about what needs to be done again once the Next Action has been written down. **The Next Action should be written so clearly that all you need to do is follow its direction when you read it next.**

### 2. Waiting For

This is the list of things that you have asked others to do, and are waiting for them to complete. 

**Structure**: List the person to whom you have delegated, the requested action, and the date on which you made the request.

**Examples**:
- Sarah - feedback on Sales Playbook, 3-18
- Jim - Write-up issue for next Leadership Team Meeting, 3-19
- Bill - time to meet, 3-19

**The Power**: You can easily scan your Waiting For list and see which aging requests are still outstanding. Move these aging requests to your Next Action list and ask the person again for the item.

### 3. Someday/Maybe

This is the list of things that you one day want to do, but don't need to get done now.

**Examples**:
- Schedule a guitar lesson
- Order the book Getting Things Done by David Allen

**The Purpose**: Captures aspirational items without them cluttering your active lists.

### 4. Agenda

**The Inefficiency Problem**: Inefficient leaders waste a lot of time reaching out about, or responding to, one-off issues in real-time. 

**The Solution**: A much more efficient method is to batch your issues and discuss them all at once. This does not apply for urgent issues—those need to be addressed immediately. But by addressing many issues on a regular basis, soon urgent issues will disappear.

**How to Use Agenda Lists**: This is your list of regular meetings. When you think of something that you want to discuss with someone with whom you meet regularly, write it down on your Agenda list. Then, when you meet with that person, check your Agenda list and review everything accumulated there.

**Examples**:

**Spouse**
- What should we do for our winter holiday?
- Connect - listen to each other's day for 10 minutes each

**Leadership Team**
- Are we having enough fun?
- 10-year Company Vision
- 3-month Company Roadmap

### 5. Projects

This list is for projects that have more than one Next Action that can only be done one after the other (serially). 

**The Method**: 
- Write out all of the Next Actions required to get to completion
- Then simply add them chronologically to your Next Actions list as the previous action is completed

### 6. Review

This is your cadence for reviewing the lists above.

**The Schedule**:
- **Daily**: Next Action and Waiting For
- **Weekly**: Someday/Maybe, Agenda and Projects

**Implementation Tip**: Use your calendar to schedule Next Actions that need to happen on a certain day or at a certain time. Mochary recommends that you actually put your reviews in your calendar.

## Beyond GTD: The Goals List

### 7. Goals (Not Part of Allen's GTD)

"This is not part of Allen's GTD, but I use it and find it very helpful."

Later in the book, Mochary recommends creating:
- 10 Year Vision for your company
- Quarterly OKRs for the company
- Department, Team and Individual quarterly OKRs

**The Practice**: Keep a copy of this Vision and these OKRs on the Goals list. Refer to it regularly to flesh out your Next Action list.

## Tools for Implementation

There are many tools that will help you maintain a GTD system:
- **Simple**: Evernote
- **Potent**: Omnifocus

**The Key**: Choose one that fits your level of willingness to learn new functionality.

## The Transformation Effect

When you implement GTD properly:
1. **Nothing falls through the cracks** - Every commitment is captured
2. **Your mind is freed** - No need to remember tasks
3. **Context switching is minimized** - Work on computer tasks when at computer
4. **Delegation is tracked** - Waiting For list ensures follow-through
5. **Long-term thinking is enabled** - Goals list connects daily work to vision

## Common Implementation Mistakes

1. **Writing vague Next Actions** - "Work on sales" vs "Draft first three slides of sales deck"
2. **Not dating Waiting For items** - Can't identify what's aging
3. **Mixing contexts** - Putting computer tasks on your Calls list
4. **Skipping reviews** - Lists become stale and unreliable
5. **Not capturing everything** - Partial implementation fails

## The CEO's GTD Advantage

As a CEO, GTD is particularly powerful because:
- You have more inputs than anyone else in the company
- Your efficiency directly impacts team efficiency
- You set the example for organizational discipline
- Your ability to follow through affects company execution

## Decision Framework

When processing any item:
1. **Can I do this in under 2 minutes?** → Do it now
2. **Is this actionable?** → Create specific Next Action
3. **Am I waiting on someone?** → Add to Waiting For with date
4. **Is this for a future meeting?** → Add to appropriate Agenda
5. **Is this a multi-step project?** → Break down and add to Projects
6. **Is this aspirational?** → Add to Someday/Maybe

## Implementation Guide

**Week 1**: 
- Set up your six lists (plus Goals)
- Process your entire inbox to zero
- Schedule daily and weekly reviews

**Week 2**: 
- Refine your Next Action writing (make them crystal clear)
- Start using context lists when in those contexts

**Week 3**: 
- Add dates to all Waiting For items
- Use Agenda lists for all regular meetings

**Week 4**: 
- Full system running
- Notice the mental clarity that comes from trusted lists

## Key Insights

- **Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them**
- **The two-minute rule prevents small tasks from becoming big psychic weights**
- **Context-based lists minimize transition time and maximize flow**
- **Clear Next Actions eliminate the need to re-think tasks**
- **Regular reviews keep the system trustworthy and current**
- **Adding a Goals list bridges the gap between daily tasks and long-term vision**
