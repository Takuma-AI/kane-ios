## The Core Philosophy

"There are many ways to create a company, but only one good one: To deeply understand real customers (living humans!) and their problem, and then solve that problem."

Starting a company is fundamentally about **solving real problems for real people**. Mochary immediately directs founders to Bill Aulet's "Disciplined Entrepreneurship" for the tactical details of customer discovery, but the principle is clear: everything begins with understanding human needs deeply.

## The Emotional Reality of Starting

### The Solo Founder Trap

Starting a company is hard. The burden includes:
- Long hours that stretch your physical limits
- Constant fear of failing that gnaws at your confidence
- Many rejections that test your resilience
- An emotional weight that can crush solo founders

**The data is clear**: Solo founders have high rates of burnout. The emotional burden is just too high. As with any trend, there are exceptions—but the rule generally holds.

### The Co-Founder Solution

YCombinator has a **strong bias toward accepting co-founder teams** (versus solo founders) for this reason. Their logic is compelling:

> "Owning much of something is better than owning 100% of nothing."

**Find a partner**, someone who has complementary skills to yours. Share the emotional burden with them. That will ease the load significantly. Give up a large percentage of the company. **It's worth it.**

#### The Purpose of a Co-Founder

Your partner's purpose is **not to be value-add forever**. As your company grows, you will likely find people with far greater skills whom you will hire. That's OK. 

**Your co-founder's purpose is to help you achieve success in your march to Product-Market Fit.** Once you get there and begin the blitz-scaling process, be pleased if they continue to add value beyond that point—but don't expect it.

### The 50/50 Partnership Mistake

When you do find a partner, **avoid one cardinal mistake: do not create a 50/50 partnership**. 

While 50/50 sounds like an ideal, it actually leads to real pain if there is no easy way to break a deadlock. Unanimous decisions are tiresome to create day after day after day. **Knowing that one person has the ability to decide actually eases the burden for all involved**, and leads to far better outcomes.

**Real-world evidence:**
- Alex MacCaw (Clearbit): "This is key. Two of my previous companies were destroyed by a 50/50 split."
- Peter Reinhardt (Segment) offers a nuanced counterpoint: "There are ways to avoid deadlock (e.g. third co-founder with small stake), and splitting evenly aside from that has been totally fine in my experience."

### The Solo Founder Exception

There is a big exception. If you:
- Have done this before
- Have the majority of skills needed (technical, social, financial)
- Are a masochist

Then by all means begin on your own. As Alex MacCaw notes: "The key for me in doing it alone is a strong friend group that supports me."

## The Team Complexity Paradox

### The Geometric Cost of Growth

While it's critical to have a partner to share the emotional burden, **each additional team member adds complexity in geometric fashion**. 

Each new member must somehow grok:
- The priorities
- The vision
- The actions of other team members

The more team members you have, the geometrically harder it becomes to:
- Share what is currently going on with everyone
- Have everyone emotionally bought in to decisions being made

**Do not underestimate this cost. It is much larger than most founders think.**

### The Magic Number: Six

YC has another strong belief: **Founding teams should never grow beyond six until there is true product-market fit.**

For B2B companies, this means greater than $1mm in recurring revenue.

## Why Stay Small? Three Critical Reasons

### 1. Morale Dynamics

**The Large Team Problem:**
- When someone joins a 10+ person company, they expect stability
- When you launch and customers don't instantly rave (which is what will happen), the team becomes demoralized
- It doesn't matter how many times you've announced you're still a startup—they hear the words but don't internalize them

**The Small Team Advantage:**
- With six or fewer people, the environment feels like a team in battle
- Chaos is expected
- When chaos is encountered, the team meets it with glee
- People who join small teams crave the challenge—they want things to be hard

### 2. Communication and Organization

**Small Team Reality:**
- When you're a few people in a room, you all know what each other is working on
- Information sharing happens by osmosis
- No formal management system required
- Tremendous time and headspace savings

**Large Team Reality:**
- Once you can't sit next to each other (20+ people or even one remote worker)
- Information-sharing by osmosis disappears
- Formal management system becomes mandatory
- Overhead of one full day per week—for everyone!

### 3. Efficiency Through Constraints

**Small Team Coding:**
- No choice but to write "prototype code"
- Code meant only to create a prototype
- Accepts technical debt as reality

**The Prototype Mindset:**
- Your first product should always be viewed as a prototype
- You're using it to gather customer feedback only
- Feedback will vastly alter what your product is
- Often becomes a completely different product
- All effort put into beautiful initial code will likely be wasted

**If you are small, there will be no temptation to write beautiful unnecessary code.**

## The Investor Pressure Trap

If you're in Silicon Valley with a large potential market, you'll be able to raise significant capital early. This allows you to hire many people. Investors may pressure you to do so to "win the race to market share."

**Resist this pressure. It is misplaced.**

> "Startups don't usually fail because they grow too late. They usually fail because they grow too early (i.e., before they have achieved Product Market Fit)."

## Understanding Product-Market Fit

### Definition
Product-Market Fit means having created a product that customers find so much value in that they are willing to both:
1. Buy it (after their test phase)
2. Recommend it

### Key Metrics
- Revenue
- Renewal rates
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)

### The Reality Check

**The first goal of the company should be to achieve real PMF**, not metrics that fool people inside and outside the company that PMF has been achieved.

**B2B Warning:** Enterprise customers have budgets just for testing new technology. They will buy your product just to test it. This does not mean you have achieved PMF. Only long-term contracts indicate they actually value your product and want to use it.

**The Benchmark:** For a B2B company, it's hard to imagine PMF at anything less than $1mm ARR.

## The Scaling Playbook

### When to Scale

Once you have achieved Product-Market Fit, **that is the right time to blitz scale** and win the race to market share.

### What Scaling Requires

To scale successfully, you need to:
- Create massive awareness (Marketing)
- Walk customers through sales process (Sales)
- Hold customers' hands during setup (Customer Success)
- Harden infrastructure for many users (DevOps)
- Eliminate technical debt and add features (Engineering)
- Update product roadmap for urgent needs (Product)
- Handle non-technical operations (People, Finance, Legal, Office)

**All of this requires hiring talented and experienced people. First raise the money, then begin hiring.**

### The Breaking Point

Once you bring on remote workers and scale beyond 15-20 people, **things will begin to fall apart**:
- You'll hire very talented people who won't perform as hoped
- You'll do more work yourself
- You'll work longer hours just to keep afloat
- You'll extrapolate the trend and realize you'll soon break

**It is at that moment that you need to implement a formal management system.**

### The Management System Reality

The transition will be painful:
- You can no longer just "work on the product"
- You and your team will spend one full day per week on meetings
- These meetings will feel like pure overhead
- They are overhead
- **And without them, your company will never scale successfully**

### The Good News

The same system that allows your company to operate well with 25 people will also allow it to work well with 25,000. Neither the system nor the amount of overhead will change. **It is a one-time hit.**

## Decision Framework

When making early company decisions, ask:
1. **Do I have a co-founder to share the emotional burden?**
2. **Have we avoided a 50/50 deadlock structure?**
3. **Are we staying under 6 people until true PMF?**
4. **Are we resisting investor pressure to scale prematurely?**
5. **Do we have clear evidence of PMF beyond just revenue?**

## Key Insights

- **The emotional burden of starting a company alone is usually too high to sustain**
- **Team complexity grows geometrically, not linearly**
- **Small teams thrive on chaos; large teams expect stability**
- **Premature scaling kills more startups than late scaling**
- **Management overhead is painful but necessary—embrace it when the time comes**
