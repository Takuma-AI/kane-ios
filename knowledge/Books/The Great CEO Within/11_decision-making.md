## The Core Philosophy

"No matter how original and innovative your ideas might be, and no matter how efficient and productive your own habits might be, you won't be able to build a truly exceptional organization alone. Your company's success depends on how well its members work together."

This chapter presents three revolutionary concepts for group decision-making: writing over talking, creating buy-in through involvement, and the RAPID framework for complex decisions.

## Writing vs Talking: The Efficiency Revolution

### The Multiplier Problem

"When two people are discussing an issue, the need to be efficient is important. When a team is discussing an issue, the need to be efficient is paramount, because each inefficient minute is multiplied by the number of people in the discussion."

### The Written Method

**The requirement**: Anyone who wants to discuss an issue must write it up, along with the desired solution, ahead of time.

**The goal**: Be thorough enough that at the time of decision-meeting, there are few or no questions.

### Two Paths to Thoroughness

#### 1. The Hard Way
Write an extraordinarily thorough analysis from the get-go.

#### 2. The Easy Way (Recommended)
- Write a draft
- Circulate it to meeting participants before the meeting
- Invite comments and questions
- Write out responses to all comments and questions prior to the meeting

## The Bezos Method

Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, is famous for using this written method:

1. **Pre-meeting requirement**: Anyone wanting to bring up an issue must write it up fully (with counterproposals if necessary)
2. **Meeting structure**: The meeting is spent reading the write-ups
3. **Decision process**: Once everyone has read, a decision is made
4. **Conflict resolution**: If consensus isn't reached, an appointed decision-maker makes the call
5. **Open questions**: If questions remain, assign research and writing for follow-up

**The result**: "This method, though time-consuming for the sponsor, yields extraordinarily thoughtful decisions in a very short amount of time. The extra effort and work by one person creates a net savings in time and energy across the whole group."

## Easing Into Written Culture

Imposing this process on a group is daunting. Here's a gradual approach:

### Stage 1: Write During Meeting
- Reserve first 15 minutes for all participants to write out updates and issues
- Use another 10 minutes for all to read each other's updates
- Then discuss and decide
- Use this method for 2-3 meetings

### Stage 2: Write Before, Read During
- Require all participants write updates and issues prior to meeting
- Do not allow people to bring up unwritten issues
- Use first 10 minutes of meeting for reading
- Use this method for 1-2 meetings

### Stage 3: Full Async Preparation
- Require all participants write by specific time (e.g., 6pm evening before)
- Require all participants read and comment prior to meeting
- People prove they've read by having comments in the docs
- Don't allow comments in meeting if not already in docs
- This makes meetings much more efficient

## Getting Buy-In: The Three Methods

### The Core Challenge

"One of the core challenges in leadership is how to get your team to buy into a decision. It's often easy to make a decision, but it can be much harder to get your team to invest emotionally in that decision."

**From Alex MacCaw of Clearbit**: "It is important for your team to be invested in a decision as otherwise their execution will be half-hearted (or won't even happen)."

### The Buy-In Principle

**You create buy-in when you make people feel they are part of the decision**, and that their input contributes to the final outcome. The more influence they feel they have on the outcome, the more they'll be invested in the final result.

### Method 1: Announce and Explain

Manager makes decision, announces it to team, answers questions.

**Pro**: Takes very little time
**Con**: Creates very little buy-in from team. Gets no benefit from their collective knowledge and experience.

### Method 2: Straw Man Iteration

Manager creates (or assigns) written straw man, shares with team, invites feedback, facilitates discussion, determines final answer.

**Pro**: Creates more buy-in. Gets some benefit from collective wisdom.
**Con**: Takes more time.

### Method 3: Collaborative Creation

Manager invites team to meeting where dilemma is discussed from scratch. Manager and team equally share ideas. Final decision by consensus if possible.

**Pro**: Creates most buy-in. Gets a lot of benefit from collective wisdom.
**Con**: Takes most time, hardest to steer.

### Choosing the Right Method

**The greatest benefits require the most work.** If you want more buy-in and a better decision, you need to take more time.

Selection criteria:
- **Everyday, low-impact issues** (e.g., venue for holiday party): Method 1
- **Major, core issues** (e.g., Company 10-Year Vision): Method 3  
- **Everything in between** (vast majority): Method 2

## Issues and Proposed Solutions Format

### The Requirement

Team members often want to bring up issues and discuss verbally. This is:
- **Inefficient**: Writing takes longer than reading
- **Ineffective**: Only the most forward people speak up

Instead, require written Issues with Proposed Solutions.

### The Format

**Issue**: Detailed description
**Proposed Solution**: Their recommendation

**Critical point**: They must propose a solution even if they "don't know the answer." They should:
- Take a guess
- Even with 10% confidence
- Phrase it in bold, directive terms ("Do this...")

"This may seem aggressive, but creates a flag in the sand which generates a much more productive discussion and a quicker decision-time."

### The Weekly Process

1. All Issues/Proposed Solutions presented at weekly Team Meeting
2. Allow 5 minutes discussion per Proposed Solution
3. If consensus reached: Solution becomes Next Action with DRI and Due Date
4. If not: DO NOT spend more time talking—turn to RAPID framework

## RAPID Decision-Making Framework

Introduced by Emilie Choi (Coinbase) via Bain Consulting, for when:
- Team has become too large for all voices in one room
- Consensus cannot be reached within 5 minutes

### The RAPID Roles

**R (Recommend)** = The one who first proposed the Issue and Solution

**A (Agree)** = Those whose input must be incorporated
- Usually Legal, ensuring no one breaks the law

**P (Perform)** = Those who will have to enact any decision
- Should be heard as they'll implement

**I (Input)** = Those whose input is worth considering
- Valuable perspective but not mandatory

**D (Decide)** = The one who will make the decision
- Type 1 decision (irreversible): Should be CEO
- Type 2 decision (reversible): Should be someone else

### The RAPID Process

1. **Someone identifies** issue needing decision and writes up:
   - The Issue
   - The Proposed Solution  
   - List of people in each RAPID role
   - Section for each person's comments

2. **R reaches out** to all As, Ps, and Is for input

3. **R schedules Decision Meeting**:
   - Urgent: Schedule as needed
   - Non-urgent: Use next Team Meeting (more efficient)

4. **At Decision Meeting**:
   - D reads through document
   - D asks questions if any
   - If answerable in 5 minutes: D decides
   - If not: Request another round of written responses

5. **After decision**:
   - D writes up Decision (or asks R to)
   - Include all Next Actions with DRI and Due Date
   - D publishes decision to company

### RAPID Infrastructure

**Tracking Sheet**: 
- Each RAPID created (with link)
- Who the R and D are
- When Decision Meeting will/did occur
- When all Next Actions completed

**Feedback Doc**:
- Like/Wish That format
- After each Decision Meeting
- Improve process until smooth

## Type 1 vs Type 2 Decisions

### Type 1: Irreversible Decisions
- High stakes
- Difficult or impossible to undo
- Require CEO involvement
- Need maximum input

### Type 2: Reversible Decisions  
- Can be changed later
- Lower stakes
- Should be delegated
- Enable faster movement

## Common Implementation Challenges

### "My Team Won't Write"
Start with Stage 1 (writing during meetings) to build the habit gradually.

### "This Seems Bureaucratic"
The structure enables speed, not slows it. Decisions happen faster with clarity.

### "We're Too Small for This"
Even 3-person teams benefit from written clarity and defined decision rights.

### "Emergency Decisions"
True emergencies bypass process. But most "emergencies" aren't.

## The Compound Benefits

When implemented consistently:
1. **Meeting time drops** by 50-75%
2. **Decision quality improves** through thoughtfulness
3. **Buy-in increases** through involvement
4. **Institutional memory builds** through documentation
5. **Async work becomes possible** at scale

## Integration with Other Systems

### With Written Culture (Chapter 7)
- Decisions become searchable history
- Patterns emerge from past decisions
- Onboarding accelerates with context

### With Transparency (Chapter 14)
- Published decisions create alignment
- RAPID roles clarify authority
- Process visible to all

### With Areas of Responsibility (Chapter 21)
- RAPID roles can map to AORs
- Decision authority clarifies ownership
- Reduces ambiguity in organization

## Decision Framework for Decision-Making

When facing a group decision:
1. **Is this written up with proposed solution?**
2. **What level of buy-in do we need?**
3. **Can we reach consensus in 5 minutes?**
4. **If not, who should be R, A, P, I, D?**
5. **Is this Type 1 or Type 2?**

## Key Insights

- **Written preparation transforms meeting efficiency—one person's effort saves everyone's time**
- **Buy-in comes from involvement—choose your method based on importance**
- **Every issue needs a proposed solution, even a bad one—flags in sand drive progress**
- **RAPID framework scales decision-making beyond consensus without losing input**
- **Most teams resist writing initially but become converts after experiencing the benefits**
- **The goal isn't to slow down decisions but to make better decisions faster**
