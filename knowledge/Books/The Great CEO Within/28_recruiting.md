## The Core Philosophy

"When recruiting, the goal is to find great people and attract them to your company. Since this is so important, you could rationalize throwing lots and lots of time at this problem, and that is what most growing companies do. Unfortunately, this time-suck will grind most of your other functions to a halt."

The key is efficiency through focused time allocation: minimal time with candidates you don't hire, maximum time with those you do.

## The Efficiency Principle

### The Time Allocation Framework

"Remember that each minute you spend with a candidate that you don't hire is a minute that you aren't spending with the team member that you want to hire."

**Optimize for**:
- Quick evaluation of non-fits
- Deep relationship building with potential hires
- Comprehensive onboarding and training

### The Recommended System

"Of all the recruiting systems that I have seen, the best is described in Who, by Geoff Smart and Randy Street."

## Before Recruiting

### The 90-Day Roadmap

As the hiring manager, create:
- Written 90-day roadmap for the position
- All goals expected within first 90 days
- Clear success metrics
- Specific deliverables

**Critical for**:
- Successful onboarding
- Setting clear expectations
- Candidate self-selection
- Performance evaluation

**During interviews**: Share this roadmap to ensure candidate excitement about the goals.

## The Dual Process: Evaluate and Sell

### Building a Relationship

"Just as in fundraising, building a relationship with a recruit will vastly increase the likelihood that she will want to join your company."

**The same four techniques**:
1. Ask about themselves
2. Reflect back what they say
3. Remember for next meeting
4. Express appreciation

**The reality**: "The best candidates can work anywhere. Make sure that they want to work with you."

## The Speed Advantage

### Why Speed Matters

"A recruit wants to feel loved. The easiest way to accomplish that is to have a fast process from start to finish. Each day of delay sends the message 'We don't have conviction about you.'"

### The Investor Parallel

"Which investors were the most compelling for you? The ones that responded and decided quickly, or those that lingered in their decision process for weeks or months?"

**The benchmark**: "Benchmark and Sequoia are famous for making investment offers within days (and sometimes hours) of meeting a company that they are excited about."

## The Streamlined Process

### The 2-Week Sprint

1. **Initial contact** and short phone interview
2. **A-player identified** → Immediately schedule full-day onsite
3. **Full-day onsite** with all needed interviewers
4. **End of day** → Team convenes and decides
5. **Same evening** → "We love you. We want you. Offer pending references."
6. **Verbal negotiation** → "I would join as long as..."
7. **Address requests** → Move to references
8. **Reference checks** → Positive
9. **Final confirmation** → "Would you accept this exact offer?"
10. **Offer ceremony** → Make it memorable

**Total time**: As little as 2 weeks from first contact to accepted offer.

### The Calendar Cadence Advantage

Success requires:
- Dedicated recruiting day
- All interviewers available
- Multiple candidates same day
- Immediate decisions
- Same-day offers

## Compensation Philosophy

### The Market-Based Approach

**Step 1: Discover market compensation**
- What big companies pay (Microsoft, Facebook, Google)
- Role and seniority specific
- Use online compensation studies

**Step 2: Discover living requirements**
- Housing, food, transportation
- Child expenses
- Comfortable living standard

### The Equity Bridge

Formula for equity calculation:
1. Market compensation - Cash needed = Equity value needed
2. Multiply by 4 years = Total equity value
3. Divide by expected growth factor (1-2, typically 1.5)
4. Grant this amount at current valuation

**Example**:
- Market: $300,000 (Google Level 3 Engineer)
- Cash needed: $120,000
- Difference: $180,000
- 4-year value: $720,000
- Divided by 1.5: $480,000 equity grant

### The Three-Option Approach

Give candidates choice in risk/reward:

| Option | Annual Cash | Equity Worth | Expected Value at $1B |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1 | $120,000 | $480,000 | $4,800,000 |
| 2 | $140,000 | $426,666 | $4,266,666 |
| 3 | $160,000 | $361,333 | $3,613,333 |

**The goal**: Candidates who believe in the company choose higher equity options.

**The advantage**: "The investment is made with pre-tax dollars, which doubles its purchasing power."

## Making the Offer

### The Pre-Agreement Process

**Never make an offer without knowing it will be accepted.**

1. Ask: "I will join the company as long as..."
2. Address all requirements
3. Negotiate alternatives if needed
4. Get explicit agreement: "If we offer X, would you accept?"

### Why This Matters

Without pre-agreement:
- Candidates ask for more after offer
- Creates awkward negotiations
- Risks political culture
- Starts relationship negatively

With pre-agreement:
- Clean acceptance
- Positive beginning
- "Yes! Thank you! I'm so excited!"

### The Offer Ceremony

"The granting and accepting of a job offer is a very emotional moment for a person. Making a big deal out of it is a good thing."

**Ceremony elements**:
- In-person offer delivery
- Two-handed presentation with bow
- Company schwag
- Hugs and high-fives
- Make it fun and memorable

## Onboarding Excellence

### The Onboarding Investment

"Most companies spend extraordinary resources of time, money and equity to bring on a new team member, and then almost entirely drop the ball on quickly getting that team member onboarded."

**The logic**: "100% of the people that you spend time with during onboarding are already team members. Focus your energy there!"

### The Onboarding System

1. **Create comprehensive checklist** of all needed information
2. **Document everything** in writing and video
3. **Share early** - even before start date
4. **Include 90-day roadmap**
5. **First day timing** - Start 2 hours after normal (people there to greet)
6. **Assign a buddy** - 15-minute daily check-ins for 2 weeks

## Firing Well

### The Performance Reality

"Inevitably, some team members will not perform even with excellent onboarding, roadmap-creation, feedback, etc."

**The consequences of inaction**:
- Other team members know
- Morale killer for performers
- Financial drain
- Must act for company health

### The Documentation Process

**For teams >10 people**:
1. Create written PIP (Performance Improvement Plan)
2. Objective milestones at 7, 30, 60, 90 days
3. Weekly progress checks
4. Strict enforcement at each milestone
5. No exceptions or credibility lost

**For teams <10 people**: "I recommend simply letting the person go without the PIP. The cost of de-motivating the team is far greater than that of the lawsuit."

### The Compassionate Approach

"When you do fire someone, put yourself in their shoes. It is a devastating event emotionally. And it is a real setback financially."

**Do**:
- Give generous severance (2-3 months)
- Help them find next job
- Make supportive announcement
- Take responsibility publicly
- Praise their contributions

**Don't**:
- Blame or criticize
- Give minimum legally required
- Let anger guide decisions
- Hide the departure

### The Cultural Impact

"Your team will also be watching closely to see how you treat ex-employees; a vindictive attitude will make everyone feel unsafe!"

**Benefits of firing well**:
- Creates culture of safety
- Team performs better
- Glassdoor reviews improve
- Recruiting becomes easier
- Can take more hiring risks
- Can act faster on poor fits

### The Leadership Reflection

"What can I do to make sure this doesn't happen again?"

Focus on improving:
- Recruiting processes
- Training programs
- Management practices
- Cultural fit assessment
