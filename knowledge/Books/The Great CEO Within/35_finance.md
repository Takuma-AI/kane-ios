## The Core Philosophy

"A company needs to track its revenue and expenses (income statement) as well as its assets and liabilities (balance sheet). This task is easy enough in the early days that a full-time person is not needed. So it is best to outsource this function."

Finance in early-stage companies should be outsourced strategically, with a focus on getting CFO-level thinking even when you can't afford a full-time CFO.

## The Two-Part Financial Need

### 1. Basic Accounting
- Track revenue and expenses (Income Statement)
- Track assets and liabilities (Balance Sheet)
- Maintain compliance
- Process transactions

### 2. Strategic Finance
- Create financial projections
- Model operational needs
- Track team metrics
- Provide investor confidence

## The Outsourcing Solution

### The Tool Foundation

"There are SaaS accounting tools (QuickBooks Online is the current default) that make this process seamless."

**Standard stack**:
- QuickBooks Online for accounting
- Automated bank feeds
- Digital receipt tracking
- Cloud-based access

### The Service Layer

"There are many outsourced accounting shops that will do this work offsite for a reasonable fee (less than $2,000 per month)."

## The Onsite Advantage

"However, just like with Legal, the work product improves significantly if the work is done onsite because of better communication and oversight."

**Why onsite matters**:
- Better communication
- Improved oversight
- Faster problem resolution
- Deeper understanding

**The recommendation**: "So choose an outsourced CFO or accounting firm that is willing to send a person to your office (once per month, or week) to do the accounting work."

## CFO vs. Accounting Firm

### The Higher-Level Need

"In addition, a company should be creating a projection of both its finances and its operations (# and type of employees, amount of office space), as well as tracking the metrics of the team."

**What constitutes CFO work**:
- Financial projections
- Operational planning
- Headcount modeling
- Space planning
- Metrics tracking

### The Integrated Solution

"This is considered CFO-level work. And any good CFO can also do the accounting work. So, we recommend hiring an outsourced CFO firm, rather than an outsourced accounting firm."

## The Investor Perspective

"Potential investors take great comfort in seeing that a company has created real projections, which is a signal that the company won't be blindsided by unforeseen occurrences in the future."

**What projections signal**:
- Professional management
- Forward thinking
- Risk awareness
- Operational maturity

## The Optimal Arrangement

### The Recommendation

"So, just like with Legal, we recommend finding a good outsourced CFO early on who will agree to come work at the company for 1 day per month."

### The Economics

"In that amount of time, we find that she can do both the accounting work, as well as the CFO work, and still charge no more than an outsourced accounting firm. ($200/hr for 10 hours = $2,000)."

**What you get for $2,000/month**:
- All accounting work
- CFO-level analysis
- Financial projections
- Operational planning
- Investor-ready reports

### Preferred Provider

"My current favorite outsourced CFO shop in San Francisco is Burkland and Associates."

3. **Remote or onsite?** → Onsite for better results
4. **What's the budget?** → $2,000/month gets both
5. **When to go full-time?** → When complexity demands it
