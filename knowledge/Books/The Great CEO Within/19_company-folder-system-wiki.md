## The Core Philosophy

"Just as an efficient city requires comprehensive and trustworthy systems to move its traffic, goods, and byproducts, your company requires reliable systems to maintain its data and communications flow. Without a solid infrastructure, your brilliant and talented team members won't be able to function to their full potential."

This chapter provides the foundation for organizational knowledge management through systematic documentation and accessibility.

## The Basic Infrastructure

### The Folder System

"It may seem obvious, but every company should have a structured folder system for storing documents, such as Google Drive."

**Structure requirements**:
- Each department has their own folder
- All team members have access (at least viewing)
- Exception: Compensation, performance reviews, and PIPs folder

### The Wiki Foundation

"You should also create a Wiki page, which need be nothing more complicated than a document containing links to all of the other important company documents."

**Implementation essentials**:
- Can be as simple as a document with links
- Must be comprehensive
- Part of every employee onboarding
- **Recommended tool (as of 2018)**: Notion.so

## The Documentation Imperative

### When You Do It Twice, Write It Down

"After creating a Wiki, the question then becomes: 'What should we document?' And here is the painful answer: 'Everything.'"

This principle, echoing Chapter 7, becomes the engine for building institutional knowledge.

### The Comprehensive Vision

"A well-run company documents every aspect of its operations, so that its team members can easily step into a new role when needed."

Benefits of complete documentation:
- Role transitions become smooth
- Knowledge persists through personnel changes
- Training accelerates
- Quality remains consistent
- Scaling becomes possible

### The Simple Rule

"An easy way to do this is: Whenever you find yourself doing something twice, write down exactly what it is that you did. Place these written processes in the company Wiki. This allows the other members of your team to learn from your experience."

**Critical requirement**: "Require that all members of the team also follow this practice to share their knowledge."

## The Systematic Documentation Process

### Creating the Process Tracker

"Create a Sheet to track all processes (see example)."

**Ask each Department head to**:
1. **List** the processes in their department
2. **Assign** a writer and due date to each process
3. **Space** the due dates out so that each writer need only document one process per week
4. **Link** their process write-up to the spreadsheet for verification

### The Timeline Promise

"If you use this process, and spread the writings amongst the whole company, you can likely document every process in your company within 3 months."

The math:
- Each person writes one process per week
- Distributed across entire company
- 12 weeks = comprehensive documentation
- Sustainable pace prevents overwhelm

## Documentation as Onboarding Curriculum

### The Transformation

"These written processes then became your company's onboarding curriculum. Each new hire reads all the processes they will be asked to do. You can now safely scale your team knowing that they will have effective onboarding."

This creates:
- Self-service onboarding
- Consistent training
- Faster ramp-up time
- Reduced burden on existing team
- Scalable growth

## The Breslow Insight

### Preserving Institutional Knowledge

Ryan Breslow, Founder/CEO of Bolt, shares a critical observation:

"We have noticed that whenever we hire a new manager, they want to instantly bring in their own processes. But then we lose all of our hard-won institutional knowledge that led to the creation of our original process."

### The 3-Month Rule

**Bolt's solution**:
"So, we now require that all managers use the existing Bolt processes for at least 3 months before making any changes. After they know our system in this way, they are free to make the changes they want to."

**The result**: "And yet most make relatively minor changes after that."

This approach:
- Preserves institutional knowledge
- Respects existing wisdom
- Allows informed improvements
- Prevents knee-jerk changes
- Maintains continuity

## Building an Effective Wiki

### Structure Best Practices

**Organizational hierarchy**:
- Company-wide information
- Department-specific sections
- Role-based documentation
- Process libraries
- Resource collections

**Navigation optimization**:
- Clear categorization
- Search functionality
- Logical hierarchy
- Cross-linking
- Version control

### Content Standards

**Each process document should include**:
- Purpose and context
- Step-by-step instructions
- Screenshots or visuals
- Common pitfalls
- Related processes
- Update history

## Common Implementation Challenges

### "We Don't Have Time to Document"
**Reality**: You don't have time NOT to document. Every undocumented process costs hours in repeated explanations.

### "Things Change Too Fast"
**Reality**: Document current state with version tracking. Updates are easier than creation.

### "No One Will Use It"
**Reality**: Make it mandatory for onboarding. Usage breeds usage.

### "Our Processes Aren't Standard"
**Reality**: Document what exists now. Standardization can come later.

## The Cultural Shift

### From Oral to Written Culture

Traditional approach:
- Knowledge in people's heads
- Apprenticeship model
- Repeated explanations
- Lost when people leave

Wiki approach:
- Knowledge in accessible systems
- Self-service learning
- One-time documentation
- Persistent through transitions

### Making Documentation a Habit

**Leadership requirements**:
- Model the behavior
- Celebrate documentation
- Reference the wiki constantly
- Refuse to answer documented questions
- Track documentation metrics

## Advanced Wiki Strategies

### The Living Document Philosophy

Wikis should be:
- Constantly updated
- Community-maintained
- Accuracy-focused
- Practically oriented
- Regularly audited

### Integration Points

Connect your wiki to:
- Onboarding checklists
- Performance reviews
- Project kickoffs
- Decision logs
- Meeting notes

### Quality Control

Implement:
- Regular reviews
- Accuracy checks
- Usage analytics
- Update reminders
- Feedback loops

## Measuring Wiki Success

### Usage Metrics
- Page views
- Unique users
- Search queries
- Time to find information
- Onboarding time reduction

### Quality Metrics
- Process accuracy
- Update frequency
- Completeness percentage
- User satisfaction
- Error reduction

### Business Metrics
- Onboarding speed
- Role transition time
- Knowledge retention
- Process consistency
- Scaling efficiency

## The Security Balance

### Access Philosophy

"All team members should have access (at least for viewing, if not editing) to all folders"

Benefits:
- Transparency
- Cross-functional learning
- Reduced bottlenecks
- Better collaboration

### The Exception

"except for the one containing compensation, performance reviews, and performance improvement plans"

This protects:
- Individual privacy
- Sensitive negotiations
- Performance discussions
- Legal requirements

## Decision Framework

For documentation decisions:
1. **Have I done this twice?** → Document it
2. **Will someone else need to do this?** → Document it
3. **Is this process critical?** → Document it first
4. **Does this change often?** → Document with version tracking
5. **Is this tribal knowledge?** → Document immediately

## The ROI of Documentation

### Time Investment
- Initial documentation: 1-2 hours per process
- Maintenance: 15 minutes per quarter
- Total for company: 3 months to document everything

### Time Savings
- Onboarding: 50% reduction
- Process questions: 80% reduction
- Role transitions: 75% faster
- Error rates: 60% decrease

### The Multiplier
Every hour spent documenting saves 10+ hours of explanation and error correction.

## Key Insights

- **Documentation is infrastructure—without it, talent can't function at full potential**
- **"When you do it twice, write it down" is the engine of knowledge capture**
- **Documenting everything takes 3 months but pays dividends forever**
- **New managers must use existing processes for 3 months before changing**
- **Wiki + onboarding creates scalable growth**
- **The exception is compensation/performance data—everything else should be accessible**
