## The Core Philosophy

"Interpersonal conflict arises often. And almost always it is due to people: 1) Not fully sharing their feelings and thoughts, 2) Not feeling heard."

This chapter provides a detailed, step-by-step process for resolving deep interpersonal conflicts and systematic methods for surfacing organizational issues before they become conflicts.

## Understanding the Root of Conflict

### The Two Core Causes

Almost all interpersonal conflict stems from:
1. **Not fully sharing** their feelings and thoughts
2. **Not feeling heard**

### The Downward Spiral

"Most feel hatred for each other, because they feel unheard. For me to respect you, I don't need for you to agree with me. But I do need for you to hear what I have to say."

The destructive cycle:
1. I share my perspective (which I believe to be right)
2. You aren't immediately convinced
3. I assume you didn't really hear or understand
4. You start sharing your perspective
5. I'm unwilling to truly listen because you haven't considered mine
6. The cycle spirals downward to hate and acrimony

### The Simple Fix

"I only need to prove to you that I have 'heard' you. And to do that, I only need to repeat back what you've said (summarized, of course) until you say 'That's right!' Then you will feel heard. You will now be open to hearing what I have to say."

## The Proof Experiment

"Here is an experiment that proves this principle. The next time you encounter a person who is repeating themselves, stop them and ask if you can state back what they've already said. They will say 'yes.' You then summarize what they've said and ask if you got it right. If they say 'yes' again, then watch to see if they continue to repeat themselves. They will not."

This demonstrates:
- People repeat because they don't feel heard
- Acknowledgment stops repetition
- Being heard is more important than agreement

## The Resolution Process

### The Written Method

"To resolve conflict, you only need to get each person to state their deepest, darkest thoughts, and then prove that each has heard what the other has said. This can be done verbally or in writing. I far prefer the written method as it takes about ⅓ the time, requires almost no facilitation (ie- its easy to stay on script), and the action items that come out of it are impeccable agreements."

## The Six-Step Facilitated Process

### Step 1: Document Creation

**Facilitator says**:
- "Open up a Doc. Please give me (the facilitator) access, but do not give access to the other person yet."
- "On the doc, write 5 categories: Anger (present), Fear (future), Sadness (past), Joy (present and past), Excitement (future)"

**The emotional framework**:
"In every major relationship that we have, we have feelings of Anger, Fear, Sadness, Joy and Excitement."

**The structured format**:
1. **Feeling**: I felt anger when...
2. **Fact**: I saw you doing... (Only what a video camera would see; no opinion, thought or judgment)
3. **Story**: The thought (or judgment) that I had was...

**Example**:
```
Anger:
I felt anger when I saw you walk by me the other day and I didn't hear the word "hello".
The thought that I had was that you purposely ignored me, and thus were really saying "screw you!" to me.
```

### Facilitator's Active Role

As facilitator:
- Look at both docs ensuring correct format
- Encourage separation of fact and judgment
- Ensure specificity about actions and feelings
- Clarify that conclusions are stories, not facts
- Prevent sweeping statements or value judgments

**For reluctant participants**:
"If one or both are reluctant to say anything, which is often the case, you supply the thoughts that you might have if you were in their shoes. Be dramatic. Become an actor. Get into the role. State the thoughts as explicitly as they would appear in your own mind. Use swear words."

The person will guide you: "That's close, but not quite it. The thoughts I have are more like..."

### Step 2: Person A Shares

**The power dynamic consideration**:
"Person A (the person with less power in the relationship) shares access to their doc with Person B."

**The reading process**:
1. Person B reads Joy and Excitement sections first
2. Person B says "thank you" when reading positive thoughts
3. Person B reads first Anger item

**The facilitation script**:
- Facilitator: "Do you want to make Person A feel Anger and have these thoughts?"
- Person B: "No."
- If yes, they shouldn't be in relationship together
- Facilitator to Person A: "What request do you have of Person B?"
- Person A: "Please do the following:..."

**Creating impeccable agreements**:
- Person B writes down action item with initials and due date
- Written plan co-created to prevent future issues
- Both parties contribute until agreement reached
- One writes, other adds "+1" to confirm

**Confirmation**:
- Facilitator: "Do you feel heard? Do you feel that Person B wants to have a positive relationship with you?"
- Person A: "Yes."
- If no, repeat process until yes

### Step 3: Person B Shares

Repeat the same script with roles reversed.

**The result**:
Both Person A and Person B have:
- Affirmed they want positive relationship
- Accepted feedback and created action items

### Step 4: Physical Connection

"When Step 3 is complete, there will usually be a moment of understanding and compassion for each other. When this moment occurs, seal it with a physical connection."

Guidelines:
- If they've hugged before, ask them to hug
- If they've only shaken hands, do that
- Match the appropriate level of physical connection
- This symbolizes new understanding

### Step 5: Process Feedback

Ask each person:
- What did they like that you (as facilitator) did?
- What did they wish you had done differently?

### Step 6: Follow-Up Meeting

Set meeting for 1-2 weeks out with all three parties to:
- Confirm both completed their action items
- Prove real desire for positive relationship
- Address remaining Anger and Fear items

## Advanced Facilitation Techniques

### Handling Resistance

When participants won't open up:
- Model the emotions yourself
- Use dramatic language
- Include profanity if appropriate
- Make it safe to be raw

### Managing Power Dynamics

- Always have less powerful person share first
- Watch for subtle power plays
- Ensure equal air time
- Protect vulnerable sharing

### Document Structure

The reordering trick:
- Write in chronological emotional order
- Cut/paste Joy and Excitement to top
- Creates receptive mindset for difficult content

## Issue Identification Methods

"There are two excellent ways that I know of to encourage people to identify the key issues in the company that need to be solved."

While the chapter mentions these two ways, the specific methods would be detailed in subsequent sections.

## The Science Behind the Method

### Why Five Emotions?

The framework covers the full emotional spectrum:
- **Anger** (present violations)
- **Fear** (future concerns)
- **Sadness** (past wounds)
- **Joy** (positive present/past)
- **Excitement** (positive future)

### Why Written?

Written processing:
- Takes ⅓ the time of verbal
- Creates clearer thinking
- Provides documentation
- Reduces emotional escalation
- Enables reflection before sharing

### Why This Order?

1. Private processing first (safety)
2. Positive before negative (receptivity)
3. Less powerful first (psychological safety)
4. Specific requests (actionable outcomes)
5. Physical connection (emotional seal)
6. Follow-up (accountability)

## Common Pitfalls

### Skipping the Positive
Never skip Joy and Excitement—they create the foundation for hearing difficult feedback.

### Allowing Vagueness
Insist on specific facts vs. stories. Vagueness perpetuates misunderstanding.

### Rushing the Process
Each person needs to fully express before moving forward.

### No Follow-Through
Without Step 6, old patterns quickly reemerge.

## Organizational Applications

### Beyond Two-Person Conflicts

This process scales to:
- Team dynamics issues
- Department rivalries
- Co-founder disputes
- Board-CEO tensions

### Preventive Use

Run quarterly relationship check-ins:
- Before conflicts escalate
- Maintains relationship health
- Surfaces issues early
- Builds communication skills
