## The Core Philosophy

You don't need to change everything at once. Shape Up can be adopted incrementally, starting with whatever aspect makes most sense for your situation. The key is building momentum through successful experiments.

**The fundamental principle:** "You don't need to change everything all at once."

## Three Starting Options

### Option A: One Six-Week Experiment

The most comprehensive approach for teams ready to try the full process.

**When to use:**
- Product team open to change
- Can dedicate resources
- Want to prove the concept
- Need visible wins

**Steps to implement:**

1. **Shape one significant project**
   - Comfortable fit in six weeks
   - Be conservative on first run
   - Allow extra time buffer
   - Clear problem and solution

2. **Carve out dedicated team time**
   - One designer
   - Two programmers
   - Full six weeks
   - Guarantee no interruptions

3. **Skip formal betting**
   - Just plan this one project
   - No betting table needed yet
   - Focus on execution

4. **Kick off properly**
   - Present shaped work
   - Include all pitch ingredients
   - Set expectations for autonomy
   - Teams discover own tasks

5. **Create collaboration space**
   - Physical space or chat room
   - Cross-functional team together
   - Close collaboration

6. **Focus on integration**
   - Get One Piece Done early
   - Wire UI and code together
   - Build momentum

**What to skip initially:**
- Mapping the Scopes (comes naturally later)
- Hill Charts (add when comfortable with scopes)
- Multiple projects
- Formal betting process

"You should see a big leap in progress just by dedicating uninterrupted time, shaping the work in advance, and letting the team work out the details."

**Building on success:**
"With credibility gained from a good outcome, it'll be easier to lobby for a bigger change and convert the wider team to working this way."

### Option B: Start with Shaping

For situations where you can't control team allocation.

**When to use:**
- CTO controls programmer time
- Can't get six-week commitment
- Current process is chaotic
- Need to prove value first

**The approach:**
- Shape compelling project
- Create clearer boundaries than usual
- Present through existing process
- Let quality shine through

"Better-shaped work can shine a light on the engineering team and help them open up to things like longer cycles or a more deliberate betting process."

**Benefits:**
- Shows value of preparation
- Reduces project chaos
- Builds shaping credibility
- Opens door for more changes

### Option C: Start with Cycles

For teams ready to change their rhythm but not their process.

**When to use:**
- Currently using short sprints
- Planning overhead is high
- Teams lack momentum
- Process is otherwise working

**The change:**
- Move from two-week sprints to six-week cycles
- Keep existing practices
- Reduce planning meetings
- Give time for momentum

"This removes the overhead of constant planning meetings and gives programmers more time to build momentum and hit their stride."

**Natural evolution:**
"Once the team has more room to breathe, it'll be natural to think more about how to shape the work to take advantage of this new capacity."

## Strategic Principles

### Fix Shipping First

"Build your shipping muscles before you worry too much about improving your research or discovery process."

Why shipping comes first:
- Best insights worthless without execution
- Shipping builds confidence
- Creates rhythm and momentum
- Proves the team can deliver

"You can have the best customer insight in the world, but if you can't turn it into a project and ship, it won't matter."

The sequence:
1. Get team finishing things
2. Establish shipping rhythm
3. Then improve inputs
4. Shape better projects

### Focus on the End Result

**The worry:**
"What if they don't use up all the time we dedicate for the cycle? What if one of the programmers or designers sits idle at some point in the cycle?"

**The mindset shift:**
"Shift the mindset from the micro to the macro."

Key questions:
- How will we feel after six weeks?
- Did we ship something meaningful?
- Did everyone make progress?
- Are we better than before?

"It doesn't matter what exactly happened down at the scale of hours or days along the way. It's the outcome that matters."

**Success looks like:**
- Projects ship on time
- Everyone feels progress
- Team has momentum
- Customers get value

## Common Concerns

### "Our situation is different"

Every team thinks they're unique, but the core problems are universal:
- Projects that drag on
- Unclear requirements
- Constant interruptions
- No sense of progress

Shape Up addresses these regardless of context.

### "We can't dedicate six weeks"

Start smaller:
- Try four weeks
- Or even three
- Keep cycles consistent
- Build from there

The principle matters more than the specific duration.

### "Management won't approve"

Start with experiments:
- One project
- Volunteer team
- Show results
- Build from success

Evidence beats arguments.

## Implementation Patterns

### For Agile Teams

Moving from Scrum/Agile:
- Replace sprints with cycles
- Transform backlog into bets
- Convert stories into shaped work
- Keep retrospectives as cool-down

### For Waterfall Teams

Moving from Waterfall:
- Keep upfront thinking (shaping)
- Add time boundaries
- Increase team autonomy
- Enable course correction

### For Chaos

Moving from ad-hoc:
- Start with any structure
- Even loose shaping helps
- Any cycle length better than none
- Build habits gradually

## Measuring Success

### Early Indicators
- Team morale improves
- Fewer urgent interruptions
- Projects actually finish
- Less management overhead

### Long-term Benefits
- Predictable delivery
- Higher quality output
- Better team retention
- Strategic progress

## Key Insight

"When projects ship on time and everyone feels they made progress, that's the success. It doesn't matter what exactly happened down at the scale of hours or days along the way."

## The Journey

Shape Up adoption is itself a project:
1. **Start somewhere** - Pick an approach
2. **Run experiment** - Learn by doing
3. **Show results** - Build credibility
4. **Expand gradually** - Add more practices
5. **Adapt as needed** - Make it yours

Remember: "First get the team into a rhythm of finishing things."
