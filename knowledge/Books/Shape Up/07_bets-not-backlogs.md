## The Core Philosophy

Instead of maintaining an ever-growing backlog of ideas, Shape Up uses a betting system where a small number of shaped projects compete for resources each cycle. This fundamental shift eliminates the burden of backlog management while ensuring only timely, well-considered work gets scheduled.

**The key insight:** "Backlogs are a big weight we don't need to carry."

## The Problem with Backlogs

### The Growing Pile

"Dozens and eventually hundreds of tasks pile up that we all know we'll never have time for. The growing pile gives us a feeling like we're always behind even though we're not."

### False Obligations

"Just because somebody thought some idea was important a quarter ago doesn't mean we need to keep looking at it again and again."

### Time Waste

"The time spent constantly reviewing, grooming and organizing old ideas prevents everyone from moving forward on the timely projects that really matter right now."

## Mental Model: Betting vs. Planning

**Traditional Thinking:** Maintain comprehensive list of everything we might do

**Shape Up Thinking:** Consider only a few well-shaped options each cycle

### The Betting Table

"Before each six-week cycle, we hold a betting table where stakeholders decide what to do in the next cycle."

What's on the table:
- Pitches from the last six weeks
- Any pitches purposefully revived and lobbied for
- Nothing else

"There's no giant list of ideas to review. There's no time spent grooming a backlog of old ideas. There are just a few well-shaped, risk-reduced options to review."

## The Power of Letting Go

### If We Don't Bet

"If we decide to bet on a pitch, it goes into the next cycle to build. If we don't, we let it go. There's nothing we need to track or hold on to."

### When Timing Isn't Right

"What if the pitch was great, but the time just wasn't right? Anyone who wants to advocate for it again simply tracks it independently—their own way—and then lobbies for it six weeks later."

No central tracking needed—advocates manage their own lists.

## Decentralized Lists

### The Alternative to Central Backlogs

"We don't have to choose between a burdensome backlog and not remembering anything from the past. Everyone can still track pitches, bugs, requests, or things they want to do independently without a central backlog."

### How Different Teams Track

- **Support:** List of requests that come up frequently
- **Product:** Ideas they hope to shape in future cycles
- **Programmers:** Bugs they'd like to fix when time permits

"There's no one backlog or central list and none of these lists are direct inputs to the betting process."

### Cross-Pollination

"Regular but infrequent one-on-ones between departments help to cross-pollinate ideas for what to do next."

Example flow:
1. Support tells Product about top customer issues
2. Product tracks these independently
3. Product might shape one issue for betting
4. Future one-on-ones revisit unaddressed issues

## Why This Works

### Distributed Responsibility

"This approach spreads out the responsibility for prioritizing and tracking what to do and makes it manageable."

Benefits:
- Each department advocates for their priorities
- Everyone uses methods that work for them
- No central bottleneck
- Natural filtering of ideas

### Fresh Conversations

"This way the conversation is always fresh. Anything brought back is brought back with a context, by a person, with a purpose. Everything is relevant, timely, and of the moment."

## The Truth About Ideas

### Ideas Are Cheap

"It's easy to overvalue ideas. The truth is, ideas are cheap. They come up all the time and accumulate into big piles."

### Important Ideas Come Back

"Really important ideas will come back to you. When's the last time you forgot a really great, inspiring idea?"

The natural filter:
- Great ideas are memorable and resurface
- Mediocre ideas fade away
- Real problems get re-reported by customers
- Persistent issues motivate shaping and pitching

### The Signal in the Noise

"If you hear it once and never again, maybe it wasn't really a problem. And if you keep hearing about it, you'll be motivated to shape a solution and pitch betting time on it in the next cycle."

## Decision-Making Framework

When considering whether to track something:
1. **Is this problem recurring?** Or a one-time mention?
2. **Am I willing to advocate for this?** In six weeks?
3. **Does this deserve shaping time?** Or is it just an idea?
4. **Will I remember this if it matters?** Without writing it down?

## The Benefits

### For Leadership
- No backlog reviews to schedule
- Meetings are short and productive
- Focus on current possibilities
- Clear decision points

### For Teams
- No guilt about old tickets
- Fresh problems to solve
- Clear priorities each cycle
- No "someday maybe" distractions

### For Advocates
- Clear path to get ideas considered
- Motivation to shape before pitching
- Natural quality filter
- Ownership of priorities

## Common Concerns and Responses

### "But we'll forget important things!"

Reality: Important things come back. If they don't come back, they weren't that important.

### "Customers will be upset we're not tracking their requests"

Reality: When customers have real problems, they'll tell you again. Tracking doesn't equal solving.

### "We need visibility into everything requested"

Reality: Visibility into hundreds of items you'll never do creates false expectations and wastes time.

## Real-World Application

### For Product Managers
- Keep personal list of potential projects
- Only shape what you'd bet on
- Let go of ideas that don't excite
- Trust important problems to resurface

### For Support Teams
- Track patterns, not every request
- Advocate for top issues in one-on-ones
- Provide context when problems recur
- Don't promise tracking equals action

### For Developers
- Maintain your own bug list
- Fix what you can during cool-down
- Pitch larger fixes for cycles
- Let go of perfectionism

### For Leadership
- Run efficient betting tables
- Evaluate current options only
- Don't maintain master lists
- Trust the system to surface priorities

## Key Insight

"Backlogs are big time wasters too. The time spent constantly reviewing, grooming and organizing old ideas prevents everyone from moving forward on the timely projects that really matter right now."

## The Betting Mindset

This approach requires a fundamental shift:
- From comprehensive tracking to selective memory
- From central control to distributed advocacy
- From obligation to opportunity
- From accumulation to curation
