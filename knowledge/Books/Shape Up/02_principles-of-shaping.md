## The Core Philosophy

Shaping is about finding the perfect level of abstraction for defining work—not too vague and not too concrete. It's the critical pre-work that happens before betting, where we craft a solution that gives teams both clear direction and creative freedom.

**The fundamental insight:** "When we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of abstraction: not too vague and not too concrete."

## The Problem with Traditional Approaches

### Wireframes Are Too Concrete

When design leaders go straight to wireframes or high-fidelity mockups, they create multiple problems:

- **No room for creativity:** "I'll give a wireframe to my designer, and then I'm saying to her: 'I know you're looking at this, but that's not what I want you to design. I want you to re-think it!' It's hard to do that when you're giving them this concrete thing."
- **Estimation errors:** "Counterintuitive as it may seem, the more specific the work is, the harder it can be to estimate."
- **Hidden complexities:** Making the interface "just so" can require solving implementation details that weren't visible in the mockup
- **Inflexible scope:** Teams can't reconsider expensive design decisions

### Words Are Too Abstract

At the other extreme, vague project definitions fail differently:

- **Ambiguity:** "Build a calendar view" or "add group notifications" sound sensible, but what exactly do they entail?
- **No boundaries:** Team members don't know what to include or leave out
- **Mind reading required:** "You're solving a problem with no context. You have to be a mind reader. It's like: 'we'll know it when we see it.'"
- **Uncontrolled growth:** Under-specified projects naturally grow out of control

## Mental Model: The Goldilocks Zone of Definition

**Traditional Thinking:** Either specify everything in detail (wireframes) or keep it high-level (user stories)

**Shape Up Thinking:** Find the sweet spot where the solution is defined enough to execute but rough enough to invite creativity

### The Three Properties of Shaped Work

**1. It's Rough**
- "Everyone can tell by looking at it that it's unfinished"
- Open spaces where contributions will go
- Avoids premature commitment to wrong details
- Leaves room for designer and programmer judgment

**2. It's Solved**
- All main elements are present at macro level
- Elements connect together coherently
- Clear direction showing what to do
- Open questions and rabbit holes removed
- Not just a problem statement—an actual approach

**3. It's Bounded**
- Specific appetite (time budget) defined
- Clear indicators of what NOT to do
- Tells the team where to stop
- Specific things deliberately left out

## Case Study: The Dot Grid Calendar

This example perfectly illustrates moving from abstract to properly shaped:

### The Problem
- Customers asking to "add a calendar" to Basecamp
- Full calendar = 6+ months of work
- Only 10% of customers used calendars in past versions
- Appetite: maximum 6 weeks

### The Shaping Process

**Too Abstract:** "Add a calendar view"

**Too Concrete:** Detailed wireframes with dragging, categories, views

**Just Right:** The Dot Grid concept
- Two-month, read-only grid view
- Days with events show dots
- Click dot to see events below
- No dragging, no spanning, no categories

### The Result
"Note how rough the sketch is and how many details are left out. The designer had a lot of room to interpret how this should look and feel. At the same time, note how specific the idea is. It's very clear how it works, what needs to be built, what's in and what's out."

## Who Shapes?

Shaping requires a unique combination of skills:

### Required Capabilities
- **Design thinking:** It's primarily interaction design work
- **Technical literacy:** Judge what's possible, easy, and hard
- **Strategic thinking:** Critical about problems and trade-offs
- **Business context:** Understand customer needs and priorities

### The Process
- **Closed-door creativity:** Private, rough, early work
- **Small collaboration:** Alone or with one close partner
- **Fast movement:** Jump between ideas quickly
- **Frank discussion:** Speak in shorthand with shared context

"It's that kind of private, rough, early work."

## The Two-Track System

### Why Two Tracks?
"You can't really schedule shaping work because, by its very nature, unshaped work is risky and unknown."

### Track Structure
- **Shaping track:** Works on future possibilities
- **Building track:** Executes previously shaped work
- Work on shaping track is private until commitment
- Shapers can shelf or drop work that's not working
- No pressure to show incomplete thinking

## Steps to Shaping

The shaping process follows four main steps:

### 1. Set Boundaries
- Figure out how much time the idea is worth
- Define the problem specifically
- Establish basic constraints

### 2. Rough Out the Elements
- Creative sketching at high abstraction level
- Move fast and explore possibilities
- Output: idea that solves problem within appetite

### 3. Address Risks and Rabbit Holes
- Find holes or unanswered questions
- Amend solution or cut scope
- Specify details only at tricky spots

### 4. Write the Pitch
- Package shaped work formally
- Summarize problem, solution, risks
- Present for betting table consideration

## Decision-Making Framework

When shaping, constantly ask:
1. **Is this too concrete?** Are we limiting creativity?
2. **Is this too vague?** Will the team know what to do?
3. **Have we solved the core problem?** Or just identified it?
4. **What are we explicitly excluding?** To fit the appetite?
5. **Where are the rabbit holes?** What could derail the team?

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Specifying
- Detailed wireframes that box in designers
- Pixel-perfect mockups before understanding the problem
- Technical implementation details too early

### Under-Specifying
- "Build a calendar" without defining which tenth
- Feature lists without connections
- Problems without solutions

### Wrong Abstraction Level
- UI details when structure isn't clear
- Technical architecture before interaction model
- Visual design before information hierarchy

## Real-World Application

### For Shapers
- Use breadboarding for logic flows
- Try fat marker sketches for visual concepts
- Keep drawings rough and unfinished
- Focus on elements and connections, not pixels

### For Teams Receiving Shaped Work
- Expect rough edges and open spaces
- Look for the core elements to preserve
- Understand what's explicitly out of bounds
- Use your expertise within the boundaries

### For Stakeholders
- Judge shaped work by clarity, not polish
- Look for solved problems, not just good ideas
- Evaluate if boundaries match appetite
- Check that rabbit holes are addressed

## Key Insight

"Work that's too fine, too early commits everyone to the wrong details. Designers and programmers need room to apply their own judgment and expertise when they roll up their sleeves and discover all the real trade-offs that emerge."
