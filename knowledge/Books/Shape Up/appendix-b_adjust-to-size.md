## The Core Philosophy

Shape Up's principles are universal, but the specific practices need to adapt to your organization's size. The key is separating the fundamental truths from the implementation details and adjusting accordingly.

**The fundamental insight:** "To apply Shape Up to your company, it helps to separate out the basic truths from the specific practices."

## Universal Truths vs. Specific Practices

### The Basic Truths (Apply to Everyone)

**1. Work Needs Shaping**
"Work has to come from somewhere, and it takes work to figure out what the right work is."

Universal realities:
- Someone must define the work
- Trade-offs happen somewhere
- Unclear work creates problems
- Better to shape early than scramble late

"If we don't make trade-offs up front by shaping, the universe will force us to make trade-offs later in a mad rush when we're confronted by deadlines, technical limitations, or resource constraints."

**2. Commitments Need Boundaries**
"The consequences of making unclear or open-ended commitments are the same for everyone."

Regardless of size:
- Open-ended work expands
- Clear boundaries enable focus
- Circuit breakers prevent overruns
- Deliberate bets beat accidental obligations

**3. Unknowns Exist**
"There will be unknowns to deal with whether you track them on a hill chart or not."

Always true:
- Distinguish known from unknown
- Sequence work appropriately
- Reserve capacity for discovery
- Problems emerge during building

### The Specific Practices (Vary by Size)

These are scale-dependent:
- Six-week cycles
- Cool-down periods
- Formal betting tables
- Dedicated shaping role
- Structured pitches
- Separate tracks

## Small Enough to Wing It

### The Two-to-Three Person Reality

"When your team is just two or three people, everybody does a bit of everything."

Characteristics:
- Multiple hats per person
- Constant context switching
- Interruptions are normal
- Direct communication

"The person doing the programming might also be answering customer requests and dealing with an infrastructure issue all at the same time."

### Why Structure Doesn't Fit

**Communication is instant:**
"You can drop something in the group chat or talk about it in person and everyone's immediately on the same page."

**Flexibility is essential:**
- Can't commit six uninterrupted weeks
- Need to respond to urgent issues
- Wearing many hats simultaneously
- Structure becomes overhead

### The Fluid Approach

"A tiny team can throw out most of the structure."

What to keep:
- Shape before building
- Set appetites
- Make deliberate bets
- Distinguish uphill/downhill

What to drop:
- Six-week cycles
- Cool-down periods
- Formal pitches
- Betting table meetings
- Parallel tracks

### How It Works

"Be deliberate about which hat you're wearing and what phase you're in."

The fluid cycle:
1. **Set an appetite** for next piece of work
2. **Shape** what to do
3. **Build** it
4. **Shape** the next thing
5. Repeat

"Your bets might be different sizes each time: maybe two weeks here, three weeks there."

Key principle: "You're still shaping, betting, and building, but you're doing it more fluidly without the rigid structure of cycles and cool-downs."

## Big Enough to Specialize

### When Fluidity Becomes Liability

"After you hire more people, all of this fluidity flips from an asset to a liability."

Signs you've outgrown winging it:
- Ad-hoc meetings proliferate
- Chat discussions get unwieldy
- Coordination eats significant time
- Things slip through cracks
- People work at cross purposes

"Winging it with ad-hoc meetings and chat room discussions doesn't work anymore."

### Time for Structure

"This is when it makes sense to take on the structure of six-week cycles, cool-downs, and a formal betting table."

Why structure helps:
- Predictable rhythm
- Clear responsibilities
- Reduced coordination overhead
- Better resource allocation
- Protected time for deep work

### Specialized Roles Emerge

"With more people available to build, someone needs to carve out more time to do the work of figuring out what to build."

Evolution options:
- **Founder transition:** Spends more time shaping than building
- **Employee elevation:** Designer moves from in-cycle to shaping work
- **Dedicated role:** Someone focuses primarily on shaping

### The Full Implementation

At scale, implement:
- Six-week cycles
- Two-week cool-downs
- Formal betting table
- Separate shaping track
- Written pitches
- Clear team boundaries

## The Transition Zone

### Medium-Sized Challenges

Between "wing it" and "full structure" lies a transition zone where teams often struggle.

Common patterns:
- Some structure, not all
- Partial implementation
- Role confusion
- Process friction

### Gradual Implementation

Consider adopting practices incrementally:
1. **Start with appetites** - Even informal work benefits
2. **Add shaping** - Someone thinks through work first
3. **Try fixed cycles** - Even if shorter than six weeks
4. **Formalize betting** - Make deliberate choices
5. **Add cool-down** - When cycle discipline is strong

## Decision Framework

### Questions to Ask

**Are we small enough to wing it?**
- Can everyone stay aligned informally?
- Is coordination overhead minimal?
- Can we pivot quickly when needed?
- Do people naturally know what to work on?

**Are we big enough for structure?**
- Is coordination eating significant time?
- Are things falling through cracks?
- Do we need predictable schedules?
- Would specialized roles help?

## Common Pitfalls

### For Small Teams
- Adding structure too early
- Rigid adherence to practices
- Losing agility for process
- Over-documenting

### For Large Teams
- Resisting necessary structure
- Half-implementing practices
- Skipping shaping work
- Unclear role definitions

## Key Insight

"The phases of the work still hold true even if you don't work in cycles or have dedicated people to do the shaping and building."

The core remains constant:
- Shape the work
- Make bets
- Build solutions
- Handle unknowns

The implementation varies:
- Fluid vs. structured
- Informal vs. formal
- Combined vs. separate roles
- Variable vs. fixed time
