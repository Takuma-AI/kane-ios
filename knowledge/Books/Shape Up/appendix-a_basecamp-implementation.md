# Appendix A: How to Implement Shape Up in Basecamp

## The Core Philosophy

Basecamp was built to implement the Shape Up method. Instead of scattering work across multiple tools, Basecamp centralizes all project communication, task management, and documentation in one place.

**The fundamental principle:** "We built Basecamp to implement the Shape Up method."

## Setting Up for Shaping

### Create a Team for Shaping

1. **Create a Basecamp Team** for shaping work
   - We call ours "Product Strategy"
   - Keep this space separate from building work

2. **Add the right people:**
   - People doing the shaping
   - Trusted advisors who give feedback on pitches
   - People who bet at the betting table
   - Keep this group small and focused

3. **Post pitches as Messages**
   - Use the Message Board for formal pitches
   - Create a Message Category called "Pitch"
   - We use a light bulb emoji (ðŸ’¡) for the icon

4. **Use Campfire for informal work**
   - Bounce ideas back and forth
   - Coordinate betting table timing
   - Quick discussions between cycles

### Announcing Bets

"We use Basecamp's HQ for thatâ€”a Team in Basecamp that includes the whole company"

After the betting table:
- Post decisions to HQ
- Include all projects for the cycle
- Name team members assigned
- Make it visible company-wide

## Setting Up Cycle Projects

### Create Projects for Each Bet

1. **Create a Basecamp Project** for each six-week project
   - Naming convention: "Cycle 4: Autopay"
   - Prepend cycle name/number for clarity

2. **Add the team members**
   - Designer(s)
   - Programmer(s)
   - Only people actively working on it

3. **Post the kick-off message**
   - First thing on Message Board
   - Include the pitch or shaped concept
   - Reference point for the team

### Using the Chat Room

"The team uses the chat room in the Basecamp project to communicate as they get started"

Early communication:
- Arrange kick-off calls
- Quick questions
- Coordination during orientation
- Real-time problem solving

## Organizing Work with Scopes

### To-Do Lists as Scopes

1. **After orientation and spiking:**
   - Team discovers tasks
   - Maps them into scopes
   - Creates structure

2. **Create To-Do List for each scope**
   - Examples: "Start Autopay" or "ACH Option"
   - Use description field to summarize scope
   - Each list represents completable work

3. **Add tasks to appropriate scopes**
   - Design tasks
   - Programming tasks
   - Example: "Start Autopay" contains:
     - Design the UI
     - Wire to existing billing API

4. **Use task discussions**
   - Post updates on To-Do items
   - Ask questions
   - Share progress

"Repeat as the team discovers new scopes and tasks."

## Implementing Hill Charts

### Enable Hill Tracking

1. **Navigate to each scope** (To-Do List page)
2. **Click options menu** (â€¢â€¢â€¢) in upper right
3. **Select "Track this on the Hill Chart"**
4. **Repeat for all scopes**

This displays the Hill Chart at the top of the To-Dos section with dots for each scope.

### Update Progress

1. **Click "Update"** on the Hill Chart
2. **Drag dots to show progress:**
   - Left side: Unknown (uphill)
   - Peak: Figured out
   - Right side: Known (downhill)
3. **Add annotations** when helpful
   - Explain stuck points
   - Note breakthroughs
   - Communicate context

### View History

"To see the history of updates to the Hill Chart, click the timestamp above the Hill Chart where it says 'last update.'"

Benefits:
- See movement over time
- Identify stuck scopes
- Track velocity patterns
- Async status updates

## Best Practices

### For Shaping Teams
- Keep Product Strategy team small
- Use categories for easy pitch finding
- Include sketches directly in messages
- Maintain separation from building work

### For Building Teams
- Start with kick-off message
- Create scopes as you discover them
- Update Hill Chart regularly (1-2x/week)
- Use chat for quick coordination

### For Managers
- Check Hill Chart history for patterns
- Look for non-moving dots
- Read annotations for context
- Avoid interrupting for status

## The Integration Advantage

"Other tools make it hard to see everything about the project in one place. Basecamp combines chat, messages, to-dos, and documents in one interface that's powerful enough for technical people and friendly enough for everyone else to use."

Benefits:
- Everything in one place
- Equal access for all roles
- No tool switching
- Complete project history

"Programmers, designers, QA and managers feel equally at home and can work together seamlessly on projects."

## Visual Examples

The appendix includes screenshots showing:
- Pitches on the Message Board
- iPad sketches embedded in pitches
- Cycle announcements in HQ
- Project setup screens
- To-Do Lists organized as scopes
- Hill Chart updates and history

## Key Insight

"Instead of scattering our work across multiple tools, Basecamp centralizes all project communication, task management, and documentation in one place."

This centralization is crucial for Shape Up because:
- Shaping work stays separate but accessible
- Teams have full context in one place
- Progress is visible without asking
- History is preserved for learning
