## Query Examples

**For Strategic Decision-Making:**
- "How should we approach setting project timelines?"
- "What's the alternative to maintaining a product backlog?"
- "How do we decide what to build next?"
- "When should we extend a project deadline?"

**For Project Management:**
- "How do we shape work before assigning it to teams?"
- "What's the right level of detail for project specifications?"
- "How do we identify and mitigate project risks?"
- "How should we structure our development cycles?"

**For Team Leadership:**
- "How do we give teams autonomy while maintaining direction?"
- "What's the best way to track progress without micromanaging?"
- "How should we organize work within a project?"
- "When and how should teams cut scope?"

**For Product Development:**
- "What are the different modes of product development?"
- "How do we balance new features with bug fixes?"
- "How should we handle customer feature requests?"
- "What's the right team size for different projects?"

**For Implementation:**
- "How can we adapt Shape Up to our company size?"
- "What tools do we need to implement Shape Up?"
- "How do we transition from our current process?"
- "What are the first steps to trying Shape Up?"

## Core Concepts

**Fixed Time, Variable Scope:** The fundamental principle that time is fixed but scope is flexible, enabling teams to ship on schedule by making trade-offs.

**Shaping:** The pre-work done to define projects at the right level of abstraction‚Äîconcrete enough to know what to do, abstract enough to leave room for creativity.

**Betting:** The process of committing resources to shaped projects, with clear boundaries and expectations, instead of maintaining an ever-growing backlog.

**The Hill Chart:** A visual tool for tracking progress that shows both the uphill phase (figuring things out) and downhill phase (execution).

**Circuit Breaker:** The principle that projects don't automatically get extensions‚Äîif they don't ship in the allocated time, we rethink the approach.

## Reading Guide

For those new to Shape Up, consider this reading order:

1. **Start with Philosophy:** Chapter 1 (Introduction) and Chapter 2 (Principles of Shaping)
2. **Understand the Process:** Chapters 3-6 (The Shaping Track)
3. **Learn the System:** Chapters 7-9 (The Betting Process)
4. **See it in Action:** Chapters 10-14 (The Building Process)
5. **Apply it Yourself:** The Appendices for implementation guidance

## Key Takeaways

Shape Up offers a complete system for product development that addresses common pain points:
- Projects that drag on with no end in sight
- Backlogs that grow infinitely
- Teams without autonomy
- Unclear project definitions
- Lack of strategic focus

The methodology provides concrete techniques (breadboarding, fat marker sketches, hill charts) within a philosophical framework that values programmer and designer expertise, respects time constraints, and focuses on shipping meaningful work.
