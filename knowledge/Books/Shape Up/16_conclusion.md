## Key Concepts

Shape Up is built on a foundation of key concepts that work together as a complete system:

### Shaping
"Shaping is the pre-work we do on projects before we consider them ready to bet on. It's a creative and integrative process, combining interface ideas with technical possibilities and business priorities."

Key aspects:
- Find the right level of abstraction
- Solve problems before betting
- Leave room for creativity
- Address risks upfront

### Appetite
"Instead of asking 'How long will this take?' and trying to estimate, we ask 'How much time do we want to spend?' and design a solution to fit."

The shift:
- From estimates to appetite
- From time discovery to time constraint
- From perfect to good enough
- From endless to bounded

### Betting
"We bet on a small number of projects for six-week cycles and drop the rest. This focuses attention, generates urgency, and ensures we make deliberate decisions about what to work on."

The system:
- Six-week cycles
- Cool-down between
- Circuit breaker default
- Clean slate each cycle

### Building
"We give full responsibility to small teams of designers and programmers. They own the project from start to finish and use their judgment to make trade-offs and get it done."

The approach:
- Whole projects, not tasks
- Vertical integration
- Scope mapping
- Hill charts for progress

## The System in Action

### From Idea to Shipped Work

1. **Raw idea emerges** - From customers, team, or leadership
2. **Appetite is set** - How much is this worth?
3. **Problem is shaped** - Concrete solution within boundaries
4. **Risks addressed** - Rabbit holes identified and patched
5. **Pitch is written** - Complete package for betting
6. **Bet is placed** - Commitment for six weeks
7. **Team takes ownership** - Full responsibility handed over
8. **Work gets integrated** - One piece done early
9. **Scopes emerge** - Natural project organization
10. **Progress shows on hill** - Uphill solving, downhill execution
11. **Scope gets hammered** - Trade-offs to ship on time
12. **Work ships** - Done means deployed
13. **Team moves on** - Clean slate for next cycle

## Cultural Transformation

### What Changes

Shape Up isn't just a process change—it's a cultural shift:

**From:** Endless projects → **To:** Fixed cycles
**From:** Task assignment → **To:** Project ownership  
**From:** Perfect solutions → **To:** Good enough progress
**From:** Estimates → **To:** Appetite
**From:** Backlogs → **To:** Betting
**From:** Status meetings → **To:** Hill charts
**From:** Extending deadlines → **To:** Circuit breakers

### The Human Impact

"Teams love being given more freedom to implement an idea the way they think is best. Talented people don't like being treated like 'code monkeys' or ticket takers."

Benefits for everyone:
- **Teams:** Autonomy and ownership
- **Managers:** Less micromanagement
- **Leadership:** Strategic control
- **Customers:** Regular improvements

## Why It Works

### Fundamental Principles

Shape Up succeeds because it aligns with reality:

1. **Work has uncertainty** - Hill charts acknowledge this
2. **Time is finite** - Fixed cycles enforce this
3. **Perfection is impossible** - Variable scope accepts this
4. **People need autonomy** - Full responsibility provides this
5. **Progress motivates** - Regular shipping ensures this

### The Virtuous Circle

"When teams are more autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing them. With less time spent on management, senior people can shape better projects. When projects are better shaped, teams have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously."

## Common Misconceptions

### It's Not About Speed

"Shape Up isn't about working faster or harder. It's about working more deliberately."

The focus:
- Right problems
- Clear boundaries
- Smart trade-offs
- Sustainable pace

### It's Not Rigid

"While we have standard cycles and team sizes, the process is flexible where it matters."

Flexibility in:
- What to build
- How to build it
- Scope decisions
- Technical choices

### It's Not Just for Software

"The principles apply beyond software development."

Universal concepts:
- Fixed time, variable scope
- Shaping before committing
- Progress through uncertainty
- Moving on after shipping

## Getting Started

### Start Where You Are

"You don't need to change everything at once. Start with one practice and build from there."

Options:
- Try one six-week project
- Start shaping before planning
- Implement hill charts
- Drop the backlog

### Find Your Appetite

"The specific practices—six weeks, two-week cool-down, teams of three—are less important than the principles behind them."

Adapt to your context:
- Different cycle lengths
- Different team sizes
- Different betting processes
- Same core principles

## Final Thoughts

### The Mindset Shift

"Shape Up is as much about changing how we think as it is about changing how we work."

New mental models:
- Projects as bets
- Time as constraint
- Uncertainty as normal
- Shipping as habit

### The Promise

"When you adopt Shape Up, you're making a promise to your team and to yourself: We're going to work on the right things, we're going to work at a sustainable pace, and we're going to ship meaningful improvements regularly."

The payoff:
- Less thrash
- More progress
- Better morale
- Clearer focus

## A Living System

Shape Up isn't a rigid methodology but a living system that adapts and evolves. The principles remain constant while the practices adjust to context. The goal is always the same: **stop running in circles and ship work that matters**.

"The way a team works has an enormous influence on what it can do."

By changing how we work—shaping before betting, betting before building, and moving on after shipping—we change what we can accomplish. Not through heroics or overtime, but through better decisions, clearer boundaries, and consistent execution.

This is Shape Up: a human approach to shipping software that respects both the work and the people doing it.
