## The Core Philosophy

Traditional progress tracking fails because it counts tasks completed without showing what's actually happening: the journey from uncertainty to certainty. The Hill Chart provides a visual metaphor that captures both problem-solving (uphill) and execution (downhill) phases of work.

**The revolutionary insight:** "Work is like a hill. Every piece of work has two phases. First there's the uphill phase of problem solving. You have to work out the approach. You have to choose the paradigm. You have to design the core components. This is where you figure out what you're doing and why. Then once you can see all the way down the other side, you can execute. The downhill phase is just about execution."

## The Problem with Traditional Progress Tracking

### The Tasks That Aren't There

"You can't really know what it will take to solve a problem until you've solved it. Counting tasks completed is a fake measure of progress."

The fundamental issues:
- Imagined tasks â‰  real work
- New tasks discovered constantly
- Unknown unknowns dominate
- Linear progress is illusion

### The Uncertainty Problem

**The Scary Question:** "Are we on track?"

**The Scary Answer:** "I don't know."

"The reason that question is scary is because we have this idea in our heads of a straight line from A to B. Any deviation from that line is a "problem." But we all know that the work doesn't happen in a straight line."

### Why Estimates Don't Show Reality

"Second, when somebody estimates four hours for a task, how do we know that the estimate is correct? And if the estimate is wrong, how much time is the right amount?"

Problems with estimates:
- Don't capture uncertainty
- Binary (done/not done)
- Miss the learning phase
- Hide actual progress

## Mental Model: Work as a Hill

**Traditional Thinking:** Work is a linear progression of tasks

**Shape Up Thinking:** Work is a hill with two distinct phases

### The Two Phases

**Uphill: Figuring Things Out**
- Problem solving
- Design decisions
- Technical approach
- Core components
- Understanding the why

**Downhill: Execution**
- Known approach
- Clear path forward
- Implementation
- Finishing work
- Confidence in completion

"You can't go downhill until you've gone uphill. And the uphill work is where you encounter the unexpected."

## The Hill Chart Visualization

### How It Works

The hill is a visual metaphor:
- Left side: Uphill (solving)
- Peak: Moment of clarity
- Right side: Downhill (executing)
- Horizontal axis: Progress through phases

"To see the status of the project at a glance, we can plot each scope on the hill."

### Reading the Hill

**Scopes on the uphill:** Still figuring out approach
**Scopes at the peak:** Just solved the problem
**Scopes on the downhill:** Confidently executing

"If it's at the top, that means all the unknowns are solved and it's just a matter of finishing the implementation."

## Status Without Asking

### The Communication Revolution

"One of our designers said that she no longer needs to ask 'How's that going?' when she walks by someone's desk. She can just look at the Hill Chart at any time and see."

Benefits:
- Asynchronous updates
- No interruption needed
- Visual at-a-glance status
- Reduces status meetings

### How Teams Update

"For the Hill Chart to be useful, it needs to be updated regularly. We've found that for most teams, once or twice a week is just fine."

Update mechanics:
- Team members move their scopes
- Click and drag on the hill
- Snapshot shows movement
- History tracks progress

## The Power of Movement

### Seeing Progress

"It's not about where things are on the hill. It's about where they're moving."

Movement patterns reveal:
- **Moving uphill:** Making progress on unknowns
- **Stuck at bottom:** Might need help
- **Moving downhill:** Execution proceeding
- **Not moving:** Potential problem

### The Snapshot Feature

Basecamp's implementation:
- Shows before/after positions
- Highlights movement with arrows
- Creates progress history
- Enables pattern recognition

"A dot that stays in the same place for three snapshots in a row is effectively screaming for attention."

## Nobody Says "I Don't Know"

### The Psychology of Uncertainty

"People don't like to report that they can't predict when they'll be done. They don't want to look like they're in trouble because they don't know how long something will take."

The Hill Chart solution:
- Uncertainty is normal (uphill)
- Not knowing is temporary
- Movement shows progress
- Stuck means need help

"It's easier to say 'I'm figuring out the approach' than 'I don't know when I'll be done.'"

### Legitimate Work States

The hill legitimizes:
- Being stuck temporarily
- Exploring solutions
- Not knowing timeline
- Needing assistance

"The uphill phase is full of uncertainty, unknowns, and problem solving. The downhill phase is marked by certainty, confidence, seeing everything, and knowing what to do."

## Prompts to Refactor Scopes

### When Scopes Don't Move

Common causes:
- Scope too big
- Unclear boundaries
- Hidden complexity
- Integration challenges

"A good way to help the team overcome the problem is to call out the work that's stuck and help them factor it differently."

### Case Study: Notify Screen Refactoring

**Original Scope:** "Notify Screen" (combining two complex features)

**The Problem:** Stuck on the hill, too much complexity

**The Solution:** Split into two scopes:
1. Broadcast Message
2. Choose Who To Notify

"As soon as they made the split, they immediately had one scope that was further uphill than the other. They were able to ship Broadcast Messages within a few days."

### Benefits of Refactoring

- Smaller scopes move easier
- Clear what's blocking
- Can ship completed parts
- Reduces coupling

## Build Your Way Uphill

### The Navigation Problem

"The uphill work requires strategies. We can't just push through. We have to navigate."

Common uphill challenges:
- Technical unknowns
- Design problems
- Integration issues
- Performance concerns

### Solve in the Right Sequence

"There's a natural order to the work. Starting in the wrong place makes everything harder."

Example sequences:
1. **Backend before fancy UI**
2. **Core functionality before edge cases**
3. **Basic flow before optimizations**
4. **Integration before polish**

## Decision-Making Framework

For using Hill Charts effectively:
1. **Is this scope moving?** If not, why?
2. **Are we solving or executing?** Different strategies needed
3. **Should we refactor this scope?** If stuck too long
4. **What would move us uphill?** Focus there
5. **Can we ship what's downhill?** While others climb

## Real-World Application

### For Teams
- Update hill positions regularly
- Use movement to show progress
- Split scopes when stuck
- Celebrate reaching peaks

### For Individual Contributors
- Be honest about position
- It's OK to be uphill
- Ask for help if stuck
- Focus on moving, not position

### For Managers
- Look for movement patterns
- Help split stuck scopes
- Provide support for uphill work
- Trust the process

### For Stakeholders
- Check hills asynchronously
- Understand both phases
- Expect non-linear progress
- Value solving over executing

## Common Patterns

### The Quick Summit
Some scopes race uphill quickly:
- Clear problem
- Known solution space
- Past experience
- Good shaping

### The Slow Climb
Others take time:
- Complex unknowns
- Technical exploration
- Design challenges
- Integration issues

### The False Summit
Sometimes teams think they're at the top:
- Start downhill
- Discover new unknowns
- Move back uphill
- Normal part of process

## Key Insight

"It's not about perfect predictions. It's about being able to see what's in motion and what's stuck. After that you can have the right conversations about how to solve the problem."

## The Cultural Impact

The Hill Chart changes team dynamics:
- Normalizes uncertainty
- Celebrates problem-solving
- Values honesty
- Reduces pressure
- Improves communication
