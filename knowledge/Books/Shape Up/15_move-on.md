## The Core Philosophy

After shipping, teams need to move on to the next project rather than getting trapped in an endless cycle of improvements and requests. Feedback needs to be shaped just like new ideas, and cool-down provides the right time for necessary adjustments without disrupting the next cycle.

**The fundamental principle:** "Let the storm pass."

## The Post-Launch Storm

### What Happens After Shipping

"The end of a project can be disorienting for a product team. They spent six weeks hammering a scope to ship on time. They're tired and ready to move on to the next project, but they know the thing they shipped probably isn't perfect. They're still thinking about improvements they could make."

The conflicting feelings:
- Pride in shipping
- Awareness of imperfections
- Desire to improve
- Need to move forward

### Customer Reactions

"Meanwhile new users are trying out the feature for the first time and reporting issues. Even worse, they might be misinterpreting something—using it wrong—and think it's broken when it's actually fine."

Types of post-launch feedback:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Misunderstandings
- Enhancement ideas
- Edge cases

## Mental Model: Feedback as Raw Ideas

**Traditional Thinking:** Customer feedback requires immediate action

**Shape Up Thinking:** Feedback is just another raw idea that needs shaping

### The Same Process Applies

"Feedback needs to be shaped before it can be bet on."

Just like any raw idea:
- Needs appetite setting
- Requires problem definition
- Must be shaped into solution
- Competes at betting table

"If a customer asks for a change or a fix, we don't take it at face value. We first ask ourselves what's really wrong and then apply the same shaping process to find a solution."

## Let the Storm Pass

### Why Immediate Response Is Wrong

"The feedback can be especially intense if the feature that shipped was a new workflow to replace an old one. People need time to get used to the change and the immediate reaction might not reflect the long-term reality."

The pattern:
1. Initial resistance to change
2. Confusion while learning
3. Gradual adaptation
4. True issues emerge

"Our natural instinct is to react, to fix it, to improve it. But if we listen to every piece of feedback and make a change, we'll soon find that the thing we shipped is no longer the thing we shaped."

### The Cooling Period

"We stay cool and don't jump on every new issue. We give it a week and see which ones are still bubbling up."

What happens during cooling:
- Users adapt to changes
- Real issues persist
- Non-issues fade away
- Patterns become clear

## Stay Debt-Free

### The Importance of Moving On

"It's important that the teams feel they are starting with a clean slate for each six-week cycle. If they know there's follow-up work from the last cycle waiting for them, they won't be able to use the next cycle to do something new and meaningful."

The debt problem:
- Unfinished work accumulates
- Teams lose autonomy
- Cycles become reactive
- Innovation stops

### Using Cool-down Wisely

"The cool-down period between cycles gives the team enough time to address the most important fixes before moving on to the next six-week project."

Cool-down activities:
- Fix critical bugs
- Make small adjustments
- Address clear oversights
- Then move on

"If it's a big thing that wasn't in the original shaping, it doesn't belong in the cool-down. It requires a new pitch and a separate bet."

## Examples of Moving On

### The Notification Redesign

**Week 1 after launch:**
- "The old way was better!"
- "I can't find my notifications"
- "This is confusing"

**Week 2:**
- Most complaints stopped
- Real issues identified
- Two small fixes in cool-down
- Major changes pitched for future

### The Calendar Feature

**Initial feedback:**
- "Why can't I drag events?"
- "Need different colors"
- "Want weekly view"

**The response:**
- Acknowledged limitations
- Fixed one visibility bug
- Let other requests compete
- Moved on to next project

## Decision-Making Framework

When handling post-launch feedback:
1. **Is this a bug or a request?** Bugs in cool-down, requests need shaping
2. **Are multiple people affected?** Wait for patterns
3. **Did we miss the mark?** Shape a new approach
4. **Is this scope creep?** Maintain boundaries
5. **Can it wait six weeks?** Most things can

## The Shaping Filter

### Not All Feedback Is Equal

"We don't want to react to every piece of feedback. We can't do everything. And doing something just because someone asked for it doesn't mean it's the right thing to do."

Apply the same rigor:
- What's the real problem?
- Is it worth our time?
- How does it compare to other work?
- What would a shaped solution look like?

### Competing for Resources

"Ideas from customer feedback aren't given any special privilege. They have to compete with everything else at the betting table."

The level playing field:
- Customer requests
- Internal ideas
- Strategic initiatives
- Bug fixes
- All compete equally

## Real-World Application

### For Teams
- Ship and move on
- Use cool-down for fixes
- Don't carry debt forward
- Trust the shaping process

### For Product Managers
- Collect feedback calmly
- Look for patterns
- Shape before reacting
- Let storms pass

### For Support
- Document feedback
- Identify trends
- Don't promise changes
- Understand the process

### For Leadership
- Protect team boundaries
- Support moving on
- Ensure clean slates
- Value forward progress

## The Long View

### Future Cycles

"Just because we don't immediately jump on a request doesn't mean it won't happen. It might be something we'll want to shape and bet on in a future cycle."

The patience principle:
- Good ideas come back
- Important issues persist
- Time provides perspective
- Better solutions emerge

### Continuous Improvement

Moving on doesn't mean ignoring quality:
- Each cycle improves product
- Shaped solutions are better
- Deliberate changes last
- Progress compounds

## Key Insight

"Shipping is just the beginning. What happens next is just as important. How we handle feedback, how we choose what to fix, and when we decide to move on—these decisions shape the product just as much as the original design."

## The Cultural Impact

A culture of moving on creates:
- Sustainable pace
- Forward momentum
- Deliberate improvements
- Reduced thrash
- Team satisfaction

"When everyone knows that we're going to move on from this project and start something new, it changes how they think about the work. They'll choose the important battles and let the smaller things go."
