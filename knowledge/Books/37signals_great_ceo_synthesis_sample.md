# How 37signals Would Apply The Great CEO Within Tactics

## Introduction

This document demonstrates how 37signals would adapt and apply tactics from The Great CEO Within, filtering them through their contrarian philosophy. While Matt Mochary's book represents Silicon Valley best practices for scaling venture-backed companies, 37signals has proven you can build a highly successful tech company by doing almost the exact opposite.

## Chapter 3: Getting Things Done → The 37signals Way

### The Great CEO Within Says:
- Implement full GTD system with capture, clarify, organize, reflect, engage
- Track everything in a trusted system
- Regular reviews and updates

### How 37signals Would Apply It:
"We don't need elaborate productivity systems. We hire managers of one—people who already know how to manage their time and attention. Instead of GTD overhead, we simply ask: What did you work on today? Post it async, move on."

**Their Implementation:**
- Daily "What did you work on?" posts (not tasks lists)
- No tracking of every little thing
- Trust people to manage themselves
- Focus on output, not process

## Chapter 11: Decision-Making → The 37signals Way

### The Great CEO Within Says:
- Use RAPID framework (Recommend, Agree, Perform, Input, Decide)
- Document all decisions
- Get stakeholder buy-in

### How 37signals Would Apply It:
"RAPID? More like SLOW. We don't need frameworks for decisions. Someone owns it, they decide it. If it affects others significantly, they might ask for input. But mostly? Make the call and move on. We hired you for your judgment—use it."

**Their Implementation:**
- Clear ownership: one person decides
- Quick gut calls over prolonged analysis
- "How does this feel?" over stakeholder matrices
- Reversible decisions made fast

## Chapter 24: Meetings → The 37signals Way

### The Great CEO Within Says:
- Daily standups, weekly 1:1s, monthly all-hands
- Structured agendas and note-taking
- Calendar discipline

### How 37signals Would Apply It:
"Meetings are toxic. They break your day into tiny, useless bits. A 30-minute meeting isn't 30 minutes—it's an hour of context switching. We write instead. Long-form, thoughtful writing beats any meeting."

**Their Implementation:**
- No daily standups (async check-ins instead)
- No weekly 1:1s (talk when needed)
- All-hands twice a year, not monthly
- Default to writing over talking
- 30-minute max when absolutely necessary

## Chapter 27: Fundraising → The 37signals Way

### The Great CEO Within Says:
- Build relationships with investors
- Raise at inflection points
- Use prestigious firms for documentation

### How 37signals Would Apply It:
"Fundraising? We've been profitable for 24 years without taking a dime. Every dollar from an investor is a dollar of independence lost. Practice making money, not raising it. Your business should be a profit machine, not a fundraising machine."

**Their Implementation:**
- Never raised money, never will
- Profitable from year one
- All profits to founders and employees
- No board, no investors, no exits
- Independence enables everything else

## Chapter 28: Recruiting → The 37signals Way

### The Great CEO Within Says:
- 2-week hiring sprints
- Full-day onsites with multiple interviewers
- Complex compensation with equity calculations
- Hire fast to show "conviction"

### How 37signals Would Apply It:
"Two weeks? Try two months. We're not dating—we're getting married. Take the time to really know each other. And forget equity calculations. We pay top 10% salaries, profit sharing, and done. Simple."

**Their Implementation:**
- Hire extremely rarely ("Can we not hire?")
- Long, thoughtful process
- Work with candidates on real projects
- Pay well, share profits, skip equity complexity
- Remote-first since day one

## Chapter 29: Sales → The 37signals Way

### The Great CEO Within Says:
- Build SDR/AE/CSM structure
- Track KPIs rigorously
- Predictable revenue machine

### How 37signals Would Apply It:
"Sales teams? We barely have a sales team. Our product sells itself because we built something people actually want. Instead of convincing people to buy, we let them convince themselves through a free trial."

**Their Implementation:**
- Product-led growth
- Self-serve model
- Minimal sales team
- No quotas or commissions
- Let the product do the talking

## Chapter 30: Marketing → The 37signals Way

### The Great CEO Within Says:
- Find your beachhead market
- Focus all resources on one segment
- Don't spread too thin

### How 37signals Would Apply It:
"Actually, this is one place we agree. But our beachhead isn't a market segment—it's a philosophy. We market to people who think like us: small teams who value simplicity, independence, and getting shit done without the bullshit."

**Their Implementation:**
- Market through teaching (books, blogs)
- Opinionated stance attracts right customers
- No growth hacking or paid acquisition
- Word of mouth from happy customers
- Build for ourselves first

## Chapter 20: Goal-Tracking System → The 37signals Way

### The Great CEO Within Says:
- Implement OKRs
- Track everything
- Regular reviews and updates

### How 37signals Would Apply It:
"OKRs are theater. We have one metric: Are we profitable? Beyond that, we work on what feels right. No arbitrary targets, no made-up metrics. Just build good shit and see if people pay for it."

**Their Implementation:**
- No OKRs or KPIs
- One question: "Are we making money?"
- 6-week cycles with clear projects
- Appetite-based planning
- Trust over tracking

## The Meta-Lesson

The Great CEO Within provides a comprehensive playbook for building a venture-scale company. It's excellent advice—if that's what you want to build. But 37signals proves there's another way:

**Instead of:**
- Raising money → Be profitable
- Scaling fast → Grow sustainably  
- Process-heavy → Trust-based
- Data-driven → Intuition-led
- Exit-focused → Independence-obsessed

As Jason Fried would say: "Best practices are for companies trying to be like everyone else. We're not trying to be like everyone else. We're trying to be like us."

## Conclusion

The beauty of 37signals' approach is that they don't wholesale reject The Great CEO Within's tactics—they filter them through their principles of independence, profitability, and simplicity. They take what serves their vision and ignore what doesn't.

The result? A highly profitable, sustainable company that's been around for 24 years, makes its founders and employees wealthy, serves hundreds of thousands of customers, and maintains complete independence. 

Not bad for doing everything "wrong."
