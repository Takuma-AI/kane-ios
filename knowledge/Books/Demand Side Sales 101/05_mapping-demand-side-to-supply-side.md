## The Core Philosophy

Each case study may seem unique, but patterns emerge when we understand the why behind decisions. This chapter maps the demand-side buying timeline to supply-side systems, showing how to meet buyers at each stage with the right inputs to create desired outcomes.

> "Demand-Side Sales is about helping your customer make progress"

The key insight: Use the timeline as the frame for how people make progress, then treat each phase as a sub-system with discrete progress goals.

## The Problem with Disconnected Systems

Traditional organizations separate sales, marketing, and customer success into silos. But from the buyer's perspective, it's one continuous journey. When these departments don't align, customers receive mixed messages and salespeople start at a disadvantage.

## Mental Model: The Six Stages of Progress

### Stage Overview

1. **First Thought**: Creating space in the brain for solutions
2. **Passive Looking**: Learning, framing, and prioritizing  
3. **Active Looking**: Seeing possibilities and framing trade-offs
4. **Deciding**: Connecting dots, making trade-offs, setting expectations
5. **Onboarding**: First use, doing the job, measuring progress
6. **Ongoing Use**: Building habits, identifying new struggles

## Stage 1: First Thought - Creating the Question

**Goal**: Help buyers admit there's a problem and open mental space for solutions.

### The Mechanism
First thought is about creating questions in the buyer's mind. As Moesta explains: "The questions create space in the brain for solutions to fall into. It's mostly about push. You want the buyer to question what they are doing and realize it's not working."

Without these questions, any solution you present will bounce off - there's literally nowhere in their mind for the information to land.

### Case Studies in First Thought

**Banking (Chad)**: The restructuring need revealed a deeper problem. "It became very clear that the existing institution did not understand our business AT ALL. And more importantly, just didn't have a desire to understand our business!"

**Healthcare (Jen)**: Coworkers created the pressure. Some genuinely worried about her health, others worried about themselves. "Let's be honest, no one likes to sit next to a sick coworker."

**Consumer Electronics (Rachel)**: The thought was injected by her husband six weeks before purchase. Despite Rachel's defense that she didn't need one, the seed was planted.

### Creating First Thoughts
Four proven methods:
1. Ask a good question (without giving an answer)
2. Tell a story
3. Give a new metric
4. State the obvious

## Stage 2: Passive Looking - Building Awareness

**Goal**: Help buyers repeatedly see your solution where they struggle most.

### The Transition
"There's very little transition between first thought and passive looking. The person is continually thinking about their problem and the question, 'Maybe I can do better?'"

### Case Studies in Passive Looking

**Banking (Chad)**:
- **Push Force**: "Chad needs to grow his business. His current bank does not understand the business and shows no interest in learning it."
- **Habit Force**: "None! Bank A changed relationship managers three times without any face-to-face meetings."
- **Emotional Energy**: "Chad holds his cards close, not telling Bank A about the upcoming business growth plans. The relationship has become so frayed that he believes providing the full picture will make things harder."
- **Triggering Event**: "After the third phone call, Chad is done dealing with Bank A. He is unwilling to keep spinning his wheels."

**Healthcare (Jen)**:
- **The Timeline**: From Friday (when her husband suggests seeing a doctor) through Sunday morning
- **Functional Motivation**: "After being sick Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, Jen feels behind at work"
- **Emotional/Social**: "Jen feels self-conscious about coughing all day long. She does not want to stand out in this negative way."
- **Triggering Event**: "Jen wakes up Sunday morning still feeling crummy. She knows she has a long week ahead."

**Consumer Electronics (Rachel)**:
- **Heightened Awareness**: "Since her husband injected the idea, Rachel is more aware of every problem and glitch. When something goes wrong, she thinks about a new computer."
- **The Crisis**: "Suddenly Rachel's daughter is admitted to the hospital and then the computer won't even boot up."
- **Triggering Event**: "The current computer won't even boot when she needs it to."

## Stage 3: Active Looking - Building the Ideal Solution

**Goal**: Help buyers see possibilities and frame their ideal solution with contrast.

### The Importance of Contrast
"It's important that the buyer has contrast; without contrast it becomes almost impossible to decide. The forces at play, pushes and pulls, continue to weigh on the person as they look for an ideal solution."

### Case Studies in Active Looking

**Banking (Chad)**:
- Sends VP to meet with four banks
- **Magnetism**: "Two banks sit down and try to learn about Chad's business; they did not come with a preplanned presentation"
- **Anxiety**: "Future growth plans put Chad in a time crunch"
- **Time Wall**: "He knows that if he is going to switch banks he must decide soon because he will need to repackage the entire deal"

**Healthcare (Jen)**:
- Weighs virtual care vs. urgent care
- **Real Driver**: "It's the fact that Jen knows she must go back to work the next day and everybody will question her again"
- **Magnetism**: "Virtual care seems quick and easy. She can do it from the comfort of her couch"
- **Anxieties**: "Can I work the technology? Can they offer an accurate diagnosis over video? They don't have my medical records."

**Consumer Electronics (Rachel)**:
- Relies on husband as tech advisor
- **Magnetism**: "There's a huge pull toward the new solution now. Rachel needs relief!"
- **Anxiety Management**: "Without the tech support her husband represents, the new solution would have high anxiety"
- **Time Wall**: "Rachel is under tight deadlines for work with limited bandwidth"

## Stage 4: Deciding - Making Tradeoffs

**Goal**: Help buyers prioritize and set value codes within the time-cost-quality triangle.

### The Time Wall Effect
"Without a time wall most people will not make a purchase. Now you know why mattress stores run specials every holiday. It forces people to buy."

Time walls create urgency by making the cost of not deciding greater than the anxiety of deciding wrong. They transform endless deliberation into concrete action.

### Case Studies in Deciding

**Banking (Chad)**:
- Started with four, immediately eliminated two with preplanned presentations
- **The Tradeoff**: "Chad decides he cares most about trust and flexibility over cost"
- **Trust Building**: When asked about personal guarantees, losing bank said "Well, maybe," while winning bank said "Nope. Can't do it and if that's a deal breaker, we need to walk away right now."
- **Key Insight**: "Trust was earned because he could deliver the bad news"

**Healthcare (Jen)**:
- **The Calculation**: "Sitting in her bathrobe on a Sunday morning, Jen contemplates her options"
- **The Decision**: "Jen decides to figure out virtual care, because it's eight in the morning and she's not dressed yet. She figures that if it fails, she can always still go to urgent care."

**Consumer Electronics (Rachel)**:
- **Setting Criteria**: "Some might think her husband is deciding, but Eric is merely acting as an advisor"
- **Simple Requirements**: "She insists her computer not be a Mac. She wants good battery life and ease of use with video conferencing."

## Stage 5: Onboarding - Delivering on Expectations

**Goal**: Match and exceed expectations set during the sales process.

### The Satisfaction Challenge
"Most people stop selling once someone's made a purchase. But progress is about making sure you deliver on the expectations that were set... Nine times out of ten, dissatisfaction comes from a breakdown in communication."

### Onboarding Outcomes

**Banking**: "If the new bank continues to treat him as a priority and understand his business, Chad will be happy."

**Healthcare**: "Jen is a very satisfied customer, and likely a repeat customer, the virtual platform exceeded her expectations by being fast and easy to use."

**Consumer Electronics**: "Rachel will be easy to satisfy because her comparison will be the old computer with its outdated problems."

## Stage 6: Ongoing Use - Building Habits

**Goal**: Transform first use into habitual use while addressing new struggling moments.

### Evolution of Value
The chapter introduces the **Kano Model**, explaining how customer satisfaction evolves:

- **Threshold Attributes (Basic)**: Features we assume exist (texting on phones in 2020)
- **Performance Attributes (Satisfiers)**: Standard expectations that increase satisfaction
- **Excitement Attributes (Delighters)**: Unexpected solutions that surprise and delight

### Ongoing Use Strategies

**Banking**: "As Chad grows the business, he needs his bank help him manage struggling moments... Chad switched for one reason but he's going to stay for a whole bunch of other reasons."

**Healthcare**: "How does the virtual platform go from being the doctor, to the health advocate? ... Now the consumer can use the platform when they are healthy as well."

**Consumer Electronics**: "How does the computer company make sure that the computer does not degrade in performance over time?"

## Decision Framework: Meeting Buyers at Each Stage

### Critical Elements for Success

1. **Find the struggling moments**: "People don't think about hiring and firing until they have a struggling moment. They're not what you think they are."

2. **Think progress**: "It's the progress that matters, not your features and benefits."

3. **Identify the tradeoffs**: "Choose what to suck at. As Jason Fried says, 'You're better off with a kick-ass half than a half-assed whole.'"

4. **Understand compound effects**: "Unfulfilled 'little hires' cause 'big hires.' Focus on the little hires."

## Making It Real

**Demand-side exercise**: "Think about the best experience you had buying something in the last year. Why was it a great sales experience? What did they know about you that was important?"

**Supply-side exercise**: "Think about a time when you struggled to sell your product or service. Now use the forces, motivations, and timeline to understand where you went wrong."
