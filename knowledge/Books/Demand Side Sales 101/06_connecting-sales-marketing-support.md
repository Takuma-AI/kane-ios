## The Core Philosophy

> "Sales, marketing, and customer support must learn to play together! Most organizations treat them as three separate entities but they're not. And treating them as such makes sales unnecessarily hard."

The fundamental problem: Customers experience one continuous journey, but organizations deliver fragmented experiences. When departments don't align, "customers get mixed messages. They are bombarded with value propositions and online tactics that try to push people to decide when they are in active looking. It's making the consumer frustrated and anxious, while putting salespeople at an immediate disadvantage."

## The Problem with Departmental Silos

### Marketing vs. Sales: Different Worlds

**Marketing operates at the macro level:**
- "They tend to be features driven—creating add-ons to reach the widest audience"
- Work with "an ideal or imagined customer, created through the triangulation of data"
- Focus on correlation: "age, zip code, income level"
- "If you think about it, age and income level are not the real reason someone buys a car"

**Sales operates at the micro level:**
- "In sales you deal directly with the real customer"
- "Great salespeople deal in causation not correlation"
- "There's nothing imagined about their customer"
- "Oftentimes, founders make the best salespeople because they understand the entire business inside and out"

### The Timeline Reality
- **First thought, passive looking, active looking** = Marketing + Sales
- **Deciding, onboarding, ongoing use** = Sales + Customer Support
- **Sales covers the entire process!**

## Case Study #1: Banking - Getting Fired and Getting Hired

### The Two Perspectives
Chad's story is particularly interesting because we can analyze it from both sides:
1. The bank that got fired ("Bank A")
2. The bank that got hired

### Sales and Marketing: Attracting Chad

**The Wrong Approach (What Most Banks Do):**
> "Let me tell you about who we are..." then they name drop their clients and offer a wide menu of options. You're not a banker, it's confusing. They don't understand your business or know you. And you don't care who they represent."

**The Right Approach (Demand-Side Selling):**

1. **Create First Thoughts Through "Lunch and Learn"**
   - Connect businesses together and build networks
   - Get existing clients to talk to prospects
   - Focus on progress: "What could you be doing if you had more money? How would your business grow if you had access to better capital?"
   - Address anxieties: "What's holding you back? How can we help you mitigate the risk?"

2. **Active Looking Response**
   > "I need thirty minutes to an hour of your time to understand your business before I can give you a quote."
   
   Then set expectations:
   - "I'll come back with three alternatives that will help you frame your situation better"
   - "From there we will morph a fourth option by merging the best of three"
   - "If at any point you reach out and I am not available, I will contact you within twenty-four hours"
   - "I'm a straight shooter. If it's a no, I'll tell you no; if it's a yes, I'll tell you yes"

**The Result:** "You've built trust; now you realize that trust is caused. You've changed the way you sell loans."

### The Jeweler Effect

Moesta shares a powerful analogy about trust and education:

> "When the diamond industry came up with the notion of cut, clarity, and color to help people shop for diamonds, jewelers were completely against it. They felt it would ruin their relationship with customers... The opposite happened. It educated consumers because now they could make tradeoffs... Diamond sales grew almost ten times as a direct result, and jewelers who were willing to educate customers got ninety percent of the sales. It was ultimately about trust!"

### Sales and Customer Support: Why Bank A Failed

**The Fatal Flaw:**
> "Most sales models think of new business as harder to get than renewals, therefore, they put their lower-level people on renewals. But renewals are just as hard, sometimes riskier, than new business because you've got history to overcome or reshape."

**What Bank A Should Have Done:**

1. **Proper Onboarding**
   - Face-to-face meetings for account handoffs
   - Learn about the customer's business
   - "Teach their people to be curious"

2. **Regular Wellness Visits**
   - "Where is the business going next year?"
   - "What big projects do you have?"
   - Come back with ways to help save money or access new resources

3. **Trust Maintenance**
   - "If you hear trust decay repeatedly, it's a vulnerability"
   - Never string people along
   - "If the answer's no, say no. Most salespeople try to never say no, but that's a bad approach"

**The Warning:** "Remember, the most vulnerable people in your portfolio are your current clients because you've learned to ignore them."

## Case Study #2: Healthcare - Solving the Technology Anxiety

### The Discovery
The healthcare company wanted to know what causes people to choose urgent care. Through interviews like Jen's, they discovered a critical insight:

> "In hindsight it's obvious, nobody wants to learn new technology while sick, but it was an a-ha moment... Why in the world are we asking patients to learn new technology when they feel their worst? Ridiculous!"

### Sales and Marketing: The Virtual Care Solution

**The Innovation:**
1. **Introduce technology when patients are well**
   - At wellness visits, help patients navigate the platform
   - Set up next year's appointment with assistance
   - "Push a button and a physician assistant would appear"
   - Result: "It quadrupled the virtual visits"

2. **Targeted Messaging for Passive Looking**
   - Original ads: "Virtual visits available 24/7"
   - New ads: "Feeling sick? Don't put your plans on hold, stay productive"
   - Context-specific ads: "When you're sick, fighting allergies, and so on"

### Sales and Customer Support: Three Patient Contexts

The interviews revealed three distinct patient types:

1. **Complicated Medical History**
   - Fear of forgetting critical health information
   - Solution: Send emails to patients and regular doctors after appointments

2. **Known Condition**
   - Want quick, no-nonsense care
   - Know what's wrong (sinus infection, UTI)

3. **Seeking Reassurance**
   - Can't self-diagnose
   - Want quick answers

**The Process Innovation:**
- Created incoming triage form with five questions
- Reduced appointment time from 18 to 5 minutes
- Increased satisfaction from 28% to 78%
- Patients returned 4x more often

## Case Study #3: Consumer Electronics - The Translation Problem

### The Disconnect
> "Computer companies don't think about the way people buy. Instead they market by screen size, processing speed, and RAM. They never talk about how to solve a customer's struggling moment."

Rachel wanted simple assurances:
- Will it power up?
- Will it interface with various formats?
- Will video conferencing be seamless?
- Will it have professional writing programs?

"But she needed a translator to get those answers—most people do."

### Sales and Marketing: Creating Urgency

**Triggering First Thought:**
- Ask: "What bothers you most?"
- "If you had a new computer, what would be better?"
- Message: "Life can be better! Imagine if you didn't have to deal with these problems"

**Context-Based Marketing:**
> "Based on Rachel's context, we need to figure out where people are pressed for time and market there: hospitals, kid's sporting events, stadiums, etc. Anyplace where you're waiting, trying to work, and lack access to a plug."

**Creating the Event:**
- Natural or artificial events push passive to active looking
- Ask provocative questions: "What are you going to do if it doesn't boot back up?"
- "By putting the doubt in her mind, it creates the space for her to think, 'I've got to create a plan'"

### Sales and Customer Support: The Service Gap

**The Insight:**
> "People will pay an additional 10 percent of the value of the computer for the service that Rachel's husband offered. For someone to just tell them what they need and to produce it with a money back guarantee."

**What Computer Companies Should Do:**
1. Talk in customer language, not features
2. Understand the problem they're solving
3. Deliver in 24 hours
4. Spend 30 minutes walking through questions
5. Recognize "the best computer for Rachel is not the best computer for everybody"

**The Universal Truth:**
> "While Rachel seems to be in a unique time and place this space in time repeats itself a thousand times a day, every day, somewhere else in the world."

## Mental Model: Integrated Customer Journey

### The New Framework
1. **Marketing creates awareness** where struggles happen
2. **Sales facilitates progress** through the entire journey
3. **Customer Support ensures ongoing progress** and identifies new struggles

### Key Principles
- Reduce anxiety at every stage
- Build trust through honesty and education
- Meet customers in their context
- Focus on progress, not products

## Decision Framework

When aligning departments:

1. **Map the customer journey** - Not your internal processes
2. **Identify handoff points** - Where do customers get confused?
3. **Create consistent messaging** - Progress-based, not feature-based
4. **Train for curiosity** - Everyone should understand customer struggles
5. **Measure progress metrics** - Not just conversion rates

## Making It Real

**Demand-side exercise**: "Think about the last time you had a bad sales experience. Why was it so bad?"

**Supply-side exercise**: "Think about the last three sales you made. Why did they work or not work?"

## Key Insight

> "Sales no longer feels icky, because it's about helping people make progress on their terms. Sales is now progress."
