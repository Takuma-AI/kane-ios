## The Core Philosophy

> "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!"
> — Theodore Levitt, Harvard Business School

The fundamental error in sales is focusing on what we're selling instead of what people are trying to accomplish. This chapter introduces three key frameworks that reveal how people actually buy:

1. **Three sources of energy** (functional, emotional, social)
2. **Four forces of progress** (push, pull, anxiety, habit)
3. **JTBD timeline** (the sequence from first thought to ongoing use)

## The Problem with Feature-Focused Selling

### The Drill Aisle Dilemma
Walk into any hardware store and you'll find:
- Drills of every color
- Different torques, battery life, accessories
- Incremental innovations (3% better battery!)
- Side-by-side products that are hardly discernible

This is **supply-side push** - companies playing "keep up with the Joneses" rather than understanding what customers actually need. We keep trying to sell people the drill, when we should be helping them figure out how to make the hole.

### The Five Whys in Action
Using Toyota's problem-solving technique reveals the real need:

1. "I need a drill" → Why?
2. "Because I want a hole" → Why?
3. "Because I want a plug" → Why?
4. "Because I want a lamp" → Why?
5. "Because it's hard to see, and I want to read better"

**The revelation**: They don't need a drill at all - they need a Kindle!

## Mental Model: Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

### Definition
JTBD is the **progress** that a person is trying to make in a particular **struggling circumstance**.

**Key Components:**
- **Struggling Circumstance**: Where they are now (e.g., need to cross a river)
- **Progress Vision**: Where they want to be (e.g., the other side)
- **Multiple Solutions**: 1,000 ways to help (swim, boat, bridge, plane)

### Critical Insights
1. **Both pieces matter**: Circumstance + Desired Outcome = JTBD
2. **No vision = No progress**: Complaints without vision aren't real struggling moments
3. **Eliminating struggle ≠ Progress**: Hiring a snowplow isn't progress; moving to a condo is
4. **Value is relative**: Determined by where you start vs. where you end

> "You cannot design the way your customer makes progress; you need to understand their definition of progress and design your process around it."

## Framework 1: Three Sources of Energy

Moesta introduces three distinct categories of motivation that fuel the buying process:

### 1. Functional Motivation

> "How cumbersome is the purchasing process for the buyer—time, effort, and speed? I think of mechanical things here: speed, effort, steps, etc."

**SNHU Example**: 
> "Remember the online students at SNHU? They were working full-time jobs and trying to go to school at night. They had little time to take the ACT/SAT and fill out a laborious application with an essay. They had no idea how to obtain a transcript. Wrapped up in the decision to go back to school were these functional barriers that stood in the way. We needed to reduce this functional barrier. It was a force pushing them away from our services."

### 2. Emotional Motivation

> "What positive or negative internal thoughts are driving my purchase—fears, frustrations, and desires?"

**SNHU Example**:
> "The online students were not focused on the university's ranking. Remember it was the vision of a better life that drove them to suffer through the lost nights and weekends. They wanted to provide a better life for their family. So, our advertisement painted that picture. It showed the struggling moment that people face working a dead-end job. It showed the hard work and the better life ahead. The advertisement focused on the emotional satisfaction they would feel providing for their families."

### 3. Social Motivation

> "How do other people perceive, respect, trust, or acknowledge me?"

**SNHU Example**:
> "The online students wanted that feeling of pride the diploma would create. They envisioned just how proud their family and friends would be. And, as a result, how proud they would feel about themselves. Our advertisement painted that picture as well."

**The Strategic Goal**: 
> "Overall, the goal in demand-side sales is to reduce the negative functional, emotional, and social motivations, which are causing anxiety and serving as a barrier. While at the same time, amplifying the positive motivations to create pull for the product or service."

## Framework 2: Four Forces of Progress

Progress happens when promoting forces overcome blocking forces: **(F1 + F2) > (F3 + F4)**

Moesta emphasizes that "buying is not random" - there are four distinct forces at play that determine whether people make progress or stick with business as usual.

### Promoting Forces

**F1: Push of the Situation**
- The current problems creating discomfort and energy for change
- For the mattress buyer: "tossing and turning and it's affecting their productivity during the day"
- This struggling moment is what starts everything - without a push, there's no reason to even consider alternatives

**F2: Magnetism of the New Solution**
- The pull created when you realize something might help you make progress
- "You start to imagine a better life with a good night's sleep"
- Often triggered by external events: "A friend buys a new mattress and raves to you about it"
- This is the vision of the better future that draws people forward

### Blocking Forces

**F3: Anxiety of the New Solution**
- The fears and uncertainties that create resistance to change
- "Will the new mattress deliver on its promise? Can I even figure out which mattress is the best?"
- The overwhelming choices and fear of making the wrong decision
- "What happens if I get the new mattress and I hate it?"

**F4: Habit of the Present**
- The comfort with status quo, even when it's inadequate
- "You are used to the old mattress, even though it sucks. You've learned to live with it."
- There's "an energy in that incumbent solution" that keeps you from switching
- The inertia of existing systems and routines

### The System View

The forces work as a system, not in isolation. Progress becomes an equation where promoting forces must overcome blocking forces. As Moesta notes: "What we are taught in business school is to add more features, but the forces work as a system and sometimes more features is not better because it causes more anxiety."

### Key Insight: Where the Money Is Made

> "As product developers we think about the first two forces—the push and the magnetism of our product—a lot. We imagine the next big feature we're going to bolt onto our product, which everyone will love. But we ignore everything else—the anxieties and the pull of habit. Our experience has taught us that **the money is made on the anxiety side of the equation**. If you can figure out what's holding people back, you can shortcut the sales process and really increase profits."

This is how Casper disrupted the mattress industry - not by building a better mattress, but by addressing the anxieties around mattress shopping.

## Framework 3: The JTBD Timeline

Nothing is random - buyers move through six distinct stages. As Moesta explains: "Like any good crime, there's a timeline." Traditional sales thinks buyers are just demographics, but even understanding the forces isn't enough - "the buyer must also be in the right time and place in their life."

### 1. First Thought - Creating Space in the Brain
- The critical moment when you think "I'm not sleeping well" or "This is a dead-end job"
- Before this, there's literally no place in your mind to file information about solutions
- "Without this first thought there is no demand"
- Once you have it, you notice things you didn't notice before, transitioning to passive looking

**Four ways to create first thought:**
- Ask a good question (and specifically don't give an answer)
- Tell a story that resonates with their situation
- Give a new metric that reframes their thinking
- State the obvious that they've been avoiding

### 2. Passive Looking - Learning Mode
- You suddenly notice the mattress store you've passed every day
- You wonder if that local university has online classes
- The questions in your head create spaces to file this new information
- Gathering context casually without actively shopping yet

### 3. Active Looking - Seeing the Possibilities
- Transitioning from casual awareness to purposeful research
- Comparing options systematically
- Imagining how different solutions might work
- Building criteria for what would constitute progress

### 4. Deciding - Making the Trade-offs
- The moment where all four forces come into play
- Establishing what value means in this context
- Weighing the push/pull against anxiety/habit
- Committing to change (or retreating to status quo)

### 5. Onboarding - The Act of Doing the JTBD
- "Meeting expectations and delivering satisfaction and value"
- The critical phase where the product must deliver on its promise
- Where customers realize (or don't) the progress they sought
- Success here determines ongoing use and referrals

### 6. Ongoing Use - Building the Habit
- New solution becomes integrated into daily life
- Transforms from "new thing" to "how we do things"
- Creates its own energy and switching costs
- Becomes the incumbent for future decisions

### The Domino Effect

Moesta uses a powerful metaphor: "When conducting interviews, we imagine the events in their life like huge dominoes falling." The key is understanding causality at a granular level:

- What specific event made them say "Today's the day..."?
- What pushed them forward or pulled them back?
- How did each domino tip the next?

The critical insight: "The customer has a certain set of systems for how they buy, and our process needs to feed their world to help them make progress."

## Decision Framework

When understanding customer progress:

1. **Start with struggle, not solution** - What progress are they trying to make?
2. **Dig for the real why** - Use Five Whys to get beyond surface needs
3. **Map the forces** - What's pushing/pulling vs. what's blocking?
4. **Understand their timeline** - Where are they in the buying journey?
5. **Design around their system** - Your process must feed their world

## Real-World Application
