“Bob has already brought the benefit of applying his JTBD princi-
ples to two of the three most important areas in business: product
strategy and marketing. This book tackles the third and arguably
the most important: sales. Most sales gurus obsess about how to
sell. Bob instead invests his time in the more important and under-
served side of the equation: how people buy. The result is a fresh
perspective and new ideas for an age-old trade.”

“I have always enjoyed my interactions with Bob Moesta, as do our
demanding students. His work with regard to JTBD is top shelf. I
am so glad he is now taking his creative engineering mindset to sales
with his new book “Demand-Side Sales 101.” Sales is the lifeblood
of any organization and unfortunately, it is too often seen as black
magic. We need a more systematic way to approach sales and this
extension of JTBD to sales fills an important gap. I recommend
this book to anyone in business because nothing really happens
until there is a sale.”

“Bob applies his engineering mindset to the sales process. His unique
perspective puts a new spin on sales that shows the reader how to
sell from the buyer’s perspective. What results is a thoughtful and
comprehensive book that equips you to look at sales through a dif-

“Bob continues to innovate and apply JTBD principles to many
aspects of a business. Sales are one place where it is desperately
needed. His empathetic perspective and diverse background bring
a fresh perspective to an age-old—and critical—set of skills and
disciplines. Most impressively, Bob has applied his engineering
thinking to create a process that mirrors how people buy, not how
we want to sell. Progress should be the new mantra for sales.”

“I recently took on the role of leading marketing and needed a
resource that helped me cut through all of the marketing buzzwords
and fads. My company is counting on me for results, not vanity
metrics. This book has enabled me to truly understand how best
to engage with prospects at each stage of their decision. We have
moved away from pushing features at prospects to engaging them
in conversations that offer benefits on their terms. As a result, our
sales team has prospects who are ready to make qualified decisions,
and our account management team has clients that purchased for
the right reasons.”

“For many people, sales is either some version of order taking or
persuading people to purchase something they may or may not need.
Bob reclaims the heart of all great sales: empathetic understanding
of what people need and giving them just the right solution to a
problem. Using a JTBD approach, Bob helps us see the how and
why of people’s purchasing process, and that will fundamentally
change how you engage your customers, how you train your people,
how you market. If you are an entrepreneur, an aspiring business-
person, and CEO, you need this knowledge.”

“The world of business creates, builds, and sells products and ser-

people are not average and their demographics don’t cause them to
buy your product. People buy things based on a struggling moment,
their current context, their future desired outcomes and trade-offs
they are willing to make at the moment. Bob Moesta has taken
these simple observations and flipped the lens on the world of sales.
This book builds on my foundations from The End Of Average, and
uses cause and effect (not correlations) to builds a set of frame-
works and tools to change how companies see a customer from
just WHO they are to wider set of data including WHEN they
struggle, WHERE they struggle, and WHY, thus changing how
sales, marketing, and customer support interact with each other
and the customer. This book will not only change the way you
structure your organizations and sell but change the way you as
an individual buy in the future.”

FOREWORD
B Y J A S O N F R I E D
I learned sales at fifteen.
I was working at a small shoe store in Deerfield, Illinois, where
I grew up. I loved sneakers. I was a sneakerhead before that
phrase was coined.
I literally studied shoes. The designs, the designers, the brands,
the technologies, the subtle improvements in this year’s model
over last year’s.
I knew it all, but there was one thing I didn’t know: nothing I
knew mattered. Sure it mattered to me, but my job was to sell
shoes. I wasn’t selling shoes to sneakerfreaks like me, I was
selling shoes to everyday customers. Shoes weren’t the center
of their universe.
F O R E W O R D · 1 7
And I wasn’t alone. The companies that made the shoes didn’t
have a clue how to sell shoes either.
Companies would send in reps to teach the salespeople all
about the new models. They’d rattle off technical advance-
ments. They’d talk about new breakthroughs in ethylene-vinyl
acetate (EVA) which made the shoes more comfortable.
They’d talk about flex grooves and heel counters and Texon
boards. Insoles, outsoles, midsoles.
And I’d be pumped. Now I knew everything I needed to know
to sell the hell out of these things.
But when customers came in, and I demonstrated my mastery
of the subject, they’d leave without buying anything. I could
show off, but I couldn’t sell.
It wasn’t until my manager encouraged me to shut up, watch,
and listen. Give people space, observe what they’re interested
in, keep an eye on their behavior, and be genuinely curious
about what they wanted for themselves, not what I wanted for
them. Essentially, stop selling and start listening.
I noticed that when people browsed shoes on a wall, they’d
pick a few up and bounce them around in their hand to get a
sense of the heft and feel. Shoes go on your feet, but people
picked the shoe with their hands. If it didn’t feel good in the
hand, it never made it to their foot.
1 8 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
I noticed that if someone liked a shoe, they put it on the ground
next to their foot. They didn’t want to try it on yet, they simply
wanted to see what it looked like from above. Companies
spend all this time making the side of the shoe look great, but
from the wearer’s perspective, it’s the top of the shoe against
their pants (or socks or legs) that seem to have an outsized
influence on the buying decision.
I noticed that when people finally got around to trying on a
shoe, they’d lightly jump up and down on it, or move side-to-
side, simulating some sort of pseudo physical activity. They
were trying to see if the shoe “felt right.” They didn’t care what
the cushioning technology was, only that it was comfortable.
It wasn’t about if it “fit right,” it was about if it “rubbed wrong”
or “hurt” or felt “too hard.”
And hardly anyone picked a shoe for what it was intended for.
Runners picked running shoes, sure, but lots of people picked
running shoes to wear all day. They have the most cushion,
they’re generally the most comfortable. And lots of people
picked shoes purely based on color. “I like green” was enough
to turn someone away from a blue shoe that fit them better.
Turns out, people had different reasons for picking shoes. Dif-
ferent reasons than my reasons, and far different reasons than
the brand’s reasons. Hardly anyone cared about this foam vs.
that foam, or this kind of rubber vs. that kind. They didn’t care
about the precise weight, or that this brand shaved 0.5oz off
F O R E W O R D · 1 9
the model this year compared to last. They didn’t care what the
color was called, only that they liked it (or didn’t). The tech-
nical qualities weren’t important - in fact, they were irrelevant.
I was selling all wrong.
And that’s really what this book is about. The revelation that
sales isn’t about selling what you want to sell, or even what
you, as a salesperson, would want to buy. Selling isn’t about
you. Great sales requires a complete devotion to being curious
about other people. Their reasons, not your reasons. And it’s
surely not about your commission, it’s about their progress.
Fast forward twenty-five years.
Today I don’t sell shoes, I sell software. Or do I?
It’s true that I run a software company that makes project man-
agement software called Basecamp. And so, you’d think we sell
software. I sure did! But once you meet Bob Moesta and Greg
Engle, you realize you probably don’t sell what you think you
sell. And your customers probably don’t think of you the way
you think of yourself. And you almost certainly don’t know
who your competition really is.
Over the years, Bob’s become a mentor to me. He’s taught us
to see with new eyes and hear with new ears. To go deeper. To
not just take surface answers as truth. But to dig for the how
2 0 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
and the why—the causation. To understand what really moves
someone to want to make a move. To understand the events
that drive the purchase process, and to listen intently to the
language customers use when they describe their struggles.
To detect their energy and feel its influence on their decisions.
Everyone’s struggling with something, and that’s where the
opportunity lies to help people make progress. Sure, people
have projects, and software can help people manage those proj-
ects, but people don’t have a “project management problem.”
That’s too broad. Bob taught us to dig until we hit a seam of
true understanding. Project management is a label, it’s not a
struggle.
People struggle to know where a project stands. People strug-
gle to maintain accountability across teams. People struggle to
know who’s working on what, and when those things will be
done. People struggle with presenting a professional appear-
ance with clients. People struggle to keep everything organized
in one place so people know where things are. People struggle
to communicate clearly so they don’t have to repeat themselves.
People struggle to cover their ass and document decisions, so
they aren’t held liable if a client says something wasn’t deliv-
ered as promised. That’s the deep down stuff, the real struggles.
Bob taught us how to think differently about how we talk,
market, and listen. And Basecamp is significantly better off
for it. We’ve not only changed how we present Basecamp, but
F O R E W O R D · 2 1
we’ve changed how we build Basecamp. We approach design
and development differently now that we know how to dig.
It’s amazing how things can change once you see the world
through a new lens.
Sales is everything. It’s survival. From selling a product, to
selling a potential hire on the opportunity to join your com-
pany, to selling an idea internally, to selling your partner on this
restaurant vs. that one, sales touches everything. If you want
to be good at everything else, you better get good at this. Bob
and Greg will show you how.

INTRODUCTION
My apprehensive leap into sales and marketing began twenty
years ago, when I took a startup from $500 thousand to $18
million in a short twenty months. But it started out miserably…
As an engineer—a real geek at heart—I had little notion of
what sales encompassed when I stepped into my first sales role.
I thought of sales as a series of techniques, tools, and process-
es—a trade—and I just had to learn it. So, it’s with this mindset
that I boldly took a lead sales and marketing role at a home
products company manufacturing and selling solid surface
countertops for kitchens and bathrooms, my second startup.
I was excited about our product—a new type of kitchen coun-
tertop—and believed that if I understood how my product
worked and its position in the marketplace, I would strategi-
cally know how to sell it. Tell people about the product, and
they’ll buy it, right? The idea was that we sold our countertops
I N T R O D U C T I O N · 2 3
to small kitchen and bath shops, as well as big box retailers
like Lowes and Home Depot, who in turn, sold direct to the
customer. Easier said than done.
Immediately I struggled! This felt more like art than science:
people, emotions, exceptions—no equations, very scary. The
hair on the back of my neck went up whenever I encountered
someone because I thought of every person I met as a prospec-
tive customer, all the time. To me, the consumer world seemed
irrational and random—like falling into a blackhole—very
different from engineering. Previously, I’d been responsible
for solving problems for people, but in sales, I was trying to get
something from people—money in exchange for my product.
For some reason, sales felt icky. It was an unnatural “push” to
get people to buy my product. I knew I hated pushy sales-
people, and I didn’t want people to hate me. I didn’t know if
I wanted to do this and wondered if sales had to be this way. I
considered myself more of an introvert at the time, and most
salespeople seemed to be extroverts. I felt like I was a misfit
in the true sense of the word. When I did procure a lead, the
rules of engagement were murky, and I was directed to say and
do whatever was necessary to close the deal.
I began to make trade-offs, compromising on both sides of the
table—with the customer and internally with the company: if
they wanted black, well then I’d figure out black. I caused havoc
back at the office. The customers were managing me and our
process, where I felt I had been reduced to an order taker. My
24 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
confidence waned. I wrestled with how to sell directly to the
resellers and meet their needs, versus providing what the end-
user customers wanted. I felt my loyalties pushed and squeezed.
I had loyalty to the company and the customer. But how could
I satisfy both? I also felt a huge amount of pressure to grow
the business. I’m a goal-oriented person, but it got to the point
where I was not sure I could do it anymore.
I thought the problem was my sales technique. Since I had
no real sales training, I began to consume everything I could:
listening to books, going to seminars, and signing up for classes.
Right away, I noticed that I could only find basic sales tech-
niques, such as how to make cold calls or how to get past the
gatekeeper, how to do a sales pitch and how to negotiate a
contract. There were gaps in how to apply the knowledge in
practice.
So, I sought out a sales coach. At the time, I was stunned to
find that none of the top business schools in the country even
had professors in the area of sales. Lawyers were teaching sales
negotiating. Sales management was being taught as part of the
human resources curriculum because it was seen as motivation
and compensation. I’d studied at both Boston College and
the Harvard Business School, and neither had professors in
sales. Why didn’t I have a sales class? Why are there no sales
professors? The short answer: “Sales is a trade, not a profession
like accounting or law,” I was told. You learn on the job; there
is no sales theory.
I N T R O D U C T I O N · 2 5
W H Y A R E T H E R E N O SA L E S P R O F E SS O R S?
As I puzzled over this, my research pointed me to a
moment in time—the 1985 sale of Nabisco—as a pos-
sible reasoning. RJR Reynolds, the tobacco company,
bought Nabisco for $4.9 billion—more than its cashflow.
At the time, the numbers didn’t make any sense. It was
the first notion of brand equity: the idea that because
people knew the Nabisco brand and their Nilla Wafers,
they wouldn’t have to sell future products as hard. Prior
to this, marketing was viewed as an assist to sales, and
sales were measured in cash flow. The moment brands
became more valuable than cash flow, marketers grew
in power.
By the time I went to business school in 1995, there was
plenty of marketing and talk of brand equity, but nobody
was talking about sales anymore. Salespeople had been
reduced to what I call “order takers,” not a trade, just a
process people followed. There was no real management
theory behind sales, just a set of tools, techniques, and
processes—a trade. Sales became to marketing what
accounting is to finance—one and the same. The kicker:
marketing got a line item on the balance sheet known
as “brand equity.” They could expense all the advertis-
ing and still get credit for the cashflow. They also had
sophisticated analysis methods that could be taught in
business schools.
As of 2020, there are some elite universities that are
bringing sales back to higher education in a sophisticated
way—a hybrid of psychology and design—but they’ve
been missing for the past thirty years.
FLIPPING THE LENS ON SALES
It was around this time that I met Bob Ericson, one of our sales
representatives—formerly a lineman for the San Francisco
2 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
49’ers, a massive man standing at 6’ 10” tall and weighing over
300 pounds—and he kept telling me that I was going about
this the wrong way.
“You’ve got to understand where they’re coming from,” he’d say.
“But I don’t! I don’t know what it’s like to be a buyer at
Home Depot. I don’t know what it’s like to own a kitchen
and bath store. I don’t know why the customer wants a black
countertop.”
“Why don’t you go live in their stores for a few days?” he asked.
“You will learn a ton.”
So, I did. I went to Home Depot and volunteered in kitchen
designs, quoting kitchens on Saturdays and Sundays, for sev-
eral months. And it was my ah-ha moment; I quickly realized I
had no idea what I was talking about! Sitting in the back of the
vast Home Depot weekend after weekend, I suddenly realized
it wasn’t about my product at all—it was about the customer.
Our countertops filled a void in the marketplace. At the time,
in the late 1990s, consumers had three basic options: low-end
laminate, followed by Corian and granite at the high-end. Our
product filled the gap between the low-end laminate and the
high-end options. Traditionally, consumers had to tradeoff
between high-end cabinets paired with cheap countertops
or the opposite, most couldn’t afford both. Our product gave
I N T R O D U C T I O N · 27
them the best of both worlds. It was engineered stone, with the
look of Corian and between the two extremes in cost.
Customers struggled to choose from the one-by-one inch,
countertop sample sizes. It was hard to pull out colors and
match them to the large cabinet doors. Yet, our competitors
used these same tiny samples. When I simply switched our
samples sizes to two-by-two inches, our product stood out. I
also realized that the wide spectrum of color options confused
the customer—some brands had upwards of fifty. Four shades
of beige just confused people. We had originally planned to
expand our palette, but I realized fewer, great options would
outperform. In this setting, more wasn’t better, just more over-
whelming. These two simple steps—making bigger samples
sizes and fewer colors options—resonated with the buyer. For
the first time, I saw the direct impact of solving a struggling
moment in the setting of sales. I had flipped the lens on how I
saw sales. Sales started to feel more like engineering—solving
a problem—and less icky.
On the business to business side, one of the biggest problems
stores had with our countertops was quoting. There were sev-
eral elaborate measurements, and every store did it differently.
Immediately, I streamlined the process. It didn’t matter if we
got the numbers exactly right. It mattered that regardless, we
lived by the quote and that it was easy to create. Right away
salespeople began selling our products—they were just easier
to quote.
2 8 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
I realized it wasn’t just about the product and what it did—
the buying process mattered too. There were a lot of details
wrapped around the process that when managed correctly,
could make us more valuable, like the samples and quoting. Yet,
none of the books taught me to look at sales this way—through
the buyer’s eyes. They were all about building a persona of an
ideal, imagined customer. And, in my experience, the imagined
customer had little in common with reality. The sales tech-
niques taught in books didn’t work in practice for me.
The idea of having a cold lead, where I pitched a preplanned
presentation of features and benefits to a persona and not a
real buyer, frustrated me to no end. A sales funnel based on
the probability someone will buy, without understanding what
causes them to buy, made no sense to me. In my experience,
customers bought on their terms. I didn’t convince them to do
anything, they convinced themselves. It was their moment of
struggle that became the seed that caused customers to switch
to my product or service. We are all creatures of habit, and
we will keep doing what we have been doing unless we have
that struggling moment. So I flipped the lens, stopped trying
to push my product, and started to understand what caused
people to pull new things into their lives.
Once I started focusing on the customer—their problem,
outcomes, and trade-offs—as well as gave the resellers tools
to inform the customer better, sales soared. Flipping the lens
from pushing product to creating pull for our solution changed
I N T R O D U C T I O N · 2 9
my perspective. And, I no longer felt like a used car salesman,
compromising left and right. There’s a different way to sell and
it starts with helping people make progress.
As of today, I’ve successfully launched over 3,500 products and
services across various industries in both business-to-business
and business-to-consumer situations and have created seven
start-ups. Along the way, I took this methodology for designing
and building new products and architected a theory called
“Jobs to be Done,” ( JTBD) with my friend and colleague, Clay-
ton Christensen of the Harvard Business School. JTBD is the
theory that people don’t buy products, they hire them to make
progress in their life. Together, we created this theory and it
helped me build better products. Then I realized it could be
applied to the sales process and understanding how people
buy as well.
The goal of this book is to reframe the way YOU think of sales—
to flip your lens and perspective. Great salespeople don’t walk
around in a sharkskin suit, selling for the sake of profit. Great
salespeople are real people: they ask questions, they listen, they
learn, and they help you make progress in your life. Salespeople
help customers solve problems and make progress in their life.
Instead of pushing their product, they represent their product
and how it fits into your life. Sales is about perspective—think
concierge, mentor, or a coach, not an order taker. It’s about
looking through your customer’s eyes, seeing what they see,
hearing what they hear, and understanding what they mean.

And there’s nothing icky about helping people. Period! The
world could use a little more help.
MY UNIQUE WORLDVIEW
Perhaps my ability to teach myself to reframe sales and to see
the world through this unique lens was a result of the fact that
my entire life has been about seeing the world from a different
perspective.
Growing up, I was a magnet for adventure and sometimes
trouble. I fought “wars” with my makeshift, conduit swords
and rode my bike off the garage roof for fun. By seven, I had
already experienced three closed head traumas that had an
impact on my ability to think and learn. Luckily, I was blessed
with an unbelievable mother! She was a Detroit schoolteacher
and single mom raising four kids alone. As such, she quickly
realized the impact of my injuries. While I was uniquely smart
in some ways, there were now things I just couldn’t do at all.
In grade school, I memorized entire books after they were
read to me—think Go Dog Go. This made everyone think
I could read when I couldn’t. Around third grade, during a
parent teacher conference, my mom and my teacher caught
on. Busted!
“You really can’t read, can you?” my mom questioned. And I
finally admitted it.
I N T R O D U C T I O N · 3 1
The diagnosis was that I had a form of dyslexia. I don’t see
anything linearly. When I see a page or a paragraph, I see the
spaces first, then I see the bigger words—but not all together,
in pieces. I take these broken letters and string words together.
My mom, who was a remedial reading teacher, taught me to
read with a big, red teacher’s pen. I would open a book, circle
the five largest words in a paragraph, and then I’d connect the
content to create meaning.
My disability dramatically shaped the person I am today,
because it forced me to create new abilities—to see patterns
in limited sets of data and use that to innovate. I was the boy in
my garage always tinkering around, trying to make something
out of nothing. I’d spend hours sorting through discarded junk
and scrap—broken TVs, arc welders, pumps, speakers—taking
them down to their bits and pieces and transforming other
people’s trash into my new creations. It was an unconventional
childhood, and these were my toys. But in the academic world,
it wasn’t so simple. The focus was on my weaknesses and a hard
push to meet the definition of average. Spelling, for instance,
was tremendously hard for me. I remember spending hour
after hour, year after year studying. Eventually, as an adult, I
just gave up. I realized focusing on my weaknesses to fit into
the corporate world was not going to work for me.
My struggles became the seed for me to become an innovator
and to develop a whole new set of skills and methods. I found a
different pathway. My work ethic became my strength, because
3 2 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
I had to work ten times harder than the average person just to
fit in. If something seemed impossible, I never quit—thanks
to my mother. I assumed it was my own failure and kept at
it. As a student, Ds were normal; I saw it as a sign that I just
needed to iterate more, learn and explore. I funneled these
character strengths into my passion for science, math, and
creating things. And my creations were fueled by my unique
perspective. When I see a flower, I don’t see a flower—I see
the seed, to the stem, to the flower. I see the flower opening,
and closing, and the context wrapped around it, similar to how
I see words. Ultimately, I see things in time and space, which
gives me a unique advantage.
When I was eventually dropped into the world of sales and
marketing at the countertop company, and found sales chal-
lenging, I decided to dive in and work the problem ten times
harder. As I puzzled over it, I realized the focus was always on
the product’s features and benefits. The customer was a set
of demographics: age, zip code, income, etc., but that’s not
what causes people to buy. Their age and location say nothing
about what’s going on in their lives. To me, these demograph-
ics seemed like static pieces hanging in space, disconnected. I
needed to connect the dots, go back to the “garage” and piece
them together.
When I started interviewing customers in Home Depot, on
the surface, there seemed to be endless situational reasons,
infinite even. I realized if I could group customers into a few
I N T R O D U C T I O N · 3 3
categories of causation, I could figure out how to come in at
just the right time and place in the buying process and help
them, as opposed to pushing my product. So, I dug a little
deeper. When I asked someone why, I stopped taking their
surface answer. When asked the right questions, the causes for
buyers shrunk dramatically—there were just five reasons my
kitchen-countertop customers bought. My discovery netted
me great success for the home products company; but at the
time, I didn’t realize I had stumbled across something much
larger than a way to sell countertops.
W H AT CAU S E S P EO P L E TO B U Y ?
My mentor, Dr. Genichi Taguchi always said, “Don’t con-
fuse correlation with causation,” and it’s a concept that’s
stuck with me throughout my career.
For instance, ice cream and sunglasses sales are cor-
related. Does this mean you should open an ice cream
shop and sell sunglasses? They are correlated, but one’s
about heat and the other is about the sun. Ice cream
sales and drownings are also correlated. Ice cream kills
people? Obviously, not! Correlation is not causation. Cor-
relation is surface knowledge and causation is truth. The
world of marketing is dominated by correlation. Once you
understand true causation, you have night-vision goggles.
The JTBD theory when applied to sales is a method for
understanding what causes people to buy, as opposed
to what correlates with your product or service.
The JTBD theory works across industries, products, and ser-
vices at scale. There really are NOT infinite reasons a person
will purchase a product or service, nor is there just one reason.
3 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
There are sets of causes—probably only four or five, path-
ways, patterns, or jobs. Most seasoned salespeople know the
causation of their product or services, that’s what makes them
great. This is my hack, so I didn’t have to fail for years before
getting better at sales. This was true of my Home Depot cus-
tomers, and it’s been true for the thousands of products and
services I’ve worked on since. I solved the puzzle of sales by
looking at it like the intricate parts of a flower, or deconstructed
words in paragraphs. My disability helped create my super
abilities—pattern recognition. I instinctively understood the
causality of the buyer to their products and developed a frame-
work for how people buy. It’s not a prescriptive way to sell or a
rigid process that tries to convince people with gimmicks and
techniques. People convince themselves; we convince them of
nothing. JTBD is a theory of how people buy, and demand-side
sales is a method for building a sales program around JTBD.
But I’ve not done it alone! Now I’m in my seventh startup—
Rewired—with my partner and co-founder Greg Engle. Greg
and I have worked on developing and launching products in
this framework for the past seventeen years. At Rewired, we
design, develop, and provide management consulting services
that help companies develop and launch new products. Greg
and I work side-by-side with our clients to help them under-
stand buyer behaviors and build the right go-to-market strategy.
While I’ve taught this theory in the classroom—I’m an adjunct
lecturer at the Northwestern Kellogg School of Management
and a guest lecturer at the Harvard Business School—Greg
I N T R O D U C T I O N · 35
and I finally decided it was time to slow down and share our
knowledge on a larger scale. The stories and ideas presented
in this book are a combination of our collective experiences.
ARE YOU STRUGGLING WITH SALES OR PROGRESS?
The struggling moment is the seed for all innovation! This book
is primarily for people who find themselves stuck. They are
struggling with the idea of sales. If you are knocking it out of
the park, then you already have your value code—this book is
not for you. But if you are like I was at thirty-four, and sales feels
icky, uncomfortable, and artificially social, this book is for you.
This book is for salespeople selling directly to customers, but
struggling in doing so. It’s for the salesperson trying to sell
to other businesses but failing to land accounts. And beyond
traditional businesses, it can be applied to healthcare profes-
sionals who need to convince patients about a particular care
regimen, or non-profits, such as church pastors, on how to
increase attendance and donations.
The title “salesperson” has gotten a bad reputation. People tend
to remember bad experiences, such as buying a car and being
pushed by an aggressive salesperson focused on their profit,
not the customer’s struggle. One bad apple has ruined the
bunch! But great salespeople don’t sell; they help. They listen,
understand what you want to achieve, and help you achieve it.
A better title would be “concierge.”

This book teaches my time-tested theory of sales. It provides
you a language to actively talk about sales in a more meaningful
way, one based on reality instead of focusing on the “church
of finance.” It’s a fundamentally different way to see the world
and once you flip the lens, you won’t be able to unsee it. It will
not only change the way you sell, but it will change the way
you buy. You will become more purposeful and understand
why. You will see it’s about a struggling moment. And you’ll
learn it’s not about you, it’s about their progress. It will teach
you to listen more intently, be more curious, and truly under-
stand what your customers are saying. Through our collective
experiences, Greg and I will lay out an operating framework,
so you can apply the theory to your own product or services.
There’s this underlying theme: nobody wants to be sold to,
but everybody wants to buy. But the reality is that great sales-
people help customers make progress in their lives, on their
terms. They are helpful, empowering, curious, and creative.
They create win-win situations! Salespeople are the lifeblood
of any organization. Let us teach you how to stop selling and
start helping people make progress in their lives.
Warning: by consuming this book you will not be able to unsee
the frameworks and theory of JTBD. The implication is that
you will never see a simple purchase the same way again. You
will challenge yourself and the people around you to think
about these decisions on a much deeper level: Why are you
buying this? What progress are you trying to make? What are
I N T R O D U C T I O N · 37
your new desired outcomes? It’s our hope that it will make
you a better consumer of products and services in your life by
allowing you to make more meaningful decisions.

TWO PERSPECTIVES ON THE
WORLD: SUPPLY AND DEMAND
“Experience by itself teaches nothing…Without theory, experience
has no meaning. Without theory, one has no questions to ask. Hence,
without theory, there is no learning.”

Through the years of developing new products and selling them,
I have come to believe there are two dominant perspectives
that drive the language and process for a business: the supply-
side and demand-side. The notion of supply and demand drive
how we see the world, what is important, and the metrics of
success. Yet, they are two very different perspectives. As you
will see, we need them both, but traditional sales are mostly
focused on supply-side thinking.

Let’s contrast supply and demand with something we can all
relate to—purchasing a new mattress. Traditionally, buying
a mattress sucks, right? There’s foam, spring, pillowtop, and
hybrids. There are also different sizes, cooling features, and
adjustability. Commissions-based salespeople approach you
in an empty store—it’s just you, them, and hundreds of beds—
and they blatantly push their products using confusing jargon.
What are they even saying? So, you stare at hundreds of differ-
ent models, one costs $1,500 and another $4,000…
“Lay down and pick one,” they say.
“I have no idea how to pick one,” you think.
It’s intimidating! There’s almost no way to judge; you’re not a
mattress expert. How many people want to buy a new mattress
but are intimidated by this process?
4 0 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
In 2014, entrepreneur Philip Krim, CEO of Casper, set out
to build a different type of mattress-buying experience. He
wanted to make purchasing a mattress simple. Instead of
variety, Krim decided to only build a few, high quality, foam
mattresses. Then the truly novel part, he sucked the air out of
his mattresses and shipped them directly to customer’s doors.
No big box-stores, no aggressive salespeople and jargon, just
a few clicks and voila, a bed-in-a-box sitting on your doorstep.
And if you don’t like it, you have one hundred days to return
it. And no, you do not have to get that bed back into the box;
they’ll come take it away. At the time, industry experts paid
little attention to Krim.
Five years later, Casper now has 3.2 percent of the US market
share for mattresses—ranking seventh. They’ve sold to over
one million customers with sales topping $400 million and
are at a valuation of $1 billion. Meanwhile, industry leaders
are barely increasing their market share, some are even losing
market share. So, how did this startup come into a well-
established industry with lots of competition and become an
industry disruptor? It’s called demand-side selling, and it’s
the basis for the JTBD theory of sales. Regardless of whether
Casper is ultimately successful, their approach is noteworthy.
SYNCHING SELLING TO THE WAY PEOPLE BUY
Buying is very different than selling. The best sales process
mimics the progress that people are trying to make in their
T W O P E R S P E C T I V E S O N T H E W O R L D : S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D · 41
lives. Selling is clearly a supply-side perspective, while buying
sits on the demand-side.
Instead of thinking about their product’s features and bene-
fits and asking, “What’s the demand for mattresses?” Casper
entered the scene and sold sleep. They asked, “How many
people struggle to sleep at night?” Their ads feature soft, fuzzy
bunnies and kittens crawling across their mattresses, tugging at
the sheets. “We asked these creatures of comfort what it’s like
to sleep on a Casper,” the narrator says. “Some things just don’t
need words.” The ad closes with the animals angelically sleeping.
Not once do you hear about the features and benefits of a Casper.
What’s so special about their approach? It’s a worldview of
selling from the customer’s vantage point, which we call
demand-side selling. Casper understood why people buy
mattresses and recognized the anxieties that got in the way.
And as a result, designed a better, more simplified way to pur-
chase a mattress. They made buying easy. They gave a few great
options, eliminating confusion. They sold mattresses the way
people want to buy—risk free and from the comfort of their
home. And, in the process, upset the well-established mattress
industry focused on their big, empty box-stores with hundreds
of mattresses and confusing jargon.
Traditional sales are not in sync with the way people buy.
We need to flip the focus of sales from supply-side selling to
demand-side selling. Let’s contrast the two.

“The tyranny of the average means that we allow ourselves
to be stereotyped, striving to fit someone else’s idea of
who we should be. When we stop comparing ourselves
to a non-existent ‘average,’ the gates just open.”
TODD ROSE, AUTHOR, THE END OF AVERAGE
Because the supply-side is so worried about efficiency
and effectiveness, it’s become all about building one
model that works for many people. But one-size does
not fit all! Aiming for average hurts customer satisfac-
tion, because when you strive for average you end up
pleasing no one.
For example, buying is very different than selling, just
like teaching is very different than learning. Yet in both
professions there’s a tendency toward a one-size-fits-all
approach.
In education there’s this notion of a pedagogy—the art
and science of teaching. Teachers are taught the best
way to teach. Yet in every classroom there are all sorts
of different learning styles, just as salespeople are taught
the best way to sell based off demographics. Yet buyers
are not all motivated to buy for the same reasons.
One size does not fit all in either scenario. There’s not one
way to sell or one way to teach. But there are also not
endless ways to teach and sell. There might be three best
ways to do each. It’s the “Pareto Principle,” also known
as the 80/20 rule; 80 percent of the consequences come
from 20 percent of the causes.
Supply-side: The focus is on the product or service and its
features and benefits. How will I sell it? Who needs my prod-
uct? You define demand through the product. In this scenario,
T W O P E R S P E C T I V E S O N T H E W O R L D : S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D · 4 3
the consumer is usually nebulous—an imagined, personified
version of the customer—an aggregated set of demographic
and psychographic information. You aggregate and triangu-
late the consumer around the product through correlative data.
When operating under this model you canvas the world for
people who need your product, adding features and benefits
along the way, to reach the widest audience. With supply-side
thinking the focus is on the profit—the product must make
money inside a specific cost structure. Everything you talk
about goes through the lens of the product or service. You
push your product. The supply-side does not see how the
product fits into people’s lives. It’s the fishbowl analogy: you
cannot see the whole picture swimming on the inside, only
what surrounds you.
“Just because I am 55, live in this zip code and have that income, it
does not cause me to buy the New York Times today.”

Demand-side: The focus is on understanding the buyer and
the user. How do people buy and how do they make prog-
ress? What’s causing them to make a purchase? You design your
go-to-market strategy around the buyer’s worldview, not the
product. You are looking at the world through a real buyer’s
eyes. It’s understanding value from the customer-side of the
world, as opposed to the product-side of the world. Demand-
side selling is understanding what progress people want to
make, and what they are willing to pay to make that progress.
Our product or services are merely part of their solution. You
create pull for your product because you are focused on helping
the customer. Demand-side selling starts with the struggling
moment. It’s the theory that people buy when they have a
struggling moment and think, “Maybe, I can do better.”

Traditional economics thinks supply and demand are con-
nected. But we would say that demand is independent of
supply. Demand is about a fundamental struggle. Supply and
demand are two completely different perspectives in sales.
Most people don’t think about your product or service if it
doesn’t address a problem they have. When you’re getting a
restful eight hours of sleep every night, you don’t even notice
the mattress store when you walk past. But if you find yourself
choosing the recliner every night over tossing and turning in
your bed, then you begin to look at—and see—other options.
When something’s not working the struggling moment occurs. It
forces people to stop and ask themselves a question. It’s those
questions that spur demand. When you study how people buy,
you realize if there’s no struggle, there’s no demand—without
demand people don’t buy. Once you see sales through this
lens, you can help people buy and make progress in their lives.
4 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
“Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t
asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind
and bounces right off. You have to ask the question—you have to
want to know—in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.”
Cl ay to n Ch r i st e n s e n, i n n ovat i o n e x p e rt
a n d H a rva r d Bu s i n e s s p ro f e s s o r
Supply-side and demand-side together make a business
work. The key to synching these two world views starts with
understanding demand without the product or your solution—
just the context and desired outcomes, tradeoffs, and hiring
requirements. Understanding the consumer at a very deep and
empathetic level adds more value to the sales approach than
focusing only on your product and its features and benefits.
Because once you understand the customer, you see pat-
terns and can now define the go-to-market approach based
on causation, not correlation. What causes your customers
to buy, not how many people are available because of their
demographics?

UNDERSTANDING YOUR CUSTOMER’S WORLDVIEW
So, what does it take to become a billion-dollar industry dis-
ruptor like Casper? It starts with listening to your customer
and truly understanding their needs. It’s not only what they
say, but how they say it, what they don’t say, and what they
eliminate. Greg and I walk through this process every day. We
identify struggling moments and then reframe products or
services from the customer’s vantage point—demand-side
selling. In the process, we learn to help customers and con-
sumers make progress in their lives.

Lead: A person with a correlative relationship to your
product or service, who has the potential to want it.
Prospect: A person who has a struggling moment, wants
to make progress, but hasn’t figured it out yet.
Customer: The person who buys your product or service
and has a set of expectations as a result.
Consumer: The person who uses your product or service
to make progress.
Note: Sometimes the customer and consumer are not
the same person. Think of a company that buys software
for their employees to use or a parent who buys a toy
for their child. In these instances, the customer and the
consumer are not the same person. The product must
be designed for the people who buy it and for people
to use it.
A perfect demonstration of the transformative effect of a
demand-side sales approach is the story of Paul LeBlanc, Pres-
ident of Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), and
how he transformed SNHU into a billion-dollar public (not-
for-profit) educational institution through demand-side sales.
The story begins in 2010 when LeBlanc attended an event
Professor Clayton Christensen was hosting at the Harvard
Business School. Clay and I were speaking about the JTBD
theory—now almost twenty years old—by demonstrating
a few case studies. At the time, the SNHU’s marketing and
T W O P E R S P E C T I V E S O N T H E W O R L D : S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D · 49
sales message was simple: “We’ve got online classes; you can
take them at any time.” Like most, SNHU sold their school
to prospective students by focusing on their product and ser-
vices—classes offered and a university degree. The process
treated the online school as an extension of the physical school,
yet LeBlanc’s takeaway from our talk was that the students
attending each might be different and potentially had a dif-
ferent set of causes on why they came and sought an online
education at SNHU.
LeBlanc took a huge step back and together we interviewed
some existing online students to understand their motives—
see what they saw, hear what they heard, and feel what they
felt. Why did they choose online school? Why now? What
barriers stood in their way? Demand-side sales always starts
with understanding the people who already bought and made
progress with your product or service and then seeing the pat-
terns to help others who have not made the progress yet.
We found that the typical online student was over thirty,
working a day job, and often supporting a family in some way.
Meanwhile, the students attending the physical school usually
began at eighteen, fresh out of high school, and lived a more
carefree existence. If you think about where you’re at emotion-
ally at eighteen, it’s very different—it’s a sense of freedom. Our
interviews provided a detailed look at the life of the typical
online student. We found they had life experiences and respon-
sibilities which were challenging to fit into studying, yet they
5 0 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
were willing to sacrifice nights, weekends, and sleep to learn.
Why? Because they wanted to secure a better life for their fam-
ilies; a step-up—a career—not just a job. They were motivated
internally because they knew they had to change their station
in life. They were making the choice from an emotional place
and not focused on the university’s features and benefits. As we
listened and understood, we thought, “There are five hundred
online students, but how many more people want to go back
to school, but can’t figure out how to do it? It’s a big market!”
C H O OS I N G CO L L EG E
My friend, educator Michael Horn, and I then took the
work we did with LeBlanc and expanded it beyond SNHU
and wrote a book called Choosing College. The book
strips away the noise and helps you understand why
you’re going to school: What’s driving you? What are
you trying to accomplish? Once you know why, the book
helps you make better choices.
The research found in Choosing College illustrates that
picking a school is complicated. By constructing more
than two-hundred mini-documentaries of how students
chose between different postsecondary educational
experiences, Horn and I explored the motivations for how
and why people make their decisions, delving into the
subject on a much deeper, causal level. By the end, you’ll
know why you’re going and what you’re really chasing.

LeBlanc launched an ad campaign targeting these potential
students in this moment of their life. It took an emotional
approach, resonating with the message of, “It’s possible.” The
ad started with a single parent, working a hard, hourly job,
struggling to meet the financial needs of their family—wanting
more. It showed the sacrifices, late nights and weekends study-
ing, contrasted against the feeling of pride. It’s the emotional
story of the satisfaction they’d feel in this accomplishment. You
see the character’s struggles and feel their success when they
finally start their new job—a new chapter in their life. The ad
was not about what they’d study, or how the university ranked,
but about the journey the online student would go through. It
almost contradicted traditional advertising, which says, “We
have the highest graduation rate, the best stats.” It said, “We
can help you get to where you want to go.”
SNHU was one of the first schools to strategically target this
online market. Their competition was nothing. When prospec-
tive students saw the ad they thought, “I’m either going to do
this or nothing; do I go or not go?” The ad ran for a month and
52 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
SNHU received thousands of applications—at least ten-times
their normal volume at that time!
But once they got these applications, there was a second prob-
lem. They couldn’t process the high quantities fast enough. It
took months. They didn’t have enough staff to quickly verify
them. The prospective students would see the ad, have a gut
response and sign up on a Friday and by Monday morning
they were asking, “When will I know if I got in?” Months later
when the university would finally get back to these people,
they had changed their minds. The energy behind the emo-
tional response to the ad was gone. We realized they needed
to figure out how to process the applications faster—in days
not months. So, we put a small admissions team together to
design a new application process that fit the unique needs of
the online students, while dramatically increasing the response
time.
As part of the new, faster admissions process, LeBlanc and
our team recognized that the application itself was a stum-
bling block. The average, prospective student couldn’t figure
out how to even apply. The traditional path, SAT/ACT scores,
securing transcripts, and writing an essay served as a barrier.
Most had no idea where to find their transcripts; they were not
coming directly from high school with a system to help funnel
them through admissions. So, rather than having students
submit test results and transcripts, the online process started
with an interview, where admissions verbally gathered the
T W O P E R S P E C T I V E S O N T H E W O R L D : S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D · 53
pertinent details—past academics and financials. Then admis-
sions would gather the documents themselves. This solved a
struggling moment for prospective students. Remember, these
were working people; they didn’t have much free time, and
they didn’t even know where to find the documentation. The
schools already knew exactly what to do.
As SNHU built the process out, more and more people were
attracted to the program. They realized there were way more
people who wanted to learn online and by the way, it was
cheaper to teach this way. The university was able to lower
costs, which allowed them to provide these admissions ser-
vices. Within seven days of applying they were able to tell
prospective students their options—academically and finan-
cially—and enroll them. It kept the momentum going!
But another problem emerged. The retention rate started to
drop. They found that about halfway through the school year
life would get in the way and students would start to drop out.
They started with the right intentions but couldn’t sustain it.
So, we spent quite a bit of time and energy trying to figure out
how to help them get through the rough patches. This time
LeBlanc turned to the academic advisors, whose typical job
includes helping students pick classes, and flipped them into
life coaches. They would monitor the students as they went
through the process reminding them exactly why they were
doing this. They became the angel sitting on their shoulder,
seeing when they hit a rough spot, and providing a bit of con-
5 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
fidence or a helping hand: tutor, work group, or somebody to
help them through it. It cut the dropout rate by almost ninety
percent.
In 2010, there were five hundred online students. Flipping
the focus from supply-side thinking to demand-side thinking
created exponential growth. In a short ten years, LeBlanc’s
online enrollment ballooned to a hundred and thirty thousand
students. He went from a $100-million university to over a
billion-dollar university!

Before 1943, there was no management theory of
business. Zero. At Ford, everybody reported to Henry
Ford—three thousand direct reports; a CEO gave orders,
and everyone followed. During this time period, a busi-
ness philosopher named Peter Drucker entered the scene
and upended corporate America with his new ideas of
decentralization. He sat down with Alfred Sloan of Gen-
eral Motors (GM), and remodeled GM by focusing on
power structures, political environments, information flow,
decision-making, and managerial autonomy. By shifting
power, he was able to replicate their systems leading to
immense growth. Now GM had a typical, modern-day
business structure: human resources, accounting, legal,
engineering, manufacturing, operations, facilities, mar-
keting, and sales.
Back in Drucker’s day, sales differed greatly from the role
today; it was simple. The traveling salesperson went from
town to town selling goods. The demand for everything
was great. Salespeople predominantly served as order
takers—fulfilling demand—because options were limited.
If you wanted to sell a car, you displayed it. Buyers could
not easily educate themselves on the options available
and relied on salespeople to help them.
While the power structurers architected by Drucker
remain largely in place today, the role of a salesperson
has changed dramatically. Today, information is readily
available, competition fierce, and consumers are well-
educated. As a result, salespeople are dealing with an
entirely different buyer. They don’t walk into a dealership
waiting to be sold to. They live in the age of information.
But a new problem has emerged. Consumers are over-
whelmed and inundated with information, more confused
than ever. As a result, buyers today struggle to find solu-
tions to their problems. Sales must evolve!

THE STRUGGLING MOMENT
The struggling moment is the seed for all new sales. By under-
standing this, LeBlanc didn’t have to convince anybody to buy
anything. The prospective students convinced themselves—
demand-side selling. If you talk the way the customer thinks,
selling becomes easy. You create pull for your product. How
do you do this? By listening, understanding, and figuring out
the contexts and outcomes that drive people to buy. SNHU
and Casper both became industry disruptors and made it big
by listening to their customers and selling the progress their
customer wanted to make. Twenty years ago, selling counter-
tops, I did the same.
If you take the time to listen and truly understand, you will
quickly realize it’s not about your product’s features and ben-
efits; it’s about the customer’s struggling moment and the
outcome they seek. How do the problem and the solution play
together? There’s a yin and yang; the push and pull. Compa-
nies get sucked into thinking about the features the customer
wants, as opposed to the outcomes they’re seeking. It’s the
basic premise of cause and effect. Understanding the context
by which people value your product will make it easier for you
to understand how to sell your product. Only your customer
can determine your value!

MAKING IT REAL
• On the demand-side think of two or three examples where
you tried to buy and the seller spoke from the supply-side,
in sharp contrast to your demand-side buying. For example,
you bought a new camera and they sold you shutter speed
and zoom, while you just wanted to take a picture of your
kid playing soccer.
• On the supply-side think about your product or services.
What supply-side language are you using? What demand-
side language is your customer using?
Now that you understand the difference between supply-side
selling and demand-side selling, let’s build the foundational
elements of a demand-side sales approach so you can begin
applying it to your own product or service.

THE FRAMEWORKS FOR
DEMAND-SIDE SELLING
“People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-
inch hole!”

Imagine yourself in the Home Depot or Lowes and you need a
drill. You go to the drill aisle and there are drills of every color,
with different torques, battery life, and accessories. What’s
happening here? The guys in Milwaukee are looking at their
competitor at DeWalt saying, “They just increased their bat-
tery life by 3 percent, we need to keep up.” This feature creep,
or incremental innovation, does very little to help move the
product. It is more about “keeping up with the Joneses” than
creating something the consumer can value. This is a supply-
T H E F R A M E W O R K S F O R D E M A N D - S I D E S E L L I N G · 59
side push of technology. Now when you walk down the drill
aisle you have side-by-side products that are hardly discernible.
How do we break out of this mold? By understanding the prog-
ress people are trying to make when they buy a drill. People
buy a drill to make a hole, right? We keep trying to sell people
the drill, when the reality is, we should be helping them figure
out how to drill the hole.
In marketing and sales, there’s the push to add a bunch of fea-
tures and benefits that don’t bring any value. We get so myopic
on the little things that we don’t realize the bigger purpose of
what people are trying to do. We should be asking why, and
not just once but several times. We need to get to the root of
the progress people are trying to make.
“I need a drill, because I want a hole.”
“I need a hole, because I want a plug.”
“I need a plug, because I want a lamp.”
“Why do you want a lamp?”
“Because it’s hard to see, and I want to read better.”
Now, we are beginning to understand the customer. They don’t
need a drill at all; they need a Kindle. Let’s invent the Kindle.
Demand-side sales is about taking a step back to see how your
6 0 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
products and services fit into people’s lives and the outcomes
they are seeking.
T H E F I V E W H YS
When I was eighteen years old, I had an internship at Ford
and went to Japan where I learned the age-old problem-
solving technique called the “Five Whys,” developed in
the 1970s by Sakichi Toyoda, founder of Toyota. It is used
to quickly get to the root of a problem. It’s the idea that
when a problem occurs you should ask why five times to
find the source of the problem. This method is still used
at Toyota today.
Part of the “Five Whys” is to take a step back and not
talk about what the customer wants from the solution
perspective. For example, people might say I want the car
door to be easy to open and close. Now, if you focus on
the door, you have a limited set of solutions. As opposed
to looking at it more broadly and thinking about making
it easier to get in and out of the car generally. Now you
are not just looking at the door but the placement of the
seatbelt, etc., because you stop assuming you know the
solution. It’s about seeing the bigger picture.
We use this methodology when interviewing our cus-
tomers to get to the root of the problem they are trying
to solve. Companies are selling drills instead of holes
because they do not ask why enough times. They sit
in boardrooms thinking of their product’s features and
benefits and fail to see how it fits into their customer’s
lives because they simply fail to ask why. You cannot
design the way your customer makes progress; you need
to understand their definition of progress and design your
process around it. People don’t buy products; they hire
them to make progress in their lives.

a JTBD is...

Moment

CIRCUMSTANCE
Idea of

PROGRESS
...the PROGRESS that a person is trying to make
in a particular struggling CIRCUMSTANCE.
Let’s define JTBD. It starts when people are in a struggling
circumstance, and they want to make progress. Take the above
graphic for instance. The person needs to cross the river: their
circumstance—so they can get to the other side: the progress
they want to make. There are 1,000 different ways we could
help them cross the river: teach them to swim, build a boat or a
bridge, fly a plane, and so on. But building their solution starts
with understanding their situation and why they are thinking
about making progress in the first place, as well as what their
vision of progress looks like.
Sometimes people start with a struggling circumstance but
have no idea what the other side looks like. Say your parents
complain about their house being too big, they hate shovel-
ing snow, and the taxes are too high. It’s not a real struggling
6 2 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
moment until they figure out what they want to do about it.
What progress do they want to make? Typically, this is where
people will complain but not do anything about it. The best
thing to do here is to take them to a condo and show them
what progress looks like, not hire a snowplow. Eliminating
the struggle is not progress, them overcoming the struggle is
progress. Both pieces are critical; the key to understanding
causation is found in the circumstance and the outcome. Value
is relative to your circumstance and determined by where you
start compared to where you end. Circumstance is a big part
of understanding causation. Their circumstance is a reference
point for their progress, without understanding their starting
place you cannot design their progress.
Great sales begins with understanding the JTBD by your cus-
tomer and the progress they are trying to make: What is the
situation they are in? What’s the outcome they seek? What
are the tradeoffs they are willing to make? We do this by inter-
viewing people who’ve purchased your product or services
and understanding why. And why is relative to what’s going on
in their life that caused them to say, “Today’s the day…” But
it’s not an imagined customer or persona as we explained in
chapter one, it’s real buyers. And the why you are looking for
has nothing to do with your features and benefits. It’s about
the customer and the progress they are trying to make in their
life. To build a meaningful understanding of why people buy
we must create language, a story, and a model of their strug-
gling moment.
T H E F R A M E W O R K S F O R D E M A N D - S I D E S E L L I N G · 63
We are going to introduce three key frameworks for how
people buy:
1. 2. 3. The three sources of energy or motivation (functional,
emotional, and social)
The four forces of progress (push, pull, anxiety, and habit
forces)
The JTBD timeline (sequence of events and actions to
make progress)
THE THREE SOURCES OF ENERGY—TYPES OF
MOTIVATIONS FOR PROGRESS
There are three different categories of motivation: functional,
emotional, and social. Let’s discuss how each of the three play
out in the buying process. Think of it as the energy or fuel to
make the buying process happen.
1. Functional Motivation. How cumbersome is the pur-
chasing process for the buyer—time, effort, and speed? I
think of mechanical things here: speed, effort, steps, etc.
Remember the online students at SNHU? They were work-
ing full-time jobs and trying to go to school at night. They
had little time to take the ACT/SAT and fill out a labo-
rious application with an essay. They had no idea how to
obtain a transcript. Wrapped up in the decision to go back
to school were these functional barriers that stood in the
6 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
2. 3. way. We needed to reduce this functional barrier. It was a
force pushing them away from our services.
Emotional Motivation. What positive or negative internal
thoughts are driving my purchase—fears, frustrations, and
desires? The online students were not focused on the uni-
versity’s ranking. Remember it was the vision of a better life
that drove them to suffer through the lost nights and week-
ends. They wanted to provide a better life for their family.
So, our advertisement painted that picture. It showed the
struggling moment that people face working a dead-end
job. It showed the hard work and the better life ahead. The
advertisement focused on the emotional satisfaction they
would feel providing for their families.
Social Motivation. How do other people perceive, respect,
trust, or acknowledge me? The online students wanted that
feeling of pride the diploma would create. They envisioned
just how proud their family and friends would be. And, as
a result, how proud they would feel about themselves. Our
advertisement painted that picture as well.

Overall, the goal in demand-side sales is to reduce the nega-
tive functional, emotional, and social motivations, which are
causing anxiety and serving as a barrier. While at the same
time, amplifying the positive motivations to create pull for
the product or service.
THE FOUR FORCES OF PROGRESS
One of the methods that we use to unpack causality are the
forces of progress. The forces at play determine whether people
can move from A to B and make progress. Will it be business
6 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
as usual or a new path forward? Within the forces are things
that pull people toward change and frictions that push them
back to the old. Buying is not random! When we talk about
consumers’ decisions, we’ve found there are ultimately four
forces driving their progress.
1. 2. 3. 4. The push of the situation. If you think about the struggling
moment for the person buying a mattress, it’s about need-
ing a better night’s sleep. They are tossing and turning and
it’s affecting their productivity during the day—the push.
The magnetism of the new solution. The moment you
realize that something might bring you a better night’s
sleep and help you make progress, that solution creates
magnetism and you start to imagine a better life with a
good night’s sleep. A friend buys a new mattress and raves
to you about it. The pull toward progress.
The anxiety of the new solution. Despite the problem and
the pull the new solution creates, there’s anxiety. Will the
new mattress deliver on its promise? Can I even figure out
which mattress is the best? What happens if I get the new
mattress and I hate it? These anxieties hold people back
from making the progress that they need.
The habit of the present. You are used to the old mattress,
even though it sucks. You’ve learned to live with it. There’s
an energy in that incumbent solution that keeps you from
making progress and stops you from switching.
Any time we talk to consumers about a purchase or switch
T H E F R A M E W O R K S F O R D E M A N D - S I D E S E L L I N G · 67
that they made, we’re constantly probing for the forces of
progress. The push of the situation and the magnetism of
the new solution need to be stronger than their anxieties and
habit before they will buy. What levers can we pull to get
them to switch to our product? As product developers we
think about the first two forces—the push and the magne-
tism of our product—a lot. We imagine the next big feature
we’re going to bolt onto our product, which everyone will
love. But we ignore everything else—the anxieties and the
pull of habit. Our experience has taught us that the money
is made on the anxiety side of the equation. If you can figure
out what’s holding people back, you can shortcut the sales
process and really increase profits. We’ve seen it time and time
again. It’s how Casper entered the well-established mattress
industry and upset the status quo.

Notice the above graphic. On the left-hand side we are thinking
of the past, which is the current situation and the lack of solu-
tion—the problem. On the right-hand side we are thinking
about the future and what you want to happen—the outcomes.
A JTBD is both the problem and the outcomes. The solution
falls in the middle on the graphic. Now if you look at it hori-
zontally, the top is more about the motivating factor moving
you forward, while the bottom is about the hindering forces
holding you back. By seeing the world in this way, progress
now becomes a system, an equation (F1 + F2) > (F3 + F4).
People only make progress when force one and force two are
bigger than force three and force four. What we are taught in
business school is to add more features, but the forces work as
a system and sometimes more features is not better because it
causes more anxiety. The ultimate thing is to see the way the
customer buys as a system that plays out over a timeline.
THE TIMELINE FOR PROGRESS
The forces and the motivations drive the buyer’s decisions,
but not in a vacuum. Like any good crime, there’s a timeline.
Yet, traditional sales teaches you that the buyer is just a set
of demographics: zip code, income, age, etc. We’ve already
learned how oversimplified this thought process is. But even
if you dig deep, and understand the forces and motivations at
play, it’s not the full picture. The buyer must also be in the right
time and place in their life. Nothing is random! Through the
T H E F R A M E W O R K S F O R D E M A N D - S I D E S E L L I N G · 69
years we’ve uncovered the six stages a buyer must walk through
before making a purchase:
1. 4. 5. First Thought—creating the space in the brain
2. Passive Looking—learning
3. Active Looking—seeing the possibilities
Deciding—making the trade-offs and establishing value
Onboarding—the act of doing the JTBD, meeting expec-
tations and delivering satisfaction and value
6. Ongoing Use—building the habit

There are events that move people along the timeline. When
conducting interviews, we imagine the events in their life like
huge dominoes falling. We need to understand the buyer at
a very granular level. What happened that made them say,
“Today’s the day I am going to…”? We need to understand
70 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
causality. What are the events which pushed and pulled them
to move forward or backward? It is an important concept. The
customer has a certain set of systems for how they buy, and our
process needs to feed their world to help them make progress.
So when interviewing, we continue until we can imagine the
dominoes in their life tipping over, moving them along the
timeline.
FIRST THOUGHT
When you finally have that first thought: “I’m not sleeping
well,” or “This is a dead-end job.” Whether you say it out loud,
or you have it in your head, it’s the critical first step for you
to buy. Before this first step, there’s not a place in your mind
to file the information about mattresses or online universities.
The thought process around buying is complicated.
Once you have the first thought, you’ve opened-up the space
T H E F R A M E W O R K S F O R D E M A N D - S I D E S E L L I N G · 7 1
in your mind for the information. Without this first thought
there is no demand. But once you have it, you notice things
you didn’t notice before, which causes you to transition to
passive looking.
Four ways to create a first thought
1. Ask a good question…and not give an answer
2. Tell a story
3. Give a new metric
4. State the obvious
PASSIVE LOOKING
You notice the mattress store when you pass it now. You drive
past a local university and wonder if they have online classes.
You have passed these places every day without a second
thought, but now, like Clay Christensen said, the questions
in your head create spaces to file this information. The first
thought is how you create the space. Passive looking is how
you start to fill the space. People can passively look for years if
there’s no event pushing them to the next step on the timeline.
Maybe you have a big meeting, sleep horribly, and underper-
form the next day. Now you might say to yourself, “Today I
need a new mattress.” This event is like a domino falling in
your life that moves you along the timeline to active looking.
Recently, a friend bought a mattress at Costco on a Saturday
72 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
while shopping with his two kids. On the surface he seemed
to do it on a whim. “It was an impulse purchase.” But we know
nothing is random, so I questioned him a little further.
“So how long haven’t you been able to sleep?”
“For two years,” he said.
His first thought happened two years ago. But the positive
forces toward change were not bigger than the anxieties and
the habit of the current situation. Two years later, something
happened that pushed him into active looking. The Costco
mattress was in the right time and place in his life. Like my
friend, consumers often can’t explain why they bought some-
thing, but with the right questions you can connect the dots
for them and understand how to help them make progress.
Passive looking is the act of figuring it out as you go through
life. You have a hole, a nagging feeling, you are struggling, but
you don’t know enough to move forward. It feels random. You
must decide if the struggle is big enough to warrant moving
forward while determining if a solution even exists to solve
your problem. Passive looking is about learning. Learning the
problem, learning the language, taking the temperature of
people around you, and socializing it. It’s usually done alone
and you’re not purposeful about it but more opportunistic—
there’s not effort, no time or money set aside to figure it out yet.
The moment people start planning, they are in active looking.
T H E F R A M E W O R K S F O R D E M A N D - S I D E S E L L I N G · 73
ACTIVE LOOKING
Active looking is when people plan, or spend time and even
money figuring out what’s next—the solution to their strug-
gling moment. In order to make progress and move forward
people need options, but not too many, as a reference point.
These options allow them to start to build an ideal solution in
their mind.
Now buyers also need a second event, a domino, before they
can move to the next step on the timeline. We call this event
a “time wall.” It can be artificial, or not, but it’s the fabricated
notion that they must make their purchase by a certain date. If
there’s no time wall, people might look forever. But the moment
the time wall is established, people buy. For example, “We hired
a builder for the kitchen remodel, and he needs the counter-
tops next month.” It doesn’t matter if they’re buying software,
countertops, or mattresses, there must be an imposed timeline.
Companies often run sales for this reason, but you must be
careful not to overdo it, which causes you to lose the urgency.
Active looking is where people start to invest time, effort, and
thought to see the possibilities. They notice discrete, indepen-
dent features and attributes and start connecting the dots to
frame future tradeoffs. Active looking is about divergent think-
ing and eliminating things. However, people are still abstract in
their thinking—they’re still learning. They start to invest time,
money, and effort to figure it out and often bring other people
into their thought process during this stage.
74 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
DECIDING
Here’s where people make their tradeoffs and ultimately decide
what they want. When buying, there’s no ideal solution, every
customer makes tradeoffs. Part of the journey in sales is under-
standing the tradeoffs your customers are willing to make.
When I sold kitchen countertops, I could send customers to
look at the low-end laminate and the high-end granite. These
were clear reference points for people to compare our product
to. Without these comparisons, people struggle to buy. People
need to reject something before they can buy something else.
Realizing what people are willing to give up in order to make
progress is the most powerful part. People will say they want
the top of the line mattress, or the best kitchen cabinets and
countertops, but when it comes down to it, nobody gets every-
thing they want. People make tradeoffs. You need to know what
tradeoffs your buyer is willing to make.
Deciding is where people connect the dots and realize they
can’t have it all. It is also where they make explicit tradeoffs
between things they value. The expectations for satisfaction are
cemented while they decide, and value is defined. The custom-
er’s understanding of quality, performance, and satisfaction
start here, and everything in the future is measured based on
the final expectations locked while they are deciding.
T H E F R A M E W O R K S F O R D E M A N D - S I D E S E L L I N G · 75
W H AT I S A T RA D EO F F ?
The traditional notion of a tradeoff is a set of “compro-
mises.” But in the setting of sales that’s not how we would
define a tradeoff. We think of tradeoffs as, “I can have it
this way; I can have it that way; or I can not have it at all.”
It’s choosing the best way to make progress, as opposed
to just a compromise.
For instance, people either want thick crust pizza or
thin crust pizza. If you averaged those results, you’d get
medium-thick crust pizza—nobody wants that. Using the
average does not work! By forcing people to choose thick
or thin, you make it easier for them to decide. They like
one or the other; it’s easy for them to eliminate one from
these two very different options.
A tradeoff in the setting of sales is more about helping
people make better decisions than compromises. When
tradeoffs are framed well it becomes easy to make deci-
sions. When they are not framed well people can’t decide
and they do nothing. Tradeoffs are the key to helping
people buy.
ONBOARDING
Onboarding is where the rubber hits the road. It’s where
the consumer determines if you’ve met the expectations set
when they decided to lock-in and buy your product or service.
Whatever expectations were set are now poured in concrete.
In onboarding, the consumer is having their first use of the
product or service and measuring that against their expecta-
tions to see if they bought what they think they bought. Here’s
where it’s important that the metrics set in deciding are the
76 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
right metrics, otherwise the consumer will be dissatisfied and
have buyer’s remorse.
Onboarding can be thought of as the “big hire,” or buying the
product or service, whereas ongoing use are the “little hires”
associated with the consumer incorporating the product or
service into their everyday life.
ONGOING USE
There’s a difference between buying and onboarding a product
or service and using a product or service everyday—ongo-
ing use. In fact, most think of buying and onboarding as the
beginning, but we always think of it as the end of part one
in a journey to make progress. In ongoing use, the consumer
decides if a product or service is doing the job through a series
of repeated little hires each time they use the product or service.
How well did we satisfy expectations? The satisfaction is deter-
mined by the expectations we set in part one. If you did not
set expectations well, the consumer will have new struggling
moments, which over time can lead to a new big hire. Ongoing
use is where the jobs get done and the progress is achieved.
As a simple example let’s use Windex. Onboarding, the big hire,
is buying the bottle of Windex and the first use of the product.
Ongoing use, little hires, is squirting the bottle of Windex as
part of your routine cleaning. How well does it work over time?

F O R
At the beginning of my career as an engineer, I would
design the best “little hire” moments, but nobody would
buy my product. I found myself always building stuff that
nobody bought because I was designing them with only
the little hires in mind. Then once I started designing for
the “big hires” I never had enough money left over to
design for the little hires.
What do I mean? Think of Salesforce. The big hire is
bought by the VP of sales, marketing and IT. They are
the ones deciding to increase the information system.
But the salespeople are the little hires, the people who
use the product every day. If Salesforce gets the big hire
right but fails to be user friendly, slowing people down,
the product will fail because ultimately sales will go down.
When you design a product, you need to build it to be
bought and used. You must focus on both the big and
little hire. Salespeople screw up when they over promise
and under deliver. We need to match the expectations
when buying with what we deliver, not over promise and
underdeliver.
Pulling together the forces, motivations, and timeline allows
you to see the buyer as a whole person. They are no longer a
set of demographics; they are real people. By understanding
the buyer in this way, you can begin to design a demand-side
sales process.

SEEING THE WHOLE: WHY DO PEOPLE BUY?
The key frameworks outlined in this chapter connect the
customer’s implicit systems for buying to the supply-side’s sys-
tems of sales, marketing, and customer success. When pulled
together, these elements will enable you to sell in a way that
helps the customer make progress in their life.
We will teach you how to think like the customer: to see,
unpack, and connect the demand-side of buying to the supply-
side of selling. Once you see what they see and hear what they
hear, you will be able to connect the customer’s phases for
buying with each of the departments in your organization. By
organizing your sales, marketing, and customer support system
to the customer’s system for making progress, the departments
within your organization will be able to work together as one
seamless system.
Progress is the goal of this book, and organizational alignment
the side effect! When you connect the dots between your
organization and the customer’s system of buying, helping
the customer make progress will naturally follow. Addition-
ally, approaching the customer from this vantage point will
accelerate your customer’s ability to make that progress. But
it all starts with understanding the customer’s JTBD, the trig-
gers, and the micro-progress at each phase in the customer’s
timeline. The following graphic is a snapshot of how your
departments will align to the customer’s systems for buying.

Demand-Side Sales is about helping your customer make progress
MAKING IT REAL
• On the demand-side, use the forces, motivations, and time-
line to map out a recent purchase you made. What were
the forces at play? What positive or negative motivations
contributed to your decision? How did you move along
the timeline?
• On the supply-side, use the timeline to describe how some-
body bought your product or service.
Now that we have the bones of the framework for demand-
side sales, let’s look at how these components play out in a
real-life example.

SOLVING THE CUSTOMER’S
STRUGGLE
In 2004, I decided to apply my skillset in sales, marketing, and
engineering to a local business where I could make an invest-
ment. A small, regional home builder based out of Detroit was
a natural fit. When I joined the company, they built close to
a hundred houses annually. I told them I would partner as an
investor over time, but I wanted to spend a year learning about
the business first. So, I became the vice president of sales and
marketing.
Our top competitor was a large, national home builder who
sold significantly more volume than us. With my engineering
background, I walked in with the ability to influence how the
homes were designed, reducing costs, as well as sales and mar-
keting—the hard part.
S O LV I N G T H E C U STO M E R ’ S ST R U G G L E · 8 1
Right away, I was shocked! The sales process was based off
the assumption that people who bought new, never looked
at used. “Nobody who wants to buy new is looking at a used
house ever?” I questioned. I knew this could not be accurate.
Additionally, salespeople pitched the homes using the same,
preplanned presentation for every prospect regardless of their
circumstance. A customer would walk in the door, be briefly
greeted, then given a presentation which consisted of a litany
of features and benefits. Most people walked away and stopped
listening after about three minutes.
“Well, let me tell you about Elk Trail. Elk Trail is a community
of two hundred and thirty houses that’s thirty-seven percent
finished, and we’ve got fifteen houses that are up for sale, blah,
blah, blah.”
They’d run through this presentation without asking any ques-
tions: Why are you moving? What’s going on in your life? And
this was the standard approach across all new real estate sales;
our large, national competitors had the same approach. It was
in this setting where I met my longtime partner Greg, who had
also recently joined me at this regional homebuilder.
“What the heck is going on here?” we both questioned. Greg
came with an extensive background in sales in both food and
electronics retailing. He was fresh off a big growth effort that had
ended in a company running out of cash and quickly into bank-
ruptcy. Their loss and our gain. We hit it off from the beginning.
8 2 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
RETHINKING THE SALES PROCESS
We decided to start by talking to homeowners who had bought
houses from us over the last six months. Greg and I would take
a couple of pizzas, some soda, and a flip chart to their home
and interview them. We would draw a line down the center of
the chart and begin.
“This is today, and here is where you had the first thought of
buying. Now, tell us the story. How in the world did you get to
the point where you bought this house?” we’d ask.
At first, people would say they couldn’t remember, but there are
techniques we can use to jog their memory. We wanted specific
details: What knowledge did they have along the way? When
did they have this knowledge? How did the knowledge impact
their decision? But we didn’t ask those questions directly. We’d
often say something casual to set the tone: “Imagine, we want
to shoot a documentary about how you decided to buy this
house.” Then we’d start from their move-in day, walking the
conversation backwards through the timeline. As we went
along, we started to understand the thought process home-
owners went through.
We were curious, how did the preplanned presentation impact
their decision? It turns out, it did not influence their purchase
at all. The preplanned presentation, which droned on with a
litany of features and benefits—not a deciding factor. Only a
third of our preplanned presentation nailed what they wanted.
S O LV I N G T H E C U STO M E R ’ S ST R U G G L E · 8 3
Another third confused them; they had no idea what we were
talking about. And a third would play into their anxieties, push-
ing them away. “Do I really need all of that?” they’d wonder.
So, while the presentation hit on everything imaginable with
the intent to reach the broadest audience, overall it actually
damaged our chances of selling a house.
UNDERSTANDING THE PUSHES AND PULLS
So, what forces were at play? What was pushing them towards
buying? What anxieties were pulling them away from the pur-
chase? How did their allegiance to the past, their old house,
play a role? What finally caused them to say: “Today’s the day
I am going to buy a house?” Simply, we pulled our house out of
the solution set; our house did not cause them to buy. So, what
did? To find out, we tried to discuss their purchase without
talking about our house at all.
“Why did you move?”
“What was going on in your life?”
“What were you hoping to achieve by moving here?”
Each interview took about an hour. They’d talk about their
struggling moment. We’d have them draw a picture of the time-
line with no words. After ten interviews, we asked ourselves:
“What do these stories have in common?” And we’d start to
8 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
see a pattern. Three of the stories boiled down to a growing
family that needed more space—babies, generations moving
in together. They wanted help finding a home that would allow
them to live together more harmoniously. Another five of the
stories were about the opposite—downsizing. They’d tell us
about getting older and wanting to travel. The kids had moved
out, and they didn’t need the space anymore: “I don’t want to
host the holidays,” they’d say. They wanted help figuring out
how to downsize.
Those interview patterns showed very consistent forces at
play—pushes, pulls, and anxieties. What were they worried
about? What were they not worried about? For this example,
we will focus on downsizers, a main target audience for this
home builder.
The Four Forces
The push of the situation. What’s going on in their life that
triggered the desire to move? Nobody really wants to pack
up their entire house and move. We usually asked, “Why in
the world did you need to move now?” The answers varied,
but it was not an infinite number of reasons. We would get
a laundry list: the house is too big, the kids have moved out,
the yard’s too much work, the laundry room’s in the basement,
high taxes, etc.
The magnetism of the new solution. Our brand-new condos
S O LV I N G T H E C U STO M E R ’ S ST R U G G L E · 8 5
were ideal for these buyers: first floor, two bedrooms, two-
and-a-half-bath, first floor laundry. They’d see it, and there’s a
pull toward it. “What do you like about our condo?” we’d ask.
Not surprisingly, they spoke of the newness, updated kitchen,
and laundry placement. Often, we’d hear that they wanted to
travel more and liked the lack of seclusion—their belongings
would be safer.
Anxiety of the new solution. But as they’re thinking about
everything they love, and the reasons it’s perfect, they are also
simultaneously thinking of a set of questions and anxieties;
panic would kick in:
“How are we going to move?”
“How are we going to sell the house?”
“Where’s the grocery store?”
“How are we going to get rid of all the stuff in the basement?”
After all, they were downsizers who needed to pack up a 3,000
square foot home and consolidate it into a 1,600 square foot
condo.
The habit of the present. There were always a lot of things
they loved about their current situation. They had friends and
a community. They’d raised their kids there; it’s packed full of
memories. The habit encourages them to stay put.
8 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
Their fears and force of habit would overwhelm their overall
appreciation of the condo. So, despite the positives, they’d
start to pull away. They needed something to push them to
act. There’s a push—the magnetism of the new condo—but
there’s more anxiety than anything else. We could build the
best condo in the world, but if the push and the pull are not
greater than the anxiety and the habit, they’re not going to
move. In business school we are taught to add more features
and benefits, which would create more magnetism, pushing
people to buy our product. It’s not true! We’ve got to reduce
their anxiety.

The Three Motivations
So, how do we go about doing this? It starts with grouping their
positive and negative motivations into three categories—func-
S O LV I N G T H E C U STO M E R ’ S ST R U G G L E · 87
tional, emotional, and social—and stepping in to solve their
anxieties within each category.
Functional motivation: Our interviews had established
that many of our buyers were downsizing. They had a 3,000
square-foot home and were moving into a 1,600 square-foot
condo. They had a lifetime of belongings that they needed to
sort through. What stayed and what went? It was a daunting
task. Many talked about the challenge of sorting through and
packing up their entire life. Wrapped into their home purchase
were a plethora of fears and anxieties. They’d get stuck and
consider not buying.
Our solution: We raised the price of our condos, built a stor-
age facility across the street, and hired movers to pack their
belongings, label their boxes, and move them. We included
this service as part of our package. Additionally, we built a
clubhouse with a sorting room inside our storage facility. Now
when their kids visited, they could all walk across the street,
and sort through their lifetime of belongings together at a
casual, leisurely pace.
This decision alone increased sales by 22 percent! We solved
a functional problem by making it easier to move. Conversely,
our competition down the street offered $5,000 off and free
granite. Did they even want granite? Most buyers could read
through this gimmick and understood they just jacked-up their
prices.
8 8 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
Emotional motivation: We learned through our interviews
that most of the downsizers began thinking about moving
during the holidays. As they prepared the Thanksgiving feast
for twenty, and set up the decorations for Christmas or Hanuk-
kah, they’d decide they were ready to pass the torch to their
children.
“I’m done hosting the holidays,” they’d say to themselves. “This
is too much work!”
They’d tell us that they only wanted a kitchen bar, where
they could have three or four chairs and a small kitchen table.
They’re downsizing after all; it made perfect sense. What they
really wanted was a large second bedroom with a suite for visi-
tors. Yet, when we dug deeper a consistent theme arose across
multiple interviews. What happens to the dining room table?
“Well, my niece Sarah might take the dining room table, then
we could move,” we heard in one interview. At first, we thought
nothing of it. But then it happened again. “My cousin Mac took
the dining room table and then we moved.” We heard it once,
twice, by the end we heard it ten times.
“What’s going on with the dining room table?” Greg and I
wondered.
Despite everything they said about not hosting the holidays,
they were torn. We realized that the dining room table turned
S O LV I N G T H E C U STO M E R ’ S ST R U G G L E · 89
out to be the emotional bank account of their lives. They could
not just put it in the basement, or into storage; it wasn’t going
to Goodwill or any old stranger. If they did not know what was
going to happen to the dining room table, they were not going
to move. So, as much as they told us they wanted a second
bedroom with a large suite, it’s not what really mattered. Emo-
tionally, they could not move without sorting out the dining
room table.
Our solution: We reduced the size of the second bedroom
dramatically, gave it shared a bath, and made a small room for
the dining room table. We realized that if they did not have a
place for the dining room table, they were not going to move.
The table represented every birthday, holiday, and special event
from their past. It was all tied up emotionally in that table. The
moment we added a small room for the table—not functional
for hosting anything—sales jumped 27 percent.
We did the opposite of what they told us to do, because of the
emotional bank account the dining room table represented.
Social motivations: Our condos appealed to a fifty-five-plus
audience who didn’t want the chaos of a typical subdivision.
Many saw their neighborhoods changing over to young fam-
ilies and now felt out of place. They were socially motivated
to live near other people in a similar circumstance. Similarly,
when younger families move it’s often about wanting their kids
in a better school district, near a certain church, etc.

UNDERSTANDING TIME AND PLACE
So, how did we take the knowledge from our interviews and
market to people at scale? Sometimes your strategy changes
in unexpected ways…
The Timeline
At the home builder, when we interviewed people about their
first thought of moving, they often talked about setting up for
the holidays.
“I told my husband, we should think about moving next year,”
said one buyer. “We’re doing too much. The kids moved out.
We should pass the torch to our children and take it easier on
the holidays.”
But the holidays came and went. They no longer were having
the conversation actively, but because of that first thought, they
were now noticing things that they otherwise might not pay
attention to—passive looking. “The house down the street
went up for sale,” they would tell us. “Once we saw that we just
up and got a real estate agent.”
Remember, nothing is random. So, we wanted to know what
the heck happened that made them reach out to a real estate
agent? There’s no doubt that an event in their lives pushed
them from passive looking to active looking. Hiring a real
estate agent is active looking. What was it? This is where we
S O LV I N G T H E C U STO M E R ’ S ST R U G G L E · 9 1
would stop and say, “Hold on a second, tell us a little bit more
about the agent.”
“Oh, we’ve known her for years. Her name is Sally. She’s been
a good friend of the family, blah, blah, blah.”
“So, when did you sign up?” we’d ask.
“I don’t know, February maybe.”
“Was it the middle of February, end of February?” we’d question.
“It was the middle of February.”
“Near Valentine’s Day?”
“No, it was after Valentine’s Day.”
“All right,” we’d say. “Was it during the week or on the weekend?”
“Oh, it was during the week.”
“Now, this seems a little strange, but pretend we are shooting
a documentary. Sally comes over, right? Did you call Sally?
Did Sally call you?”
“Oh, we called Sally.”
92 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
A favorite technique we use to jog people’s memories is to get
into the minutia of their life to trigger bigger memories.
“What were you wearing when you signed the documents, and
where were you?” we questioned.
“Now I remember! It was a Thursday,” and the flood gates
opened. “We had just come from a funeral. Our friend Jim
passed away. We realized his poor wife would have to move
their entire house alone. If we don’t move now, one of us is
going to have to move without the other, and neither of us
wants that to happen. On our way to the funeral parlor, we
decided to call Sally.”
We heard this story once, twice, ten times. So, we decided to
run a test. We moved our advertising from the real estate sec-
tion to the obituaries. And seemingly overnight, we got a 37
percent increase in traffic and because ad space is cheaper in
the obituaries, a 70 percent reduction in costs. The leads were
unbelievable. The close rate on those leads was unbelievable
because they were already in active looking.
CONTRASTING SUPPLY VERSUS DEMAND
When Greg and I first came into our roles at the regional home
builder based in Detroit, salespeople viewed everyone who
walked through the door as a prospect. They had a preplanned
presentation that talked about our features and benefits at a
S O LV I N G T H E C U STO M E R ’ S ST R U G G L E · 93
very high level. It’s sales from a product perspective—supply-
side sales. As a rule, preplanned presentations tend to get
bigger and bigger over time and less and less and less relevant.
But once we understood the buyer’s timeline and developed
questions and answers specific to their position on the timeline,
we only needed two minutes instead of twenty:
1. 2. 3. “How long have you been looking?”
“Is your house up for sale?”
“How’s your life going to be better by moving?”
Once we saw the world through the buyer’s eyes, we were
dramatically more efficient. We could employ just one sales-
person per homesite, because we didn’t have to talk for twenty
minutes about every feature and benefit. Once we knew where
they were on the timeline, we could figure out what we had
to do to help move them along the timeline. The goal was
not to get buyers to jump from the first phase to the fifth. It’s
not possible! Knowing the customer’s stage on the timeline
allowed us to talk to them and help them move forward at
their pace.
If we pushed too hard at the beginning, we would have turned
them off and even scared them away by feeding into their anxi-
eties. Instead we met them where they were on the timeline. If
their house was not up for sale yet, we’d tell them to go online,
fill out a survey, and we’d help them get it listed. If they were
unsure how much they could afford, we’d look at their debt
9 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
and give them the answers. Let’s build a solution together and
help you frame out your options.
How many people want to move but can’t figure out the
details? If we could help solve their roadblocks and move them
through the phases of buying, we were much more likely to sell.
We didn’t create more things, we took care of their anxieties,
which increased the pushes. We recognized that we were not
just builders, we were movers! The more we could help people
move, the better off we were.
When Greg and I began at the regional home builder, there
were seven homesites and one-hundred houses sold annually.
After switching to a demand-side sales approach, we catapulted
the business to fourteen homesites and three hundred homes
sold annually. We created pull for our homes by understand-
ing the customers’ struggles and meeting them at the right
place and time. We figured out how our homes fit into their
lives. Greg and I viewed ourselves as a moving company, help-
ing people get from one home to the next, not just a builder.
Together, we have now applied this approach to hundreds of
companies for both sales and strategy, including innovation
and start-up communities.
MAKING IT REAL
• On the demand-side, take a minute and look for struggling
moments in your life. What did you buy recently? How
S O LV I N G T H E C U STO M E R ’ S ST R U G G L E · 95
did it relate to a struggling moment? Connect the dots
between your struggling moment and the purchase.
• On the supply-side think of your products or services fea-
tures. What are the struggling moments that make these
features valuable?
Now that you’ve seen demand-side sales in action, let’s walk
through the process step by step with three case studies, start-
ing with the customer interview.
9 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
C h a p t e r F o u r
SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH
THE CUSTOMER’S EYES
The devil is in the details! Wrapped up in the details you will
find the social and emotional energy that caused someone to
buy. Without the little things, the sale never happens. To help
people make progress, you must understand how other people
who bought your product or service before made progress.
This starts with interviewing existing customers.
It’s natural human behavior to hold back when being ques-
tioned; to give the simplest answers to stop the interview.
As a result, our interviewing techniques are based more on
criminal and intelligence interrogation methods than market
research methods and social sciences. You must unpack things
from the details, to actions, as well as to when (time) and to
space (where). It’s the details that enable us to understand
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 97
what caused a person to make progress and buy our product or
solution. But the interrogation should feel like a casual conver-
sation, like talking to a friend. Easier said than done.

FINDING THE SET OF CAUSES THAT MAKE
PROGRESS
Interviewing for causes is part art (learned through experience)
and part science. It’s based more on criminal and intelligence
interrogation than traditional interviewing and market research
techniques. Short of water boarding, people will lie to you and
to themselves. “Buyers are liars!” has always been a saying in
the sales world. The reality is that buyers rarely intentionally
lie; but, for example, “to get healthy” is not a cause, that’s more
a wish or a desire. Compare that with causes: “I don’t want to
die” or “I want to fit into that suit for the wedding next month.”
The key to interviewing for causes is following a set of prin-
ciples and tips that act as guardrails for best practices. Also, I
recommend reading and re-reading Chris Voss’ book Never
Split the Difference. It’s a collection of tools and techniques that
take interviewing to the next level—amazing book. And, as
such, we can’t simply give you a few tips and walk away. First,
we’ll set the stage with our best interrogation techniques for
ensuring interview success. Followed by a demonstration of
our interviewing process with three real examples:
• a C-Level executive firing a bank and hiring a replacement
• a person choosing a virtual doctor over urgent care
• someone purchasing a new computer
We will make it look easy, but it’s much harder than it appears.
The key is to practice.
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 9 9
THE FIVE KEY PRINCIPLES
It’s important to keep these five principles in mind as we move
forward with the technique. Think of them as the guardrails
that safely keep you on the right path.
1. 2. 3. Humility: You’re not smart enough to instinctively know
why people really buy. Assume nothing! You need to be
an investigator to understand the causal events that led
someone to make a purchase. There are too many causes
and too many different sequences, which makes it hard to
see patterns. You can’t sit in a conference room and figure
this out.
Causality: Everything is caused; nothing is random.
The notion of randomness was created to help us be “okay”
with no explanation. But it’s overused and has the side
effect of enabling us to waste time and wait. Home builders
will sit in a trailer in the middle of a development waiting
for people to randomly stop by. That is insanity! People
don’t randomly stop by—they stop by with a purpose, but
because we don’t know when, we don’t ask why.
Tradeoffs: Everyone makes tradeoffs to make progress.
I’m willing to give up this, so I can get that. No one can
have everything. What tradeoffs is your customer willing
to make? I have a friend who bought a brand-new Audi
RS7—beautiful car. It was silver, and he wanted matte grey.
Why did he settle for silver? Because he would have needed
to wait another month for the car to get matte grey. He
was willing to make a tradeoff to have the car immediately.
1 0 0 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
4. 5. Sales is about managing and packaging the tradeoffs the
consumer is willing to make.
Disconnected: Most people don’t know why they do
what they do. They will tell you a purchase was random, an
impulse purchase, or they’ll give a simple answer. You need
to dig and not accept their surface response. Most people
live their lives in the moment and don’t connect the dots.
“I bought a mattress on an impulse.” “So how long haven’t
you been able to sleep?” “Two years.”
Lies: Everybody lies. You must be careful not to fall for
the lies people tell themselves. If someone says, “I bought
this product because it’s important to be healthy.” You
should ask them to tell you three other things they’ve done
recently to be healthy. They don’t lie with malice or intent.
They build a story that fits their world. We call it the cake
layer of causality. Lies are a very complicated thing. This is
about getting past the lying, past the cake layer.
THE TOP TEN JTBD INTERVIEW TIPS
Next, we have our top ten tips for interviewing…
The setup
Set a casual, conversational tone from the beginning. Ask for
first names of people, places, and dates. Almost like you want
to shoot a documentary.
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 01
Do this: “I’m doing some early
research to understand the language
people use when talking about
buying our product. There’s no
right or wrong answer. I don’t
have a long list of questions. This
is about helping us understand
the words you use, and how you
fit our product into your life.”
Don’t do that: “I’m doing research.
Tell me why you bought this.”
It’s important they don’t feel like there’s a right or wrong
answer. When set up correctly, the conversation becomes more
casual. We truly do not bring a list of questions, because it’s not
about our product; it’s about the buyer’s progress. We follow
the interview where it takes us and fill in the timeline as we go
along. Also, at the start ask the names of key players, like their
husband or kids. Then use them later in the interview when
you ask a follow-up question. Suddenly, you’re at a different
level of familiarity.
Details, details, details
Yes, you’re digging for the details, but the details are also how
you jog their memory.
Do this: “What was the weather
outside?” “Who was with you?” “Did
you call them, or did they call you?”
Don’t do that: “Tell me about
the day.” General high-level
questions do not work.
Asking detailed, specific questions about tangible aspects is a
trick to jog an interviewee’s memory. Asking innocuous details
surrounding their purchase triggers bigger pieces of the puzzle
to fall into place. “It was snowing! Oh, now I remember…”
1 02 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
The brain can remember vast details when prompted or sur-
rounded by details.
Context creates meaning
The irrational becomes rational with context. When the
answers feel irrational, it’s typically because you don’t know
the whole story. “Hold on I am confused…”
Accept this: “I bought the pizza
because our team won the
big game, and we all wanted
to go out to celebrate.”
Don’t accept that: “I bought
the pizza because I like pizza.”
Like is not a cause, it is an
excuse for not knowing why.
Most people if asked would say they like steak and pizza, so
why did they buy pizza in that moment? Why didn’t steak make
sense in this context? Context has as much meaning as the
product.
Contrast creates value
Providing an interviewee with contrast leads to greater under-
standing. Have them tell you why they decided against an
alternative path. I use a bracketing technique to help pro-
vide contrast where neither option is right, and they need to
elaborate.
Do this: “Why do it virtually?
Why not just get into your car
and drive to the doctor?”
Don’t do that: “Why do it virtually?”
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 03
Without giving them contrast they often can’t figure out why
they did what they did. Ask people to tell you what it’s not.
Most people can eliminate or tell you what it’s not easier than
they can tell you what it is.
Unpack vague words
Everything is bound. You are trying to figure out the inter-
viewee’s reference point.
Accept this: “It installed fast, in
just under two minutes. The last
program took five minutes to install.”
Don’t accept that: “It installed fast.”
One person’s definition of the word fast may be entirely dif-
ferent than another’s. There’s no healthy, only healthier than…
There’s no fast, just faster than…
Energy matters
Listen for the energy. It’s not just what they say but how they
say it.
Question this: “I bought this
new laptop and it’s REALLY
good.” “[Sigh] I bought this
laptop and it’s good.”
Don’t question that: “I bought this
new laptop, and it’s really good.”
Do they accentuate words? Does the intonation go up or down?
Downward intonation implies there’s something wrong. Listen
for pauses and sighs. Did you hear a comma, but there is no
1 0 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
comma? Did you hear all caps, but there’s no caps? As soon as
you hear this emotional energy, stop and ask further questions.
“Wait, tell me more about that. Why is that important?” When
we interview customers, Greg and I focus on how people say
things as much as what they say.
Play “dumb”
When you want to question what they’re saying, put it as your
own stupidity or your naivety. “How much RAM did you get
on the new computer?” you might ask. “Well, I don’t know,”
they respond apologetically. In this scenario you need to be
able to delve into the topic without making them feel dumb.
“I am confused” is one of my favorite sayings…but you have
to mean it when you say it.
Do this: “I mean what’s RAM
anyway? You know what I mean?”
Don’t do that: “Why don’t you
know how much RAM you got?”
The moment someone feels stupid they shut down. The
moment they think you are judging them they feel insecure.
Sometimes interviewees set up a response by saying: “This
is really stupid but…” And I will respond: “Oh, I do that all
the time.”
Set-up bad questions
A lot of times there’s a question that is either a little bit too
personal or a little too close to the vest. You know that if you
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 0 5
don’t ask, they will never tell you, so you set it up: “Okay, this
is a bad question, don’t feel you need to answer it and please
make it better.”
Do this: “I’ve got a personal
question, and if you don’t want to
answer it you don’t have to, but
why were you at the doctor?”
Don’t do that: “Why were
you at the doctor?”
When you set it up as a bad question, they are always expecting
the worst, much worse than the actual question. It disarms
them from what might have been a negative or awkward
response.
Good cop, bad cop
It always helps to interview in pairs. You don’t have to, but
when you do, you can play good cop, bad cop.
Do this: Argue with each other
to fuel the conversation.
Don’t do that: Argue
with the interviewee.
Or we play back the story wrong and argue with each other
over the details. It’s a good way to check what’s most important
to the interviewee.
Use analogies
Often the interviewee will hit a wall and not have the language
to express their thoughts completely. Don’t push, instead use
analogies to help build language.
1 0 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
Do this: “How is buying a
phone like buying a laptop?”
Don’t do that: Continue to
push in the same way when
they are at a loss for words.
Sometimes asking them to compare two things that are not
similar at all works well. It forces people to think and use better
language.
CASE STUDY EXAMPLES
There’s something called the domino effect. It’s the idea that a
domino can topple over a domino double its size and start a
chain reaction. As you read each of the case studies, imagine
what dominoes had to fall for people to move forward along
the timeline. What forces were at play pushing them toward a
new product and pulling them away? To be clear, the following
interviews are actual stories, not brainstormed or ideal-user
experiences. Seeing the customer from the demand-side will
clearly demonstrate the disconnect with supply-side-only
thinking. “The irrational becomes rational with context,” we
always say. People making plans in conference rooms about
products are largely rational. Yet, most people do not behave
rationally when they buy. Customers make tradeoffs and con-
nect dots emotionally—even when choosing rational services
like banking.
The purpose of this section is to demonstrate how we uncover
the forces, dominoes, and motivations through a series of ques-
tions formed in the moment, not preplanned. Our discussions
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 07
then act as a guide for the frameworks outlined in chapter two.
It’s important to not just listen and take surface answers but to
unpack the personal meanings behind the language being used.
Ultimately, it’s about the intent behind the words. Additionally,
we listen carefully to not only what people say, but how they
say it. You’ll see that the same words can be said in completely
different ways, which can imply different intents.
As we go through the interviews, we will pause—game off—to
discuss what we’ve learned before continuing forward—game
on. These moments of reflection will show what we have learned,
and where we are headed next, so that hopefully you will begin
to understand the degree of listening, thinking, and adjustment
that’s required when you conduct your own interviews. We will
make it look easy, but it’s not. Successfully conducting inter-
views to understand the causes behind customer’s decisions
requires practice, like riding a bike. And like riding a bike you can
only learn so much before you need to hop on and try it yourself.
CASE STUDY #1: BANKING
What Causes a Bank to Get Fired and a New One Hired?
What makes someone fire a product or service and hire a new
one? A struggling moment and a thought: “Maybe I can do
better…”
Our first case study is the story of Chad. He owns a biotech
company for hospital equipment that he founded in 2009. A
1 0 8 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
short four years later, he fired the initial bank holding his loans
and investments. Why? We sat down with Chad to uncover
his story.
Chad began by giving us the pertinent background infor-
mation. He acquired the company in 2009 after raising the
Series-A Equity—capital from investors—in conjunction with
the initial financing. He hired a bank, we’ll call them “Bank A,”
to manage all their holdings. “Bank A” held their loans, total-
ing about $2 million, as well as their treasury management
systems and merchant card services. (Treasury management
systems optimize a company’s liquidity, while mitigating risk.
Merchant card services are for credit card and debit card
transactions.)
After four years, in 2013, he fired “Bank A.” We asked him to
recall back several years to tell us his story, so there are cobwebs
around some of the specifics; but when getting someone to
recall memory, if it’s emotional, it’s in there. What forces drove
Chad to change banks? What solutions did the new bank offer?
What role did Chad’s anxieties and forces of habit play in the
decision-making process?
Bob (The setup): Chad, we’re trying to understand the lan-
guage people use when they talk about banks. This is early
research, so we just want to have a conversation to get your
story. Imagine I’m shooting a documentary and I am trying
to understand why you switched banks. We’re going to ask
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 0 9
some weird questions, but we don’t have a list. We just want
to hear your story.
Bob: At some point, something happened at the old bank that
made you say, “Today’s the day we’re going to switch banks.”
Tell us about that. At what point did you have the first thought?
At what point, in and around the decision in 2012, did you
think, “Okay, we have a problem.”
Chad: We did a minor acquisition, which we internally
financed. But as a result, we needed to restructure our capi-
talization table. (The capitalization table is a spreadsheet that
shows the company’s equity ownership).
Bob: So, what happened next?
Chad (Energy Matters): Well, it became very clear that the
existing institution did not understand our business AT ALL.
And more importantly, just didn’t have a desire to understand
our business!”
Bob (Unpack vague words): What do you mean? How do you
know they didn’t understand?
Chad: The financial changes were very standard for a
life-science business. Yet, we were getting pushed into a cookie-
cutter scenario that did not apply to our business. They never
tried to understand what we were trying to do, or where we
1 1 0 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
were trying to go. Also, the person we were dealing with was
very green, and the third relationship manager we had been
assigned in as many years.
Bob (Unpack vague words): What do you mean by third rela-
tionship manager?
Chad: The person we started with, who put the facilities in
place initially, left and the position had turned over several
times.
Bob: Three times?
Chad (Energy Matters): At LEAST three times! I had never
met this new person face to face. It quickly became clear that
this was going to be an arduous process for a minor change. It
concerned me, because I knew that in six months we wanted
to put new financing in place for capital expenditures for the
remainder of that year. (Capital expenditures are funds gen-
erally used for a new project.) This headache over a relatively
minor change made me very concerned about their ability to
handle the bigger financing coming down the pike.
Bob: Are you trying to educate this relationship manager?
Chad: Yes.
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 1 1
Bob (Details, details, details): Are you doing this on the phone
or email?
Chad: On the phone.
Bob: Are they local?
Chad: Yes, local.
Bob (Context create meaning): But he wouldn’t come over, or
you couldn’t go see him?
Chad: Well, I’m not going to go. I mean…
Bob: Just say it. He works for you, right?
Chad: Yes!
Bob: Damn it. He should come to you!
Chad (Energy Matters): If they wanted to understand our busi-
ness, come see our freakin’ business.

Can you see the energy here? He uses the word freakin’. Why is
he so upset? Most people are conflict avoidant, they’d move on.
But here’s where you need to dig in, it’s counterintuitive, but
buried with the emotions are the pushes of why he left the bank.
Hear that statement again: “If they wanted to understand our
business, come see our freakin’ business.” We need to unpack
those key words: understand and come see. Are they the same
thing? Come see implies he wants a relationship, while under-
stand indicates he wants them to know how he makes money.

Bob: Right! He’s sitting at his desk listening to you talk, doesn’t
understand your business, and at some point in time you must
be thinking, “I have to explain all of this? Oh my god, really?”
Did you invite him over?
Chad (Energy Matters): Oh, ABSOLUTELY! We had several
phone conversations where we talked about the EXACT same
information. The conversation would end. Our relationship
manager would go back to gather information, so we could talk
again in ten days. Ten days later, NO CALL. I’d call them and
they’d start all over again asking the EXACT same questions.
Bob (Context creates meaning): Is there time pressure on your
part? Do you need to get this done by a certain date?
Chad: For that job there wasn’t a significant amount of time
pressure.
1 1 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
Bob: But it’s that other thing…
Chad: I knew that the clock was ticking, because I wanted our
new capital expenditures facility in place within one hundred
days. And if I’m going to switch institutions, well now there is
time pressure, because I’ll need to repackage the whole deal.
There was time pressure in terms of are we staying or going.
Bob: You’re not revealing this other plan to him? You must be
thinking, “Oh my god! If I add this to the conversation, it’ll
confuse the crap out of him even more?”
Chad: Well, I’m not trying to be a shitty customer and act like,
“Well if you don’t get this done, we’re out of here.”
Bob: You’re trying to make it work.
Chad: I’m thinking, “I’m trying to give you more business, and
I think this should be a relatively easy thing to get done, but if
you’re going to put us on the back burner and just not give us
an answer, string us along for six months, then that’s just not
going to work for us.”
Bob (Details, details, details): So, imagine I want to shoot the
scene of you hanging up the phone and turning to whoever
and saying: “Okay, we need to start looking for banks.” When
did you finally do that? What was the last straw?

Chad: I think it was the second or third phone call where we
went over the exact same things again. And I knew we were
dealing with somebody who was very green.
Bob (Context creates meaning): Why didn’t you elevate it?
Chad: Oh, I tried.
Bob (Unpack vague words): What do you mean you tried?
Chad: I tried.
Bob: What does that mean, you tried?
Chad: I went to the president of the bank and basically was
told that I needed to work with this person.
Bob: Wow!
Chad: And at the time, I think we were probably the second or
third largest long-term loan they had in their portfolio.
Bob: Is this where you open the flood gates? How do you find
the new bank?
Chad: We had just hired a VP of finance. I was in the process of
allowing that individual to really own the banking relationship.

Clearly, the energy of all three realms—functional, emotional,
and social—are at play here. Who said banking is boring and
not emotional? We have enough of the back story, but we need
to keep digging: How did he find the next bank? Who helped
him? Did he hire the new VP based on this banking problem?
How did he fire the old bank? What fears are driving his deci-
sions? Keep digging, uncover more! We know the struggling
moments, the pushes: He wants to grow the business and the
bank does not understand him. The bank is rotating through
people. They are nickel-and-diming him to save pennies, while
he’s trying to grow. Let’s go to the next side of this.

up!
Chad: I told him the most important thing was that we have
an institution that understands our business.
Bob (Unpack vague words): What does that mean? What are
they supposed to know?
Chad: Different businesses have different unique metrics. For
instance, what’s a receivable, what’s not? Is a maintenance con-
tract a receivable? Or is an annual renewal? Do we lend on that?
Do we not lend on that? How do we structure that borrowing
base? It takes some real in-depth knowledge of a company’s
contracts; how they renew with their customers, etc.
Bob: Got it.
Chad: Hospitals typically pay slow. I don’t think that’s a shock
to anybody. Our borrowing base is not a standard ninety-day
borrowing base. Anything past that, screw you. We have almost
zero bad debts, but our borrowing base needs to be 100 to 120
1 1 8 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
days. If we’re at an institution where it’s, “This is our standard
deal, here’s our template. You either fit this or don’t.” That’s
not a place for us. And frankly I don’t think that’s a place for
any company.
Bob (Context creates meaning): Who wants that, right? Did
you even give them a chance? Did you even tell them that
you’re shopping?
Chad: I think after the third phone call, I unleashed my VP of
finance: “Here’s what we need, go look for it. Here, are insti-
tutions off the top of my head that you should go talk to; add
whoever you want to the list.”
Bob: How many banks did he bring you?
Chad: Four.
Bob: Help me understand what these four meetings were like.
How do they know what to pitch?
Chad: If I sit down in a meeting of that nature and there’s
a Power Point presentation already prepared, a deck to sit
through, I get up and leave.
Bob (Context creates meaning): Why?
Chad: Because they don’t know us. The finalists in that process
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 1 9
were the ones who opened up the meeting with, “We’re really
happy to be here. We want this meeting to be all about us
understanding you and your business. And then we’re going
to go back, put our thinking hats on, and come back with a
presentation.” As opposed to, “Here’s our standard deck that
we give to every company, and you’re going to fit into one of
our three boxes.” Ultimately, we ended up with the bank we
did because they started from a blank sheet of paper. I also
knew that group very well, but I tried to remove myself from
the decision.
Bob: But even knowing them very well, they still came in with
a blank sheet versus a Power Point?
Chad: Absolutely.
Bob (Details, details, details): And you didn’t tell them to come
in with a blank sheet?
Chad: No, not at all.
Bob (Contrast creates value): Was there another bank that came
in with a blank sheet?
Chad: Yeah, one other.
Bob: The other two of the four, gone right away? So now you’re
down to two?

Chad: Correct.
Bob: How in the world did you choose? And what was the
timing on it?
Chad: Here’s the interesting part. The bank we picked was
more expensive.
Bob: You bought the more expensive one?
Chad: Absolutely, because the structure of the term facility on
the future capital expenditure was much more flexible.
Bob: So, you bought flexibility?
Chad: Absolutely. In terms of features, that’s what we cared
about.
Bob (Contrast creates meaning): And tell me why the other
guys lost.
Chad: My personal relationships certainly played into it.
Bob (Unpack vague words): What does that mean? Tell me
more about that.
Chad: Well, I knew that group extremely well.

Chad: I knew the individual who ran that group, I worked for
him at Merrill Lynch.
Bob: Okay. Yeah, but working for somebody and knowing
somebody…
Chad: I trusted him.
Bob (Unpack vague words): What does that mean? Whoa, trust.
It’s a big word.
Chad: I trusted that he would tell me things clearly and upfront.
Meaning what they can do and what they can’t do.
Bob (Contrast creates value): So, wait a second. Give me an
example of exactly that. What’s something they said, “Yeah, we
can do this, but we can’t do that.” Can you think of a specific
causal thing? It was five years ago, so it might be too hard.
Chad: Well, I’ll say this, originally when we switched, I per-
sonally guaranteed everything.
Bob: Wow!
Chad: And in those conversations, I remember very distinctly
asking, “Is there a way that we can structure this, and I can get
1 2 2 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
off as a personal guarantee?” The other bank said, “Well, maybe.
Let’s look at it. Let’s talk about it.” Which just means, “No, but
we don’t want to tell you. We’re going to pop that on you two
days before closing.”
Bob: Or two days after.
Chad: The bank we ended up choosing said, “Nope. Can’t do
it and if that’s a deal breaker, we need to walk away right now.”
Bob: Wow! So, I just want to make sure I got this straight. By
delivering the bad news in a straight-forward way he earned
your trust, because the other guys waffled on it.
Chad: Yeah.
Bob: You want somebody who’s going to be direct with you,
and trust was earned because he could deliver the bad news.

CASE STUDY #2: HEALTHCARE
How Do People Choose to Get Help from a Medical
Professional?
Greg and I had been working on a project in the on-demand
care space. We wanted to understand how customers used
those medical services before recommending how to enhance
or amend them. So, we recruited a list of patients to interview
who’d used these services in the past ninety days. Our first
patient was Jen. She had hired virtual care for the first time
recently, rather than going to urgent care. We wanted to know
1 24 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
why. What caused Jen to go there? What was she expecting, and
did the services meet those expectations?
Bob (The setup): We want to talk to you about some of the
services you’ve had in the last ninety days. If there’s anything
you don’t feel comfortable answering that’s fine. We don’t have
a list of questions. We’re trying to understand the language you
use as a consumer. Imagine we’re shooting a documentary, if
we have an actress that’s going to play you, what do we tell her
to feel like? There are no right or wrong answers.
Bob: Before you start, can you tell us a little bit about you and
your family?
Jen: My husband and I have been married for almost twenty
years and have a college-aged daughter, Susan. My husband is
very technically savvy and is a software engineer.
Bob: What’s his first name?
Jen: Kyle. My daughter is also tech savvy, so there’s a lot of
laughing at me that goes on.
Bob: You’re not tech savvy?
Jen: I can make things work, but I have a learning curve.
Bob: You count on them, or you just have them do it for you?

Jen: No, I have them help me troubleshoot when I can’t figure

Why in the world do we need to know her husband’s name?
Because it builds familiarity and ease. If throughout the inter-
view I now refer to him as Kyle, rather than your husband, it’s
almost as if we are friends. The more you can make people
comfortable, the more they are going to reveal the emotional
and social aspects behind their decisions. Additionally, she
offers up a vulnerability by letting us know that she’s not that
tech savvy. The more we can lean into this and help her feel
comfortable the better.

Bob: Tell us about the first time you used virtual visit? Do you
remember when it was?
Jen: I was very sick; my voice was going. It was a Sunday
morning.
Bob (Details, details, details): I almost want you to do a timeline.
When? In the fall, the spring?
Jen: Probably February or March timeframe. I had a choice,
I could go to urgent care, I could wait and call the doctor on
Monday, or try the virtual visit.
Bob (Details, details, details): I want to kind of slow it down a
little bit. You had been sick for a while, or you felt it coming on?
Jen: I had been sick for several days by then.
Bob (Unpack vague words): What does that mean, several days?
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 27
Jen: Four or five days.
Bob (Contrast creates value): Tell me how it started. Did it ramp
up, or was it terrible the whole time?
Jen: It started out just like a regular cold. I have asthma, so I
started to cough a lot. It got to the point where it was a barky
cough and annoying to my coworkers—that’s usually what
encourages me to go to the doctor.
Bob: Do your coworkers say something to you?
Jen (Energy matters): They’re like, “Oh, are you okay?” You
know, after eight hours of sitting next to someone that’s bark-
ing, it’s annoying!
Bob (Context creates meaning): Just to make sure I got this
right, your clue that this is a problem is when somebody says,
“Are you okay?”
Jen: Yeah.
Bob: But you still didn’t go, why?
Jen: I thought, I’ll hang out over the weekend, I’ll start to feel
better. Then it was Sunday and I realized I would still be bark-
ing on Monday. I knew I didn’t have time for that.

Bob: It was the notion of going in on Monday still sick? You
thought, “crap”?
Jen: Exactly.
Greg (Good cop, bad cop): You didn’t feel bad?
Jen: I felt bad, but that’s not usually the thing that will get me
to go. It’s when it’s noticeable to other people.
Greg (Unpack vague words): What does feel bad mean?
Jen: I have less energy. People will notice that I look tired.
Greg: Were you running a fever?
Jen: I might have been. I don’t know.
Bob (Context creates meaning): It almost feels like you’re too
busy to notice. You’re coughing but don’t really notice. And at
some point, people are interrupting you and you think, “Leave
me alone, I’m fine”?
Jen: Right.
Bob: Is that an over exaggeration?
Jen: No, not at all.

you didn’t want to bother the people around you at work the
next day or that you felt bad?

“Are you okay?” “Have you gone to the doctor yet?”
Bob: You’re guilted into going.
Jen: I feel bad but not enough to go by myself.

Wow, so the push is not just that she feels bad for several days,
it’s the fact that people keep asking her about it. She is more
worried about how she’s perceived than her own health. You
start to realize the impact of social pressure; some people need
to not only feel bad, but they need other people around them
to push them to go to the doctor. I imagine her worrying on
Sunday about the response from her coworkers the next day.

Bob (Details, details, details): What time do you decide to go?
Jen: Sunday, probably around eight in the morning. I had on
my bathrobe. I thought, “Am I going to go to urgent care, or
am I going to go do a virtual visit?” I hadn’t done one before.
Bob (Contrast creates value): What’s the difference between
the two?
Jen: In urgent care, you go and wait in the waiting room, then
they’ll see you without an appointment. Virtual care, if you
can figure out how to sign up, can be done from the comfort
of your home.

Jen: You see the face of the person on the other end, like Skype.
Bob: Sounds like they’re the lesser of two evils.
Jen: Right.
Bob (Details, details, details): How far away is urgent care?
Jen: Probably ten, fifteen minutes.
Bob (Contrast creates value): What was the thought about
going there? Was it even a real consideration or was it, I’m
going to do this virtual thing?
Jen: No, I was going to go. Then I was in my bathrobe and I just
didn’t feel like getting dressed and going out.
Bob (Contrast creates value): If this had occurred at three in
the afternoon and you were dressed, you probably would have
just done urgent care?
Jen: Probably.
Bob: Eight in the morning, still coughing? Are you sitting there
with your husband, Kyle?

Why am I getting so specific with Jen? Because it’s hard for
people to remember things when they are not tied to a sig-
nificantly emotional event. We find that people can remember
way more than they think they can if you can get their mind
back into the context of the moment. The details help people
remember what really happened. So, I am unpacking these
details to help her remember. When conducting an interview
where the person is hesitant with their answers, deploy this
tactic. The more you can get them back in the moment the
more the details will flow.

Jen: We were in the office.
Bob: What’s the conversation?

more. You walk in, or he walks in, you’re already there?
Jen: He’s in the room, I come in the room; he’s always in there

because he works from home. I say, “I feel pretty gross, I think
I need to go to the doctor.” And he’s like, “Yeah, I told you to
do that.”
Bob: When did he tell you to do that?
Jen: Probably two days before that.
Bob (Setup bad questions): This might be a hard question, but
is this more about Monday, or is this more about needing to
feel better?
Jen: Probably equally both. I don’t want to go into another
week feeling bad with no plan in sight. I probably wouldn’t get
around to it through that entire week.
Bob: Right, because you had a full schedule already, you lost
your energy Wednesday, Thursday, Friday so you’re already
behind.
Jen: That’s right.
Greg (Details, details, details): Is the virtual visit software
installed?
Jen: No, I didn’t need it before then.

Greg (Good cop, bad cop): Come on. Why didn’t you just
get dressed and go? Sorry, but you’re not the tech savvy one,
you’ve declared it. You’ve got to install this thing.
Jen: I figured if it didn’t work, I could still go.
Bob: It’s almost like, “I’ll try this and if I can’t figure it out, I’ll
just get in the car?”
Jen: Yup.
Bob: You’ve told us that Kyle is tech savvy, is Kyle helping?
Jen: No. But I knew if I got stuck Kyle would help.

click on, it says virtual visit, and it brings up the virtual visit

Bob: Then what happens?
Jen: It says, “do you need to log in, sign up?” It walks you
through the screens.
Bob: Okay. You had not signed up?
Jen: No.

sign up, or how easy it was?
Jen: I had no idea.

Jen: I did, because it tells you how much it’s going to cost.

Jen: Forty-nine dollars.

CASE STUDY #3: CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
How Do Real Consumers Buy a Computer?
Think about the language computer companies use to sell
computers: gigabytes, RAM, and CPU. Is this the way the
average consumer talks when they buy a computer? Most
companies tell people how to buy a computer. But when you
talk to real consumers, how they bought, is completely out
of sync with sales processes. How do people buy computers?
Most people need help to translate the confusing features and
jargon, they are buying in spite of the way they are being sold
to, not because of it. How many people want to buy a new
computer but don’t know how? It’s a massive market. Yet com-
panies spend fortunes competing, worrying that there are not
enough consumers to go around. If they flipped the lens and
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 4 3
focused on helping people, their market would be twice as big
as everybody else’s.
We interviewed Rachel, who recently bought a computer, to
understand what caused her to buy. What language does she
use when talking about buying a computer? You will see that
Rachel does not buy a computer by any of the standards com-
puter companies are selling to her. I setup the interview with
Rachel as demonstrated above in the first two case studies,
let’s jump right into it.
Bob: Can you tell me a little bit about yourself, your back-
ground, what you do for a living?
Rachel: I’m a freelance writer, a journalist, and I also do some
work in public relations.
Bob: How long have you been writing?
Rachel: My entire career, about fifteen years.
Bob (Setup bad questions): If this is too personal you don’t
have to answer, but are you the only income in the household?
Rachel: No, I work part-time. My husband, Eric, is the main
income.

Bob: But you take it seriously? How many hours a week are
you writing?
Rachel: Yes, I take it very seriously. I work about twenty to
twenty-five hours a week.
Bob (Details, details, details): What computer did you buy?
Rachel: The Lenovo ThinkPad. I had a Mac, and I was having
a lot of problems. Partially because it was older.
Bob: How old was the Mac?
Rachel: About six years old.
Bob: You had a Mac and switched to a PC? What was going on?
Rachel: I’m a contractor, and when I would interface with
companies, they were all Windows-based. I had the Win-
dows applications on the Mac, but it was glitchy. It wasn’t user
friendly.
Bob (Unpack vague words): Can you give me an example of
glitchy?
Rachel: When I would incorporate Windows-based templates
they wouldn’t necessarily format right.
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 4 5
Bob (Contrast creates meaning): It feels like it’s a lot of extra
work. Is it a little extra work or a lot of extra work?
Rachel: It was a little extra work each time but a constant issue.
Bob: What happened that made you say, “Okay, I’m done.” It
feels like you had work arounds.
Rachel: My daughter was admitted to the hospital. She has
chronic medical issues, and it’s one of the reasons I’m a con-
tractor; I can still work while supporting her at the hospital.
But I suddenly had internet issues, trouble staying connected
to the hospital’s server, and the battery kept dying. I wasn’t
always in a spot where I could plug it in while working. To
make matters worse, sometimes it randomly wouldn’t power
on. I had deadlines to meet and now my time was very limited
because I was juggling her care. I didn’t have the bandwidth
for computer problems!
Bob (Contrast creates value): Did these issues slowly ramp up
over several months, or did it become a problem suddenly?
Rachel: It was a sudden problem because of my daughter’s
hospitalization.
Bob: Did it just die, or did you give up on it?
Rachel (Energy matters): I just gave up; I’d had it!

new computer ASAP.

Rachel: He works in software sales. He’s very technologically
savvy.
Bob (Details, details, details): Imagine I am shooting a documen-
tary. Do you call him? Text him? Tell me about that conversation.
Rachel (Energy matters): I texted him. It wasn’t a new idea.
We had talked about it several months before this happened. I
had already told him that the computer was frustrating me; he
suggested I get a new one. So, that day in the hospital I sent a
very brief, urgent text: “Help! I need a new computer now!”
Bob: He was waiting for you to be frustrated enough? Did he
already buy it and just have it in the package at home? Like
“go upstairs, it’s right there.”
Rachel: He had already picked it out; it was in the cart online.
Bob: Let me make sure I’ve got the story right. For months
you have several different things wrong with the computer, but
the stress of now being in the hospital is the last straw. You are
more pressed for time. The battery life sucks. And you decide
you’re done, and you need something else.

Rachel: Exactly.
Bob (Contrast creates meaning): Was it more about the
fact that people were counting on you, or that you were
frustrated.
Rachel: It was more about the fact that people were counting
on me. I got nervous that I would not be able to deliver.
Bob (Details, details, details): What did you tell Eric you
needed? Did he ask you any questions, or did he just know?
Rachel: Well, he knows what I do. I told him I needed to be
able to write, seamlessly interface with Windows-based sys-
tems, video conference, and have a decent battery life.
Bob (Unpack vague words): Battery life, what does that mean?
It’s got to last eight hours, the entire day.
Rachel: No.
Bob: It was literally just boot up and be available for two hours.
Rachel: Yes.
Bob: Got it. But he didn’t understand whether you needed a
350 milliampere lithium battery or an i7 processor? You didn’t
use that language; you were counting on him to translate?
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 49
Rachel: Yeah. And frankly, in that moment, it would have over-
whelmed me if I had to figure it all out.
Bob (Play dumb): Who understands all of that anyway? You’ve
got your sick child, if you had to walk into Best Buy and figure
this out, it’s not going to happen, right?
Rachel (Energy matters): I would’ve lost it! Thankfully, he
bought it and brought it to the hospital the next day, then he
sat there with me for two hours transferring files and talking
me through any differences.

tion events, people don’t buy. Things will always happen at
the worst time because it’s that struggle that causes change.

ANXIETY OVER THE NEW WAY
CREATING REAL GROWTH
Imagine if Chad’s relationship manager had taken the time to
go to his office and learn the business. Imagine how many more
people might use virtual care if they weren’t trying to learn
about it while sick. Imagine if salespeople sold computers the
way Rachel bought, talking in a recognizable language.
Most real growth does not come from stealing a small seg-
ment of customers from your competitors. It comes from truly
understanding the problem your customer is trying to solve
and focusing on helping them. By doing this you reach people
who wouldn’t even enter the marketplace to begin with. This is
where most real growth comes from—the struggling moment!
Instead, the focus of sales tends to be on the point of differ-
S E E I N G T H E W O R L D T H R O U G H T H E C U STO M E R ’ S E Y E S · 1 5 1
entiation from competitors. One more feature: they have
Bluetooth 5, we need Bluetooth 6; they have two-cell lithium
ion batteries, we need three-cell. You end up over-engineering
the product, until people don’t even understand what they are
buying. The buyer doesn’t care! They want you to solve their
problem; to speak their language. Salespeople should be doing
these things, but they are not.
MAKING IT REAL
• On the demand-side, take a very specific struggling
moment in your life and unpack the vague words you use
to describe it.
• On the supply-side, unpack the most common word that
people use to talk about your product or service. What
does it really mean? How do you cause it?
Let’s take these three case studies and begin to build a sales
process around the results of our interviews that focuses on
helping people make progress.

For each of these case studies you may think there is no way
anybody else lived this story. But you’d be wrong! It’s not the
exact details of each story that matter. Let’s delve into the why
behind Chad, Jen, and Rachel’s decisions. Why did they each
hire a new product or service into their lives?
• Chad switched banks, because “Bank A” failed to under-
stand his business, treated him as a low priority, and offered
him cookie-cutter options, while Chad knew there was a
time pressure ahead.

• Jen tried virtual care because her coworkers kept question-
ing her illness; it was Sunday and she wanted to stop the
probing on Monday morning.
• Rachel bought a new computer because her old one
wouldn’t boot; she was now pressed for time and couldn’t
risk missing a deadline.
Yes, the details will change, but if you conduct enough inter-
views you will see consistent patterns. Other people buy in
similar circumstances. And for every person who bought in
these circumstances, there are thousands, even millions behind
them who want to make the same progress but can’t figure it
out. Let’s look at the big picture again.

The key flip here is to use the timeline as the frame around how
people make progress. Then take each phase of the timeline
and make it a sub-system of the bigger process. By doing this
we can then look at the discrete progress people are trying to
make at any point on the timeline.
• First Thought: creating space in the brain for solutions to
fall into
• Passive Looking: learning, framing, and prioritizing to
know what to do next
• Active Looking: seeing possibilities, framing trade-offs,
and ruling things both in and out—inclusion and exclusion
• Deciding: connecting the dots into alternatives for prog-
ress, getting buy in from the group, making trade-offs, and
setting expectations to measure progress
• Onboarding: first use, doing the job, and seeing both the
progress and the metrics of progress achieved
• Ongoing Use: building new habits, identifying new strug-
gling moments, and new feature development
Let’s review each of the case studies and see how they connect
to the supply side.
BUILDING PROGRESS ON THE BUYER’S TIMELINE
Let’s take each of the three case studies and break them down
into the sales framework you learned in chapter two. We’ll start
M A P P I N G D E M A N D - S I D E B U Y I N G TO S U P P LY- S I D E S A L E S , M A R K E T I N G , A N D C U STO M E R S U CC E S S · 1 5 5
with the buyer’s timeline and intertwine the forces at play and
motivations moving the buyers along the timeline.
FIRST THOUGHT
First thought is about admitting there’s a problem. “I’m not
sleeping well.”
How do you cause a first thought? Everything starts with
understanding the customer’s perspective. What are the strug-
gling moments people have? Where do they have them? With
first thought, you create questions in the buyer’s mind. The
questions create space in the brain for solutions to fall into. It’s
mostly about push. You want the buyer to question what they
are doing and realize it’s not working. The goal is to help people
understand there could be a better way. Successfully creating a
first thought means now they can see things they could not see
before; they were blind but now they see. It’s about opening the
buyer’s brain, so they are looking for a solution. Let’s look at
our three case studies. Where did they have their first thought?
Case Study #1: Banking
Chad’s business was changing. He needed to restructure his
existing debt and think about getting more money to scale the
business at a different level. It became clear that “Bank A” did
not understand his business; they were checking off boxes in
a cookie-cutter formula.
1 5 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
The Question: Chad realized there was a problem, “Maybe I
need a new bank?”
Case Study #2: Healthcare
Jen’s willing to muscle her way through her illness but question-
ing colleagues make her feel self-conscious. People keep asking
her, “Have you seen a doctor yet?” Some people are genuinely
worried about her while others are worried about themselves.
Let’s be honest, no one likes to sit next to a sick coworker.
The Question: Jen’s coworkers create pressure for her to solve
her illness, “Maybe I should go to the doctor?”
Case Study #3: Consumer Electronics
Rachel had work arounds for the glitchy computer. Although
she said there were issues for roughly a year, these problems
were not enough that they triggered her first thought. Rachel’s
true first thought happened about six weeks before she pur-
chased the new computer when her husband suggested she
needed a new one. He injected the idea into her head, despite
Rachel’s defense that she did not need one.
The Question: Rachel’s husband injects the thought, “Maybe
I need a new computer?”

PASSIVE LOOKING
Passive looking is realizing you need to do something about
the problem. “I need to find a way to sleep better.”
There’s very little transition between first thought and passive
looking. The person is continually thinking about their prob-
lem and the question, “Maybe I can do better?” Here, you want
buyers to repeatedly see your product or services popping up
in their daily life, especially in places where they’re struggling
the most. They are exploring the possible solutions to their
problem. You help them connect the dots between the ques-
tion in their brain—first thought—and your solution. Now
they can’t stop seeing your product or service as a solution. By
showing up at the right place and time, you grow their social
and emotional energy around the problem. They start to think,
“I need to do something,” which transitions them to active look-
ing. This is where the forces start to play a role. Let’s look at
our three buyers in passive looking. What did that stage look
like for each buyer?
Case Study #1: Banking
Chad considers the small problems in the frame of his growing
business plans. He tries to teach “Bank A” his business and they
have the same conversation over and over again. Customer
service is terrible, even though the business is local they will
not come and sit down for a face-to-face conversation to learn
the business. He raises his concerns to the bank leadership to
1 5 8 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
no avail. Because he’s had a first thought, Chad is continually
thinking about how life would improve with a new bank.
The force—push: Chad needs to grow his business. His cur-
rent bank does not understand the business and shows no
interest in learning it. He needs a loan that meets his unique
business needs.
The force—habit: None! “Bank A” changed relationship man-
gers three times without any face-to-face meetings. The new
relationship manager shows no understanding of Chad’s busi-
ness and little interest in learning the business. The relationship
had blown up.
Functional motivation: Functionally, the process with “Bank
A” is arduous and shows little progress or improvement for a
minimal change. They are wasting Chad’s time with the exact
same conversation over and over again. Chad feels like he is
spinning his wheels.
Emotional motivation: Chad holds his cards close, not telling
“Bank A” about the upcoming business growth plans. The rela-
tionship with this bank has become so frayed that he believes
providing the full picture will make things harder. They send
Chad clear signals that his business is not a priority, specifically
that they are unwilling to learn the business or meet face-to-
face. Overall, Chad feels like they do not have his best interests
at heart. There’s been a complete erosion of trust.

Social motivation: Chad does not want to seem like a “jerk,” so
he does not even tell “Bank A” that he is looking for another bank.
Triggering event: After the third phone call, Chad is done
dealing with “Bank A.” He is unwilling to keep spinning his
wheels. He decides it’s time to move on and begins discussing
a plan with his new VP. Chad is now in active looking.
Case Study #2: Healthcare
While Jen does not go to the doctor when her coworkers ini-
tially comment, she is self-conscious about her illness now. It
also starts to slow her down and by Friday she feels behind
on work. Also, on Friday her husband suggests she go to the
doctor. Jen’s now sorting through her medicine cabinet for
over-the-counter remedies, drinking fluids, and getting plenty
of rest. She passively looks all the way from Friday until Sunday.
Passive looking is going through life, knowing there’s a prob-
lem, and not thinking it’s big enough to react yet.
The force—push: Jen does not want to go into another week
at work sick. She is embarrassed by the repeated attention
the illness is bringing her, and she is falling behind at her job
because the illness is slowing her down.
The force—habit: She knows the urgent care option will work,
but it’s time consuming, and she’d have to get dressed and
ready to go.
1 6 0 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
Functional motivation: After being sick on Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday, Jen feels behind at work and wants to
get back to being more productive.
Emotional and social motivation: The emotional and social
are tied together here. Jen feels self-conscious about coughing
all day long. She does not want to stand out in this negative way.
Triggering event: Jen wakes up Sunday morning still feeling
crummy. She knows that she has a long week of work ahead and
decides that she should see a doctor. Jen is now in active looking.
Case Study #3: Consumer Electronics
Since her husband injected the idea of the new computer into
her head, Rachel is more aware of every problem and glitch.
When something goes wrong, she thinks about a new com-
puter and the headaches it would solve. She’s more aware of the
pain. Suddenly Rachel’s daughter is admitted to the hospital
and then the computer won’t even boot up.
The force—push: Rachel’s under tremendous pressure and
anxiety because her time is limited, and the old computer
won’t even boot when she needs to work.
The force—habit: Rachel has owned the Mac for six-years,
it contains her files and she already has work arounds for the
glitches.

Functional motivation: Rachel has deadlines to meet at work,
and her time is now limited because she has the added care
of her daughter.
Emotional motivation: Rachel is under tremendous emo-
tional stress with her daughter in the hospital combined with
looming work deadlines. How will she meet everyone’s needs,
while the computer is failing?
Social motivation: Rachel’s clients are counting on her, as
well as her employer.
Triggering event: The current computer won’t even boot
when she needs it to. This event pushes Rachel from passive
to active looking. Rachel texts her husband and says she needs
a new computer.
ACTIVE LOOKING
Active looking is asking yourself, “What are the alternatives
for progress?”
This is where sellers can inject their possible solution to the
person’s problem. The mattress seller wants to introduce
their mattresses at this point in the buyer’s life, as a solution
to a better night’s sleep. If you’re buying a mattress you’re
thinking, “It needs to keep me cool at night.” “It must be
soft.” “Do I want foam or spring?” “How much can I afford?”
1 6 2 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
These are all independent issues. Ultimately, this is where
people build their ideal solution—a target. It’s important
that the buyer has contrast; without contrast it becomes
almost impossible to decide. The forces at play, pushes and
pulls, continue to weigh on the person as they look for an
ideal solution.
Case Study #1: Banking
Chad realizes he needs to actively look for another bank. He
sends his VP of finance to line up meetings. They meet with
four banks over a two-week time period. He gathers the differ-
ent options for moving forward but he still does not tell “Bank
A” that he is switching banks.
The forces—magnetism of the new solution: Two banks
sit down and try to learn about Chad’s business; they did
not come with a preplanned presentation or a cookie-cutter
formula.
The forces—anxiety of the new solution: Future growth
plans put Chad in a time crunch. He knows that if he wants
to switch banks, he must do so quickly.
Triggering event—the “time wall”: There’s the time pres-
sure of the future acquisition pushing Chad to act quickly. He
knows that if he is going to switch banks he must decide soon
because he will need to repackage the entire deal.

Case Study #2: Healthcare
Jen realizes she needs to actively look for a doctor on Sunday.
She considers virtual care versus urgent care because it’s
Sunday and her general doctor’s not open. Jen wants to feel
better, but it’s not the real driving factor that pushes her to
actively look. It’s the fact that Jen knows she must go back
to work the next day and everybody will question her again.
Secondarily, Jen is falling behind at work. Jen never talks about
feeling better as a major contributing factor.
The forces—magnetism of the new solution: Virtual care
seems quick and easy on the surface. She can do it from the
comfort of her couch and never even get out of her bathrobe.
The forces—anxiety of the new solution: The anxiety forces
are high: “Can I work the technology?” “Can they offer an
accurate diagnosis over video? “They don’t have my medical
records.” Figuring this out for the first time while being sick
is not ideal.
Triggering event—the “time wall”: Jen wants to be able to
return to work on Monday with a solution to tell everyone so
they will back off. It’s Sunday morning, the time pressure for
a solution is high.
Case Study #3: Consumer Electronics
The moment the Mac fails to boot that day in the hospital,
1 6 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
Rachel realizes she must actively look. The event pushes her to
act quickly. People are counting on her, and her time is limited
because of her daughter’s care. She tells her husband what she
needs from a computer and insists it not be a Mac.
The force—magnetism of the new solution: There’s a huge
pull toward the new solution now. Rachel needs relief! The
additional promise of being able to solve the smaller problems
related to her Mac also create pull.
The force—anxiety of the new solution: Without the tech
support her husband represents, the new solution would have
high anxiety. Rachel says if she had to walk into Best Buy and
figure this out in the middle of this personal crisis, she could
not do it.
Triggering event—the “time wall”: Rachel is under tight
deadlines for work with limited bandwidth.
DECIDING
The outcome of active looking is that the buyer knows what
they want. A “time wall” has pushed them into deciding. It’s a
trigger mechanism that forces them to choose, rather than end-
lessly look. Think of an hourglass, it needs to be running out
of time. Without a time wall most people will not make a pur-
chase. Now you know why mattress stores run specials every
holiday. It forces people to buy. Some of these sales create false
M A P P I N G D E M A N D - S I D E B U Y I N G TO S U P P LY- S I D E S A L E S , M A R K E T I N G , A N D C U STO M E R S U CC E S S · 1 6 5
time walls because there’s almost a constant sale which makes
it meaningless. When deciding, people must make tradeoffs:
What’s most important? What’s least important? This is where
priorities are set, and value codes determined. It’s a triangle
between time, cost, and quality. No one can have it all! People
set their expectations here and will base their satisfaction on
the criteria they set. This is where buyers factor in bigger dis-
counts. Interestingly, the discount is more emotional and social
than financial; people want to feel good about themselves.
Case Study #1: Banking
Chad’s now deciding between two banks. He started with four,
but two banks arrive with preplanned presentations; immedi-
ately they are out of the running. The new banks attract Chad
by listening and trying to understand Chad’s business, meeting
his unique needs; there’s no cookie-cutter plan.
Tradeoffs: Chad decides he cares most about trust and flex-
ibility over cost. Chad trusts the new bank because they are
willing to be upfront and honest and tell him no directly rather
than giving a vague maybe about what they can and can’t do.
Additionally, one of the contacts is a known colleague. They
also provide Chad with options; they don’t try to define value
for Chad. Ultimately, Chad chooses flexibility over cost. It’s a
great example of tradeoffs. No one else gave him a more expen-
sive option to buy ease of use. Why not? Probably because
1 6 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
they didn’t think he would take it. You do not know what your
customer wants, provide contrast.
Case Study #2: Healthcare
Jen’s now deciding between urgent care and virtual care. Sitting
in her bathrobe on a Sunday morning, Jen contemplates her
options: getting dressed and driving to the known urgent care
or staying home and navigating the new technology.
Tradeoffs: Jen decides to figure out virtual care, because it’s
eight in the morning and she’s not dressed yet. She figures that
if it fails, she can always still go to urgent care.
Case Study #3: Consumer Electronics
Rachel’s now deciding by setting the criteria a new computer
needs to have to meet her needs. Some might think that her
husband, Eric, is the one deciding, but Eric is merely acting
as an advisor. It’s the criteria Rachel sets forth that drive the
decisions.
Tradeoffs: She insists her computer not be a Mac. She wants
a good battery life and ease of use with video conferencing.
Ultimately, Rachel’s criteria are simple.

ONBOARDING
Acquiring a customer is about being able to onboard them and
deliver in a way that matches the expectations set. You want the
customer to not only feel satisfied but excited and delighted
about aspects they didn’t know they’d wanted or get. Deliv-
ering here is about understanding the customer upfront. The
customer satisfaction should drive engineering changes. If you
are not meeting expectations, what things can you improve?
Most people stop selling once someone’s made a purchase. But
progress is about making sure you deliver on the expectations
that were set. What expectations did the customer hear and
did you really deliver? Nine times out of ten, dissatisfaction
comes from a breakdown in communication. What are the
social, emotional, and functional cues that let people under-
stand they’re satisfied or dissatisfied? The devil is always in the
details; little things add up. Satisfaction, it’s a bitch to accom-
plish. Apple spends an enormous amount of time on these
details—and even they were unable to satisfy Rachel. Very
few other companies spend any time on these details.
Case Study #1: Banking
Chad will base his satisfaction largely on a comparison with the
old bank. If the new bank continues to treat him as a priority
and understand his business, Chad will be happy.

Case Study #2: Healthcare
Jen hires virtual care. She logs onto the site and successfully
completes the virtual care visit. It’s easy to use and Jen never
needs to leave her couch or her bathrobe. Her husband quickly
picks the medication up from the pharmacy and Jen is on the
path to recovery. Jen is a very satisfied customer, and likely a
repeat customer, the virtual platform exceeded her expecta-
tions by being fast and easy to use.
Case Study #3: Consumer Electronics
Rachel purchases a new computer. Rachel’s husband delivers
the computer and helps transfer data, walking through differ-
ences. Rachel will be easy to satisfy because her comparison
will be the old computer with its outdated problems.
ONGOING USE
How do you build a habit? That’s the goal in ongoing use, turn-
ing the first use experience in onboarding into something that
becomes a habit. You need to make it easy for consumers to
use it once they’ve made this progress. Take consumer elec-
tronics for instance. Every update your Mac offers is about
making the computer easier for you to use. Yet most people
think of it as fixing bugs that you’ve had. So, ongoing use is
about understanding different struggling moments and making
the product or service better. It’s about exceeding customer’s
M A P P I N G D E M A N D - S I D E B U Y I N G TO S U P P LY- S I D E S A L E S , M A R K E T I N G , A N D C U STO M E R S U CC E S S · 1 69
expectations and addressing any struggling moments that
would cause people to fire you.
Case Study #1: Banking
As Chad grows the business, he needs his bank help him
manage struggling moments. It’s about a continued partner-
ship: How is the bank going to help them when they have
a cash crunch? How will it help them when they go public?
What are the new future struggles of the business, and how
does the bank help them overcome those struggles? What
are the areas where the bank can help Chad make progress?
Chad switched for one reason but he’s going to stay for a whole
bunch of other reasons. The bank needs to know what they
are. And, it’s not about pushing services Chad doesn’t need,
it’s about understanding where the struggling moments are so
the bank can offer the best services to increase their footprint
inside the company.
Case Study #2: Healthcare
What other things can Jen use the virtual visit for? How does
the virtual platform go from being the doctor, to the health
advocate? What are those new struggling moments the con-
sumer has, and can they use the virtual platform for it, like
scheduling or for pre-visit conversations? We used the plat-
form for scheduling future visits and created an area where
consumers could log ongoing aliments for discussion in future
1 70 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
appointments. This helped their healthcare provider be more
prepared and manage their time better. Now the consumer can
use the platform when they are healthy as well.
Case Study #3: Consumer Electronics
What else is Rachel going to be using her computer for over
time? She bought it with the intent of using it for work but now
she’s noticing other features, such as the camera. What are the
new struggling moments? For instance, as systems update does
the computer get slower? How does the computer company
make sure that the computer does not degrade in performance
over time? And, are there things that Rachel could be using
the computer for that she hasn’t even thought of?

T H E KA N O M O D E L
Japanese professor Dr. Noriaki Kano developed a cus-
tomer satisfaction model for creating profitable products
in the 1980s, which we use today in our demand-side
sales approach. It’s the idea that customer satisfaction is
about more than the functionality of a product or service,
it’s also about customers’ emotions. Kano breaks prod-
uct attributes into three categories or needs: threshold
attributes (basic), performance attributes (satisfiers), and
excitement attributes (delighters). We need to talk about
these things in space and time, because over time what
qualifies in each category changes.
Threshold attributes are the basic features we assume a
product or service contain, so we don’t ask for them. In
2020, nobody buys a phone for the texting, internet, and
camera. Those are all basic attributes that are assumed
now but were not assumed in 2005—space and time
matter.
Performance attributes are standard expectations. The
more performance attributes a product or service has the
more satisfied the customer. The fewer it has the more
dissatisfied. If you do it, great; if you don’t do it, horrible.
For instance, how do websites look on my phone versus
my laptop? Can I use my phone to buy and pay for items?
Is it easy to share photos and documents?
Excitement attributes are unexpected things that delight
the customer. When you don’t do it, they don’t notice or
care, but when you do it, they are delighted. Right now,
Facetime and features of video conferencing are exciting
features as more people and businesses use them to stay
connected in a personal way. Excitement features come
into play when people have struggling moments that
you are not responsible for and you can surprise them
with a solution.

MEETING THE BUYER IN THE RIGHT TIME AND
PLACE
Think of each of the six phases in the sales process as a system,
like a “black box” problem in math, with inputs, outputs, and
outcomes. As a salesperson, your job is to meet the buyer in
each of the six stages—first thought, passive looking, active
looking, deciding, and ownership—with an input. Your goal
is to create an input for each of the six stages of buying, that
triggers a desired output, which ultimately leads to an ideal
outcome for the customer. As we start to unravel a new sales
approach to meet Chad, Jen, and Rachel’s needs, focus on the
critical elements:
1. 2. 3. 4. Find the struggling moments and understand how to solve
them. People don’t think about hiring and firing a product
or service until they have a struggling moment. What are
your customer’s struggling moments? They’re not what
you think they are.
Think progress! What’s the progress your customer is
trying to make? Now, enable them to do THAT. It’s the
progress that matters, not your features and benefits.
Identify the tradeoffs. Don’t talk features, benefits, and cost,
because people are willing to make tradeoffs. What makes
your product or service kick ass? Where do you say no?
Basically, choose what to suck at. As Jason Fried, entre-
preneur, CEO and co-founder of Basecamp says, “You’re
better off with a kick-ass half than a half-assed whole.”
Understand that unfulfilled “little hires” cause “big hires.”

What does that mean? The struggling moment starts in
the “little hires” and if someone struggles too much they’ll
accumulate to a “big hire.” Focus on the “little hires.”
MAKING IT REAL
• On the demand-side, think about the best experience you
had buying something in the last year. Why was it a great
sales experience? What did they know about you that was
important, that made it valuable?
• On the supply-side, think about a time when you struggled
to sell your product or service. Now use the forces, motiva-
tions, and timeline to understand where you went wrong.
Next, let’s connect the dots and design a plan to approach each
of these buyers to help them make progress.

CONNECTING THE
DOTS BETWEEN SALES,
MARKETING, AND
CUSTOMER SUPPORT
Sales, marketing, and customer support must learn to play
together! Most organizations treat them as three separate enti-
ties but they’re not. And treating them as such makes sales
unnecessarily hard. First thought, passive looking, and active
looking are a combination of marketing and sales. Deciding,
onboarding, and ongoing use are a combination of customer
support and sales. Sales covers the entire process! But because
the three departments don’t talk, customers get mixed mes-
sages. They are bombarded with value propositions and online
tactics that try to push people to decide when they are in active
CO N N E C T I N G T H E D OT S B E T W E E N S A L E S , M A R K E T I N G , A N D C U STO M E R S U P P O R T · 1 75
looking. It’s making the consumer frustrated and anxious,
while putting salespeople at an immediate disadvantage.

B E T W E E N
Marketers are the people building the brochures and
advertising the product to help salespeople sell. They
tend to be features driven—creating add-ons to reach
the widest audience. They work at a very high, abstract,
macro level. They have an ideal or imagined customer,
created through the triangulation of data, such as: cus-
tomer age, zip code, income level, etc. If you think about
it, age and income level are not the real reason some-
one buys a car, but that’s how marketing works—data
correlation.
Sales is more complicated because it’s micro-level. In
sales you deal directly with the real customer. Great sales-
people deal in causation not correlation. There’s nothing
imagined about their customer. What causes me to buy a
car? Typically, salespeople are the highest compensated
in the company. A great salesperson knows the market-
ing piece of the business, but also knows how to talk to
people about the product, who to target, and under-
stands why that person is driven to buy. They also ensure
product delivery and must understand and manage the
cashflow side of the business. Oftentimes, founders make
the best salespeople because they understand the entire
business inside and out.
While it sounds like sales and marketing are talking about
the same thing, they’re different ends of the spectrum.
Macro verses micro; ideal customer versus real customer.

Let’s break down the three case studies by looking at the sales
process as two parts instead of three.

2. Sales and customer support
HOW TO STOP GETTING FIRED AND START
GETTING HIRED
Banks are people who sell money. How hard is it to sell money?
It’s not! Diligence is the only thing separating successful bank-
ers from everybody else. Most bankers spend their time trying
to assess risks and fail to understand how many people want a
loan but don’t apply because the process is too arduous. The
market is huge, but they’ve made it so difficult that they’re
not realizing the results. Chad’s experience is happening right
now, today! Yet, people selling these services don’t even realize
it. Did Chad want to look for a new bank? No! Who wants to
switch banks?
Chad’s story is a particularly interesting case study because we
can analyze it from two perspectives: the bank that got fired,
and the bank that got hired.
Sales and Marketing
Let’s start from the first thought, and from a sales and market-
CO N N E C T I N G T H E D OT S B E T W E E N S A L E S , M A R K E T I N G , A N D C U STO M E R S U P P O R T · 1 7 7
ing perspective. Imagine you are the competing bank. How
would you attract Chad? How would you package something
with the right message, features, and advertising to pull him in?
Remember that the push of the situation and the magnetism
of the new solution need to be stronger than the anxieties and
habit before someone will buy. Many people think all banks
are the same. So if you think this, and your bank sucks, you
don’t say, “Oh boy, I think I need to get a better bank.” You
don’t believe there is a better bank. As a result, you don’t even
know that you’re struggling with your current bank. Part of
marketing and selling is showing customers that something
else exists.
When people have a first thought and begin passively looking,
it’s about being in the right place at the right time. To that end,
if we were bankers trying to attract this type of business, we’d
start with a “Lunch and Learn” to connect businesses together
and build a network. It’s also a great way to get your existing
clients to talk about you to prospective clients. The conver-
sation should not be about loans and terms, it should focus
on the progress people are trying to make: What could you
be doing if you had more money? How would your business
grow if you had access to better capital? Then try to understand
their anxieties: What’s holding you back? How can we help
you mitigate the risk? How can you prepare for the downside?
No one knows where the economy is going, but who’s by your
side to help you figure it out?

When somebody transitions to active looking and asks for a
quote say, “I need thirty minutes to an hour of your time to
understand your business before I can give you a quote.” In
that meeting set the expectations, “I’ll come back with three
alternatives that will help you frame your situation better. From
there we will morph a fourth option by merging the best of
three. If at any point you reach out and I am not available, I
will contact you within twenty-four hours.” Then set the tone,
“I’m a straight shooter. If it’s a no, I’ll tell you no; if it’s a yes,
I’ll tell you yes.” By setting the expectations up front, you’re
already ahead of the competition.
Let’s contrast this to what most banks do: “Let me tell you
about who we are…” then they name drop their clients and
offer a wide menu of options. You’re not a banker, it’s confusing.
They don’t understand your business or know you. And you
don’t care who they represent.
But when you sell from the demand-side and understand
their progress and struggles first, you’re ahead of the game.
You take the time to learn the business. You educate them on
their options, specific to their needs only. At this point, you’ve
built trust; now you realize that trust is caused. You’ve changed
the way you sell loans.

When the diamond industry came up with the notion of
cut, clarity, and color to help people shop for diamonds,
jewelers were completely against it. They felt it would ruin
their relationship with customers and undermine what
they did. The opposite happened. It educated consumers
because now they could make tradeoffs. They could buy
a bigger diamond at a lower price, by sacrificing color
or clarity and vice versa. Diamond sales grew almost ten
times as a direct result, and jewelers who were willing to
educate customers got ninety percent of the sales. It was
ultimately about trust!
Sales and Customer Support
Now think about the old bank, “Bank A,” that got fired: What
could they have done differently? What would you have
changed about the situation? What messaging and interactions,
could have stopped this from happening?
It all starts with customer support. Most sales models think of
new business as harder to get than renewals, therefore, they put
their lower-level people on renewals. But renewals are just as
hard, sometimes riskier, than new business because you’ve got
history to overcome or reshape. The “big hire” on the timeline
is the beginning, not the end. “Bank A” failed to recognize
this and took the customer for granted; as a result there’s zero
force of habit in the relationship. What changes should “Bank
A” make to retain their customers?
1 8 0 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
First, “Bank A” needs an onboarding process that enables their
sales representatives to help the customer. A simple change in
the way they handoff accounts from one relationship manager
to another would have made a big difference here. The first
meeting should be face-to-face, to learn about their business.
They should teach their people to be curious about their cus-
tomer’s business.
Second, they should establish regular, meaningful wellness
visits with their customers where they ask pointed questions
and offer real assistance: Where is the business going next
year? What big projects do you have? Now, they should come
back with ways to help them save money or have access to
something new: Can they connect the customer to a helpful
resource? Can they offer a new loan that would provide sav-
ings? “Bank A” needs to find ways to stay engaged with their
customers. If they do this, renewals will become easy.
Finally, “Bank A” needs to listen and be honest. If you hear trust
decay repeatedly, it’s a vulnerability. They built trust initially;
they got the deal. But then they made changes and eroded the
trust. They need to do a trust check, and let’s be clear, custom-
ers will lie to you if you simply ask, “Do you trust us today?”
That’s a terrible question, dig deeper. The policy should always
be to answer questions in an upfront and honest way, never
string people along. If the answer’s no, say no. Most salespeo-
ple try to never say no, but that’s a bad approach. They should
assemble their house of cards on trust.

Remember, the most vulnerable people in your portfolio are
your current clients because you’ve learned to ignore them.
UNDERSTANDING HOW PEOPLE CHOOSE A
HEALTHCARE PROVIDER
We were hired in this instance by a healthcare company that
was starting to build urgent cares, but also had a virtual care
platform and general practices. They initially wanted to know
what causes people in non-emergency situations to choose
urgent care. So, we set out to interview people about their
choices over the last few months. What circumstances led
them to choose urgent care, virtual care, or their general
doctor? Think of it this way, we have email, texts, and phone
calls. When do you use each? How do you decide to pick up
the phone and call somebody versus texting them? We have
all these codes in our head that tell us when to do each and
everyone’s codes are different. We want to learn people’s codes
for choosing a to engage in healthcare and how they decided
on the provider. What made this the right choice at this time?
We’re trying to frame the situations people are in when they
are trying to make progress, so we can help them.
Sales and Marketing
Jen was one of dozens of patients interviewed about her health
care choices. Immediately, it became clear that the anxiety
factor for all our interviewees was high. Remember, value is
1 8 2 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
created and money is made by solving the anxiety side of the
equation. And Jen’s interview, along with many others, netted
us great feedback for the virtual side of the business. In hind-
sight it’s obvious, nobody wants to learn new technology while
sick, but it was an a-ha moment. At the time, around 2015,
people were not doing Zoom and other virtual conferencing
nearly as much—a foreign concept. Why in the world are we
asking patients to learn new technology when they feel their
worst? Ridiculous!
After this insight we asked ourselves: how do we introduce
them to the virtual visits sooner? Because this client owned
the virtual care platform, as well as urgent care and general
practices, we decided to leverage the entire system. They began
by introducing the virtual platform at wellness visits, which
acted as a first thought trigger. As patients were leaving, they
helped them navigate the platform by asking them to set up
next year’s appointment on it with help. Patients could push
a button and a physician assistant would appear. As patients
concluded the scheduling call, the medical provider reminded
them they could do this anytime they needed medical help.
Additionally, every time someone called for an appointment,
providers encouraged them to schedule through the virtual
visit platform. The patient learned to make the technology
work while they were well. It quadrupled the virtual visits.
Now that patients knew how to use the virtual platform, the
medical provider targeted patients with billboard ads explain-
CO N N E C T I N G T H E D OT S B E T W E E N S A L E S , M A R K E T I N G , A N D C U STO M E R S U P P O R T · 1 8 3
ing when patients could use virtual care. The original ads
simply explained that virtual visits were available 24/7. The
new ads targeted people in that moment where they were pas-
sively looking: “Feeling sick? Don’t put your plans on hold, stay
productive.” People knew how to use the platform now and
realized they only needed a fifteen-minute window between
meetings, instead of getting in their car, driving to the doctor,
waiting, etc. The provider also ran billboard ads that explained
when you could use virtual care, such as when you’re sick, fight-
ing allergies, and so on, because our interviews revealed people
were unsure. Context creates value!
Sales and Customer Support
From these interviews the medical provider found there were
three different contexts which led someone to potentially
choose urgent care. First, the patient felt sick, but their overall
medical history was complicated: diabetes, heart condition, or
another chronic illness. They were afraid to go to the urgent
care, because they didn’t have their medical records. This anx-
iety caused them to delay care out of fear that they’d forget
to explain critical aspects of their health to the new provider.
Second were patients who felt sick; however, they knew what
was wrong because they’d had it before—a sinus infection or
a urinary tract infection. They wanted quick, no nonsense care.
Third, something’s wrong, but it’s not major. They cannot self-
diagnose, and they want answers. This patient is mostly seeking
quick reassurance.
1 8 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
The medical provider revamped their process to help these
people as well. First, they began sending emails to patients
and their regular care doctors right after appointments. This
gave patients the confidence that nothing would be missed.
The provider found that the force of habit was not very high,
most people did not like their doctor. So, if they could ease
the patient’s anxiety about a lack of connection to their med-
ical records, they’d hire us. Second, the provider created an
incoming form to help triage patients. They asked them five
questions: Have you had this before? Do you know what it is?
Do you have any other complications? And do you have your
medical records within our system?
Originally, each patient was supposed to spend eighteen min-
utes with a doctor. This form got most people down to five
minutes, while increasing satisfaction from 28 percent to 78
percent. Patients who came into urgent care after we imple-
mented the changes had a propensity to come back four times
as often as they did prior to the new system. We effectively
changed the way we onboarded new patients by optimizing
the entire system around solving their anxieties and meeting
their personal progress. Instead of just marketing to them more,
we were able to set expectations better and get people to use
urgent care more often.
By focusing on urgent care during the interview, we found
other areas to improve business, such as the medical provider’s
virtual platform. As you can see, we did not steer Jen’s interview
CO N N E C T I N G T H E D OT S B E T W E E N S A L E S , M A R K E T I N G , A N D C U STO M E R S U P P O R T · 1 8 5
to focus on urgent care despite that being the client’s focus.
By understanding Jen and other patients’ not choosing their
service, we learned valuable information.
HOW TO SYNCH SELLING COMPUTERS TO THE
WAY PEOPLE BUY
The way Rachel bought a computer is not in sync with the way
computer companies sell them. Computer companies don’t
think about the way people buy. Instead they market by screen
size, processing speed, and RAM. They never talk about how
to solve a customer’s struggling moment. Selling computers is
not about selling computers; it’s about helping people make
progress with fitting a computer into their lives. Rachel wanted
simple assurances: Will it power up? Will it interface with var-
ious formats? Will the video conferencing be seamless? Will it
have all the latest programs for a professional writer? But she
needed a translator to get those answers—most people do.
Sales and Marketing
Triggering a first thought is about helping people recognize
that a problem already exists. Computer companies should be
talking about your current computer’s problems: What both-
ers you the most? What are you frustrated about? If you had
a new computer, what would be better? Computer marketing
should be saying, “Life can be better! Imagine if you didn’t
have to deal with these problems.” Remember, people are not
1 8 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
paying attention until they see the problem in their own lives.
Computer companies should be highlighting your struggle to
be even greater than you perceive it. And this push force should
become bigger as people move into passive looking.
Based on Rachel’s context, we need to figure out where people
are pressed for time and market there: hospitals, kid’s sporting
events, stadiums, etc. Anyplace where you’re waiting, trying
to work, and lack access to a plug. Remember, Rachel had
computer problems for months before she acted. She needed
an event to push her from passive looking to active looking. In
June she was not ready to buy a computer because there was
no pressure. She had more time and access to a plug. But it’s
that moment of pressure, when it’s logistically challenging to
buy, that she was the most receptive. Rachel was tolerant for
nine months, she had a functional problem, but emotionally
she couldn’t do it yet.
To get people from passive to active looking you need an
event, natural or artificial. This event needs to make buyers,
like Rachel, painfully aware of how much they are doing to
compensate for their computer’s deficits. As a salesperson, you
might watch Rachel navigate her computer and ask questions:
Why do you do this? Why did you do that? How many times
has your computer stopped working? The questions alone will
trigger the thought, “Yeah, why am I doing all this?” Several
months before Rachel purchased her computer, she could have
been nudged to active looking with the right questions: what
CO N N E C T I N G T H E D OT S B E T W E E N S A L E S , M A R K E T I N G , A N D C U STO M E R S U P P O R T · 1 87
are you going to do if it doesn’t boot back up? By putting the
doubt in her mind, it creates the space for her to think, “I’ve
got to create a plan. I don’t want to be caught off guard.”
Now Rachel’s in active looking. When people are in active
looking, they think of every possibility. But the options are not
connected to each other, they are separate and independent.
They are deciding between a bigger screen versus’ a smaller
screen, but they don’t understand the difference between the
two beyond size. Is the bigger screen heavier? Does it affect
battery life? They don’t understand the tradeoffs. It’s just about
features and possibilities. Active looking is accumulating facts,
but they don’t have enough information to decide.
There’s a big disconnect between Rachel’s requirements and
computer companies. For instance, Rachel needed a reason-
ably better battery life. Now engineers are arguing if it’s four
hours, six hours, or eight. They get so myopic on the little
things that they fail to understand the struggle. Rachel just
wants a computer that turns on and lasts through a two-hour
video conference call when she does not have access to a power
outlet. Her expectations are very low.
Rachel’s criteria was more about getting the replacement fast
than perfection. Emotionally, she’s extremely stressed, she’s got
no time, she needs a good enough replacement and needs it
in under twenty-four hours. The criteria she gave her husband
had nothing to do with the biggest screen or any of the other
1 8 8 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
features that computer companies advertise on. She bought
it to be up and running in twenty-four hours. She was willing
to make tradeoffs to get it up and running quickly. She didn’t
want to wait two weeks for the best computer, she wanted
good enough tomorrow.
Sales and Customer Support
The key is to help consumers make tradeoffs. Rachel’s husband
made the tradeoffs for her. People will pay an additional 10 per-
cent of the value of the computer for the service that Rachel’s
husband offered. For someone to just tell them what they need
and to produce it with a money back guarantee. Most people
would rather pay someone to be accountable, because then if
there’s a problem they can take it back easily. You can’t buy a
computer this way; nobody sells them this way!
Computer companies need to talk to Rachel the way her hus-
band does, understand her problem, and help her solve it by
introducing solutions in a language that makes sense. Skip the
features and benefits, ask her the problem she is trying to solve,
and deliver a computer in twenty-four hours that solves that
problem. Then spend thirty minutes walking her through any
questions. As a salesperson, you need to help get Rachel the
best computer to solve her problem, and the best computer for
Rachel is not the best computer for everybody. The customer
should define the way a product is being sold, rather than the
company dictating the way a customer buys, but that’s often
CO N N E C T I N G T H E D OT S B E T W E E N S A L E S , M A R K E T I N G , A N D C U STO M E R S U P P O R T · 1 89
not the case. They need to understand how the customer wants
to buy.
While Rachel seems to be in a unique time and place this space
in time repeats itself a thousand times a day, every day, some-
where else in the world. Maybe the struggle is not specifically
the same, but it boils down to the same place.
MAKING IT REAL
• On the demand-side, think about the last time you had a
bad sales experience. Why was it so bad?
• On the supply-side, think about the last three sales you
made. Why did they work or not work?
Sales no longer feels icky, because it’s about helping people
make progress on their terms. Sales is now progress.

MOVING FROM PUSHING
PRODUCTS TO CREATING
PULL FOR PROGRESS
Why do people buy a Snickers? Why do people buy a Milky
Way? Traditional supply-side thinking says that Snickers and
Milky Way compete for the same customers. After all, they
sit side-by-side in the candy aisle and are made with similar
ingredients.
But what motivates someone to buy a Snickers instead of a
Milky Way? It turns out that people buy a Snickers because they
are running out of energy; they need a boost. Their stomach is
growling, and Snickers feels like food—the nougat, caramel,
and peanuts form a ball, it’s hard. Snickers does not compete
with Milky Way at all. It competes with a sandwich, Red Bull,
M OV I N G F R O M P U S H I N G P R O D U C T S TO C R E AT I N G P U L L F O R P R O G R E S S · 1 9 1
and a cup of coffee. Whereas, Milky Way slides down your
throat, coating your mouth with chocolate and endorphins.
It’s a candy bar. People usually eat it alone, after an emotional
event, good or bad, and it helps them feel better or acts as a
reward. Milky Way competes with ice cream, brownies, and
a glass of wine.
Understanding this dynamic was a game changer for Snickers.
They flipped the lens on sales and launched a commercial that
spoke to people in this specific moment in time. The adver-
tisement opened on a field with a group of young men playing
football with Betty White. Betty’s struggling, everyone’s yelling
at her. Then someone hands her a Snickers bar, she takes a bite
and transforms back into himself—another one of the young
men playing football. “You’re not YOU when you’re hungry,”
the narrator says. “Snickers satisfies!”
This ad took Snickers to over $3.5 billion in less than ten
years. And it’s a perfect example of demand-side sales. When
Snickers reframed their product from competing with Milky
Way—supply-side selling—to solving the customer’s strug-
gling moment—demand-side selling—they created pull for
their product by helping people make progress.
Today most sales still operate under a supply-side model.
Industry disruptors like Casper, SNHU, and our personal
experiences with over 3,500 products and services are still
not the norm.

WHAT’S WRONG IN SALES TODAY?
Unfortunately, most salespeople are not taught to think of
themselves as a helper. They are taught to think about their
product, the what, with all its features and benefits, and
the people, the who, as a set of demographics. But they’re
missing the five W’s and two H’s—who, what, when, where,
why, how, and how much. Salespeople have been trained
to only focus on a small portion of the equation. In fact, it
seems many salespeople are operating under the marketing
framework.
The problem goes back the 1985 sale of Nabisco we spoke about
in the introduction. When brand equity became more valuable
than cashflow, marketers took the lead. It’s a fundamental pow-
ershift that’s relegated salespeople to order takers, not helping
to generate demand. Marketers are expected to create demand,
and sales is to follow the leads generated. It’s a flawed approach
that sets salespeople up to fail. Demand is only generated by
a customer’s struggling moment. If there is no struggle, there
is no demand.
Additionally, other disciplines have developed major frame-
works, theories, and tools to help them do what they do. In
marketing they have brand equity, features, benefits, and a
whole set of tools wrapped around how to market. But from
a sales perspective all you get are leads. Salespeople need
frameworks, theories, and tools to help them as well. Sales
and marketing are not one and the same.
M OV I N G F R O M P U S H I N G P R O D U C T S TO C R E AT I N G P U L L F O R P R O G R E S S · 1 93
It’s the lack of resources that’s turned traditional supply-side
sales into an icky business. Salespeople are put under tremen-
dous pressure, everything they do is viewed through the lens of
the product and profit. The focus is on the “church of finance,”
where cashflow is king and budget forecasting is center stage to
keep banks and investors happy. When the “church of finance”
is driving decisions, they’re not made in the customer’s best
interest. As a result, salespeople end up promoting and creating
endless ways in which to push people to buy their product or
service before they’re ready. The reality is the push mentality
does more harm than good—failed expectations and buyer’s
remorse.
It’s easy to negatively judge sales from the outside, but sales
is hard. Great salespeople know a lot. They have what we
call horizontal skills, meaning their knowledge crosses every
department of the company. Salespeople are one of the few
people in the entire organization who know everything. They
are close to the CEO in knowledge but on the frontline. They
are marketers who know the people and know the product
at the same time. We call marketers ‘a salesperson who can’t
close,’ because they don’t have the same in-depth knowledge
that great salespeople must have. They work in features and
benefits, while sales pushes beyond this, helping to reduce
anxieties. Great salespeople deal in causation, not correlation.
They need to understand the real customers, not an imagined,
personified version. It’s that micro level of understanding that
makes sales so tremendously hard.

“ T H E M A N I N T H E R I N G ”
In April 1910, former United States President Theodore
Roosevelt gave one of his most widely quoted speeches
about critics:
“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out
how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better. The credit belongs to the
man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred
by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who
errs, who comes short again and again, because there
is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who
does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great
enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself
in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the
triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he
fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place
shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither
know victory nor defeat.”
It’s easy to judge sales from the outside, to hold a
derogatory view. But, people on the outside don’t truly
understand the pressures on the inside: trying to close
deals, knowing everything and anything. Salespeople are
on the inside of the ring, and it’s a tremendously hard job
with few tools and resources.
REFRAMING SELLING AS SERVING
If you’re struggling to be great at sales, you’re not alone. While
seasoned salespeople already instinctively understand the con-
cepts taught here, they had to muddle their way through the ick
at first too. We wrote this book so you don’t have to struggle
like I did all those years ago selling kitchen countertops. It’s
our hack for becoming a seasoned salesperson without failing
for twenty years first.

Now that you’ve flipped the lens, what does sales look like under
the demand-side paradigm? Not sales! Sales turns into serving
and helping others. You see the world through your custom-
er’s eyes. You’re no longer a salesperson but an advisor, coach,
or helper. The role of the salesperson in a demand-side sales
approach is to assist customers in shaping and framing their
progress. Salespeople are the shepherds that help customers go
down the path of progress. When you approach sales as a guide,
assisting customers, you stop pushing your product by adding
endless features and benefits, and create pull instead by framing
the context, outcomes, and tradeoffs for the customer. People
need someone to help them navigate their way to make progress.
The salesperson’s job is to help customers figure out what the
options are by first understanding what’s important to them.

Let’s review the six stages of buying one more time.
• First Thought: creating space in the brain for solutions to
fall into
• Passive Looking: learning, framing, and prioritizing to
know what to do next
• Active Looking: seeing possibilities, framing trade-offs,
and ruling things both in and out—inclusion and exclusion
• Deciding: connecting the dots into alternatives for prog-
ress, getting buy in from the group, making trade-offs, and
setting expectations to measure of progress
• Onboarding: first use, doing the job, and seeing both the
progress and the metrics of progress achieved
• Ongoing Use: building new habits, identifying new strug-
gling moments, and new feature development
A SNAPSHOT OF DEMAND-SIDE SALES
Let’s look at the six stages of the buying process once more
from the perspective of a car salesperson. As we do, think of
it as a system for making progress. What would someone do
to avoid the cliché of becoming the icky, used car salesperson?
How would they transform the process to become a helper?
First Thought
Start in system one, first thought. The customer becomes aware
of the problem: “My car just went into the shop to get ser-
M OV I N G F R O M P U S H I N G P R O D U C T S TO C R E AT I N G P U L L F O R P R O G R E S S · 1 97
viced; it’s got 110,000 miles on it.” At this moment they wonder,
“Maybe I’m ready for a new car.” This is the first thought. The
buyer is realizing their car is going to need a few fixes. So, what
should the salesperson do to help them think through their
decision? First, they should frame the situation in a way that
helps the customer understand what it will look like if they
keep their old car: “After we’ve done these repairs, here’s the
next adjustments you can expect, and the estimated costs.” Pro-
viding this information creates pushes.
Passive Looking
Now, it’s a great time to offer them a complimentary loaner;
their car’s in the shop after all. So, for two days while the old
car is serviced, they drive around in a brand-new car. Sud-
denly, they realize what life would be like if they upgraded
now. It’s passive looking at its best. They’re not looking for
a car, they’re not asking for a test drive, but while their car is
serviced, they’re learning what’s possible. No one’s pushed
them. Additionally, up until this moment, it’s come through
a trusted advisor, a serviceperson they’ve known, ideally, for
years. With zero push, you’re helping them figure out whether
they need a new car by framing the situation they’re in and
showing them what’s possible.
When they return, the service person should reiterate what’s
next for the old car: “Here’s what your next service interval
looks like, and here’s the things you can expect between now
1 9 8 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
and 150,000 miles.” This creates more push. The buyer is think-
ing, “Do I really want to spend $5,000 more on this car?” Now’s
a good time for the salesperson to step in and follow up: “Well,
if you have any interest, I can get your car appraised. Let you
know how much it’s worth. It could be a good down payment
for a new car.”
Active Looking
The moment they agree to the appraisal, they’re in active
looking. Active looking is about shaping up their options:
“Where do I drive? How far do I go? What kind of car do
I want to have? How long will I keep it? Do I want to buy
something smaller? Do I want to buy the same type of car?”
Think of active looking as going deeper. The buyer is trying
to figure out how this is going to fit into their life. As the
salesperson you should be asking questions to frame out their
definition of value. Then it’s about getting a few products and
comparing.
This is where contrast to create meaning is extremely import-
ant! They might think they want a Ford instead of an Audi, or
maybe they want an SUV instead of a minivan. Your job as a
salesperson is to give them contrasting options so they can
frame out what they value. If they want that SUV, show them
an oversized SUV, a small sized SUV, and the minivan. If they
want the Ford fully loaded show them that it’s about the same
price as the Lincoln loaded. But also show them the Audi, it’s
M OV I N G F R O M P U S H I N G P R O D U C T S TO C R E AT I N G P U L L F O R P R O G R E S S · 1 9 9
only a little bit more expensive and if they buy it slightly used,
it’s in the same price range.
There’s a book called Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, which
speaks to the concept of contrast and options. It’s the notion
that if you give people three choices, the first thing they’ll do
is eliminate one of the three. Then, once they’ve eliminated
one, they will compare the other two to the one they elimi-
nated. Interestingly, they now have two reference points for
what’s in and what’s out. However, when you give somebody
two things, they struggle to decide. And if you give them one
thing, they typically can’t choose. So, in sales when someone
is deciding, it’s important to have enough contrast to create
meanings. Otherwise, they cannot make the tradeoffs they
need to make for progress.
Deciding
After providing them contrasting options, you may find that
they originally had no intention of buying the Audi, but when
they realize the one-year-old Audi is the same price, their
thinking changes. The competitive sets for buyers are very
different than what the people in the car industry think they
are. They don’t imagine the Ford and Audi competing, because
they only think in terms of new versus new. A great salesperson
understands this dynamic and helps frame these tradeoffs.
Now they are in system four, deciding. For the buyer to move
2 0 0 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
from deciding to ownership there needs to be a time wall, a
pressure cooker that forces them to make tradeoffs, like a sale.
It’s the moment of truth, where people make decisions, and
in this moment the context changes or magnifies. It’s very dif-
ferent than active looking. It’s like the trash compactor in Star
Wars, when things get closer, they’re willing to think differently
and give up on certain things. Partly, it’s the time wall. As you
approach the time wall it distorts everything so people can
make tradeoffs.
Onboarding and Ongoing Use
Here is where value, satisfaction, and expectations are locked
in. Here’s where people make a commitment. The key is the
word “commitment” versus “transaction,” because there are
exceptions where people are committed to doing something,
but they are not able to follow through. The moment that
they’ve committed is where all the expectations are locked in.
Whatever they thought was going to happen before is reframed,
and almost poured in concrete, when they commit.
A bad salesperson doesn’t set clear expectations. Setting clear
expectations is all about understanding value from the cus-
tomer’s perspective. What do they value? And when discussing
value, you’ll often find people expect discounts. They think,
“Well, I don’t need that feature, so I should get some money
back.” This is about understanding what the customer values
and only talking in those terms. If they complain about cold
M OV I N G F R O M P U S H I N G P R O D U C T S TO C R E AT I N G P U L L F O R P R O G R E S S · 2 01
seats, talk about that feature, but if they live in a hot climate,
don’t even bring it up. You should not be talking about every
feature and benefit of each car, only the ones applicable to their
specific definition of value.
The moment they commit, buyers adjust their reference point
of what better means. Better doesn’t mean better than every-
thing they’ve looked at. It means better than the old product
they fired—their old car. People think of better in the compet-
itive set, but that’s not right. It’s better than the old reference
point. The concept of better is important, because of the anxiety
forces at play. If they are not addressed, there’s buyer’s remorse.
Buyer’s remorse comes from two things: A buyer didn’t think
through all the criteria. Or, they were not able to see the full
picture until after they bought. When you understand your
buyer, as demand-side sales teaches, you anticipate their prob-
lems and solve them before they even realize they exist.
Demand-side sales is like having night vision goggles. People
think sales is just a numbers game of percentages and proba-
bility. If you bring in enough people, cars will sell. They’re not
taking the time to understand why people buy. They don’t ask
questions: What do you like? What don’t you like? Why are
you buying a new car? They don’t talk about car loans. If they
were paying attention, they’d help. They’d know the customer’s
requirements, show them contrasting options, and frame their
tradeoffs. They’d help them frame it out then use a time wall
to force a decision. When you do this, selling becomes serving.

HELPING PEOPLE MAKE PROGRESS
As we come full circle, we want you to think of the best sales-
person you’ve ever had, whether you were buying a car or
make-up. You probably didn’t think of them as a salesperson at
the time of purchase. “Oh yeah, Joe helped me buy my car. But
Joe’s not really a salesman; he’s like a concierge.” You don’t want
to call Joe a salesperson, because it’s so derogatory. Supply-side
selling caused this dynamic. We hope we’ve changed the way
you view the words sales and selling.
Demand-side sales is about pulling people toward progress.
Flipping this lens flips the role of salesperson from icky used
car salesperson to a helper. When you get away from push-
ing your product, you start to make people feel like you’re
helping them; you’re their concierge. You’re no longer the
used car salesperson. A great salesperson listens first and
then helps.
MAKING IT REAL
• On the demand-side, think about something that you are
considering buying and map out where you are using the
framework. Can you identify some of your own behavior
and map it to the timeline? Now use this information to
help yourself make progress.
• On the supply-side, look at something you trying to sell,
such as convincing your significant other to go on vacation
or buy a new mattress. Now flip your perspective to their
M OV I N G F R O M P U S H I N G P R O D U C T S TO C R E AT I N G P U L L F O R P R O G R E S S · 2 03
world. Where are they on the timeline? What progress are
they trying to make?
Let’s take one last look at the key points outlined throughout
Demand-Side Sales 101.
2 0 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
CONCLUSION
The very foundation of demand-side sales is being helpful,
empowering, curious, and creative; you must understand why
people do what they do. Once you truly master demand-side
sales, it’s like riding a bike. But, also like riding a bike, you
only truly learn it by doing it—practice, practice, practice. Let’s
wrap-up Demand-Side Sales 101 with a summary of the three
main principles for success, the three main myths we are trying
to dispel, and the best ways to get started. We feel like we fed
you with a firehose, so let’s boil it down.
THE THREE PRINCIPLES FOR SUCCESS
• Principle #1: People buy for their own reasons. It’s more
about progress than about your product or service. Your
job as a salesperson is to help people make progress on
their terms; it’s about more than selling and making the
CO N C L U S I O N · 2 0 5
“almighty dollar.” Approaching sales from this mindset will
set you apart as a great salesperson.
• Principle #2: Nothing is random; everything is caused.
Understanding the causal mechanisms of why people do
what they do, down to the action level, is critical. It will
help you see patterns and sell better while helping people
make progress faster.
• Principle#3 The struggle creates demand. The struggling
moment is the seed for all sales. Where do people strug-
gle? Helping people make progress is embedded in finding
these struggling moments. So, find the struggling moment!
THE THREE MYTHS TO DISPEL
• Myth #1: Supply creates demand; build it and they will
buy it. No, the product does not create demand. How-
ever well-meaning your aspirations, they are not enough
to sell your product and cause people to make the neces-
sary tradeoffs. People want to be their definition of best,
not yours. It’s about fitting your product into their life by
understanding the progress they are trying to make.
• Myth #2: Sales are random, the needle in a haystack
mentality. This is the idea that you just need to find people
and they will buy. Sales is not about finding people; it’s
about creating demand. Many salespeople operate under
the probability framework: “If I get my product in front
of enough people eventually it will sell. I’ve got to play the
numbers.” Random is one of the worst concepts in the
2 0 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
world, it causes people to wait and work harder in vain.
Sales are caused; you must build a system.
• Myth #3: Sales is about convincing people, and you can
convince anyone to do anything. Salespeople don’t con-
vince people to buy, people convince themselves. They buy
for their own reasons. The customer defines the value. You
need understand them first, and then your product and
how it fits into their lives.
WHERE TO START?
1. 2. Look at your own buying habits. Think of something you
purchased recently that took you a long time to finally buy.
Now, sit down with a friend or family member and talk
about how and why you purchased it. It doesn’t matter if
it’s a car, phone, or a meal service. Whatever it is, try to
uncover what happened, and don’t do it alone. Dig deep
into yourself and understand the social, emotional, and
functional reasons why you did what you did. Under-
stand how you bought. You will realize that the irrational
becomes rational with context. It’s ultimately a low-risk
way to practice this new approach before applying it to
your product or service.
Practice helping your friends and family. Question
them about something they bought recently. This is a
great way to practice the interrogation techniques from
chapter four. Walk through whatever they bought and try
to understand how and why they did what they did. You
CO N C L U S I O N · 2 07
3. can also use this approach with your kids. Understand the
struggling moments that caused them to say, “I need help
in homework,” or “I’m not good at this sport.” Now use
the techniques you learned to help them make progress.
See if you can sell your child on a new path.
Now that you’re comfortable, start applying the
demand-side sales approach to your customer. First,
talk to someone who recently bought your product or
service and made progress with it. Now have a conversa-
tion and figure out what caused them to say, “Today’s the
day I’m going to buy…” What was going on in their life?
Second, think of your next presentation or PowerPoint as
helping somebody make progress. Can you design your
presentation to help people see their context and desired
outcome? Can you address their anxieties, and understand
their tradeoffs? Most presentations are designed from the
functional perspective, but not the emotional and social
perspectives. Can you design a presentation aimed at all
three motivations?
Now take each of these three starting points and apply the
knowledge you’ve learned throughout Demand-Side Sales 101.
1. 2. Articulate the buyer’s timeline and the four forces of prog-
ress. Do you understand the dominoes that had to fall
before the sale happened?
Summarize it into a meaningful story, including the func-
tional, emotional, and social motivations.
2 0 8 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
3. Design a sales process to help others make progress.
Finally, there are a few great books we recommend that will
serve to propel your demand-side sales skills forward.
Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss. He’s a CIA negotiator
and teaches techniques for becoming a better investigator with
tips for how to uncover the causal mechanisms behind why
people do what they do. It’s the ultimate guide to interviewing.
To Sell Is Human by Daniel Pink. He believes everyone is in
sales, to one degree or another, and he explores the social sci-
ences behind great sales. He believes there are fundamental
attributes to great salespeople—“glass half-full” types.
The Sandler Rules by David Mattson. It’s a great foundational
approach to learning the language of sales.
The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey.
It’s a manual for improving both professionally and personally
and is very applicable to demand-side sales.
The Little Red Book of Selling by Jeffrey Gitomer. It’s a pocket-
reference guide for learning to sell yourself with 12.5 principles.
TRANSFORMING SELLING AND BUYING
We hope the words sales and selling have undergone a meta-
CO N C L U S I O N · 2 0 9
morphosis in your mind, like watching The Wizard of Oz in
black and white versus color. It all seemed so simple and plain
at first, but now you’ve got color and texture. When you frame
sales around the lens of helping people make progress, on their
terms, it’s no longer a negative. You’re creating value!
Sales is the lifeblood of any organization, but more than that,
it’s everywhere, and in everything that you do. Beyond making
you better at sales, we hope this book helps you in life, by not
only changing the way you sell, but by changing the way that
you buy. We hope you become more purposeful and under-
stand why. It’s liberating to know that the only person standing
in the way of your personal progress is YOU. And, you don’t
need four years to decide how to buy a car, phone, or whatever
else you’ve failed to make progress with. Now, you’ll under-
stand why you’ve failed to make progress and be able to move
forward. Your purchases as a result will become more purpose-
ful and less wasteful.
Demand-side sales is about listening more intently and under-
standing other people’s perspectives. These are more than sales
skills; they are life skills as well. It’s our hope that this book will
lead to deep and meaningful conversations with your friends,
family, and customers, so that you can help everybody around
you make progress.

APPENDIX
T H E T O P F I V E T O O L S F O R
S E R V I N G C U S T O M E R S
Now that you understand demand-side sales, this appendix
will serve as a cheat sheet, or back-pocket reference guide, for
moving forward. At this point, you’ve already interviewed past
customers and understand the progress they made with your
product or services. But how do you approach new customers
and apply that progress? We call these best tips from through-
out the book “progress tools” and we’ve put them in one handy
reference guide. These are forward-looking tools that will help
you approach new customers and apply your knowledge.
A P P E N D I X · 2 1 1
PROGRESS TOOLS
1. FRAMING THE PROBLEM
This starts with framing out the struggling moment and under-
standing the context and outcomes the customer is seeking.
Think of these as questions you want to ask in order to help
someone make progress. These questions can be divided into
push, pull, anxieties, and habit.
Push Questions: What are you struggling with? What’s not
happening that you want to happen? Where’s your frustration?
Why are you doing this now? What don’t you like about your
current product or service?
Pull Questions: What are you hoping for? What’s going to be
different once you’ve got something new in your life?
Anxiety Questions: What are you worried about? What’s your
greatest concern about getting rid of the old product or ser-
vice? What’s your greatest concern about putting something
new into your life? How’s that going to impact everybody else
around you? What are they going to say?
Habit Questions: Even though there are problems, what do
you love the most about your current product or service? What
are you willing to give up in order to get something better?
What are you not willing to give up?
These are very standard questions that can frame a buyer’s sit-
2 1 2 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
uation so that you quickly understand where they are and why
they’re doing what they’re doing. This is where you want to
think about the social, emotional, and functional motivations.
Finally, understand the buyer’s time wall.
Time Wall Questions: When do you need to make this deci-
sion by? Why then?
2. UNPACKING LANGUAGE
This goes back to unpacking vague words and concepts, such
as easy, convenient, fast, healthy, etc.
Unpacking Questions: What does THAT (insert: easy, con-
venient, fast, healthy) mean? Tell me what THAT is? Tell me
what THAT is not. Give me an example of THAT. Give me an
example of not THAT. Ultimately, it’s asking questions down
to actions. For example…
Customer: Well, it’s easy.
You: Easy like what?
Customer: It’s easy like a car.
You: In what way is it easy like a car?
Customer: It’s a known process. You open the door, put the
A P P E N D I X · 2 1 3
key in the ignition, etc. There are steps but you know exactly
what to do. It’s familiar and easy.
You: But those steps weren’t always familiar and easy. At the
beginning you had to learn them.
Customer: Yeah, but I could learn it.
You: Ah, so easy is about being able to learn it and repeat it. Got
it. Give me an example of something that’s not easy.
Customer: Docking a boat. I don’t do it often enough. I know
the procedures, but it’s hard to do. And it varies so much on
the weather conditions. So, I can’t do it consistently.
Unpacking is about getting down to the action. It’s asking
“why” five times, not literally five times, but it’s peeling back
the onion. The other part about unpacking is finding the ref-
erence point. Let’s say you are talking in terms of healthy. Kale
chips are healthy but wanting to be healthy and eating kale
chips are not synonymous. When you start to unpack it, you
realize it’s just got to be healthier than Doritos and Cheetos—
SunChips. I can build a $400 million product based off that,
but I can’t build a $400 million kale chip business because
they suck. So, with unpacking it’s never healthy, fast, or easy.
It’s always healthier, faster, easier than the reference point. You
need that reference point.
2 1 4 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
3. PROTOTYPING TO LEARN
Prototyping is “let’s pretend.” Once you have the context and
the outcomes framed you want to pull in contrasting solutions
to their problem.
For instance, let’s say you are a real estate agent selling houses.
You want to initially show the buyer three very different houses.
Even if they already told you that they don’t want a rancher, you
take them there to understand their value code better. Once
at the rancher, ask them to tell you three things they like, and
three things they don’t. The contrast will help you understand
their value code, not change their mind about ranchers. You
might learn that they like having the bedrooms close together,
or that they hate being able to see the bedrooms from the main
living space. Contrast provides valuable feedback for helping
people make progress.
Here’s another example of prototyping. I’ll take my kids to a
college that I know they’re not going to attend, just to learn
their value code. They get to experience something different,
which allows them to better understand what they want. Now,
suddenly, they know they want a smaller campus or an urban
environment. Prototyping allows you to pick apart the pieces
and understand what parts are the most desirable so you can
build an ideal solution. It’s about giving them distinction.
Framing the struggling moment and unpacking are all about
context. Prototyping is about building contrast to create
A P P E N D I X · 2 1 5
meaning. This is not about building real options. It’s about
showing them things that are different enough so that you
can have a deeper conversation. It’s fact-finding and scenario
building before you’ve found the solution to their problem.
Understanding what they don’t want helps shape the design
requirements.
By pulling in contrasting solutions, you understand both their
tradeoffs and design requirements. We call this prototyping
to learn.
4. DESIGNING TO DECIDE
You’ve framed the struggling moment, unpacked their words,
and given them three prototypes. Now you’re ready to design
their progress with three possible solutions. Three’s the magic
number. People need to be able to eliminate options in order to
decide but not too many options, which only serves to confuse.
Let’s say you’re selling cars. Here’s where you lay out the
options that meet their needs in varying ways: “I’ve got the
Suburban, an oversized SUV, at $45,000 with 10,000 miles. It
fits all your requirements, but it’s larger than you wanted. I’ve
got the Honda Odyssey, a minivan, which I know you said you
didn’t want, but it meets your needs exactly. It gets everybody
in and out easily with remote doors, and it’s a little smaller than
the Suburban. It’s also going to be $45,000, with 12,000 miles.
Finally, I have the Kia Sorento, an SUV, the smallest of the three
2 1 6 · D E M A N D - S I D E S A L E S 1 0 1
options, but it’s loaded with everything. It’s also $45,000 with
10,000 miles.” Here we created three different options with
different sets of tradeoffs but the same price tag. Now they’ll
almost immediately eliminate one, which is important. This
is how you close a sale, by giving them three well-designed
options that frame the tradeoffs that they’re willing to make.
They’ve said they don’t want a minivan. But they also said they
like that the doors close automatically and that it fits in their
garage, things the Suburban can’t do. They’ve never had a Kia
and it’s smaller. So, now you’ve framed the tradeoffs nicely with
three neat options that are different enough but meet their
criteria. To be honest, nobody wants a minivan but making
these tradeoffs is the way everybody ends up buying one. If we
only present the minivan, people would not be able to choose.
It’s the tradeoffs that frame the decision.
5. PLAYING IT OUT
This is where you help the buyer see around corners and look
to the future. Ask the buyer questions in advance that help
them play it out; it’s a test: How do you know you’ll be sat-
isfied? What are your measures of satisfaction? What are the
outcomes that will make you realize you made the right pur-
chase? It’s about metrics. Without these questions there can
be unintended consequences that lead to buyer’s remorse.
For example, let’s say you bought a new car: What are you
A P P E N D I X · 2 1 7
going to do with the old car? When do you want the new one
delivered? How do you want to handle maintenance? Do you
need a roof-rack on top? Let’s say you bought a house: How
are you going to pack up and move? Will your furniture fit in
the new house? Do you need to send things to storage?
If you don’t bring these things up, you can’t help them under-
stand the next sixty to ninety days. By anticipating these issues,
you help them mentally prepare and prevent buyer’s remorse.
Playing it out involves things the buyer didn’t necessarily think
of. It’s about setting expectations.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Writing a book is a huge undertaking that is not done alone,
though there is usually only one author. This book, like my pre-
vious books, is a culmination of so many of my life experiences,
collaborations, and research done with others. It is impossible
for me to acknowledge everyone who has contributed to me,
my life, and this book over my years. I have received so much
help as a dyslexic kid from Detroit. I am thankful to so many
people, too many to list everyone, but you know who you are,
and I am blessed, thankful, and truly appreciate all of the help
throughout the years. THANK YOU!
That said, I have a few, very specific people who helped me
directly on this book.
I want to thank Greg Engle for being my business partner for
almost two decades. We make a great team, and this is as much
yours as it is mine. We talk through everything together.
