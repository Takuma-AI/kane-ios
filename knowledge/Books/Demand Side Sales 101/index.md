## Core Concepts

**The Big Idea:** Sales isn't about pushing products - it's about helping people make progress in their lives. Great salespeople are therapists, teachers, and coaches who understand that people buy when they have a struggling moment and think "Maybe I can do better."

**Key Mental Models:**
- Supply-side vs. Demand-side thinking
- Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework
- The Four Forces of Progress
- Struggling moments as catalysts for change
- Progress over personas

## Query Examples
- "How do I identify when someone is ready to buy?"
- "What's the difference between supply-side and demand-side selling?"
- "How do I understand what progress my customers are trying to make?"
- "Why do traditional sales techniques feel pushy?"
- "How can I align sales, marketing, and customer support?"
- "What causes people to switch from one solution to another?"
- "How do I help customers overcome their anxieties about buying?"
- "What role does context play in the buying decision?"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Nobody wants to be sold to, but everybody wants to buy** - Focus on helping, not pushing
2. **No struggle, no progress** - People only buy when they're struggling with their current solution
3. **Context matters more than demographics** - Understand the when and why, not just the who
4. **Sales is about progress, not products** - Your product is just part of their solution
5. **Great salespeople are investigators** - Dig deep to understand the real motivations
