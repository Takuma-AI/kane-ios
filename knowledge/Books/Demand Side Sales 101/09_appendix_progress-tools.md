## Overview

> "Now that you understand demand-side sales, this appendix will serve as a cheat sheet, or back-pocket reference guide, for moving forward. At this point, you've already interviewed past customers and understand the progress they made with your product or services. But how do you approach new customers and apply that progress?"

These are "forward-looking tools that will help you approach new customers and apply your knowledge."

## Progress Tool #1: Framing the Problem

### Purpose
"This starts with framing out the struggling moment and understanding the context and outcomes the customer is seeking. Think of these as questions you want to ask in order to help someone make progress."

### The Four Forces Questions

**Push Questions** (What's driving them away from current solution):
- "What are you struggling with?"
- "What's not happening that you want to happen?"
- "Where's your frustration?"
- "Why are you doing this now?"
- "What don't you like about your current product or service?"

**Pull Questions** (What's attracting them to new solution):
- "What are you hoping for?"
- "What's going to be different once you've got something new in your life?"

**Anxiety Questions** (What's holding them back):
- "What are you worried about?"
- "What's your greatest concern about getting rid of the old product or service?"
- "What's your greatest concern about putting something new into your life?"
- "How's that going to impact everybody else around you?"
- "What are they going to say?"

**Habit Questions** (What keeps them with current solution):
- "Even though there are problems, what do you love the most about your current product or service?"
- "What are you willing to give up in order to get something better?"
- "What are you not willing to give up?"

### Additional Consideration
"These are very standard questions that can frame a buyer's situation so that you quickly understand where they are and why they're doing what they're doing. This is where you want to think about the social, emotional, and functional motivations."

**Time Wall Questions**:
- "When do you need to make this decision by?"
- "Why then?"

## Progress Tool #2: Unpacking Language

### Purpose
"This goes back to unpacking vague words and concepts, such as easy, convenient, fast, healthy, etc."

### Core Unpacking Questions
- "What does THAT (insert: easy, convenient, fast, healthy) mean?"
- "Tell me what THAT is?"
- "Tell me what THAT is not."
- "Give me an example of THAT."
- "Give me an example of not THAT."

### Example Dialogue
**Customer**: "Well, it's easy."
**You**: "Easy like what?"
**Customer**: "It's easy like a car."
**You**: "In what way is it easy like a car?"
**Customer**: "It's a known process. You open the door, put the key in the ignition, etc. There are steps but you know exactly what to do. It's familiar and easy."
**You**: "But those steps weren't always familiar and easy. At the beginning you had to learn them."
**Customer**: "Yeah, but I could learn it."
**You**: "Ah, so easy is about being able to learn it and repeat it. Got it. Give me an example of something that's not easy."
**Customer**: "Docking a boat. I don't do it often enough. I know the procedures, but it's hard to do. And it varies so much on the weather conditions. So, I can't do it consistently."

### Key Insight on Reference Points
> "Unpacking is about getting down to the action. It's asking 'why' five times, not literally five times, but it's peeling back the onion. The other part about unpacking is finding the reference point."

**Example - The "Healthy" Reference Point**:
"Let's say you are talking in terms of healthy. Kale chips are healthy but wanting to be healthy and eating kale chips are not synonymous. When you start to unpack it, you realize it's just got to be healthier than Doritos and Cheetosâ€”SunChips. I can build a $400 million product based off that, but I can't build a $400 million kale chip business because they suck."

**The Rule**: "It's never healthy, fast, or easy. It's always healthier, faster, easier than the reference point. You need that reference point."

## Progress Tool #3: Prototyping to Learn

### Purpose
"Prototyping is 'let's pretend.' Once you have the context and the outcomes framed you want to pull in contrasting solutions to their problem."

### Real Estate Example
> "Let's say you are a real estate agent selling houses. You want to initially show the buyer three very different houses. Even if they already told you that they don't want a rancher, you take them there to understand their value code better."

**The Process**:
- Take them to the rancher they said they don't want
- Ask them to identify three things they like and three they don't
- "The contrast will help you understand their value code, not change their mind about ranchers"
- Learn specifics: "They like having the bedrooms close together" or "hate being able to see the bedrooms from the main living space"

### College Visit Example
> "I'll take my kids to a college that I know they're not going to attend, just to learn their value code. They get to experience something different, which allows them to better understand what they want. Now, suddenly, they know they want a smaller campus or an urban environment."

### Key Principles
- "Prototyping allows you to pick apart the pieces and understand what parts are the most desirable"
- "It's about giving them distinction"
- "This is not about building real options. It's about showing them things that are different enough so that you can have a deeper conversation"
- "Understanding what they don't want helps shape the design requirements"

**The Framework**:
- Framing and unpacking = understanding context
- Prototyping = building contrast to create meaning

## Progress Tool #4: Designing to Decide

### Purpose
"You've framed the struggling moment, unpacked their words, and given them three prototypes. Now you're ready to design their progress with three possible solutions."

### The Magic of Three
"Three's the magic number. People need to be able to eliminate options in order to decide but not too many options, which only serves to confuse."

### Car Sales Example
The setup with three options at same price ($45,000):

1. **Suburban (Oversized SUV)**
   - 10,000 miles
   - "Fits all your requirements, but it's larger than you wanted"

2. **Honda Odyssey (Minivan)**
   - 12,000 miles
   - "Which I know you said you didn't want, but it meets your needs exactly"
   - "Gets everybody in and out easily with remote doors"
   - "A little smaller than the Suburban"

3. **Kia Sorento (SUV)**
   - 10,000 miles
   - "The smallest of the three options, but it's loaded with everything"

### The Psychology
> "Now they'll almost immediately eliminate one, which is important. This is how you close a sale, by giving them three well-designed options that frame the tradeoffs that they're willing to make."

**The Minivan Paradox**:
- "They've said they don't want a minivan"
- "But they also said they like that the doors close automatically and that it fits in their garage, things the Suburban can't do"
- "To be honest, nobody wants a minivan but making these tradeoffs is the way everybody ends up buying one"
- "If we only present the minivan, people would not be able to choose"

**Key Insight**: "It's the tradeoffs that frame the decision."

## Progress Tool #5: Playing It Out

### Purpose
"This is where you help the buyer see around corners and look to the future. Ask the buyer questions in advance that help them play it out; it's a test."

### Core Questions
- "How do you know you'll be satisfied?"
- "What are your measures of satisfaction?"
- "What are the outcomes that will make you realize you made the right purchase?"

"It's about metrics. Without these questions there can be unintended consequences that lead to buyer's remorse."

### Car Purchase Example
- "What are you going to do with the old car?"
- "When do you want the new one delivered?"
- "How do you want to handle maintenance?"
- "Do you need a roof-rack on top?"

### House Purchase Example
- "How are you going to pack up and move?"
- "Will your furniture fit in the new house?"
- "Do you need to send things to storage?"

### The Value
> "If you don't bring these things up, you can't help them understand the next sixty to ninety days. By anticipating these issues, you help them mentally prepare and prevent buyer's remorse."

**Key Point**: "Playing it out involves things the buyer didn't necessarily think of. It's about setting expectations."

## Using the Tools Together

These five progress tools work as a system:

1. **Frame the Problem** - Understand their struggling moment
2. **Unpack Language** - Get to specific, actionable meanings
3. **Prototype to Learn** - Use contrast to understand values
4. **Design to Decide** - Present three options that frame tradeoffs
5. **Play It Out** - Anticipate future needs and prevent remorse

Each tool builds on the previous one, creating a complete framework for helping customers make progress.
