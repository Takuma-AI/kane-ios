## Core Strategy: Pick a Fight

"Sometimes the best way to know what your app should be is to **know what it shouldn't be**. Figure out your app's enemy and **you'll shine a light on where you need to go**."

## How This Works in Practice

"When we decided to create project management software, we knew **Microsoft Project was the gorilla in the room**. Instead of fearing the gorilla, we **used it as a motivator**. We decided Basecamp would be something completely different, **the anti-Project**."

"We realized project management isn't about **charts, graphs, reports and statistics** — it's about **communication**. It also isn't about a project manager sitting up high and broadcasting a project plan. It's about **everyone taking responsibility together** to make the project work."

"Our enemy was the **Project Management Dictators and the tools they used to crack the whip**. We wanted to **democratize project management** — make it something everyone was a part of (including the client). Projects turn out better when everyone takes collective ownership of the process."

"When it came to Writeboard, we knew there were competitors out there with lots of whizbang features. So we decided to emphasize a **'no fuss' angle** instead. We created an app that let people share and collaborate on ideas simply, without bogging them down with non-essential features. **If it wasn't essential, we left it out**. And in just three months after launch, over 100,000 Writeboards have been created."

"When we started on Backpack our enemy was **structure and rigid rules**. People should be able to organize their information their own way — not based on a series of preformatted screens or a plethora of required form fields."

## The Marketing Advantage

"One bonus you get from having an enemy is a **very clear marketing message**. People are stoked by conflict. And they also **understand a product by comparing it to others**. With a chosen enemy, you're **feeding people a story they want to hear**. Not only will they understand your product better and faster, **they'll take sides**. And that's a sure-fire way to get attention and ignite passion."

## The Balance: Don't Get Obsessed

"Now with all that said, it's also important to **not get too obsessed with the competition**. Overanalyze other products and you'll start to limit the way you think. **Take a look and then move on to your own vision and your own ideas**."

## Mental Model: Don't Follow the Leader

Seth Godin's insight: "Marketers (and all human beings) are well trained to **follow the leader**. The natural instinct is to figure out what's working for the competition and then try to outdo it — to be cheaper than your competitor who competes on price, or faster than the competitor who competes on speed."

### The Psychology Problem

"The problem is that once a consumer has bought someone else's story and believes that lie, **persuading the consumer to switch is the same as persuading him to admit he was wrong**. And **people hate admitting that they're wrong**."

### The Alternative Story Strategy

"Instead, you must **tell a different story** and persuade listeners that your story is more important than the story they currently believe. If your competition is faster, you must be cheaper. If they sell the story of health, you must sell the story of convenience. Not just the positioning x/y axis sort of 'We are cheaper' claim, but a **real story that is completely different** from the story that's already being told."

## Case Study: BlinkList's Focus

Michael Reining's experience: "One of the quickest ways to get yourself into trouble is to **look at what your competitors are doing**. This has been especially true for us at BlinkList. Since we launched there have been about 10 other social bookmarking services that have been launched. Some people have even started to generate spreadsheets online with a detailed feature by feature comparison."

### The Solution: Stay Focused

"However, this can quickly lead one astray. Instead, we **stay focused on the big picture** and keep asking ourselves, **what is the key problem we are trying to solve and how can we solve it**."

## Enemy Selection Framework

### Good Enemies:
- **Dominant players** with obvious weaknesses
- **Complex solutions** when you can be simple
- **Expensive options** when you can be affordable
- **Rigid systems** when you can be flexible
- **Corporate tools** when you can be human-centered

### Enemy Characteristics:
- **Clear philosophical differences** (not just feature differences)
- **Represent what you're against** (not just who you compete with)
- **Help clarify your own positioning** (make your story clearer)
- **Create emotional resonance** (people love underdogs vs. giants)

## Decision-Making Framework

### When Choosing Your Enemy:

1. **What does the dominant player do that frustrates users?**
2. **What philosophical approach do they represent that we reject?**
3. **How can we be the opposite of what they are?**
4. **What story are they telling that we can contradict?**
5. **What would the "anti-[competitor]" look like?**

### Warning Signs:

- **Feature-by-feature comparison obsession**
- **Trying to out-do rather than differentiate**
- **Copying their story with slight variations**
- **Losing focus on your own vision**
- **Building reactive features instead of proactive solutions**

## The Story Framework

### Their Story vs. Your Story:
- **Complexity** → **Simplicity**
- **Control** → **Freedom**  
- **Features** → **Ease of use**
- **Power users** → **Everyone**
- **Corporate** → **Human**

### Marketing Message Template:
"While [Enemy] focuses on [their approach], we believe in [your opposite approach] because [your philosophy]."

**Example:** "While Microsoft Project focuses on detailed charts and top-down control, we believe in simple communication and collaborative ownership because projects succeed when everyone takes responsibility together."

## Long-Term Strategy

### Benefits of Having an Enemy:
- **Clear positioning** in the market
- **Emotional engagement** from users
- **Decision-making clarity** (would our enemy do this?)
- **Marketing differentiation** (easy to explain what you're not)
- **Team motivation** (rallying against something)

### Maintaining Balance:
- Use enemy for **clarity**, not **obsession**
- Focus on **your vision**, not their weaknesses
- Build **what you believe in**, not just **anti-competitor features**
- Stay **customer-focused**, not **competitor-focused**

## Cultural Insights & Communication Style

### How They Think About Competition
- **"the gorilla in the room"** - Casual way of acknowledging dominant players without fear
- **"Project Management Dictators and the tools they used to crack the whip"** - Vivid, almost political language about software philosophy
- **"whizbang features"** - Dismissive term for complexity that sounds impressive but isn't useful

### Their Relationship with Conflict
- **"People are stoked by conflict"** - Understanding human psychology, not just product strategy
- **"they'll take sides"** - Recognition that business is tribal and emotional, not just rational
- **"feeding people a story they want to hear"** - Sophisticated understanding of narrative and positioning

### Casual Confidence Markers
- **"Wasn't that easy?"** (from market validation)
- **"And in just three months after launch, over 100,000 Writeboards have been created"** - Understated way of sharing impressive metrics
- Matter-of-fact tone about democratizing entire industries

### Language Choices That Reveal Values
- **"democratize project management"** - Political language applied to software
- **"collective ownership"** - Community values in business context
- **"anti-Project"** - Identity defined by opposition, not just features
