## Build Something You Can Manage

"If you launch an affiliate program do you have the systems in place to handle the accounting and payouts? Maybe you should just **let people earn credit against their membership fees** instead of writing, signing, and mailing a check each month."

"Can you afford to give away 1 gb of space for free just because Google does? Maybe you should **start small at 100 mb**, or only provide space on paying accounts."

## The Bottom Line

"Bottom line: **Build products and offer services you can manage.** It's easy to make promises. **It's much harder to keep them.** Make sure whatever it is that you're doing is something you can actually sustain — **organizationally, strategically, and financially**."

## Mental Model: Promise vs. Delivery Gap

### Easy to Promise:
- Affiliate program with cash payouts
- 1GB free storage
- 24/7 support
- Feature parity with giants
- Unlimited anything

### Hard to Deliver:
- Monthly check processing
- Infrastructure costs
- Round-the-clock staffing
- Maintenance burden
- Scaling challenges

## Alternative Approaches

### Instead of Complex:
**Affiliate cash payouts** → **Membership credits**
- No check writing
- No mailing costs
- No accounting complexity
- Automated system

**1GB free (like Google)** → **100MB free or paid-only**
- Manageable costs
- Sustainable model
- Realistic capacity
- No bleeding money

## The Three Sustainability Pillars

### 1. Organizational Sustainability
**Can your team handle it?**
- Current team size
- Skill requirements
- Process complexity
- Ongoing maintenance

### 2. Strategic Sustainability
**Does it align with your direction?**
- Core mission fit
- Long-term vision
- Resource allocation
- Opportunity cost

### 3. Financial Sustainability
**Can you afford it long-term?**
- Initial costs
- Ongoing expenses
- Hidden costs
- Revenue impact

## The Google Comparison Trap

"Can you afford to give away 1 gb of space for free **just because Google does?**"

### Why This Fails:
- Different scale economies
- Different business models
- Different funding sources
- Different strategic goals

### The Right Question:
Not "What does Google do?"
But "What can we sustain?"

## Scaling Decisions

### Start Small Approach:
- **100MB instead of 1GB**
- Test sustainability
- Grow if viable
- Maintain control

### Paid-Only Option:
- No free tier burden
- Clear value exchange
- Sustainable from day one
- No subsidization needed

## Promise Management Framework

### Before Making Promises, Ask:

1. **Delivery Mechanism**
   - How will we fulfill this?
   - What systems needed?
   - Manual or automated?

2. **Ongoing Burden**
   - Monthly requirements?
   - Support implications?
   - Maintenance needs?

3. **Scale Implications**
   - Works at 10 customers?
   - Works at 1,000?
   - Works at 10,000?

4. **True Costs**
   - Direct expenses
   - Time investment
   - Opportunity cost

## Examples of Unsustainable Promises

### Service Promises:
- Free phone support for all
- Same-day response guarantees
- Custom features for everyone
- Unlimited resources

### Feature Promises:
- Feature parity with competitors
- Everything users request
- Constant updates
- Platform availability

### Business Model Promises:
- Unsustainable pricing
- Costly customer acquisition
- Manual processes at scale
- Geographic coverage

## The Simplification Strategy

### Affiliate Program:
**Complex:** Cash payouts
- Check processing
- Tax documentation
- Mailing logistics
- Accounting overhead

**Simple:** Credit system
- Automated credits
- No physical processing
- System handles all
- Scales easily

## Decision Framework

### Can You Handle It Test:

1. **Map the full process**
   - Every step required
   - Every month/year
   - At different scales

2. **Calculate true cost**
   - Time investment
   - Financial burden
   - Opportunity cost

3. **Project forward**
   - 10x current load
   - Team changes
   - Market shifts

4. **Find simpler alternative**
   - Same benefit
   - Less complexity
   - More sustainable

## Warning Signs
