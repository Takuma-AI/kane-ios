# Chapter 58: Open Doors

## Core Concept

**Get data out into the world via RSS, APIs, etc.** Don't try to lock-in your customers. Let them get their information when they want it and how they want it. To do that, you've got to give up the idea of sealing in data. Instead, let it run wild.

## The Philosophy of Openness

Two paths for your data strategy:
1. **Lock-in approach**: Seal data inside, make it hard to leave
2. **Open approach**: Let data run wild, make it easy to access

37signals advocates for radical openness: Give people access via RSS feeds and APIs.

## Mental Model: Data Liberation

**Traditional Thinking:** Control data tightly to maintain competitive advantage and customer lock-in.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Liberate data to create more value, build trust, and expand possibilities.

### Decision Framework

For data strategy:
1. **How can we make data more accessible?**
2. **What would developers build with our API?**
3. **How does openness benefit our customers?**
4. **Where can we reduce friction?**

### Key Insight

When you let data run free, it returns with compound interest through innovation, loyalty, and expanded use cases.

## RSS: Beyond Blogs

"People used to think of RSS feeds as merely a good way to keep track of blogs or news sites. Feeds have more power than that though."

**The Basecamp approach**: "They also provide a great way for customers to stay up to date on the changing content of an app without having to log in repeatedly."

Basecamp RSS enables:
- Project message tracking
- Todo list monitoring
- Milestone awareness
- No constant login required

## APIs: The Innovation Multiplier

"APIs let developers build add-on products for your app that can turn out to be invaluable."

### Case Study: Backpack Dashboard Widget

**The story**: Backpack supplies an API → Chipt Productions builds Mac OS X Dashboard widget → Widget lets people manage Backpack from desktop

**The impact**: 
- "Customers have raved to us about this widget"
- "Some have even said it was the key factor in getting them to use Backpack"

## Real-World Success Stories

### Google Maps API
"The Google Maps API has spawned interesting mash ups that let people cull information from another source (e.g. apartment listings) and plot that data on a map."

### Del.icio.us Linkrolls
"Linkrolls offer a way for people to get their latest del.icio.us bookmarks displayed on their own sites."

### Flickr's Commercial APIs
"Flickr allows other businesses access to commercial APIs so customers can buy photo books, posters, DVD backups, and stamps."

Stewart Butterfield's vision: "The goal is to open it up completely and give you the biggest variety of choices when it comes to doing things with your photos."

## Benefits of Open Doors

### For Customers
- **Convenience**: Access data their way
- **Integration**: Connect with other tools
- **Control**: Own their information
- **Innovation**: Benefit from third-party creativity

### For Your Business
- **Expanded ecosystem**: Others build value
- **Increased stickiness**: More integration points
- **Free innovation**: Developers create features
- **Market feedback**: See what people want
- **Competitive advantage**: Openness attracts users

## Todd Dominey's Widget Experience

"When Basecamp released Backpack a while back, my first impression was…eh."

**The transformation**: Chipt Productions widget changes everything

**The workflow impact**:
- "Now whenever an idea hits, I pop up the widget, type, and submit — done"
- "Email arrives with something I want to check out? Pop up the widget, type, and submit — done"
- "The widget is an immediate brain dump readily available"

**The key insight**: "And because everything is web based, there isn't any version control or syncing — just the fluid input of content without having to be concerned about where it's going or how I'll access it later."

## Implementation Strategies

### RSS Feeds
- Every list should have a feed
- Every user action can be tracked
- Private feeds with authentication
- Customizable feed contents
- Real-time updates

### API Design
- RESTful principles
- Clear documentation
- Example code
- Rate limiting
- Authentication options
- Versioning strategy

### Data Formats
- Standard formats (JSON, XML)
- Clear schemas
- Consistent structures
- Good defaults
- Flexible options

## Common API Use Cases

Developers often build:
- **Mobile apps**: Native experiences
- **Desktop widgets**: Quick access tools
- **Integration bridges**: Connect to other services
- **Reporting tools**: Custom analytics
- **Backup utilities**: Data protection
- **Workflow automation**: Business processes

## The Trust Factor

"This is crucial because giving people control over their information builds trust."

Open data policies show:
- Confidence in your value
- Respect for customers
- Long-term thinking
- Ethical approach
- Customer-first mentality

## Overcoming Lock-in Fears

Common fears about openness:
- Customers will leave easier
- Competitors will steal ideas
- Lost control over experience
- Support complexity

Reality of openness:
- Happy customers stay anyway
- Innovation outweighs risks
- Ecosystem adds value
- Community provides support

## Building an Ecosystem

1. **Start simple**: Basic read-only API
2. **Document well**: Clear examples
3. **Engage developers**: Support early adopters
4. **Showcase successes**: Highlight cool uses
5. **Iterate based on usage**: See what people need
6. **Expand gradually**: Add capabilities over time

## The Boomerang Effect

"Other good examples of companies letting data run free in order to get a boomerang effect"

When data goes out freely:
- Returns as innovations
- Brings new users
- Creates unexpected value
- Builds community
- Strengthens platform
