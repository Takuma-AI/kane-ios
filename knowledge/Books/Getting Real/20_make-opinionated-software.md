## The Agnostic Software Myth

"Some people argue software should be agnostic. They say it's arrogant for developers to limit features or ignore feature requests. They say software should always be as flexible as possible."

"**We think that's bullshit.**"

## Software with a Spine

"**The best software has a vision. The best software takes sides.** When someone uses software, they're not just looking for features, they're looking for **an approach**. They're looking for **a vision**. Decide what your vision is and run with it."

## The Happy Customer Fallacy

"And remember, if they don't like your vision there are **plenty of other visions out there for people**. Don't go chasing people you'll never make happy."

## Case Study: The Wiki Revolution

"A great example is the original wiki design. Ward Cunningham and friends **deliberately stripped the wiki of many features** that were considered integral to document collaboration in the past. Instead of attributing each change of the document to a certain person, they **removed much of the visual representation of ownership**. They made the content **ego-less and time-less**. They decided it wasn't important who wrote the content or when it was written. **And that has made all the difference.** This decision fostered a shared sense of community and was a key ingredient in the success of Wikipedia."

## The 37signals Way

"Our apps have followed a similar path. **They don't try to be all things to all people.** They have **an attitude**. They seek out customers who are actually **partners**. They speak to people who **share our vision**. You're either **on the bus or off the bus**."

## Mental Model: Opinionated vs. Agnostic

### Agnostic Software Thinking:
- Maximum flexibility for all users
- Every feature request is valid
- Avoid limiting anyone
- Please everyone possible
- Developer knows less than users

### Opinionated Software Thinking:
- **Clear vision guides decisions**
- **Some features deliberately excluded**
- **Limits create focus**
- **Please the right people deeply**
- **Developer vision matters**

## Why Opinions Matter

### Users Want Approach, Not Just Features:
- Features are commodities
- Approach is differentiating
- Vision provides coherence
- Philosophy guides experience

### The Partnership Model:
- **Users as partners** - Shared vision
- **Not just customers** - Deeper relationship
- **Mutual selection** - They choose you, you choose them
- **Aligned goals** - Moving in same direction

## The Wiki Example Decoded

### What They Removed:
- Individual attribution
- Timestamps
- Ownership indicators
- Revision tracking by person

### What They Gained:
- **Ego-less content** - Focus on information
- **Time-less value** - Content matters, not when
- **Community sense** - Shared ownership
- **Wikipedia success** - Enabled massive collaboration

### The Lesson:
**What you remove is as important as what you include**

## Making Opinionated Choices

### Areas to Have Opinions:

**Interface Design:**
- How much customization to allow
- What workflows to support
- Which interactions to prioritize

**Feature Set:**
- What to include
- More importantly: what to exclude
- How features work together

**User Experience:**
- Guided vs. open-ended
- Simple vs. powerful
- Fast vs. comprehensive

**Business Model:**
- Who you serve
- How you charge
- What you support

## The "On the Bus" Philosophy

"You're either **on the bus or off the bus**"

### What This Means:
- **No middle ground** - Either align or find alternative
- **Clear expectations** - Know what you're getting
- **Self-selection** - Wrong users leave naturally
- **Strong community** - Right users bond over shared vision

### Benefits:
- **Coherent product** - Not pulled in all directions
- **Passionate users** - They chose your approach
- **Clear development** - Vision guides decisions
- **Less support burden** - Users understand philosophy

## Decision Framework for Opinionated Software

### When Facing Feature Requests:

1. **Does this align with our vision?**
   - If no, reject regardless of demand

2. **Would this dilute our approach?**
   - If yes, protect the core

3. **Are we chasing non-believers?**
   - If yes, let them go

4. **Does this serve our partners?**
   - If yes, consider deeply

### When Making Design Decisions:

1. **What would our vision say?**
2. **Are we being true to our approach?**
3. **Will our partners appreciate this?**
4. **Are we taking a clear side?**

## The Courage to Exclude

### What to Exclude:
- Features that complicate core use
- Options that create confusion
- Flexibility that dilutes focus
- Requests from non-partners

### How to Exclude:
- **Say no clearly** - Don't string along
- **Explain vision** - Help them understand
- **Suggest alternatives** - Point to other solutions
- **Stay confident** - Your vision has value

## Examples of Opinionated Software

### Wikipedia (via Wiki):
- **Opinion:** Ownership doesn't matter
- **Result:** Collaborative encyclopedia

### Basecamp:
- **Opinion:** Project management is communication
- **Result:** No Gantt charts, yes messages

### Getting Real Philosophy:
- **Opinion:** Less is more
- **Result:** Focused, simple products

## Cultural Insights & Communication Style

### Profanity for Emphasis:
- **"We think that's bullshit"** - No ambiguity
- Strong language = strong opinion
- Rejection of conventional wisdom

### Absolute Statements:
- **"The best software has a vision"**
- No hedging or qualifying
- Confidence in approach

### Binary Thinking:
- **"On the bus or off the bus"**
- No room for compromise
- Clear boundaries

### Partnership Language:
- **"Partners"** not just customers
- **"Share our vision"** - Mutual alignment
- Relationship depth matters

### Historical Validation:
- Wiki/Wikipedia example
- Proves opinionated can win
