## The Paradox: We Love Details, But...

"We're crazy about details.
- The space between objects
- The perfect type leading
- The perfect color
- The perfect words
- Four lines of code instead of seven
- 90% vs 89%
- 760px vs 750px
- $39/month vs. $49/month

**Success and satisfaction are in the details.**"

## The Dark Side of Early Detail Focus

"However, success isn't the only thing you'll find in the details. You'll also find **stagnation, disagreement, meetings, and delays**. These things can **kill morale and lower your chances of success**."

## The Reality Check

"How often have you found yourself stuck on a single design or code element for a whole day? How often have you realized that the progress you made today wasn't real progress? This happens when you **focus on details too early in the process**. There's plenty of time to be a perfectionist. **Just do it later.**"

## The Right Time for Wrong

"Don't worry about the size of your headline font in week one. You don't need to nail that perfect shade of green in week two. You don't need to move that 'submit' button three pixels to the right in week three. **Just get the stuff on the page for now. Then use it. Make sure it works. Later on you can adjust and perfect it.**"

## Details Emerge Through Use

"**Details reveal themselves as you use what you're building.** You'll see what needs more attention. You'll feel what's missing. You'll know which potholes to pave over because you'll keep hitting them. **That's when you need to pay attention, not sooner.**"

## Mental Model: The Artist's Approach

Patrick Lafleur (Creation Objet Inc.) shares a crucial lesson from drawing:

"I really got over the 'get into details right away' attitude after I took some drawing classes…If you begin to draw the details right away you can be sure that **the drawing is going to suck**. In fact, you are completely missing the point."

### The Right Process:

"You should begin by getting your **proportions right for the whole scene**. Then you **sketch the largest objects in your scene, up to the smallest one**. The sketch must be very loose up to this point. Then you can proceed with shading which consists of bringing volume to life. You begin with only three tones (light, medium, dark). This gives you a tonal sketch. Then for each portion of your drawing you reevaluate three tonal shades and apply them. Do it until the volumes are there (requires multiple iteration)…"

"**Work from large to small. Always.**"

## The Progressive Refinement Framework

### Week One: Structure
- Get the basic flow working
- Establish main screens
- Connect the key pieces
- **Ignore:** Fonts, colors, pixel-perfect alignment

### Week Two-Three: Functionality  
- Make things actually work
- Test core features
- Fix broken flows
- **Ignore:** Perfect copy, exact spacing, final colors

### Week Four+: Refinement
- Now notice what bothers you
- Fix the potholes you keep hitting
- Perfect what matters through use
- **Address:** Real problems, not theoretical ones

## Why This Works

### Details Without Context = Waste
- Can't know what matters without usage
- Theoretical perfection ≠ Actual needs
- Early details often need redoing anyway

### Usage Reveals Truth
- **"You'll see what needs more attention"**
- **"You'll feel what's missing"**  
- **"You'll know which potholes to pave over"**

### Momentum Matters More
- Progress > Perfection (early on)
- Moving forward > Standing still
- Real usage > Imagined scenarios

## The Cost of Early Perfectionism

### What You Lose:
- **Time** - Days on details that might change
- **Morale** - Team frustration with no progress
- **Perspective** - Can't see forest for trees
- **Flexibility** - Harder to change "perfect" work

### What You Gain by Waiting:
- **Clarity** - Know what actually matters
- **Efficiency** - Fix real problems, not imagined ones
- **Motivation** - Visible progress keeps team energized
- **Accuracy** - Details based on actual use

## Decision Framework

### Ask Yourself:
1. **Have we used this yet?**
   - If no, it's too early for details
   
2. **Is this preventing progress?**
   - If no, move on

3. **Will this matter if the concept is wrong?**
   - If no, wait to perfect it

4. **Are we solving a real or theoretical problem?**
   - Real = fix now
   - Theoretical = fix later

## Examples of Details to Ignore Early

### Design:
- Perfect color palettes
- Pixel-perfect spacing
- Font size optimization
- Hover state refinements

### Code:
- Premature optimization
- Perfect naming conventions
- Ideal file structure
- Edge case handling

### Copy:
- Perfect marketing language
- Error message wordsmithing  
- Microcopy refinement
- SEO optimization

## When Details DO Matter Early

**Exception cases:**
- Core usability issues
- Fundamental architecture decisions
- Security considerations
- Data structure design

**Rule:** If changing it later would be exponentially harder, decide now. Otherwise, defer.

## Cultural Insights & Communication Style

### Confession and Authority:
- **"We're crazy about details"** - Establishes credibility
- Shows they're not anti-detail, just anti-timing
- Vulnerable admission of perfectionist tendencies

### Specific Examples:
- **"760px vs 750px"** - Ridiculously specific
- **"$39/month vs. $49/month"** - Real business decisions
- **"Four lines of code instead of seven"** - Developer precision

### Rhetorical Questions:
- **"How often have you..."** - Creates self-recognition
- Reader sees themselves in the problem
- Builds agreement through shared experience

### Metaphorical Teaching:
- Drawing class analogy - Makes abstract concrete
- **"Potholes to pave"** - Physical metaphor for UX problems
- **"Large to small"** - Universal principle

### Time-Based Progression:
- **"Week one... week two... week three"**
- Concrete timeline guidance
- Shows this is temporary, not permanent

### Blunt Honesty:
- **"The drawing is going to suck"**
- **"Wasn't real progress"**
- No sugar-coating the problem

### Practical Wisdom:
- **"Just get the stuff on the page"**
- **"Then use it"**
- **"Make sure it works"**
- Action-oriented solutions
