## Get Something Real Up and Running Quickly

"**Running software is the best way to build momentum, rally your team, and flush out ideas that don't work.** It should be your **number one priority from day one**."

## The Speed Imperative

"It's ok to do less, skip details, and take shortcuts in your process if it'll lead to running software faster. Once you're there, you'll be rewarded with a **significantly more accurate perspective** on how to proceed. Stories, wireframes, even html mockups, are just **approximations**. **Running software is real.**"

## The Truth Machine

"With real, running software **everyone gets closer to true understanding and agreement**. You avoid heated arguments over sketches and paragraphs that wind up turning out not to matter anyway. You realize that **parts you thought were trivial are actually quite crucial**."

"**Real things lead to real reactions.** And that's how you get to the truth."

## Mental Model: The Real Thing Leads to Agreement

Christopher Alexander (Professor of Architecture) provides the theoretical foundation:

"When a group of different people set out to try and find out what is harmonious…**their opinions about it will tend to converge if they are mocking up full-scale, real stuff**. Of course, if they're making sketches or throwing out ideas, they won't agree. But, **if you start making the real thing, one tends to reach agreement**."

## The Fractal Mantra

Matt Hamer (developer and product manager, Kinja) extends the principle:

"I do not think I've ever been involved with a software project — large or small — that was successful in terms of schedule, cost, or functionality that **started with a long period of planning and discussion and no concurrent development**. It is simply too easy, and sometimes fun, to waste valuable time inventing features that turn out to be unnecessary or unimplementable."

### The Fractal Nature:

"This applies at all levels of development and **'get something real up and running' is a fractal mantra**. It doesn't just apply to the project as a whole, it is at least equally applicable to the smaller-scale development of components from which the application is built."

## Early Integration Benefits

"When there is a **working implementation of a key component** available, developers want to understand how it will or won't work with their piece of the application and will generally try to use it as soon as they can. Even if the implementation isn't perfect or complete at first, this **early collaboration usually leads to well-defined interfaces** and features that do exactly what they need to."

## Approximations vs. Reality

### Approximations:
- Stories
- Wireframes
- HTML mockups
- Sketches
- Specifications

### Reality:
- **Running software**
- Working features
- Live interactions
- Actual performance
- Real user experience

## Why Running Software Wins

### Builds Momentum:
- Team sees progress
- Excitement grows
- Tangible results
- Energy increases
- Confidence builds

### Rallies Team:
- Common ground
- Shared vision
- Clear direction
- United purpose
- Collective ownership

### Flushes Out Problems:
- Bad ideas exposed
- Assumptions tested
- Reality check
- Hidden issues surface
- True complexity revealed

## The Agreement Phenomenon

### With Sketches/Ideas:
- Endless debates
- Different interpretations
- Abstract arguments
- No convergence
- Wasted energy

### With Running Software:
- **Opinions converge**
- Shared understanding
- Concrete discussion
- Natural agreement
- Productive iteration

## Priority Framework

### Day One Priority:
1. **Get something running**
2. Not perfect
3. Not complete
4. But real
5. But working

### Acceptable Trade-offs:
- Do less
- Skip details
- Take shortcuts
- Cut scope
- Simplify aggressively

### Unacceptable:
- Extended planning only
- Endless discussion
- Perfect specifications
- Complete wireframes
- Delayed reality

## The Perspective Shift

"Once you're there, you'll be rewarded with a **significantly more accurate perspective**"

### What Changes:
- **Trivial → Crucial** discoveries
- Hidden complexity exposed
- Real workflow emerges
- Actual pain points surface
- True priorities clarify

## Implementation Strategy

### Project Level:
- Smallest working version
- Core functionality first
- Ship skeletal system
- Add incrementally
- Always be running

### Component Level:
- Each piece working ASAP
- Integration points early
- Interfaces through usage
- Collaboration through code
- Reality over theory

## The Planning Trap

### Why Planning Fails:
- **"Too easy, and sometimes fun"**
- Inventing unnecessary features
- Creating unimplementable ideas
- Avoiding hard decisions
- False sense of progress

### Why Development Succeeds:
- Forces real decisions
- Exposes actual problems
- Creates true progress
- Builds on reality
- Delivers value

## Cultural Insights & Communication Style

### Prioritization Language:
- **"Number one priority"**
- **"From day one"**
- Absolute statements
- No ambiguity

### Permission to Cut:
- **"Ok to do less"**
- **"Skip details"**
- **"Take shortcuts"**
- Removes guilt
- Enables speed

### Reality vs. Approximation:
- Clear hierarchy
- **"Running software is real"**
- Everything else secondary
- Binary distinction

### Physical Reactions:
- **"Real things lead to real reactions"**
- Tangible cause-effect
- Truth through experience
- Not theoretical

### Academic Authority:
- Christopher Alexander quote
- Architecture professor
- Cross-discipline validation
- **"Full-scale, real stuff"**

### Fractal Concept:
- **"Fractal mantra"**
- Pattern at every scale
- Universal principle
- Recursive application

### Warning Language:
- **"Too easy, and sometimes fun"**
- Acknowledges temptation
- Planning as procrastination
- Fun but wasteful
