## Core Concept

**Give your app a name that's easy to remember.** A big mistake a lot of people make is thinking their app's name needs to be ultradescriptive. Don't worry about picking a name that vividly describes your tool's purpose; That usually just leads to a generic, forgettable name.

## Mental Model: Memorable Over Descriptive

**Traditional Thinking:** The name must explain exactly what the product does.

**Getting Real Thinking:** The name must stick in people's minds.

### Decision Framework

For naming:
1. **Is it short and catchy?**
2. **Can people remember it easily?**
3. **Does it avoid generic descriptors?**
4. **Can we own it distinctively?**

### Key Insight

A memorable name beats a descriptive name every time.

## The Examples That Prove the Point

**Good names (memorable):**
- Basecamp
- Writeboard
- Backpack
- Campfire

**Bad names (generic/descriptive):**
- Project Management Center
- ProjectExpress
- CollaborEdit

The pattern: The memorable names tell you nothing about function but stick in your mind. The descriptive names tell you everything but are instantly forgettable.

## The Naming Process

"Don't focus group or committee-ize the naming process too much. Pick a name that's short, catchy, and memorable and then run with it."

### What This Means
- **Avoid overthinking** the process
- **Skip endless debates** about meaning
- **Trust your instincts** on memorability
- **Move forward decisively** once chosen

## The Domain Name Reality

"Don't sweat it if you can't get the exact domain name you want. You can always be creative and get close with a couple of extra letters."

Examples given:
- backpackit.com
- campfirenow.com

The lesson: **Perfect domain availability shouldn't dictate your name choice.**

## David Pogue's Wisdom

From the New York Times columnist:

"Doesn't the tech industry realize that thinking up catchy, self-explanatory names would ultimately benefit it in the same way?"

His argument for better naming:
- **Sell more** because not scaring off consumers
- **Technology catches on quicker**
- **Easier to describe** to others
- **Easier to use** psychologically
- **Easier to buy** - which means easier to sell

Key quote: "They wouldn't scare off consumers who think they're being kept out of the high-tech club by a bunch of arrogant engineers."

## The Psychology of Names

### Why Memorable Beats Descriptive

1. **Word of mouth**: Easy to say and share
2. **Mental storage**: Simple to remember
3. **Brand building**: Distinctive identity
4. **Flexibility**: Room to grow beyond initial function
5. **Personality**: Conveys character, not just function

### The Generic Trap

Descriptive names create problems:
- Sound like every competitor
- Hard to trademark
- Limit future expansion
- Lack personality
- Forgettable in conversation

## Characteristics of Good Names

### Short
- One or two words ideal
- Easy to type
- Quick to say
- Fits in logos

### Catchy
- Interesting sound
- Unique combination
- Slightly unexpected
- Pleasant to say

### Memorable
- Sticks after one hearing
- Easy to spell
- Distinctive pattern
- Creates mental image

## The Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Over-Description
- ProjectManagerPro
- TaskTrackerDeluxe
- CollaborationSuite
- TeamWorkflow

### Tech Jargon
- SyncroTech
- DataFlow
- CloudLogic
- NetSphere

### Forced Combinations
- Projecto
- Taskify
- Collaborator
- WorkFusion

### Committee Compromise
- Names that try to please everyone
- Acronyms from long descriptions
- Hybrid descriptive-creative disasters
- Safe, boring choices

## The Creative Process

### Starting Points
- Real words in new contexts (Basecamp)
- Object associations (Backpack)
- Activity references (Campfire)
- Simple combinations (Writeboard)

### Testing Criteria
- Say it out loud repeatedly
- Tell someone and see if they remember
- Check if it autocorrects wrongly
- Ensure international appropriateness

## Living with Domain Constraints

### Creative Solutions
- Add context words (now, app, HQ)
- Use variations (.io, .co)
- Embrace the modified version
- Make it part of the brand

### What Not to Do
- Don't let domain availability kill a great name
- Don't choose inferior name for perfect .com
- Don't hyphenate desperately
- Don't use numbers as letters

## The Long-term View

Good names age well because they:
- **Aren't tied to specific technology**
- **Don't limit product evolution**
- **Build brand equity over time**
- **Become more valuable with use**

## Common Naming Mistakes

### Process Errors
- Too many people involved
- Endless revision cycles
- Over-researching options
- Analysis paralysis

### Choice Errors  
- Choosing descriptive over memorable
- Following industry conventions
- Playing it too safe
- Copying competitor patterns

## The Confidence to Choose

"Pick a name that's short, catchy, and memorable and then run with it."

This requires:
- Trusting your judgment
- Accepting imperfection
- Moving forward boldly
- Committing fully

## International Considerations

While not mentioned in the chapter, modern naming should check:
- Cross-cultural meanings
- Pronunciation in key markets
- Trademark availability
- Social media handles

## The 37signals Pattern

Looking at their names:
- **Basecamp**: Evokes starting point, organization
- **Backpack**: Suggests portability, essentials
- **Campfire**: Implies gathering, warmth
- **Writeboard**: Simple function + object

All are concrete objects/places that create mental images while avoiding literal description.

## Making the Decision

Steps to follow:
1. Brainstorm freely without judgment
2. Filter for memorability
3. Check basic availability
4. Make quick decision
5. Commit and move forward

## The Bottom Line

Your name should:
- Be easy to remember
- Be easy to say
- Be easy to type
- Create positive associations
- Leave room to grow

Your name should not:
- Describe every feature
- Sound like competitors
- Require explanation
- Limit your future
- Please committees
