## Core Principle: Define Your One-Point Vision

"What does your app stand for? What's it really all about? Before you start designing or coding anything you need to know the purpose of your product — the vision. **Think big. Why does it exist? What makes it different than other similar products?**"

"This vision will guide your decisions and keep you on a consistent path. Whenever there's a sticking point, ask, **'Are we staying true to the vision?'**"

## The Power of Brevity

"Your vision should be brief too. **A sentence should be enough to get the idea across**. Here's the vision for each of our products:
- **Basecamp:** Project management is communication
- **Backpack:** Bring life's loose ends together
- **Campfire:** Group chat over IM sucks
- **Ta-da List:** Competing with a post-it note
- **Writeboard:** Word is overkill"

## Case Study: How Vision Shapes Product

"With Basecamp, for example, the vision was 'Project management is communication.' We felt strongly that **effective communication on a project leads to collective ownership, involvement, investment, and momentum**. It gets everyone on the same page working toward a common goal. We knew if Basecamp could accomplish this, everything else would fall in line."

### Vision Driving Features

"This vision led us to keep Basecamp as **open and transparent as possible**. Instead of limiting communication to within a firm, we gave clients access too. We thought **less about permissions and more about encouraging all participants to take part**. The vision is why we **skipped charts, graphs, tables, reports, stats, and spreadsheets** and instead focused on communication priorities like **messages, comments, to-do lists, and sharing files**."

### The Decision Framework

"**Make the big decision about your vision upfront and all your future little decisions become much easier.**"

## Mental Model: Whiteboard Philosophy

Dave Thomas (The Pragmatic Programmers) shares a powerful example:

"Andy Hunt and I once wrote a debit card transaction switch. A major requirement was that the user of a debit card shouldn't have the same transaction applied to their account twice. In other words, no matter what sort of failure mode might happen, the error should be on the side of not processing a transaction rather than processing a duplicate transaction."

"So, we wrote it on our shared whiteboard in big letters: **Err in favor of users.**"

"It joined about half-a-dozen other maxims. Jointly, these guided all those tricky decisions you make while building something complex. Together, these laws gave our application **strong internal coherence and great external consistency**."

## The Mantra Approach

Guy Kawasaki (author) reinforces this philosophy:

"Organizations need guideposts. They need an outline; employees need to know each day when they wake up why they're going to work. This outline should be **short and sweet, and all encompassing**: Why do you exist? What motivates you? I call this a **mantra** — a **three or four-word description of why you exist**."

### Basecamp: "Project management is communication"
- **Not about:** Charts, graphs, Gantt charts
- **Is about:** Messages, collaboration, transparency
- **Result:** Clients included, not excluded

### Campfire: "Group chat over IM sucks"
- **Enemy defined:** Existing IM solutions
- **Clear direction:** Fix what's broken
- **Focus:** Better group dynamics

### Ta-da List: "Competing with a post-it note"
- **Benchmark:** Physical simplicity
- **Constraint:** Can't be more complex than paper
- **Goal:** Digital with analog simplicity

### Writeboard: "Word is overkill"
- **Problem identified:** Too much software
- **Direction:** Strip away complexity
- **Target:** Essential writing only

## Decision-Making Through Vision

### When Facing Feature Decisions:
1. **Does this support our core vision?**
2. **Would this exist if we truly believe our vision?**
3. **Are we adding this because of our vision or despite it?**

### When Facing Design Choices:
1. **Which option better embodies our vision?**
2. **Does this make our vision clearer to users?**
3. **Are we staying true to why we exist?**

### When Facing Technical Trade-offs:
1. **Which path serves our vision?**
2. **Are we solving our core problem?**
3. **Does complexity serve the vision?**

## The Power of Negative Space

Notice what's NOT in these visions:
- No mention of features
- No technology specifications
- No market positioning
- No growth targets
- No competitor comparisons

**Just pure purpose.**

## Creating Your Own Vision

### What Makes a Good Vision:
- **Brief** - One sentence maximum
- **Clear** - No ambiguity
- **Differentiating** - Why you're unique
- **Actionable** - Guides decisions
- **Memorable** - Easy to internalize

### What to Avoid:
- Corporate mission statement language
- Feature lists disguised as vision
- Technology focus over user focus
- Committee-written compromise
- Generic could-be-anyone statements

## Vision as Daily Tool

### Not Just a Poster:
- Write it on the whiteboard
- Ask it in every meeting
- Use it to break ties
- Reference it in debates
- Let it kill features

### Living Document:
- Employees know it by heart
- Customers feel it in the product
- Decisions reflect it consistently
- Product evolves within its bounds
