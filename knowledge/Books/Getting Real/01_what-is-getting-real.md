## The Core Philosophy

"Want to build a successful web app? Then it's time to Get Real."

Getting Real is a **smaller, faster, better way to build software** that fundamentally rejects the traditional approach of building representations and instead focuses on building the actual thing.

## What Getting Real Really Means

Getting Real is about **skipping all the stuff that represents real** (charts, graphs, boxes, arrows, schematics, wireframes, etc.) and **actually building the real thing**.

### The "Less" Philosophy
Getting real is **less**. Less mass, less software, less features, less paperwork, less of everything that's not essential. And crucially: **most of what you think is essential actually isn't**.

This isn't just minimalism for its own sake—it's about staying **small and being agile**.

### Interface-First Thinking
Getting Real **starts with the interface, the real screens that people are going to use**. It begins with what the customer actually experiences and builds backwards from there. This approach lets you **get the interface right before you get the software wrong**.

## Why Getting Real Works Better

Getting Real delivers better results because it **forces you to deal with the actual problems you're trying to solve instead of your ideas about those problems**. It forces you to deal with **reality**.

### The Problem with Functional Specs
Getting Real **foregoes functional specs and other transitory documentation in favor of building real screens**. Here's their stark assessment:

- A functional spec is **make-believe**
- An functional spec is an **illusion of agreement** 
- An actual web page is **reality**—that's what your customers are going to see and use
- **That's what matters**

Getting Real gets you there faster, meaning you're **making software decisions based on the real thing instead of abstract notions**.

### Perfect for Web-Based Software
Getting Real is ideally suited to web-based software because **the old school model of shipping software in a box and then waiting a year or two to deliver an update is fading away**. Unlike installed software, **web apps can constantly evolve on a day-to-day basis**. Getting Real leverages this advantage for all its worth.

## The "Vigorous Software" Mental Model

37signals applies William Strunk Jr.'s writing principles to software:

> "Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that **every word tell**."

Applied to software: every feature, every screen, every option must **tell**—must serve a clear, essential purpose.

## What Getting Real Eliminates

**The old way:** "a lengthy, bureaucratic, we're-doing-this-to-cover-our-asses process." 
**The typical result:** "bloated, forgettable software dripping with mediocrity. Blech."

Getting Real gets rid of:
- Timelines that take months or even years
- Pie-in-the-sky functional specs
- Scalability debates
- Interminable staff meetings
- The "need" to hire dozens of employees
- Meaningless version numbers
- Pristine roadmaps that predict the perfect future
- Endless preference options
- Outsourced support
- Unrealistic user testing
- Useless paperwork
- Top-down hierarchy

### The Counter-Intuitive Truth
"You don't need tons of money or a huge team or a lengthy development cycle to build great software. Those things are the **ingredients for slow, murky, changeless applications**. Getting real takes the opposite approach."

## Beyond Software Applications

"While this book's emphasis is on building a web app, a lot of these ideas are applicable to non-software activities too." The principles work for:
- Starting a business
- Writing a book  
- Designing a web site
- Recording an album
- "a variety of other endeavors"

**Key insight:** "Once you start Getting Real in one area of your life, you'll see how these concepts can apply to a wide range of activities."

## Decision-Making Framework

When facing any development decision, Getting Real asks:
1. **Are we dealing with actual problems or our ideas about problems?**
2. **Are we building reality or make-believe?**
3. **Does this force us to deal with what customers will actually see and use?**
4. **Are we making decisions based on the real thing or abstract notions?**
