## Core Philosophy: Outside Money is Plan B

"The first priority of many startups is acquiring funding from investors. But remember, if you turn to outsiders for funding, **you'll have to answer to them too**. Expectations are raised. Investors want their money back — and quickly. The sad fact is **cashing in often begins to trump building a quality product**."

## The Modern Reality

"These days it doesn't take much to get rolling. **Hardware is cheap and plenty of great infrastructure software is open source and free**. And **passion doesn't come with a price tag**."

## The Constraint Framework

"So do what you can with the cash on hand. Think hard and determine what's really essential and what you can do without."

**Key Questions:**
- What can you do with **three people instead of ten**?
- What can you do with **$20k instead of $100k**?
- What can you do in **three months instead of six**?
- What can you do if you **keep your day job and build your app on the side**?

## Mental Model: Constraints Force Creativity

"Run on limited resources and you'll be forced to **reckon with constraints earlier and more intensely**. And that's a good thing. **Constraints drive innovation**."

### The Validation Benefit

"Constraints also force you to **get your idea out in the wild sooner rather than later** — another good thing. A month or two out of the gates you should have a pretty good idea of whether you're onto something or not."

### The Exit Strategy Advantage

"If you are, you'll be self-sustainable shortly and won't need external cash. If your idea's a lemon, it's time to go back to the drawing board. At least you know now as opposed to months (or years) down the road. And at least **you can back out easily**. **Exit plans get a lot trickier once investors are involved**."

## The Quality vs. Quick Buck Principle

"If you're creating software just to make a quick buck, **it will show**. Truth is a quick payout is pretty unlikely. So **focus on building a quality tool that you and your customers can live with for a long time**."

## Case Study: Two Paths Compared

Jake Walker's experience with one company funded (Disclive) vs. one bootstrapped (The Show):

### The Problems with Funding

"The root of all the problems wasn't raising money itself, but **everything that came along with it**. The expectations are simply higher. People start taking salary, and **the motivation is to build it up and sell it**, or find some other way for the initial investors to make their money back. In the case of the first company, we simply **started acting much bigger than we were** — out of necessity..."

### The Bootstrap Alternative

"[With The Show] we realized that we could **deliver a much better product with less costs, only with more time**. And we gambled with a bit of our own money that people would be willing to **wait for quality over speed**. But the company has stayed (and will likely continue to be) a small operation. And ever since that first project, we've been **fully self funded**. With just a bit of creative terms from our vendors, we've never really need to put much of our own money into the operation at all. And **the expectation isn't to grow and sell, but to grow for the sake of growth** and to continue to benefit from it financially."

## Key Mental Models

### 1. **Expectation Management**
- **With investors:** Build big, exit fast, answer to others
- **Self-funded:** Build sustainably, maintain control, grow organically

### 2. **Resource Constraints as Advantages**
- Force early validation
- Drive innovative solutions
- Maintain flexibility
- Enable easy pivoting

### 3. **Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs**
- Investors often push for speed over quality
- Self-funding allows quality-first approach
- Customers often prefer waiting for quality

### 4. **The "Acting Bigger" Trap**
- External money creates pressure to scale prematurely
- Forces artificial growth and complexity
- Distances you from actual customer needs

## Decision-Making Framework

### Before Seeking Funding, Ask:
1. **What's the minimum viable version we can build with current resources?**
2. **Can we validate the core concept without external money?**
3. **Are we solving a real problem or just building to impress investors?**
4. **Would investor expectations compromise our product vision?**
5. **Can we maintain our focus on quality with external pressure?**

### Red Flags for External Funding:
- Pressure to "act bigger" than you are
- Focus shifts from product quality to investor returns
- Timeline compression that compromises craftsmanship
- Loss of control over product direction
- Complex exit strategies that distract from building

### Green Flags for Self-Funding:
- Clear understanding of essential vs. nice-to-have features
- Willingness to start small and grow organically
- Focus on long-term sustainability over quick exits
- Direct customer feedback loops without investor interference
- Ability to pivot quickly based on real user needs

## Long-Term Strategy

### The Self-Funded Advantage:
- **Customer-driven growth:** Revenue comes from users, not investors
- **Quality focus:** Time to build things right
- **Organic scaling:** Grow at sustainable pace
- **Maintained vision:** Product decisions stay with creators
- **True validation:** Success measured by customer satisfaction, not investor metrics
