## Core Concept

**"Hire good writers."** If you are trying to decide between a few people to fill a position, always hire the better writer. It doesn't matter if that person is a designer, programmer, marketer, salesperson, or whatever, the writing skills will pay off.

## Why Writing Matters Everywhere

"Effective, concise writing and editing leads to effective, concise code, design, emails, instant messages, and more."

The universal applications:
- **Code**: Clear thinking produces clean code
- **Design**: Good writers understand user communication
- **Email**: Daily effectiveness depends on clear writing
- **Documentation**: Better writers create better docs
- **Customer Communication**: Every interaction improves

## Beyond Just Words

"Being a good writer is about more than words. Good writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. They think clearly. And those are the qualities you need."

## Mental Model: Writing as Universal Skill

**Traditional Thinking:** Writing is just for writers. Technical roles need technical skills.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Writing is thinking made visible. Good writing indicates good thinking across all disciplines.

### Decision Framework

When choosing between candidates:
1. **Who communicates most clearly?**
2. **Who can explain complex ideas simply?**
3. **Who shows organized thinking?**
4. **Who demonstrates empathy in their writing?**

### Key Insight

Clear writing reflects clear thinking. If someone can't write clearly, they probably can't think clearly either.

## The Organized Mind Connection

### Dustin J. Mitchell's Insight

"Good writing skills are an indicator of an organized mind which is capable of arranging information and argument in a systematic fashion and also helping (not making) other people understand things."

Writing skills spill over into:
- **Code quality**
- **Personal communications**
- **Instant messaging** (especially for remote collaboration)
- **Professionalism**
- **Reliability**

## Clear Writing, Clear Thinking

### Michael A. Covington's Wisdom

"Clear writing leads to clear thinking. You don't know what you know until you try to express it."

The character connection: "Good writing is partly a matter of character. Instead of doing what's easy for you, do what's easy for your reader."
