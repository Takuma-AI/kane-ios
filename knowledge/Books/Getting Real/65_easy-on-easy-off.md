## Core Concept

**Make signup and cancellation a painless process.** Make it as easy as possible to get in — and get out — of your app.

## The Easy On Principle

"If I'm a customer that wants to use your app, it should be a painless, no-brainer process."

### Implementation
- **Prominent signup**: "Provide a big, clear, signup button that pops and put it on each page of your marketing site"
- **Set expectations**: "Tell folks how easy it is: 'From sign-up to login in just 1 minute!'"
- **Always free option**: "There should always be a free option so customers can demo the app without entering credit card information"

## The Competition's Mistakes

"Some of our competitors require a call back, an appointment, or a special password in order to try their product. What's the deal with that? We let anyone try our apps for free at any time."

This highlights the friction that drives customers away.

## Mental Model: Trust Through Freedom

**Traditional Thinking:** Make it hard to leave to retain customers. Complex signups show seriousness.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Easy in and easy out builds trust. Freedom creates loyalty.

### Decision Framework

For signup/cancellation:
1. **How many steps can we remove?**
2. **What information is truly essential?**
3. **Can users try before providing payment?**
4. **Is leaving as easy as joining?**

### Key Insight

Customers stay because they want to, not because they're trapped.

## Signup Best Practices

"Keep the signup form as short as possible. Don't ask for stuff you don't need and don't throw a long daunting form at people."

Principles:
- **Minimal fields**: Only essentials
- **Clear value**: Why sign up?
- **No surprises**: Show what's next
- **Instant access**: No waiting
- **Free trial**: No credit card

## The Easy Off Principle

"The same principles hold true for the cancellation process. You never want to 'trap' people inside your product."

### 37signals Approach
"While we're sorry when people decide to cancel their Basecamp account, we never make that process intimidating or confusing."

Implementation: "'Cancel my account' is a link that's clear as day on a person's account page. There shouldn't be any email to send, special form to fill out, or questions to answer."

## Data Portability

"Also, make sure people can get their data out if they decide to leave. We make sure customers can easily export all messages and comments in XML format at any time. It's their data and they should be able to do with it what they want."

This recognizes:
- Data belongs to customers
- Portability reduces lock-in fear
- Export ability builds trust
- Ownership matters

## Building Trust

"This is crucial because giving people control over their information builds trust. You're giving them a bridge to their data island. You're allowing them to leave without penalty if they find a better offer. It's the right thing to do and it builds goodwill."

## Charlie O'Donnell on Exit Freedom

"Don't hold users against their will. If they want to leave, let them pick up with all of the content they created while they were on your site and leave…for free…"

His key insight: "You have to let the barn door open and focus on keeping your customers fed, so they want to come back, instead of coming back because they're stuck."

## The Psychology of Easy Exit

Why easy cancellation works:
1. **Reduces signup anxiety**: Know they can leave
2. **Builds confidence**: Company isn't desperate
3. **Shows respect**: Values customer choice
4. **Creates goodwill**: Even when leaving
5. **Enables returns**: Door stays open
