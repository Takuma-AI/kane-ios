## Core Concept

**"Work with prospective employees on a test-basis first."** It's one thing to look at a portfolio, résumé, code example, or previous work. It's another thing to actually work with someone.

## The Limitations of Traditional Hiring

Traditional hiring relies on:
- Portfolios that show polished end results
- Résumés that may embellish reality
- Code samples out of context
- Previous work done in different environments

**The problem:** None of these show you how someone actually works with your team, on your problems, in your environment.

## The Test Drive Approach

"Whenever possible, take potential new team members out for a 'test drive.'"

### The 37signals Method

"Before we hire anyone we give them a small project to chew on first."

What you learn from a test project:
- **How they handle the project**
- **How they communicate**
- **How they work**
- **Their actual skills in practice**

"Working with someone as they design or code a few screens will give you a ton of insight."

## Mental Model: Show, Don't Tell

**Traditional Thinking:** Evaluate people based on their credentials and past accomplishments.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Evaluate people based on actual work together on real problems.

### Decision Framework

When evaluating candidates:
1. **Can we see them solve our actual problems?**
2. **How do they communicate during the process?**
3. **Do they mesh with our team's style?**
4. **What's their work really like in practice?**

### Key Insight

The right vibe is obvious when you work together. Interviews and résumés can't capture this.

## Practical Implementation

### Time Investment

"Scheduling can be tough for this sort of thing but even if it's for just 20 or 40 hours, it's better than nothing."

Benefits of even short trials:
- **Immediate clarity** on fit
- **Mutual evaluation** opportunity
- **Risk reduction** for both sides
- **Real work** gets done

### Clear Outcomes

"If it's a good or bad fit, it will be obvious. And if not, both sides save themselves a lot of trouble and risk by testing out the situation first."

## Supporting Perspective

### Suzanne Falter-Barns on Virtual Assistants

"Try a small test assignment to start. Don't leap in with all of your work at once. Give your new [virtual assistant] a test project or two to work on and see how the chemistry develops."

Key advice:
- Start small
- Watch the chemistry develop
- Avoid rose-colored glasses
- Make it clear it's a test run

"In the beginning, it's too easy to gloss over potential problems with rose-colored glasses. Make it clear this is a test run."
