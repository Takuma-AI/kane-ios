## Core Concept

**Subscribe to news feeds about your competitors.** Subscribe to news feeds about both your product and your competitors (it's always wise to know the ways of one's enemy). Use services like PubSub, Technorati, Feedster, and others to stay up to date (for keywords, use company names and product names). With RSS, this constantly changing info will be delivered right to you so you're always up to speed.

## Mental Model: Strategic Awareness

**Traditional Thinking:** Focus only on your own product. Ignore competitors to avoid distraction.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Stay informed about the competitive landscape while maintaining your own vision.

For competitive monitoring:
1. **What are competitors doing?**
2. **What are people saying about them?**
3. **What can we learn?**

### Key Insight

Know your enemy's ways to compete effectively.
