## Ask People What They Don't Want

"Most software surveys and research questions are centered around what people want in a product. **'What feature do you think is missing?' 'If you could add just one thing, what would it be?' 'What would make this product more useful for you?'**"

## The Other Side of the Coin

"What about the other side of the coin? Why not ask people what they don't want? **'If you could remove one feature, what would it be?' 'What don't you use?' 'What gets in your way the most?'**"

## The Core Truth

"**More isn't the answer.** Sometimes the biggest favor you can do for customers is to **leave something out**."

## Mental Model: Innovation Through Subtraction

Steve Jobs reinforces this philosophy:

"**[Innovation] comes from saying no to 1,000 things** to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We're always thinking about new markets we could enter, but **it's only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important**."

â€”Steve Jobs, CEO, Apple

## Traditional vs. Subtractive Research

### Traditional Questions:
- What's missing?
- What should we add?
- What would make it better?
- What features do you want?
- How can we do more?

### Subtractive Questions:
- **What should we remove?**
- **What don't you use?**
- **What gets in your way?**
- **What's unnecessary?**
- **What confuses you?**

## Why Subtraction Matters

### Addition Problems:
- Feature bloat
- Complexity creep
- Confused users
- Slower performance
- Maintenance burden

### Subtraction Benefits:
- Clarity emerges
- Speed increases
- Focus sharpens
- Simplicity wins
- Core value shows

## The Mayo Metaphor

"Hold the Mayo" - Restaurant ordering analogy:
- Sometimes what you leave out matters most
- Customization through removal
- Not everyone wants everything
- Simplicity is a preference
- Less can be more

## Research Framework

### Ask Users:

**Removal Questions:**
1. "If you could remove one feature, what would it be?"
2. "What functionality do you never use?"
3. "What confuses you most?"
4. "What slows you down?"
5. "What feels unnecessary?"

**Friction Questions:**
1. "What gets in your way?"
2. "Where do you get stuck?"
3. "What annoys you?"
4. "What takes too long?"
5. "What's too complicated?"

## The Jobs Doctrine Applied

### Say No To:
- 1,000 things
- New markets (most)
- Feature requests (most)
- Complexity additions
- Scope creep

### To Focus On:
- **"Things that are really important"**
- Core functionality
- Essential features
- User success
- Product vision

## Implementation Strategy

### Survey Design:
- Balance addition and subtraction questions
- Make removal questions specific
- Ask about actual usage
- Focus on friction points
- Identify unused features

### Analysis Approach:
- Weight removal requests highly
- Look for common frustrations
- Identify feature overlap
- Find complexity sources
- Map user avoidance

## The Favor Framework

"Sometimes the biggest favor you can do for customers is to **leave something out**"

### Favors Through Omission:
- Simpler interface
- Faster learning
- Clearer purpose
- Better performance
- Reduced confusion

### Not Favors:
- Every requested feature
- Maximum flexibility
- All possible options
- Kitchen sink approach
- Complexity for edge cases

## Real-World Applications

### Product Decisions:
- Remove unused features
- Simplify workflows
- Eliminate confusion
- Reduce options
- Cut complexity

### Customer Research:
- Ask different questions
- Value subtraction insights
- Listen to frustrations
- Map actual usage
- Find the friction

## Cultural Insights & Communication Style
