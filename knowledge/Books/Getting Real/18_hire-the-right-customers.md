## The Counter-Intuitive Truth

"**The customer is not always right.** The truth is you have to sort out who's right and who's wrong for your app. The good news is that the internet makes finding the right people easier than ever."

## The Universal Pleasing Fallacy

"**If you try to please everyone, you won't please anyone**"

## Case Study: Basecamp's Focused Approach

"When we built Basecamp we **focused our marketing on design firms**. By narrowing our market this way, we made it more likely to **attract passionate customers who, in turn, would evangelize the product**. Know who your app is really intended for and focus on pleasing them."

## Mental Model: The Best Call We Ever Made

David Greiner (founder, Campaign Monitor) shares their defining decision:

"The decision to aim Campaign Monitor **strictly at the web design market** was the best call we ever made. It allowed us to easily identify which features would be genuinely useful and, more importantly, **which features to leave out**. Not only have we attracted **more customers by targeting a smaller group of people**, these customers all have similar needs which makes our job much easier. There are loads of features in Campaign Monitor that would be **useless to anyone but a web designer**."

### The Multiplication Effect

"Focusing on a core market also makes it much easier to **spread the word** about your software. Now that we have a tightly defined audience, we can **advertise where they frequent online**, publish articles they might find interesting, and generally **build a community around our product**."

## The Narrowing Paradox

### Traditional Logic:
- Cast a wide net to catch more fish
- Build features for every possible user
- Market to everyone who might buy
- Avoid excluding any potential customer

### Getting Real Logic:
- **Narrow targeting attracts more customers**
- **Specific features for specific people**
- **Market where your people already are**
- **Deliberately exclude wrong customers**

## Benefits of Customer Selection

### Product Development:
- **Clear feature priorities** - Know what to build
- **Know what to leave out** - Equally important
- **Similar user needs** - Easier to satisfy
- **Focused development** - No feature sprawl

### Marketing & Growth:
- **Natural evangelists** - Passionate users spread the word
- **Targeted advertising** - Know exactly where to reach them
- **Community building** - Shared interests create connections
- **Word-of-mouth** - Right customers attract more right customers

### Business Operations:
- **Easier support** - Similar problems, similar solutions
- **Clearer roadmap** - Consistent user feedback
- **Stronger product** - Not diluted by conflicting needs
- **Happier team** - Clear mission and purpose

## The "Wrong Customer" Problem

### Signs of Wrong Customers:
- Want to change your core vision
- Need features that conflict with simplicity
- Don't understand your approach
- Require you to be something you're not

### Cost of Wrong Customers:
- **Product dilution** - Features that confuse core users
- **Mission drift** - Losing sight of original vision
- **Team confusion** - Who are we building for?
- **Support burden** - Mismatched expectations

## Customer Selection Framework

### Questions to Identify Right Customers:

1. **Do they have the specific problem we're solving?**
   - Not a general problem, THE problem

2. **Do they value our approach?**
   - Not just features, but philosophy

3. **Will they evangelize to others like them?**
   - Natural word-of-mouth potential

4. **Do their needs align with our vision?**
   - Feature requests support core purpose

### How to Find Your Core Market:

1. **Start with yourself** - Who are you building for?
2. **Look for passion indicators** - Who gets excited about your approach?
3. **Identify common characteristics** - What do early adopters share?
4. **Test and refine** - Let usage data guide you
