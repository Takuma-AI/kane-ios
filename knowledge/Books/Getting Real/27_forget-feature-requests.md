## The Avalanche Reality

"Customers want everything under the sun. They'll **avalanche you with feature requests**. Just check out our product forums; The feature request category always trumps the others by a wide margin."

## The Constant Refrain

"We'll hear about **'this little extra feature'** or **'this can't be hard'** or **'wouldn't it be easy to add this'** or **'it should take just a few seconds to put it in'** or **'if you added this I'd pay twice as much'** and so on."

## The Right Attitude

"Of course we don't fault people for making requests. We encourage it and we want to hear what they have to say. Most everything we add to our products starts out as a customer request. But, as we mentioned before, **your first response should be a no**."

## The Radical Solution

"So what do you do with all these requests that pour in? Where do you store them? How do you manage them? **You don't. Just read them and then throw them away.**"

"Yup, **read them, throw them away, and forget them**. It sounds blasphemous but the ones that are important will **keep bubbling up anyway**. Those are the only ones you need to remember. Those are the **truly essential ones**. Don't worry about tracking and saving each request that comes in. **Let your customers be your memory**. If it's really worth remembering, **they'll remind you until you can't forget**."

## The Basecamp Learning Experience

"How did we come to this conclusion? When we first launched Basecamp we tracked every major feature request on a Basecamp to-do list. When a request was repeated by someone else we'd update the list with an extra hash mark (II or III or IIII, etc). We figured that one day we'd review this list and start working from the most requested features on down."

"But the truth is **we never looked at it again**. We already knew what needed to be done next because our customers **constantly reminded us** by making the same requests over and over again. There was **no need for a list** or lots of analysis because it was all happening in real time. **You can't forget what's important when you are reminded of it every day.**"

## The Final Warning

"And one more thing: Just because x number of people request something, doesn't mean you have to include it. Sometimes it's better to just **say no and maintain your vision** for the product."

## Mental Model: The Bubble-Up Principle

### Traditional Feature Management:
- Track every request
- Build complex databases
- Analyze request frequency
- Review lists periodically
- Implement by vote count

### The Getting Real Way:
- **Read and forget**
- **Trust the bubble-up**
- **Let repetition be your guide**
- **Customers as living memory**
- **Real-time prioritization**

## Why Tracking Doesn't Work

### The List Problem:
- **Never reviewed** - Too overwhelming
- **False precision** - Hash marks don't equal importance
- **Stale data** - Priorities change
- **Analysis paralysis** - Too much to process
- **Disconnected from reality** - List != actual need

### The Natural Solution:
- **Important requests repeat** - Can't be forgotten
- **Urgency self-organizes** - Most needed bubbles up
- **Fresh perspective** - Current needs, not old lists
- **Effortless prioritization** - Loudest = most important
- **Connected to users** - Direct feedback loop

## Customer Request Patterns

### What They Say:
- "This little extra feature"
- "This can't be hard"
- "Wouldn't it be easy"
- "Just a few seconds"
- "I'd pay twice as much"

### What It Means:
- They don't understand complexity
- They assume it's simple
- They underestimate effort
- They overvalue their need
- Price isn't the issue

## The Memory Framework

### Step 1: Receive
"We encourage it and want to hear"

### Step 2: Read
"Just read them"

### Step 3: Release
"Then throw them away"

### Step 4: Trust
"Important will keep bubbling up"

### Result:
"Can't forget what's important"

## Decision Framework

### When Requests Come In:

1. **Read with openness** - Understand the need
2. **Default to no** - First response
3. **Delete/forget** - Don't track
4. **Wait for patterns** - Let repetition emerge
5. **Act on persistence** - What keeps coming back

### What Makes a Request "Real":
- **Multiple people asking** - Not just one loud voice
- **Consistent repetition** - Keeps coming back
- **Clear problem solving** - Addresses real need
- **Aligns with vision** - Fits your product
- **Can't be ignored** - Becomes obvious

## The Power of Forgetting

### Benefits:
- **No maintenance overhead** - No lists to manage
- **Fresh perspective** - Each request judged anew
- **Natural prioritization** - Important stuff persists
- **Less analysis paralysis** - Can't overthink
- **Direct connection** - Users tell you real-time

### What You Avoid:
- Complex tracking systems
- Outdated priority lists
- Feature request debt
- Analysis without action
- False obligations

## The Vision Protection Clause

"Just because x number of people request something, **doesn't mean you have to include it**"

### This Means:
- **Popularity â‰  Right choice**
- **Vision trumps votes**
- **Quality over democracy**
- **Maintain product integrity**
- **Sometimes no is right**

## Real-World Application

### Daily Practice:
1. Customer emails request
2. Read and understand
3. Respond politely
4. Don't log it anywhere
5. Trust important will return

### Weekly Reality:
- Same requests keep appearing
- Patterns become obvious
- Priorities self-select
- No list consultation needed
- Action becomes clear
