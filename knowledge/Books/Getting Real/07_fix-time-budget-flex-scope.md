## Core Principle: Launch on Time and on Budget

"Here's an easy way to launch on time and on budget: **keep them fixed**. Never throw more time or money at a problem, just **scale back the scope**."

## The Myth of Triple Constraint

"There's a myth that goes like this: we can launch **on time, on budget, and on scope**. It almost never happens and **when it does quality often suffers**."

## The Reality-Based Approach

"If you can't fit everything in within the time and budget allotted then **don't expand the time and budget**. Instead, **pull back the scope**. There's always time to add stuff later — **later is eternal, now is fleeting**."

### Quality vs. Scope Trade-off

"Launching something **great that's a little smaller in scope** than planned is better than launching something **mediocre and full of holes** because you had to hit some magical time, budget, and scope window. **Leave the magic to Houdini**. You've got a real business to run and a real product to deliver."

## The Three Benefits of Fixed Time/Budget, Flexible Scope

### 1. **Prioritization**
"You have to **figure out what's really important**. What's going to make it into this initial release? This forces a constraint on you which will **push you to make tough decisions instead of hemming and hawing**."

### 2. **Reality**
"**Setting expectations is key**. If you try to fix time, budget, and scope, you won't be able to deliver at a high level of quality. Sure, you can probably deliver something, but is **'something' what you really want to deliver?**"

### 3. **Flexibility**
"The ability to change is key. Having everything fixed makes it tough to change. **Injecting scope flexibility will introduce options based on your real experience building the product**. Flexibility is your friend."

## The Half Product Philosophy

"Our recommendation: **Scope down**. It's better to make **half a product than a half-assed product** (more on this later)."

This isn't about delivering less value—it's about delivering focused, high-quality value.

## Mental Model: Incremental Failure

> "How does a project get to be a year behind schedule? **One day at a time**."
> —Fred Brooks, software engineer and computer scientist

This highlights how small scope creeps and timeline extensions accumulate into massive delays.

## Decision-Making Framework

### When Facing Scope Pressure:

**Traditional Response (Wrong):**
- "We need more time to fit everything in"
- "Let's expand the budget to hire more people"
- "We can't launch without feature X, Y, and Z"

**Getting Real Response (Right):**
- "What's the core value we're delivering?"
- "What can we move to version 2?"
- "How do we deliver something great within our constraints?"

### Prioritization Questions:
1. **What's the minimum viable version that delivers real value?**
2. **Which features are essential vs. nice-to-have?**
3. **What can we learn from shipping a smaller scope first?**
4. **How do we maintain quality while reducing scope?**

## The Psychology of Constraints

### Why Fixed Scope Fails:
- **Perfectionism:** "It's not ready until it has everything"
- **Fear of shipping:** "What if people think it's incomplete?"
- **Feature creep:** "Just one more small addition..."
- **Stakeholder pressure:** "But we promised feature X!"

### Why Flexible Scope Works:
- **Forces real prioritization:** Can't delay tough decisions
- **Enables learning:** Ship, learn, iterate
- **Maintains quality:** Better to do less well than more poorly
- **Creates momentum:** Shipping something beats shipping nothing

## Real-World Application

### Before Project Starts:
- Set fixed time and budget boundaries
- Identify minimum viable scope
- Establish scope flexibility agreements with stakeholders
- Define quality standards that cannot be compromised

### During Development:
- Regular scope reality checks
- Ruthless prioritization of new requests
- Move non-essential features to "later" bucket
- Maintain quality standards while reducing scope

### At Launch:
- Ship something great, even if smaller than originally planned
- Use real user feedback to guide next iterations
- Build on solid foundation rather than shaky comprehensive attempt

## The "Later is Eternal" Principle

"There's always time to add stuff later — **later is eternal, now is fleeting**."

This reframes the urgency around scope. Missing a launch window is often more damaging than launching with reduced scope. You can always add features, but you can't recapture a missed opportunity.

## Warning Signs

### Scope Creep Indicators:
- "Just one more quick feature"
- "It won't take long to add..."
- "We can't launch without..."
- Timeline extensions becoming routine
- Quality compromises to fit scope

### Healthy Scope Management:
- Regular "what can we cut?" discussions
- Clear distinction between must-have and nice-to-have
- Willingness to disappoint some stakeholders
- Focus on core user value over comprehensive feature sets
