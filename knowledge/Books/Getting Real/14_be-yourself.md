## The Fundamental Mistake

"A lot of small companies make the mistake of trying to act big. It's as if they perceive their size as a weakness that needs to be covered up. **Too bad.** Being small can actually be a **huge advantage**, especially when it comes to communication."

## The Small Company Advantages

"Small companies enjoy **fewer formalities, less bureaucracy, and more freedom**. Smaller companies are **closer to the customer by default**. That means they can communicate in a more direct and personal way with customers. If you're small, you can use **familiar language instead of jargon**. Your site and your product can have a **human voice instead of sounding like a corporate drone**. Being small means you can **talk with your customers, not down to them**."

## Internal Communication Benefits

"There are also advantages to internal communications at small companies too. You can **ditch formalities**. There's no need for arduous processes and multiple sign-offs on everything. Everyone in the process can **speak openly and honestly**. This **unfettered flow of ideas** is one of the big advantages of staying small."

## Mental Model: Proudly, Defiantly Truthful

Khoi Vinh (Subtraction.com and co-founder of Behavior LLC) shares hard-won wisdom:

"Though you may think that a customer can be fooled by exaggerations on the number of staffers in your company or the breadth of your offerings, **the smart ones, the ones you really want, will always learn the truth** â€“ whether through intuition or deduction. Embarrassingly, I've been a part of white lies like this in the past, and none of those situations ever resulted in what matters most to a business: **meaningful, lasting and mutually beneficial relationships** with people who had a real need for the services offered. The better course would have been to be **proudly, defiantly truthful** about the exact size and breadth of the company."

## Case Study: Radical Accessibility

Edward Knittel (Director of Sales and Marketing, KennelSource) demonstrates extreme transparency:

"No matter what business you are in, good customer service has got to be the biggest request that any client will ever make. We demand it for the services we use so why would we think our customers would be any different? From the very beginning we made it **easy and transparent** for our customers to get in touch with us for any number or questions they might have. On our website we **list a toll-free number that forwards to our mobile phones** and on our business cards **each of us list our mobile numbers**. We emphasize to our customers that they can **get in touch with us any time** no matter what the problem might be. Our customers appreciate this level of trust and **no one has ever abused this service**."

## The Communication Transformation

### From Corporate to Human:

**Instead of:** "Our enterprise solution leverages synergies..."  
**Try:** "Our app helps you work better together..."

**Instead of:** "Please submit a support ticket..."  
**Try:** "Call us anytime - here's our mobile..."

**Instead of:** "Our robust team of professionals..."  
**Try:** "The three of us who built this..."

## Decision-Making Framework

### Authenticity Checklist:

1. **Language Audit**
   - Are we using jargon to sound bigger?
   - Can a regular person understand our copy?
   - Does our voice sound human or corporate?

2. **Process Review**
   - What formalities exist just for appearance?
   - Where do we have sign-offs that slow us down?
   - How can we be more direct?

3. **Customer Communication**
   - Are we accessible or hiding behind forms?
   - Do we talk with or down to customers?
   - How transparent are we being?

4. **Size Honesty**
   - Are we pretending to be bigger than we are?
   - Do we celebrate or hide our small size?
   - Are we using size as an advantage?

## The Trust Equation

### Being Small + Being Honest = Customer Trust

**The Paradox:** Customers often prefer small companies but companies try to appear big

**The Reality:** 
- Smart customers value direct access
- People want to talk to real humans
- Authenticity builds lasting relationships
- Trust comes from transparency

## Practical Applications

### External Communications:
- **Write like you talk** - Conversational, not corporate
- **Give direct access** - Real phone numbers, real people
- **Admit your size** - "The three of us" not "our team"
- **Be responsive** - Small means fast

### Internal Operations:
- **Skip the bureaucracy** - Direct decisions
- **Encourage honest talk** - No corporate speak
- **Move quickly** - No sign-off chains
- **Stay flat** - No artificial hierarchy

### Customer Service:
- **Personal phone numbers** - Radical accessibility
- **Any time contact** - Trust customers not to abuse
- **Human responses** - Not form letters
- **Quick resolution** - No department transfers

## The Competitive Advantage of Being Small

### What Big Companies Can't Do:
- Give personal cell phone numbers
- Make decisions instantly
- Change course quickly
- Know every customer personally
- Speak without legal review

### What Small Companies Shouldn't Do:
- Hide behind corporate facades
- Create fake departments
- Use meaningless jargon
- Add unnecessary process
- Pretend to be bigger

## Cultural Insights & Communication Style
