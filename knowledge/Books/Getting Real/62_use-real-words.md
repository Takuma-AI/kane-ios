## Core Concept

**Insert actual text instead of lorem ipsum.** Lorem ipsum dolor is a trusted friend of designers. Dummy text helps people get what the design will look like once it's fleshed out. But dummy text can be dangerous too.

## The Lorem Ipsum Problem

"Lorem ipsum changes the way copy is viewed. It reduces text-based content to a visual design element — a shape of text — instead of what it should be: valuable information someone is going to have to enter and/or read."

The fundamental issues:
- **Hides variations**: "Dummy text means you won't see the inevitable variations that show up once real information is entered"
- **Masks experience**: "It means you won't know what it's like to fill out forms on your site"
- **Creates false reality**: "Dummy text is a veil between you and reality"

## Why Real Copy Matters

"You need real copy to know how long certain fields should be. You need real copy to see how tables will expand or contract. You need real copy to know what your app truly looks like."

## Mental Model: Design with Reality

**Traditional Thinking:** Lorem ipsum lets us focus on visual design without content distractions.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Real content IS the design. You can't separate them.

### Decision Framework

When designing:
1. **What will real users actually type?**
2. **How will real data affect layout?**
3. **What edge cases will appear?**
4. **How does it feel to enter real information?**

### Key Insight

Design decisions based on fake content lead to interfaces that break with real content.

## The Practice of Real Content

"As soon as you can, use real and relevant words. If your site or application requires data input, enter the real deal."

**Critical detail**: "And actually type in the text — don't just paste it in from another source."

Examples:
- **Name fields**: Type a real name
- **City fields**: Type a real city  
- **Passwords**: Type it twice if repeated

## The Garbage Data Trap

"Sure, it's easier to just run down the forms and fill the fields with garbage ('asdsadklja' '123usadfjasld' 'snaxn2q9e7') in order to plow through them quickly."

**But**: "That's not real. That's not what your customers are going to do."

**The key question**: "Is it really smart to take a shortcut when customers are forced to take the long road?"

## Experience Through Doing

"When you just enter fake copy in rapid-fire fashion, you don't know what it really feels like to fill out that form."

The solution: "Do as your customers do and you'll understand them better. When you understand them better, and feel what they feel, you'll build a better interface."

## Tom Smith on Lorem Ipsum Garbage

"By not having the imagination to imagine what the content 'might' be, a design consideration is lost."

The cascade of problems:
1. **Meaning becomes obfuscated** because "it's just text"
2. **Understandability gets compromised** because nobody realized text was meant to be read
3. **Opportunities get lost** because lorem ipsum didn't suggest possibilities
4. **Text gets made really small** to create "lovely white space"

## Real Content Reveals

### Field Length Issues
- Names longer than expected
- Addresses that wrap
- Titles that truncate
- Numbers that overflow

### Layout Problems  
- Tables that break
- Columns that misalign
- Text that overlaps
- Spacing that fails

### Usability Issues
- Confusing field labels
- Unclear requirements
- Poor error messages
- Bad flow

### Edge Cases
- International names
- Special characters
- Empty states
- Maximum lengths

## The Design Process Impact

### With Lorem Ipsum
1. Design looks perfect
2. Implementation begins
3. Real content breaks design
4. Costly redesigns needed
5. Compromises made

### With Real Words
1. Design adapts to content
2. Problems found early
3. Solutions built in
4. Implementation smoother
5. Better end result

## Types of Real Content

### User Input
- Actual names
- Real addresses
- True email formats
- Realistic passwords
- Genuine comments

### System Content
- Real error messages
- Actual notifications
- True help text
- Genuine instructions
- Real confirmations

### Dynamic Content
- Actual product names
- Real prices
- True descriptions
- Genuine reviews
- Real timestamps

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Create realistic test data** early
2. **Use actual content** from day one
3. **Test with extremes** (shortest/longest)
4. **Include international** examples
5. **Feel the experience** yourself

## Common Excuses Debunked

### "Content isn't ready yet"
Use realistic placeholder content

### "Lorem ipsum is faster"
Short-term gain, long-term pain

### "We'll fix it later"
Later never comes cleanly

### "It's just for the mockup"
Mockups become reality

## Benefits of Real Words

1. **Authentic design**: Fits actual use
2. **Early problem detection**: Find issues before coding
3. **Better empathy**: Feel user experience
4. **Accurate testing**: Real scenarios
5. **Honest presentation**: No surprises

## The International Consideration

Real words expose:
- Character encoding issues
- Text direction problems
- Length variations
- Cultural differences
- Translation challenges

## Creating a Real Content Culture

### Do
- Keep sample content libraries
- Test with actual user data
- Type in forms yourself
- Use production content when possible
- Think globally

### Don't
- Use lorem ipsum
- Test with "asdf"
- Ignore edge cases
- Assume content will fit
- Design in isolation

## The Bottom Line

Every design decision should be tested against real content. If it doesn't work with actual words, it doesn't work.
