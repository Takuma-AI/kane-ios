# Chapter 83: One Month Tuneup

**Book:** Getting Real  
**Section:** Post-Launch  
**Mental Model:** Process & Execution  
**Tags:** #product-iteration #launch-strategy #momentum #customer-feedback #agile-development

## Core Concept

**Issue a major update 30 days after launch.** A quick update shows momentum. It shows you're listening. It shows you've got more tricks up your sleeve. It gives you a second wave of buzz. It reaffirms initial good feelings. It gives you something to talk about and others to blog about.

## Mental Model: Sustained Momentum

**Traditional Thinking:** Launch with everything perfect. Major updates come months or years later.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Launch with core features, then quickly demonstrate progress and responsiveness.

### Decision Framework

For the one-month update:
1. **What did customers request most?**
2. **What can we deliver quickly?**
3. **What shows we're listening?**
4. **What generates excitement?**

### Key Insight

The second impression is almost as important as the first.

## The Multiple Benefits

A one-month update delivers:
1. **Shows momentum** - You're actively developing
2. **Shows you're listening** - Customer feedback matters
3. **Shows depth** - "More tricks up your sleeve"
4. **Creates buzz** - Second wave of attention
5. **Reaffirms feelings** - Initial enthusiasm renewed
6. **Provides content** - Something new to discuss

## The Launch Strategy Evolution

"Knowing a quick upgrade is coming also lets you put the focus on the most crucial components before launch."

This enables:
- **Tighter initial focus**
- **Earlier launch date**
- **Clearer priorities**
- **Less feature pressure**
- **Better core quality**

"Instead of trying to squeeze in a few more things, you can start by perfecting just the core feature set."

## The Real-World Testing Phase

"Then you can 'air out' the product in the real world."

Benefits of this approach:
- **Actual usage data**
- **Real user feedback**
- **Unexpected use cases**
- **Priority validation**
- **Bug discovery**

"Once it's out there you can start getting customer feedback and you'll know which areas require attention next."

## The Backpack Case Study

"This baby-step approach worked well for Backpack."

The execution:
1. **Launched base product** first
2. **Gathered customer feedback**
3. **Identified top requests**
4. **Delivered quickly**

"A few weeks later, added features like Backpack Mobile for handhelds and tagging since those things are what our customers told us they wanted most."
