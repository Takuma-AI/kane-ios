# Chapter 61: Tell Me a Quick Story

**Tags:** #user-stories #communication #documentation #requirements #agile

## Core Concept

**Write stories, not details.** If you do find yourself requiring words to explain a new feature or concept, write a brief story about it. Don't get into the technical or design details, just tell a quick story. Do it in a human way, like you would in normal conversation.

## The Story Approach

Key principles for story writing:
- **Keep it brief**: "It doesn't need to be an essay"
- **Focus on flow**: "Just give the flow of what happens"
- **Use context**: "If you can include the brief story in context with screens you are developing, all the better"

## Mental Model: Human Communication

**Traditional Thinking:** Document every technical detail and edge case comprehensively.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Tell a simple human story about what happens. Details come later.

### Decision Framework

When explaining features:
1. **What's the user's journey?**
2. **What happens in simple terms?**
3. **Can we show this alongside screens?**
4. **Are we talking like humans?**

### Key Insight

Stories create shared understanding better than specifications create precision.

## Strategy Over Tactics

"Stick to the experience instead of getting hung up on the details. Think strategy, not tactics."

This hierarchy matters:
- **Strategy**: What we're trying to achieve
- **Experience**: How it feels to use
- **Details**: Specific implementation
- **Tactics**: Technical minutiae

"The tactics will fall into place once you begin building that part of your app. Right now you just want to get a story going that will initiate conversation and get you on the right track."

## Why Stories Work

### 1. Natural Communication
- People understand narratives
- Flows are easier to grasp
- Context provides meaning
- Conversations feel natural

### 2. Flexibility Built In
- Details can evolve
- Implementation stays open
- Changes are expected
- Discovery is enabled

### 3. Focus on Experience
- User journey matters most
- Technical details secondary
- Emotion and flow central
- Purpose stays clear

## Story Structure

A good feature story includes:
1. **Who**: The user/persona
2. **Context**: Starting situation
3. **Action**: What they do
4. **Result**: What happens
5. **Value**: Why it matters

## Examples of Quick Stories

### Bad: Technical Specification
"The system shall provide a boolean flag allowing users to toggle between public and private visibility states for uploaded documents with granular permission controls."

### Good: Quick Story
"Sarah uploads a design document. She wants only her team to see it, so she clicks 'Make Private.' Now only invited team members can view it. Later, when the design is final, she can make it public for clients."

## Story vs. Specification

### Stories Provide
- Human context
- Clear flow
- Emotional connection
- Conversation starters
- Flexible interpretation

### Specifications Provide
- Technical precision
- Edge case handling
- Implementation details
- Rigid requirements
- Complete coverage

Choose stories for understanding, specs only when absolutely necessary.

## The Context Connection

"And if you can include the brief story in context with screens you are developing, all the better."

Ways to add context:
- Annotate mockups with stories
- Show story flow across screens
- Connect narrative to visuals
- Use real scenarios

## Story-Driven Development

1. **Start with story**: What should happen?
2. **Create screens**: Show the flow
3. **Build feature**: Make it real
4. **Refine through use**: Discover details
5. **Document if needed**: Only what's essential

## Common Story Patterns

### Feature Introduction
"When [user] wants to [goal], they [action]. This lets them [benefit]."

### Problem Solution
"Currently [problem]. With this feature, [solution]. Now users can [new capability]."

### Workflow Description
"First [step 1]. Then [step 2]. Finally [step 3]. The result is [outcome]."

## Initiating Conversation

Stories are conversation starters:
- Raise questions naturally
- Invite clarification
- Encourage exploration
- Build shared vision

## The Right Track

"Right now you just want to get a story going that will initiate conversation and get you on the right track."

Being on track means:
- Shared understanding
- Clear direction
- Open possibilities
- Forward momentum

## When Stories Aren't Enough

Sometimes you need more:
- Legal requirements
- API specifications
- Data formats
- Security protocols

But start with stories even for these.

## Story Quality Checklist

Good stories are:
- **Brief**: One paragraph maximum
- **Clear**: No jargon needed
- **Human**: Natural language
- **Flowing**: Show progression
- **Valuable**: Explain why

## Benefits of Story-First

1. **Faster alignment**: Everyone understands
2. **Better feedback**: Natural responses
3. **Easier changes**: Not locked in
4. **Clearer purpose**: Why over how
5. **Human focus**: Users over systems

## Evolution of Stories

Stories naturally evolve:
1. Initial story sets direction
2. Building reveals details
3. Usage refines understanding
4. Final product embodies story
5. Documentation captures learnings

## Story Templates

### Basic Feature Story
"As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]."

### Scenario Story
"When [situation], I need to [action] because [reason]."

### Problem Story
"Currently [problem description]. I wish I could [desired solution]."
