# Chapter 4: Build Less

**Book:** Getting Real

**Mental Model:** Competitive Strategy  
**Tags:** #competition #strategy #simplicity #underdoing #leadership

## Core Concept

Beat competitors by doing **less**, not more. One-down instead of one-up. Underdo instead of outdo.

## The Problem with "One-Upping"

### Traditional Cold War Mentality
- If they have 4 features → you need 5 (or 15, or 25)
- If they spend X → you need XX
- If they have 20 → you need 30

### Why This Fails
- **Expensive** - resource drain
- **Defensive** - reactive instead of proactive  
- **Paranoid** - fear-based decision making
- **Backward-thinking** - can't lead, only follow

## The "Less" Strategy

### What Less Means
- **Less features** - focus on core value
- **Less options/preferences** - reduce decision fatigue
- **Less people and corporate structure** - stay agile
- **Less meetings and abstractions** - more doing
- **Less promises** - under-promise, over-deliver

### Strategic Advantage
- **Solve simple problems** - leave complex ones to competitors
- **Focus on clarity** - while others struggle with complexity
- **Move faster** - less coordination overhead
- **Higher quality** - attention to fewer things

## Mental Model: Competitive Underdoing

**Traditional Logic:** Match competitors feature-for-feature  
**Getting Real Logic:** Solve customer problems simpler than competitors

### Decision Framework
When evaluating competitive responses:
1. **What's the core problem being solved?**
2. **Can we solve it more simply?**
3. **What can we eliminate while keeping value?**
4. **How does this help us lead vs. follow?**

## Leadership vs. Following

### Followers Think:
- "What are competitors doing?"
- "How can we match their features?"
- "What if we fall behind?"

### Leaders Think:
- "What do customers actually need?"
- "How can we solve this more elegantly?"
- "What can we eliminate?"

## Applications

### Product Development
- Choose fewer features, execute them better
- Solve 90% of use cases perfectly vs. 100% poorly

### Team Building  
- Small, focused teams vs. large, coordinated ones
- Clear roles vs. complex hierarchies

### Process Design
- Simple workflows vs. comprehensive procedures
- Fast decisions vs. consensus building
