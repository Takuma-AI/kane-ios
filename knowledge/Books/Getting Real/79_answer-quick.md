## Core Concept

**Quick turnaround time on support queries should be a top priority.** Customers light up when you answer their questions quickly. They're so used to canned responses that show up days later (if at all) that you can really differentiate yourself from competitors by offering a thoughtful response right away.

## The 37signals Standard

"During business hours, we answer 90% of all email support requests within 90 minutes — and often within a half-hour. And people love it."

This sets a benchmark:
- **90% response rate** within 90 minutes
- **Often within 30 minutes**
- **During business hours**
- **Thoughtful responses**, not canned

## Mental Model: Speed as Service

**Traditional Thinking:** Take time to craft perfect responses. Queue tickets by priority. Efficiency over speed.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Quick, genuine responses build more goodwill than perfect but delayed answers.

### Decision Framework

For support responses:
1. **Can we answer something now?**
2. **Is partial information helpful?**
3. **Will delay frustrate more than imperfection?**
4. **How can we show we care immediately?**

### Key Insight

Speed itself communicates care and attention better than perfection delivered late.

## The Imperfect Response Strategy

"Even if you don't have a perfect answer, say something."

This acknowledges:
- **Something beats nothing**
- **Acknowledgment matters**
- **Perfect is enemy of good**
- **Communication builds trust**

### Example Response
"We hear what you're saying and we'll be working on it in the future."

This works because it:
- Shows you're listening
- Acknowledges the issue
- Sets realistic expectations
- Maintains dialogue

## The Psychology of Quick Response

"You can buy goodwill with a response that is delivered quickly in an open, honest way."

Why speed matters:
1. **Breaks expectations** (positively)
2. **Shows priority** on customers
3. **Reduces anxiety** about being heard
4. **Builds trust** through action
5. **Differentiates** from competitors

## Emotional Transformation

"Customers appreciate directness and will often shift from angry to polite if you respond quickly and in a straight-shooting manner."

The transformation:
- **Angry customer** → Quick response → **Appreciative customer**
- **Frustrated user** → Fast acknowledgment → **Patient partner**
- **Confused person** → Immediate help → **Loyal advocate**

## Diffusing Negative Situations

"It's a great way to diffuse a potentially negative situation."

Quick responses prevent:
- Escalation of frustration
- Public complaints
- Negative reviews
- Lost customers
- Damaged reputation

## Michael Reining's Implementation

From Blinklist co-founder:

"At Blinklist, every single customer email is answered, usually within the first hour (unless we happen to be asleep)."

Their philosophy extends beyond email:
"We also have an online forum and we make sure that every single post and comment gets acknowledged."

## The Army of Many Philosophy

"How can a small team of just three developers create an innovative product and successfully compete with the big guys? The answer is to enlist an army of many."

Key insight: "Your customers are your most important asset and that they are absolutely vital to your long-term success so treat your community of users like royalty."

## The Small Team Advantage

"The way to compete with the big guys is by starting small and paying attention to every one of your customers."

What customers become:
- **Bug reporters**: "First to alert you of bugs"
- **Need identifiers**: "First to alert you of needs"
- **Evangelists**: "Carry the flag and spread your message"

## The Imperfection Permission

"This does not mean that your product has to be perfect when you launch. Quite to the contrary, release early and often."

But the key: "However, when your customers encounter bugs, make sure to send a reply to them quickly thanking them for their input."

## Customer Expectations Reality

"Customers don't expect your product to be perfect and they don't expect that all of their features will be implemented."

What they DO expect: "However, customers do expect that you are listening and acknowledging that you care, so show that you care."

## The Large Company Deficit

"This is one area where most large companies show a huge deficit so develop a sense of community early."

Your advantage:
- Personal responses
- Quick turnaround
- Genuine care
- Direct connection
- Human touch

## Developer Involvement

"All of our developers receive our customer feedback and they are active participants in the online discussion forums."

This creates:
- Direct feedback loops
- Better product understanding
- Stronger empathy
- Faster solutions
- Community connection

Result: "This way, we are slowly but surely building an active and loyal BlinkList community."
