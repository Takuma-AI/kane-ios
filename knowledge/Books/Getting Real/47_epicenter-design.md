## Core Concept

**Start from the core of the page and build outward.** Epicenter design focuses on the true essence of the page — the epicenter — and then builds outward. This means that, at the start, you ignore the extremities: the navigation/tabs, footer, colors, sidebar, logo, etc. Instead, you start at the epicenter and design the most important piece of content first.

## Defining the Epicenter

"Whatever the page absolutely can't live without is the epicenter."

**Example:** "If you're designing a page that displays a blog post, the blog post itself is the epicenter. Not the categories in the sidebar, not the header at the top, not the comment form at the bottom, but the actual blog post unit. Without the blog post unit, the page isn't a blog post."

## The Progressive Design Process

1. **Start with the epicenter** - The absolute essential element
2. **Add the second most critical element** - Only after the first is complete
3. **Continue outward** - Third most critical, and so on
4. **Frame comes last** - Navigation, sidebars, footers added at the end

## Mental Model: Inside-Out Design

**Traditional Thinking:** Build the frame first, then pour content into whatever space remains.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Start with what matters most and let the frame form around it.

### Decision Framework

For every page or screen:
1. **What can this page absolutely not live without?**
2. **If we could only show one thing, what would it be?**
3. **What's the core user need here?**
4. **How can we best serve that need before anything else?**

### Key Insight

Design from the inside out. The content defines the container, not vice versa.

## The Problem with Frame-First Design

"Epicenter design eschews the traditional 'let's build the frame then drop the content in' model."

Traditional process problems:
1. **Page shape is built first**
2. **Navigation is included**
3. **Marketing "stuff" is inserted**
4. **Core functionality is poured into whatever space remains**

"It's a backwards process that takes what should be the top priority and saves it for the end."

## Benefits of Epicenter Design

### 1. Focus on What Matters
"Epicenter design flips that process and allows you to focus on what really matters on day one."

### 2. Clear Priorities
"Essentials first, extras second."

### 3. Better User Experience
"The result is a more friendly, focused, usable screen for customers."

### 4. Immediate Collaboration
"It allows you to start the dialogue between designer and developer right away instead of waiting for all aspects of the page to fall in line first."

## Real-World Applications

### Blog Post Page
- **Epicenter**: The post content
- **Second**: Post metadata (author, date)
- **Third**: Comments
- **Last**: Navigation, sidebar, related posts

### E-commerce Product Page
- **Epicenter**: Product image and buy button
- **Second**: Price and key details
- **Third**: Detailed specifications
- **Last**: Navigation, recommendations

### Dashboard
- **Epicenter**: Primary metric or status
- **Second**: Supporting data
- **Third**: Actions and controls
- **Last**: Navigation framework

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Identify the Epicenter
- What's the one thing users come here for?
- What would make this page worthless if removed?
- What's the primary user goal?

### Step 2: Design in Isolation
- Create the epicenter element alone
- Perfect it without distractions
- Ensure it works standalone

### Step 3: Add Supporting Elements
- Only what directly supports the epicenter
- Each addition must justify itself
- Stop when you have enough

### Step 4: Frame Thoughtfully
- Add navigation last
- Keep chrome minimal
- Don't let frame overshadow content

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Over-Framing
- Too much navigation
- Excessive sidebars
- Marketing clutter
- Feature creep in chrome

### Lost Focus
- Epicenter gets buried
- Too many "important" things
- Equal weight to all elements
- Design by committee

### Premature Optimization
- Worrying about edge cases first
- Building for maybes
- Over-designing secondary elements

## The Power of Constraints

Epicenter design creates useful constraints:
- Forces prioritization
- Prevents feature creep
- Maintains user focus
- Speeds decision-making

## Epicenter Design in Practice

### Questions to Ask
- Can users accomplish their goal with just the epicenter?
- Does each addition improve or distract?
- Are we adding this because it's needed or expected?
- Would removing this hurt the core experience?

### Signs of Success
- Page purpose is immediately clear
- Users can act without hunting
- Design feels focused, not cluttered
- Core action is prominent

## Connection to Broader Philosophy

Epicenter design embodies Getting Real principles:
- **Build less**: Focus on essential
- **Start with no**: Add only what's necessary
- **Interface first**: User needs drive design
- **Ignore details early**: Perfect the core before the periphery
