## Core Concept

**Get advance buzz and signups going ASAP.** We've already touched on it but it bears repeating: Get some sort of site up and start collecting emails as soon as possible.

## The Simple Formula

"Pick your domain name and put up a logo and maybe a sentence or two that describes, or at least hints at, what your app will do. Then let people give you their email address."

Components needed:
- Domain name
- Logo
- Brief description (1-2 sentences)
- Email signup form

"Now you're on your way to having a foundation of folks ready and waiting to be notified of your launch."

## Mental Model: Pre-Launch Momentum

**Traditional Thinking:** Build everything in secret, then launch and hope people find you.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Start building your audience before you have a product to sell.

### Decision Framework

For early solicitation:
1. **How early can we start collecting interest?**
2. **What's the minimum needed to convey value?**
3. **How do we make signing up frictionless?**
4. **What creates anticipation without overselling?**

### Key Insight

Your future customers can be gathered before your product exists.

## Why This Works

### 1. Building Anticipation

## The Compound Effect

Early email collection creates:

2. **They tell others** about coming product
3. **List grows organically** pre-launch
4. **Launch notification** reaches many
5. **Immediate usage** and feedback
6. **Social proof** attracts more users
