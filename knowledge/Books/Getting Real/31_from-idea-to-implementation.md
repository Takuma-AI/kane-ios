## Go from Brainstorm to Sketches to HTML to Coding

"Here's the process we use to Get Real:"

## Stage 1: Brainstorm

"Come up with ideas. **What is this product going to do?** For Basecamp, we looked at our own needs. We wanted to post project updates. We wanted clients to participate. We knew that projects had milestones. We wanted to centralize archives so people could easily review old stuff. We wanted to have a big-picture, bird's-eye view of what's going on with all our projects. Together, those assumptions, and a few others, served as our foundation."

### Key Principle:

"This stage is **not about nitty gritty details**. This is about **big questions**. What does the app need to do? How will we know when it's useful? What exactly are we going to make? This is about **high level ideas, not pixel-level discussions**. At this stage, those kinds of details just aren't meaningful."

## Stage 2: Paper Sketches

"Sketches are **quick, dirty, and cheap** and that's exactly how you want to start out. Draw stuff. Scrawl stuff. **Boxes, circles, lines.** Get your ideas out of your head and onto paper. The goal at this point should be to **convert concepts into rough interface designs**. This step is all about experimentation. **There are no wrong answers.**"

## Stage 3: Create HTML Screens

"Make an html version of that feature (or section or flow, if it's more appropriate). **Get something real posted** so everyone can see what it looks like on screen."

"For Basecamp, we first did the 'post a message' screen, then the 'edit a message' screen, and it went on from there."

"**Don't write any programming code yet.** Just build a mock-up in html and css. Implementation comes later."

## Stage 4: Code It

"When the mock-up looks good and demonstrates enough of the necessary functionality, go ahead and **plug in the programming code**."

## The Iteration Imperative

"During this whole process remember to **stay flexible and expect multiple iterations**. You should feel free to **throw away the deliverable** of any particular step and start again if it turns out crappy. **It's natural to go through this cycle multiple times.**"

## Mental Model: Progressive Materialization

### From Abstract to Concrete:
1. **Ideas** (conceptual)
2. **Sketches** (visual concepts)
3. **HTML** (interactive mockup)
4. **Code** (functional reality)

### Each Stage Purpose:
- **Brainstorm:** Define the what and why
- **Sketch:** Explore possibilities cheaply
- **HTML:** Test real interactions
- **Code:** Build actual functionality

## The Brainstorming Focus

### Big Questions to Answer:
- What does the app need to do?
- How will we know when it's useful?
- What exactly are we going to make?

### What to Ignore:
- Nitty gritty details
- Pixel-level discussions
- Implementation specifics
- Technical constraints

### Basecamp Example:
- Post project updates
- Client participation
- Project milestones
- Centralized archives
- Bird's-eye view

## The Sketching Philosophy

### Characteristics:
- **Quick** - Don't spend hours
- **Dirty** - Not pretty
- **Cheap** - Just paper and pen

### What to Draw:
- Boxes
- Circles
- Lines
- Rough layouts
- Basic flows

### Mindset:
- **"There are no wrong answers"**
- Experimentation mode
- Quantity over quality
- Ideas over aesthetics

## The HTML Transition

### Why HTML Before Code:
- **Real screen experience**
- Clickable interactions
- Shareable with team
- No backend complexity
- Fast to modify

### What to Build:
- Feature mockups
- Section layouts
- User flows
- Key screens
- Core interactions

### Basecamp Progression:
1. Post a message screen
2. Edit a message screen
3. Continue from there

## The Coding Trigger

"When the mock-up **looks good** and **demonstrates enough of the necessary functionality**"

### Prerequisites:
- Visual design acceptable
- Interactions clear
- Flow makes sense
- Team alignment
- Ready to commit

### What Not to Do:
- Code too early
- Skip HTML stage
- Perfect in code
- Resist changes

## The Flexibility Framework

### Stay Flexible:
- Expect changes
- Plan for iterations
- Don't get attached
- Keep moving forward

### Throwaway Mentality:
- **"Feel free to throw away"**
- Any deliverable
- At any stage
- If it's not working
- Start fresh

### Natural Process:
- **"Natural to go through this cycle multiple times"**
- Not failure
- Expected path
- Learning process
- Progressive refinement

## Implementation Tips

### Don't Skip Stages:
- Each serves a purpose
- Each reveals different issues
- Each is faster than the next
- Each reduces risk

### Move Quickly:
- Don't perfect at each stage
- Get to the next level
- Learn through progression
- Refine through iteration

### Judge Appropriately:
- Ideas by potential
- Sketches by concepts
- HTML by experience
- Code by functionality

## Cultural Insights & Communication Style

### Process Clarity:
- Numbered stages
- Clear progression
- Specific outputs
- Linear flow

### Informal Language:
- **"Draw stuff. Scrawl stuff."**
- **"Quick, dirty, and cheap"**
- Approachable tone
- Anti-precious

### Permission Statements:
- **"There are no wrong answers"**
- **"Feel free to throw away"**
- **"It's natural"**
- Reduces anxiety

### Specific Examples:
- Basecamp's actual needs
- Real screen names
- Concrete progression
- Not theoretical

### Stage Separation:
- **"Don't write any programming code yet"**
- Clear boundaries
- Resist temptation
- Trust the process

### Reality Focus:
- **"Get something real posted"**
- Move from abstract
- Shareable artifacts
- Tangible progress
