## Core Philosophy: Build Software for Yourself

"A great way to build software is to start out by **solving your own problems**. You'll be the target audience and you'll know what's important and what's not. That gives you a great head start on delivering a breakout product."

## The Market Validation Logic

"The key here is understanding that **you're not alone**. If you're having this problem, it's likely hundreds of thousands of others are in the same boat. **There's your market. Wasn't that easy?**"

This isn't just about market size—it's about authentic problem understanding.

## Real Example: Basecamp's Origin Story

**The Problem:** "As a design firm we needed a simple way to communicate with our clients about projects. We started out doing this via client extranets which we would update manually. But changing the html by hand every time a project needed to be updated just wasn't working. These project sites always seemed to go stale and eventually were abandoned. It was frustrating because it left us disorganized and left clients in the dark."

**The Search:** "So we started looking at other options. Yet every tool we found either 1) didn't do what we needed or 2) was bloated with features we didn't need — like billing, strict access controls, charts, graphs, etc. We knew there had to be a better way so we decided to build our own."

**The Result:** They built exactly what they needed, nothing more, nothing less.

## The Passion Principle

"When you solve your own problem, you **create a tool that you're passionate about**. And passion is key. **Passion means you'll truly use it and care about it**. And that's the best way to get others to feel passionate about it too."

This creates an authentic feedback loop—you're building for someone you know intimately (yourself) and you'll actually use what you build.

## Mental Model: "Scratching Your Own Itch"

The Open Source world has long embraced this concept. For developers, "it means they get the tools they want, delivered the way they want them. But the benefit goes much deeper."

### The Decision-Making Advantage

**The Problem with Building for Others:**
"As the designer or developer of a new application, you're faced with hundreds of micro-decisions each and every day: blue or green? One table or two? Static or dynamic? Abort or recover? How do we make these decisions? If it's something we recognize as being important, we might ask. The rest, we guess. And all that guessing builds up a kind of **debt in our applications** — an interconnected web of assumptions."

**Why Personal Use Matters:**
"Open Source developers, scratching their own itches, don't suffer this. Because **they are their own users, they know the correct answers to 90% of the decisions they have to make**."

### The Stress Factor

"As a developer, I hate this. The knowledge of all these small-scale timebombs in the applications I write adds to my stress... I think this is one of the reasons folks come home after a hard day of coding and then work on open source: **It's relaxing**."

—Dave Thomas, The Pragmatic Programmers

## Case Study: Campaign Monitor

**The Frustration:** "For years we'd been frustrated by the quality of the email marketing options out there. One tool would do x and y but never z, the next had y and z nailed but just couldn't get x right. We couldn't win."

**The Decision:** "We decided to clear our schedule and have a go at building our dream email marketing tool. We **consciously decided not to look at what everyone else was doing** and instead build something that would make ours and our customer's lives a little easier."

**The Validation:** "As it turned out, we weren't the only ones who were unhappy with the options out there... In less than six months, thousands of designers were using Campaign Monitor."

—David Greiner, founder, Campaign Monitor

## The Long-Term Investment Principle

Malcolm Gladwell on writing: "When you write a book, you need to have more than an interesting story. You need to have a **desire to tell the story**. You need to be **personally invested** in some way. If you're going to live with something for two years, three years, the rest of your life, **you need to care about it**."

## Decision-Making Framework

When evaluating potential projects:

1. **Am I personally experiencing this problem?**
2. **Do I care enough to live with this solution for years?**
3. **Do I know the correct answer to most micro-decisions because I'm the user?**
4. **Will I be passionate about using what I build?**
5. **If I'm frustrated by this problem, are others likely to be too?**

## Why This Works

### Authentic Problem Understanding
- You understand the real pain points, not assumed ones
- You know what's essential vs. what's nice-to-have
- You can distinguish between real problems and imagined ones

### Natural Quality Control
- You'll actually use what you build
- Bad decisions will hurt you personally
- You'll iterate because you have to live with it

### Reduced Guesswork
- Fewer assumptions and "small-scale timebombs"
- Clearer decision-making criteria
- Less stress about uncertain choices

### Market Validation
- If you have the problem, others likely do too
- Your solution will be authentic, not theoretical
- You can speak from experience to potential users
