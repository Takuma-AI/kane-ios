## Core Concept

**Share your knowledge with the world.** When a teacher appears as a contestant on Jeopardy, Alex Trebek often comments that it's a "noble profession." He's right. There's definitely something wonderful and rewarding about sharing your knowledge with others. And when the subject you're teaching is your app, it serves a dual purpose: You can give something back to the community that supports you and score some nice promotional exposure at the same time.

## The Soft Sell Approach

"As a promotional technique, education is a soft way to get your name — and your product's name — in front of more people. And instead of a hard sell 'buy this product' approach, you're getting attention by providing a valuable service."

**The result**: "That creates positive buzz that traditional marketing tactics can't match. People who you educate will become your evangelists."

## Mental Model: Teaching as Marketing

**Traditional Thinking:** Promote by talking about how great your product is.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Promote by teaching valuable skills that happen to involve your product.

### Decision Framework

For educational content:
1. **Is this genuinely helpful?**
2. **Does it provide value beyond our product?**
3. **Will people want to share this knowledge?**
4. **Does it build our credibility?**

### Key Insight

When you teach, you don't sell—you serve. Service creates evangelists better than sales pitches.

## Forms of Education

"Education can come in many forms."

### 1. Tips and Tricks
"Post tips and tricks at your site that people will want to share with others."

### 2. Speaking Engagements
"Speak at conferences and stay afterwards to meet and greet with attendees."

### 3. Workshops
"Conduct workshops so curious fans can learn more and talk to you in the flesh."

### 4. Interviews
"Give interviews to publications."

### 5. Articles
"Write articles that share helpful information."

### 6. Books
"And write books. ;)"

## Case Study: Yellow Fade Technique

"An example from our own history is the Yellow Fade Technique, a method we invented to subtly spotlight a recently changed area on a page."

The process:
1. **Created the technique** for their own use
2. **Wrote a post** about it on Signal vs. Noise
3. **Post went viral** and spread widely
4. **Thousands of page views** (still generating traffic)

"The post worked on both an educational and a promotional level. A lesson was learned and a lot of people who never would have known about our products were exposed to them."

## Case Study: Ruby on Rails

"During our development of Ruby on Rails, we decided to make the infrastructure open source."

Results of educational open-sourcing:
- **Gave back** to the community
- **Built goodwill** with developers
- **Garnered recognition** for the team
- **Received useful feedback**
- **Began receiving patches** and contributions from programmers worldwide

"It turned out to be a wise move."

## The Karma Principle

"Teaching is all about good karma. You're paying it forward. You're helping others. You get some healthy promotion. And you can even bask in a bit of nobility."

The virtuous cycle:
1. Share knowledge freely
2. Build community goodwill
3. Gain recognition naturally
4. Attract right customers
5. Create lasting relationships

## David Greiner's Experience

From Campaign Monitor's founder:

"The articles and tips section of our blog is one of the most popular sections of our site. Passing on our knowledge about email marketing ensures our customers get the most out of our software."

### The Business Logic

"If they can provide a better service to their customers, then they're likely to get more business, which in turn creates more business for us — everyone wins."

### Additional Benefits

1. **Expert positioning**: "Helped position us as experts in the industry"
2. **Customer relationships**: "Strengthened our relationship with existing customers"
3. **Trust building**: "They know we care about the quality of their work"
4. **Traffic generation**: "We get loads of targeted inbound traffic from search engines and bloggers"

Key insight: "These are people that would never have heard of our software had we not written that article."
