## Core Concept

**They're hungry for it so serve it up.** New or interesting features are a great way to generate buzz for your application. Special interest groups love to chew up "feature food" and spit it back out to the community. Alright, that's kind of an unpleasant analogy but you get the point.

## Mental Model: Innovation as Marketing

**Traditional Thinking:** Build features for users, market the overall product.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Innovative features themselves become marketing vehicles through special interest communities.

### Decision Framework

For feature promotion:
1. **What communities care about this feature?**
2. **Is this genuinely innovative or noteworthy?**
3. **Can we spotlight it effectively?**
4. **Will early adopters evangelize it?**

### Key Insight

Special interest groups amplify innovative features far beyond your marketing reach.

## Case Studies from 37signals

### Ruby on Rails Adoption
"For example, by using Ruby on Rails, a new development platform, we generated a ton of attention for Basecamp within the developer community."

### Ajax Implementation
"The Ajax elements we used in our applications got lots of buzz and even led to Business 2.0 magazine naming Basecamp a 'key player in Ajax' alongside big names like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Amazon."

### RSS Support
"Another example: Bloggers took notice of Basecamp's RSS support since it was one of the first business examples of RSS."

### iCal Integration
"iCal integration, a seemingly minor feature, got us press on a ton of Mac-related sites which probably never would have mentioned the app otherwise."

## The Small Team Advantage

"Small teams have a leg up on integrating new ideas into software. While bigger companies have to deal with bureaucratic bottlenecks, you can rapidly implement new ideas and get attention for using them."

Advantages:
- **Quick decisions** on new technology
- **Fast implementation** without committees
- **Risk tolerance** for innovation
- **First-mover advantage** in niches
- **Authentic enthusiasm** for new tech

## Riding the Hype Wave

"Riding the hype coattails of the technology du jour is an effective and cheap way to build your buzz."

**Important caveat**: "That said, don't go adding the latest obscure technology just to gain some notice. But if you are using something new or noteworthy, go ahead and spotlight it for special interest groups."
