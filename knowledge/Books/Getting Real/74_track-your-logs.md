# Chapter 74: Track Your Logs

**Book:** Getting Real  
**Section:** Promotion  
**Mental Model:** Business & Marketing  
**Tags:** #analytics #buzz-monitoring #customer-engagement #reputation-management #feedback-loop

## Core Concept

**Study your logs to track buzz.** You need to know who's talking about you. Check your logs and find out where the buzz is coming from. Who's linking to you? Who's bitching about you? Which blogs listed at Technorati, Blogdex, Feedster, Del.icio.us, and Daypop are hot on your trail?

## Mental Model: Active Listening at Scale

**Traditional Thinking:** Launch and hope people talk about you. React only when problems arise.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Proactively monitor, engage, and build relationships with everyone talking about you.

### Decision Framework

For buzz monitoring:
1. **Who's talking about us?**
2. **What are they saying?**
3. **How can we engage meaningfully?**
4. **What can we learn from this?**

### Key Insight

Your logs aren't just dataâ€”they're conversations waiting to happen.

## The Monitoring Imperative

### What to Track
- Who's linking to you
- Who's complaining about you
- Which influential blogs mention you
- Where traffic originates
- What people are saying

### Where to Look
Original platforms mentioned:
- Technorati
- Blogdex
- Feedster
- Del.icio.us
- Daypop

Modern equivalents:
- Google Analytics
- Social media monitoring
- Mention tracking tools
- Referrer logs
- Search alerts

## Engagement Strategy

"Find out and then make your presence felt."

### For Positive Mentions
- **Leave comments** at those blogs
- **Thank people** for posting links
- **Build relationships** with advocates
- **Offer exclusive access**: "Ask them if they want to be included on your special advance list"

### Creating Social Proof
"Collect positive praise and create a 'buzz' page at your site. Testimonials are a great way to promote your app since third-party praise is more trustworthy to most people."

## Handling Negative Feedback

"If the comments are negative, still pay attention. Show you're listening."

### The Response Framework

1. **Acknowledge**: Show you're aware and listening
2. **Appreciate**: "We appreciate the feedback"
3. **Explain**: "...but we did it this way because..."
4. **Commit**: "You raise a good point and we're working on it"

### The Transformation Effect

"You'll soften up your critics and put a human face on your product. It's amazing how much a thoughtful comment on a blog can diffuse naysayers and even turn complainers into evangelists."

## Types of Responses

### To Criticism About Design Decisions
"We appreciate the feedback but we did it this way because..."
- Explain your reasoning
- Show the thought process
- Demonstrate you've considered alternatives
- Stand by decisions while respecting feedback

### To Valid Points
"You raise a good point and we're working on it."
- Acknowledge validity
- Show it's on your radar
- Don't make false promises
- Keep them updated

## The Human Face Principle

Key benefits of personal engagement:
- **Softens critics** through human connection
- **Builds understanding** of your decisions
- **Creates evangelists** from complainers
- **Demonstrates care** for user experience
- **Provides context** for choices
