## Core Concept

**Blogging can be more effective than advertising (and it's a hell of a lot cheaper).** Advertising is expensive. And evaluating the effectiveness of various types of advertising can wind up being even more expensive than the advertising itself. When you don't have the time or money to go the traditional advertising route, consider the promote-via-blog route instead.

## The Blog Strategy

"Start off by creating a blog that not only touts your product but offers helpful advice, tips, tricks, links, etc."

Key principle: **Value first, promotion second.**

### Signal vs. Noise Example

"Our Signal vs. Noise blog gets thousands of unique readers a week thanks to the helpful, informative, and interesting bits and anecdotes we post on a daily basis."

## Mental Model: Earned Attention

**Traditional Thinking:** Pay for advertising to interrupt people and promote your product.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Earn attention by providing value, then leverage that audience.

### Decision Framework

For blog content:
1. **Is this genuinely helpful?**
2. **Would I read this if I didn't work here?**
3. **Does this build our credibility?**
4. **Will people want to share this?**

### Key Insight

Build an audience by being useful, then that audience becomes your promotional channel.

## The Basecamp Launch Story

"So when it came time to promote our first product, Basecamp, we started there. We got the word out on SvN and it started to spread."

The network effect: "Folks like Jason Kottke, the BoingBoingers, Jim Coudal, and a variety of other people with popular blogs helped raise the visibility and things took off."

## The Power of Blog Marketing

### Ta-da Lists Launch
"We launched Ta-da with a single post on Signal vs. Noise, and a few weeks later it had been mentioned on over 200 blogs and over 12,000 people had signed up for their own Ta-da account."

### Backpack Success
"Word about Backpack spread even faster. Within 24 hours of launch, more than 10,000 signed up."
