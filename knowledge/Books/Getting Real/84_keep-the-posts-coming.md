# Chapter 84: Keep the Posts Coming

**Book:** Getting Real  
**Section:** Post-Launch  
**Mental Model:** Business & Marketing  
**Tags:** #content-marketing #product-blogs #community-engagement #transparency #ongoing-communication

## Core Concept

**Show your product is alive by keeping an ongoing product development blog post-launch.** Don't stop blogging once you launch. Show your product is a living creature by keeping a dedicated blog that you update frequently (at least once a week, more often if you can).

## Mental Model: Living Product Communication

**Traditional Thinking:** Launch with fanfare, then go quiet. Only communicate for major releases.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Keep constant conversation going. Show life through regular updates.

### Decision Framework

For product blogging:
1. **Is this helpful to users?**
2. **Does this show we're active?**
3. **Will this build community?**
4. **Can we sustain this pace?**

### Key Insight

A frequently-updated blog is the heartbeat of a living product.

## Content Categories

Things to include:
- **FAQ** - Answer common questions
- **How-tos** - Teach best practices
- **Tips & tricks** - Share power user knowledge
- **New features, updates, & fixes** - Announce improvements
- **Buzz/press** - Share external coverage

## The Human Connection

"A blog not only shows your app is alive, it makes your company seem more human."

This humanization:
- Breaks down corporate walls
- Creates personal connection
- Builds trust through transparency
- Enables real conversation
- Shows people behind product

## The Napoleon Complex

"Small teams sometimes feel like they need to sound big and ultra-professional all the time. It's almost like a business version of the Napoleon Complex."

The advice: "Don't sweat sounding small. Revel in the fact that you can talk to customers like a friend."

## Gina Trapani's Perspective

From Lifehacker's editor:

"A frequently-updated product blog is the best indicator that a webapp is in active development, that it's loved and that there's a light on at home."

The flip side: "An abandoned product blog is a sign of an abandoned product, and says the people in charge are asleep at the wheel."

## The Living Product Philosophy

"Keep the conversation going with your users on your product blog, and be transparent and generous with the information you share."

Key practices:
- **Let philosophies shine through**
- **Openly link and discuss competitors**
- **Hint at upcoming features**
- **Keep comments open for feedback**

## The Two-Way Street

"A living product is one that's talking and listening to its users."

This creates:
- Active dialogue
- User engagement
- Community feeling
- Feedback loops
- Continuous improvement

## Benefits of Active Blogging

A frequently-updated product blog promotes:
1. **Transparency** - Open communication
2. **Community sense** - Shared journey
3. **Brand loyalty** - Emotional connection
4. **Free publicity** - Bonus benefit
5. **User retention** - Ongoing engagement

## The Press Advantage

"As editor at Lifehacker, I scan the product blogs of webapps I love continuously â€” like Google, Flickr, Yahoo, del.icio.us, and Basecamp product blogs."

Key insight: "I'm much more likely to mention them than webapps that send out one-sided press releases out of the blue and don't maintain an open conversation with their users and fans."

## Blog Update Frequency

Minimum standard: "At least once a week, more often if you can"

This suggests:
- **Weekly minimum** for relevance
