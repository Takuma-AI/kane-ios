## Core Concept

**Soften the blow of bad news with advance notice and grandfather clauses.** Need to deliver bad news like a price increase? Make it as painless as possible by giving folks plenty of advance notice. Also, consider a grandfather period that exempts existing customers for a certain period of time.

## The Principle of Cushioning

When delivering bad news:
1. **Give plenty of advance notice**
2. **Consider grandfather clauses**
3. **Treat existing customers specially**

"These folks are your bread and butter and you want to make them feel valued, not gouged."

## Mental Model: Respectful Change Management

**Traditional Thinking:** Make changes quickly to maximize immediate revenue. Treat all customers the same.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Cushion necessary changes with time and exceptions. Honor existing relationships.

### Decision Framework

When making unfavorable changes:
1. **How much notice can we give?**
2. **Can existing customers be protected?**
3. **What softens the impact?**
4. **How do we show we value loyalty?**

### Key Insight

How you deliver bad news matters as much as the news itself.

## Advance Notice Strategy

### Why It Matters
- Allows planning and budgeting
- Shows respect for customers
- Reduces shock and anger
- Enables graceful transitions
- Maintains trust

### How Much Notice?
- **Minor changes**: 30 days minimum
- **Major changes**: 60-90 days
- **Significant impact**: 6 months+
- **Consider**: Customer planning cycles
- **Communicate**: Multiple times

## Grandfather Clause Benefits

### For Customers
- Feel valued and special
- Reward for loyalty
- Time to adjust
- Reduced immediate impact
- Appreciation recognized

### For Business
- Reduces churn
- Maintains goodwill
- Shows values
- Builds loyalty
- Protects revenue base

## Types of Grandfather Clauses

### Time-Based
- "Current price for 6 months"
- "Old terms through year-end"
- "Gradual increase over time"

### Permanent
- "Lock in current rate forever"
- "Original features always included"
- "Early adopter pricing"

### Hybrid
- "Current price for 1 year, then 50% of increase"
- "Keep 80% of features at old price"
- "Stepped increases over 2 years"

## Communication Best Practices

### The Announcement

**Structure:**
1. **Acknowledgment**: "We know this isn't ideal..."
2. **Reasoning**: "Here's why this is necessary..."
3. **Cushioning**: "Here's what we're doing to help..."
4. **Timeline**: "This will take effect on..."
5. **Gratitude**: "Thank you for your loyalty..."

### Tone Matters
- Apologetic but not weak
- Transparent about reasons
- Appreciative of loyalty
- Clear about changes
- Open to feedback

## Real Examples

### Price Increase
**Bad**: "Prices increase next month. Update your payment method."

**Good**: "We're writing to give you 90 days notice about a price change. As a valued customer since [date], you'll keep your current rate through [date]. Here's why this change is necessary and how we're making it easier..."

### Feature Changes
**Bad**: "This feature is discontinued effective immediately."

**Good**: "We're planning to sunset this feature in 6 months. Current users can continue using it through [date], and here are some alternatives we're building..."

## Common Scenarios

### Price Increases
- Inflation adjustments
- Added value/features
- Market corrections
- Cost increases
- Service improvements

### Feature Removals
- Low usage features
- Technical debt
- Security concerns
- Strategic refocus
- Maintenance burden

### Terms Changes
- Payment schedules
- Service levels
- Usage limits
- API access
- Support options

## The Psychology of Grandfathering

Why it works:
1. **Reciprocity**: Kindness breeds loyalty
2. **Loss aversion**: Keeping something feels valuable
3. **Special status**: Being "grandfathered" feels exclusive
4. **Trust building**: Shows long-term thinking
5. **Switching costs**: Reduces reason to leave

## Balancing Business Needs

### Considerations
- Financial impact of grandfathering
- Complexity of maintaining multiple tiers
- Long-term sustainability
- Competitive positioning
- Customer lifetime value

### Finding Balance
- Grandfather most loyal/valuable customers
- Set reasonable time limits
- Consider partial grandfathering
- Evaluate case-by-case for enterprise
- Build in review periods

## Implementation Checklist

1. **Identify impact**: Who's affected and how
2. **Design cushions**: Time and/or pricing
3. **Craft message**: Clear, empathetic, grateful
4. **Plan timeline**: Multiple communications
5. **Prepare support**: FAQs and responses
6. **Monitor reaction**: Adjust if needed
