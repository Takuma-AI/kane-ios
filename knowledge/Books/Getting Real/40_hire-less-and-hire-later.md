## Core Concept

**"Add slow to go fast."** There's no need to get big early — or later. Even if you have access to 100 of the very best people, it's still a bad idea to try and hire them all at once.

## The Problem with Rapid Hiring

"There's no way that you can immediately assimilate that many people into a coherent culture."

Rapid hiring creates:
- **Training headaches**
- **Personality clashes**
- **Communication lapses**
- **People going in different directions**
- **Cultural dilution**

## The Getting Real Approach to Hiring

### First, Don't Hire

"So don't hire. Really. Don't hire people. Look for another way."

Before considering a hire, ask:
- **Is the work that's burdening you really necessary?**
- **What if you just don't do it?**
- **Can you solve the problem with a slice of software or a change of practice instead?**

### The Jack Welch Principle

"Whenever Jack Welch, former CEO of GE, used to fire someone, he didn't immediately hire a replacement. He wanted to see how long he could get along without that person and that position."

The insight: **"You don't need as many people as you think."**

### When You Must Hire

"If there's no other way, then consider a hire. But you should know exactly:
- Who to get
- How to introduce them to the work
- The exact pain you expect them to relieve"

## Mental Model: Lean Staffing

**Traditional Thinking:** More people = more productivity = faster progress.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Fewer people = less overhead = faster decisions = better product.

### Decision Framework

Before hiring:
1. **Can we eliminate this work entirely?**
2. **Can we automate or systematize it?**
3. **Can we change our process to avoid it?**
4. **Do we know the specific pain this hire will solve?**

### Key Insight

The best hire is often the one you don't make. Challenge every assumption about necessary work.

## Brooks' Law

**"Adding people to a late software project makes it later."** — Fred Brooks

This fundamental law of software development explains why throwing bodies at problems doesn't work.

## The Mozart's Requiem Principle

Joel Spolsky's powerful insight:

"A single good programmer working on a single task has no coordination or communication overhead. Five programmers working on the same task must coordinate and communicate. That takes a lot of time..."

The crucial point:

**"The real trouble with using a lot of mediocre programmers instead of a couple of good ones is that no matter how long they work, they never produce something as good as what the great programmers can produce."**

"Five Antonio Salieris won't produce Mozart's Requiem. Ever. Not if they work for 100 years."
