## Core Concept

**Tear down the walls between support and development.** In the restaurant business, there's a world of difference between those working in the kitchen and those out front who deal with customers. It's important for both sides to understand and empathize with the other. That's why cooking schools and restaurants will often have chefs work out front as waiters so the kitchen staff can interact with customers and see what it's actually like on the front lines.

## The Restaurant Analogy

The parallel to software:
- **Kitchen = Development/Design team**
- **Front of house = Support team**
- **The problem**: Total separation means chefs (developers) never hear what customers actually say

"Unfortunately, that means the software chefs never get to hear what customers are actually saying. That's problematic because listening to customers is the best way to get in tune with your product's strengths and weaknesses."

## Mental Model: Direct Connection

**Traditional Thinking:** Separate support from development for efficiency. Let developers focus on building.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Connect developers directly to customers for better products and genuine empathy.

### Decision Framework

For support structure:
1. **Who knows the product best?**
2. **Who needs to hear feedback most?**
3. **How do we maintain genuine empathy?**
4. **What creates the best customer experience?**

### Key Insight

When builders feel customer pain directly, they build better solutions.

## The 37signals Approach

"At Basecamp, all of our support emails are answered personally by the people who actually build the product."

### Why This Works

1. **Better support for customers**: "They're getting a response straight from the brain of someone who built the app"
2. **Better feedback for builders**: "It keeps us in touch with the people who use our products and the problems they're encountering"

## The Empathy Advantage

"When they're frustrated, we're frustrated. We can say, 'I feel your pain' and actually mean it."

This creates:
- **Genuine understanding** of user struggles
- **Emotional investment** in solutions
- **Faster problem recognition**
- **Better priority alignment**
- **Authentic communication**

## The Solution Framework

### Don't
- Outsource customer support to call centers
- Use third parties for customer communication
- Build walls between teams
- Rely only on statistics
- Buffer yourself from criticism

### Do
- Handle support yourself
- Include whole team in support
- Listen to actual voices
- Feel customer frustration
- Learn from direct feedback

## Stats vs. Voices

"It can be tempting to rely on statistical analysis to reveal your trouble spots. But stats aren't the same as voices."

### Why Voices Matter More
- **Context**: Understanding the why
- **Emotion**: Feeling the frustration
- **Nuance**: Catching subtle issues
- **Stories**: Learning usage patterns
- **Humanity**: Building relationships

### The Goal
"You need to eliminate as many buffers as possible between you and the real voices of your customers."

## The Action Imperative

"The front lines are where the action is. Get up there. Have your chefs work as waiters. Read customer emails, hear their frustrations, listen to their suggestions and learn from them."

## David Greiner's Implementation

From Campaign Monitor's founder:

"Almost all Campaign Monitor development, support and marketing are performed by two people. Even if we're forced to expand the team, we'll never separate support from development."

### The Benefits

"By personally responding to every request, we force ourselves to sit in our customers shoes and see things from their perspective."

### Understanding Context

"It's important to understand why your customer needs something, not just what it is they need. That context often has a direct impact on how we design something."

### The Direct Connection

"Cut out the middle man. It's much easier to give your customers what they want when your ears are that close to the ground."

## The Common Objection

"I've discussed this setup with loads of people and the first response is often 'shouldn't you just hire a junior to handle your support?'"

His response: "Put yourself in your customer's shoes. If you want your steak cooked just how you like it, would you rather talk to the bus boy or the chef that's actually cooking it?"

## Implementation Strategies

### For Small Teams
- Everyone does support
- Rotate support duties
- Share interesting cases
- Discuss patterns in team meetings
- Act on feedback quickly

### For Growing Teams
- Maintain developer involvement
- Create support partnerships
- Regular rotation schedules
- Share support insights
- Keep builders connected

### For Larger Teams
- Dedicated support with developer rotation
- Regular ride-alongs
- Support shadowing programs
- Feedback loops to development
- Customer advisory boards

## The Benefits Cascade

Direct support involvement creates:
1. **Better products** through understanding
2. **Faster fixes** through direct knowledge
3. **Stronger empathy** through connection
4. **Clearer priorities** through pain points
5. **Happier customers** through expert help

## Common Mistakes

### Structural Problems
- Creating support silos
- Using metrics over stories
- Hiding developers from criticism
- Outsourcing understanding
- Building artificial barriers

### Cultural Issues
- Viewing support as lesser work
- Protecting developers from "distractions"
- Prioritizing efficiency over empathy
- Focusing on tickets closed
- Missing learning opportunities

## The Mindset Shift

From: "Support is a cost center that distracts from building"

To: "Support is where we learn how to build better"
