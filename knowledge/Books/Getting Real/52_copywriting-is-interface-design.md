## Core Concept

**"Copywriting is interface design."** Great interfaces are written. If you think every pixel, every icon, every typeface matters, then you also need to believe every letter matters. When you're writing your interface, always put yourself in the shoes of the person who's reading your interface. What do they need to know? How can you explain it succinctly and clearly?

## Every Word is a Design Decision

"Do you label a button Submit or Save or Update or New or Create? That's copywriting. Do you write three sentences or five? Do you explain with general examples or with details? Do you label content New or Updated or Recently Updated or Modified? Is it There are new messages: 5 or There are 5 new messages or is it 5 or five or messages or posts? All of this matters."

These micro-decisions shape the entire user experience.

## Mental Model: Words as Interface Elements

**Traditional Thinking:** Design the interface visually, then add words to label things.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Words ARE the interface. They're as crucial as any visual element.

### Decision Framework

When writing interface copy:
1. **What does the user need to know right now?**
2. **What's the clearest way to say it?**
3. **What words match their mental model?**
4. **How can we be more concise?**

### Key Insight

Good writing is good design. They're inseparable in creating great user experiences.

## Speaking the User's Language

"You need to speak the same language as your audience too. Just because you're writing a web app doesn't mean you can get away with technical jargon."

Guidelines for user-friendly language:
- **Think about your customers** and what words mean to them
- **Don't use acronyms** or words most people don't understand
- **Don't use internal lingo**
- **Don't sound like an engineer talking to another engineer**
- **Keep it short and sweet**
- **Say what you need to and no more**

## The Pervasiveness of Writing in Design

"Good writing is good design. It's a rare exception where words don't accompany design."

Examples throughout the interface:
- **Icons with names**
- **Form fields with examples**
- **Buttons with labels**
- **Step by step instructions in a process**
- **Clear explanation of your refund policy**

"These are all interface design."

## Real-World Copywriting Decisions

### Button Labels
- **Submit**: Generic, unclear outcome
- **Save**: Implies preservation
- **Update**: Suggests changing existing
- **Create**: Indicates making new
- **Send**: Implies delivery to others

Each word creates different expectations and mental models.

### Status Messages
- **New**: Fresh, unread
- **Updated**: Changed from before
- **Recently Updated**: Timeframe context
- **Modified**: Technical, vague

The choice affects how users prioritize and understand.

### Quantity Display
- **There are new messages: 5**: Formal, wordy
- **There are 5 new messages**: More natural
- **5 new messages**: Concise, clear
- **5**: Too minimal, lacks context
- **Five**: Unnecessarily spelled out

Balance clarity with brevity.

## Principles of Interface Copywriting

### 1. Clarity First
- Remove ambiguity
- Be specific
- Use familiar terms
- Avoid double meanings

### 2. Conciseness Matters
- Trim unnecessary words
- Front-load important info
- Use active voice
- Get to the point

### 3. Consistency Helps
- Use same terms throughout
- Maintain tone
- Follow patterns
- Build vocabulary

### 4. Context is King
- Right amount of detail
- Appropriate tone
- Timely information
- Relevant examples

## Common Interface Copy Challenges

### Error Messages
- **Bad**: "Error 404"
- **Better**: "Page not found"
- **Best**: "We couldn't find that page. Try searching or go home."

### Empty States
- **Bad**: "No items"
- **Better**: "Nothing here yet"
- **Best**: "Create your first project to get started"

### Loading States
- **Bad**: "Processing..."
- **Better**: "Saving your changes"
- **Best**: "Saving your profile. This usually takes a few seconds."

### Confirmation Messages
- **Bad**: "Are you sure?"
- **Better**: "Delete this file?"
- **Best**: "Delete 'Report.pdf'? This can't be undone."

## The Power of Microcopy

Small words make big differences:
- **"Your" vs "My"**: Perspective and ownership
- **"Log in" vs "Sign in"**: Subtle tone differences
- **"Free" vs "No cost"**: Emotional impact
- **"Error" vs "Problem"**: Severity perception
- **"Required" vs "Needed"**: Flexibility feeling

## Writing Process for Interfaces

1. **Draft quickly**: Get ideas down
2. **Read aloud**: Test natural flow
3. **Cut ruthlessly**: Remove every unnecessary word
4. **Test with users**: See what confuses
5. **Iterate based on feedback**: Refine continuously

## Integration with Design Process

### Design With Real Copy

## Measuring Copy Effectiveness

Good interface copy results in:
- Fewer support questions
- Faster task completion
- Reduced errors
- Higher satisfaction
- Better conversion

## The Emotional Impact

Words set emotional tone:
- **Friendly**: "Oops! Let's try that again."
- **Professional**: "Please correct the errors below."
- **Playful**: "Uh oh! Something went wonky."
- **Serious**: "Action required to continue."

Choose tone to match brand and context.
