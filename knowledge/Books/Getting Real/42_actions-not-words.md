## Core Concept

**Judge potential tech hires on open source contributions.** The typical method of hiring for technical positions — based on degrees, résumés, etc. — is silly in a lot of ways. Does it really matter where someone's degree is from or their GPA? Can you really trust a résumé or a reference?

## The Gift of Open Source

"Open source is a gift to those who need to hire technical people. With open source, you can track someone's work and contributions — good and bad — over a lengthy period of time."

**The key insight:** "That means you can judge people by their actions instead of just their words."

## What Really Matters

You can make a decision based on the things that actually count:

### 1. Quality of Work
"Many programmers can talk the talk but trip when it comes time to walk the walk. With open source, you get the nitty gritty specifics of a person's programming skills and practices."

### 2. Cultural Perspective
"Programming is all about decisions. Lots and lots of them. Decisions are guided by your cultural vantage point, values, and ideals. Look at the specific decisions made by a candidate in coding, testing, and community arguments to see whether you've got a cultural match. If there's no fit here, each decision will be a struggle."

### 3. Level of Passion
"By definition, involvement in open source requires at least some passion. Otherwise why would this person spend free time sitting in front of a screen? The amount of open source involvement often shows how much a candidate truly cares about programming."

### 4. Completion Percentage
"All the smarts, proper cultural leanings, and passion don't amount to valuable software if a person can't get stuff done. Unfortunately, lots of programmers can't. So look for that zeal to ship. Hire someone who needs to get it out the door and is willing to make the pragmatic trade-offs this may require."

### 5. Social Match
"Working with someone over a long period of time, during both stress/relaxation and highs/lows, will show you their real personality. If someone's lacking in manners or social skills, filter them out."

## Mental Model: Evidence-Based Hiring

**Traditional Thinking:** Evaluate candidates based on credentials, interviews, and references.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Judge candidates based on actual work they've done over time in the real world.

### Decision Framework

When evaluating technical candidates:
1. **Can you see their actual code and contributions?**
2. **How do they interact with the community?**
3. **Do they ship or just talk?**
4. **Do their technical decisions align with your values?**

### Key Insight

Actions reveal truth. Everything else is just marketing.

## The 37signals Approach

"When it comes to programmers, we only hire people we know through open source. We think doing anything else is irresponsible."

### Case Study: Hiring Jamis

"We hired Jamis because we followed his releases and participation in the Ruby community. He excelled in all the areas mentioned above. It wasn't necessary to rely on secondary factors since we could judge him based on what really matters: the quality of his work."

## Addressing Common Concerns

### Won't Extra Activities Distract from Work?

"Don't worry that extra-curricular activities will take focus and passion away from a staffer's day job. It's like the old cliché says: If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know."

Evidence: "Jamis and David are two of the heaviest contributors to Rails and still manage to drive Basecamp technically. People who love to program and get things done are exactly the kind of people you want on your team."

## Supporting Perspective

### Jarkko Laine on Open Source Passion

"What you want the most from a new hire is passion for what he does, and there's no better way of showing it than a trace of commitment in open source projects."

## Real-World Application

### For Hiring Managers
- Search for candidates' open source profiles
- Review commit history and code quality
- Observe community interactions
- Look for completed projects, not just contributions

### For Technical Leaders
- Encourage team participation in open source
- Use open source as a recruiting pipeline
- Value demonstrated skills over credentials
- Build relationships in the community

### For Candidates
- Contribute to projects you use
- Build a public portfolio of work
- Engage respectfully in communities
- Ship complete features, not just patches

## Benefits of Open Source Hiring

1. **Reduced Risk**: See actual work quality before hiring
2. **Cultural Fit**: Observe values and decision-making in action
3. **Proven Track Record**: Evidence of shipping and completing work
4. **Network Effects**: Tap into communities of passionate developers
5. **Self-Selection**: Only motivated people contribute for free

## What to Look For

### In Code
- Clean, readable implementations
- Thoughtful architecture decisions
- Good documentation habits
- Test coverage and quality

### In Community
- Helpful responses to issues
- Constructive code reviews
- Respectful disagreements
- Mentoring behavior

### In Projects
- Regular contributions
- Feature completion
- Bug fixes that work
- Maintained projects

## Red Flags

- Talk without code
- Abandoned projects
- Hostile community interactions
- Over-engineering simple solutions
- Never shipping features
