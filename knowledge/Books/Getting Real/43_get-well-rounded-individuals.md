## Core Concept

**Go for quick learning generalists over ingrained specialists.** We'll never hire someone who's an information architect. It's just too overly specific. With a small team like ours, it doesn't make sense to hire people with such a narrowly defined skill-set.

## The Problem with Specialists

In small teams, overly specialized roles create several issues:
- **Limited flexibility** when needs change
- **Underutilization** of narrow skill sets
- **Communication barriers** between specialists
- **Slower adaptation** to new challenges

## What Small Teams Need

"Small teams need people who can wear different hats."

Essential qualities for small team members:
- **Designers who can write**
- **Programmers who understand design**
- **Everyone should have an idea about how to architect information**
- **Everyone needs to have an organized mind**
- **Everyone needs to be able to communicate with customers**

## Mental Model: T-Shaped People

**Traditional Thinking:** Hire deep specialists who are experts in one narrow domain.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Hire T-shaped people with broad capabilities and deep expertise in at least one area.

### Decision Framework

When building a small team:
1. **Can this person contribute beyond their primary skill?**
2. **Are they curious about other disciplines?**
3. **Can they adapt when priorities shift?**
4. **Will they collaborate across boundaries?**

### Key Insight

In small teams, versatility beats specialization. You need people who can adapt, learn, and contribute wherever needed.

## The Need for Adaptability

"Everyone needs to be willing and able to shift gears down the road. Keep in mind that small teams often need to change direction and do it quickly."

**The choice is clear:** "You want someone who can adjust and learn and flow as opposed to a stick-in-the-mud who can do only one thing."
