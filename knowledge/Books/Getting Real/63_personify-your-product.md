## Core Concept

**What is your product's personality type?** Think of your product as a person. What type of person do you want it to be? Polite? Stern? Forgiving? Strict? Funny? Deadpan? Serious? Loose? Do you want to come off as paranoid or trusting? As a know-it-all? Or modest and likable?

## The Power of Personality

"Once you decide, always keep those personality traits in mind as the product is built. Use them to guide the copywriting, the interface, and the feature set. Whenever you make a change, ask yourself if that change fits your app's personality."

**The key insight**: "Your product has a voice — and it's talking to your customers 24 hours a day."

## Mental Model: Product as Person

**Traditional Thinking:** Products are neutral tools. Keep personality out of it.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Products have personalities whether you design them or not. Better to craft it intentionally.

### Decision Framework

For every product decision:
1. **Does this match our personality?**
2. **Would our "person" say/do this?**
3. **Is this voice consistent?**
4. **Does this strengthen or dilute our character?**

### Key Insight

Every interaction shapes personality perception. Consistency builds trust and connection.

## Personality Spectrum Examples

### Formality Level
- **Polite**: "Please enter your password"
- **Casual**: "Pop in your password"
- **Stern**: "Password required"

### Error Handling
- **Forgiving**: "Oops! Let's try that again"
- **Strict**: "Invalid input. Requirements not met"
- **Helpful**: "Almost there! Just need 8+ characters"

### Trust Level
- **Paranoid**: Multiple confirmations, warnings
- **Trusting**: Minimal barriers, easy undo

### Knowledge Stance
- **Know-it-all**: "You should do it this way"

- **Collaborative**: "Let's figure this out together"
