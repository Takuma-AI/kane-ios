# Chapter 44: You Can't Fake Enthusiasm

## Core Concept

**"Enthusiasm. It's one attribute you just can't fake."** When it comes time to hire, don't think you need a guru or a tech-celebrity. Often, they're just primadonnas anyway. A happy yet average employee is better than a disgruntled expert.

## The Enthusiasm Equation

**Traditional wisdom says:** Hire the most skilled person available.

**Getting Real says:** "A happy yet average employee is better than a disgruntled expert."

This challenges the conventional hiring hierarchy that places technical skill above all else.

## What to Look For

Find someone who's:
- **Enthusiastic** about the work
- **Trustworthy** to get things done when left alone  
- **Experienced** at bigger, slower companies and longs for change
- **Excited** to build what you're building
- **Aligned** - "Someone who hates the same things you hate"
- **Thrilled** to climb aboard your train

## Mental Model: Attitude Over Aptitude

**Traditional Thinking:** Skill is king. Hire the best technician regardless of personality.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Enthusiasm is irreplaceable. Skills can be learned, but passion can't be taught.

### Decision Framework

When evaluating candidates:
1. **Do they genuinely care about what you're building?**
2. **Will they bring positive energy to the team?**
3. **Can you trust them to work independently?**
4. **Do they share your frustrations with the status quo?**

### Key Insight

You can teach skills, but you can't teach someone to give a damn.

## The Question Test

### Eric Stephens on Passionate Programmers

"Observe whether a potential hire asks a lot of questions about your project."

Why questions matter:
- **Understanding**: "Passionate programmers want to understand a problem as well as possible"
- **Solutions**: They "quickly propose potential solutions and improvements"
- **Complexity**: Questions "reveal an understanding that your project could be implemented thousands of different ways"
- **Specificity**: It's "essential to nail down as explicitly as possible exactly how you imagine your web app working"

"As you dig into the details, you'll develop a sense of whether the person is a good cultural match."

## The Prima Donna Problem

Why to avoid "gurus" and "tech-celebrities":
- Often come with ego baggage
- May not be team players
- Can poison team culture
- Expertise without enthusiasm is toxic

## Real-World Application

### Interview Strategies
- Focus on what excites them
- Ask about frustrations with current tools/processes
- Gauge genuine interest in your problem space
- Look for curiosity and questions

### Red Flags
- Indifference to the product
- Focus only on technology, not purpose
- No questions about the business
- Complaints without constructive ideas

### Green Flags
- Lights up when discussing the project
- Has already thought about improvements
- Asks thoughtful, specific questions
- Shows they've done their homework

## Benefits of Hiring for Enthusiasm

1. **Self-Motivation**: Enthusiastic people drive themselves
2. **Contagious Energy**: Positive attitudes spread
3. **Problem Solving**: Passionate people find solutions
4. **Retention**: People stay where they're excited
5. **Growth**: Enthusiasm fuels learning

## The Suffering Factor

"Someone who's suffered at a bigger, slower company and longs for a new environment."

This person brings:
- Appreciation for agility
- Understanding of what doesn't work
- Hunger for better ways
- Energy from newfound freedom

## Building on Shared Values
