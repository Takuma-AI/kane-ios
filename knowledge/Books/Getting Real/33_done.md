## Decisions Are Temporary So Make the Call and Move On

"**Done.** Start to think of it as a **magical word**. When you get to done it means something's been accomplished. A decision has been made and you can move on. **Done means you're building momentum.**"

## The Reality of Wrong Calls

"But wait, what if you screw up and make the wrong call? **It's ok.** This isn't brain surgery, it's a web app. As we keep saying, you'll likely have to revisit features and ideas multiple times during the process anyway. **No matter how much you plan you're likely to get half wrong anyway.** So don't do the 'paralysis through analysis' thing. That only slows progress and saps morale."

## The Value of Moving Forward

"Instead, value the importance of **moving on and moving forward**. Get in the rhythm of making decisions. Make a quick, simple call and then go back and change that decision if it doesn't work out."

## The Temporary Nature of Everything

"**Accept that decisions are temporary.** Accept that mistakes will happen and realize it's no big deal as long as you can correct them quickly. Execute, build momentum, and move on."

"Accept that mistakes will happen and realize **it's no big deal as long as you can correct them quickly**"

### Key Insight:

- Speed of correction matters
- Not the mistake itself
- Quick fixes possible
- Learning opportunity

## The Execution Imperative

"**Execute, build momentum, and move on**"

### The Cycle:
1. **Execute** - Do something
2. **Build momentum** - Create energy
3. **Move on** - Next challenge

### Why It Works:
- Action creates clarity
- Momentum is motivating
- Progress compounds
- Energy builds
- Results accumulate

## Decision Framework

### When Facing Decisions:

**Ask:**
1. Can we make a call now?
2. Is 80% confidence enough?
3. Can we fix it later?
4. What's the cost of delay?

**Then:**
1. Make the call
2. Mark it done
3. Move forward
4. Revisit if needed
