## Core Concept

**What makes sense here may not make sense there.** Should actions be buttons or links? It depends on the action. Should a calendar view be in list-form or grid-form? It depends where it's being shown and how long the time period is. Does every global navigation link need to be on every page? Do you need a global search bar everywhere? Do you need the same exact footer on each page? The answer: "It depends."

## The Flexibility Principle

"That's why context is more important than consistency. It's ok to be inconsistent if your design makes more sense that way. Give people just what matters. Give them what they need when they need it and get rid of what they don't. It's better to be right than to be consistent."

## Mental Model: Contextual Design

**Traditional Thinking:** Maintain strict consistency across all interfaces for predictability.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Adapt interfaces to specific contexts, even if it means breaking consistency.

### Decision Framework

When making design decisions:
1. **What does the user need in this specific context?**
2. **Would consistency help or hinder here?**
3. **What can we remove without losing value?**
4. **Does this make the task easier or harder?**

### Key Insight

Blind consistency can hurt usability. Smart inconsistency serves users better.

## Examples of Context-Driven Decisions

### Buttons vs. Links
- **Buttons**: For primary actions, form submissions, state changes
- **Links**: For navigation, secondary actions, reversible choices
- **Context decides**: The importance and consequence of the action

### Calendar Views
- **List view**: Better for sparse events, long descriptions
- **Grid view**: Better for dense schedules, visual overview
- **Context decides**: Density of information and user goal

### Navigation Elements
- **Full navigation**: On landing and overview pages
- **Minimal navigation**: During focused tasks or checkout
- **Context decides**: Whether navigation helps or distracts

### Search Functionality
- **Global search**: On content-heavy pages
- **No search**: On simple, focused task pages
- **Context decides**: Whether search adds value

## Mark Hurst on Intelligent Inconsistency

"Consistency is not necessary. For years, students of UI and UX have been taught that consistency in the interface is one of the cardinal rules of interface design. Perhaps that holds in software, but on the Web, it's just not true."

**The key insight:** "What matters on the Web is whether, on each individual page, the user can quickly and easily advance the next step in the process."

**Creative Good's approach:** "We call it 'intelligent inconsistency': making sure that each page in the process gives users exactly what they need at that point in the process."

## The Problem with Blind Consistency

"Adding superfluous nav elements, just because they're consistent with the rest of the site, is just silly."

Consistency-driven problems:
- **Clutter**: Unnecessary elements everywhere
- **Distraction**: Options that don't help current task
- **Confusion**: Wrong tools for the context
- **Inefficiency**: Making simple tasks complex

## Real-World Application

### Checkout Process
- Remove main navigation
- Hide promotional content
- Focus on purchase flow
- Minimize distractions

### Form Pages
- Reduce sidebar content
- Remove footer links
- Highlight help content
- Streamline to essentials

### Dashboard Views
- Customize navigation
- Add contextual tools
- Remove marketing elements
- Optimize for tasks

### Mobile Interfaces
- Completely different navigation
- Context-appropriate controls
- Task-focused design
- Platform-specific patterns

## Benefits of Contextual Design

1. **Improved Focus**: Users see only what's relevant
2. **Faster Task Completion**: No distractions or wrong turns
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Less to process and decide
4. **Better Conversion**: Optimized for specific goals
5. **Enhanced Usability**: Right tool for right job

## Guidelines for Intelligent Inconsistency

### When to Break Consistency
- Task requires different tools
- Context changes significantly
- Consistency would confuse
- Performance would suffer
- User goals shift

### When to Maintain Consistency
- Core navigation patterns
- Fundamental interactions
- Brand elements
- Safety-critical features
- Learning transfers

## Balancing Act

The goal isn't chaos but thoughtful adaptation:
- **Consistent where helpful**: Basic patterns users rely on
- **Flexible where needed**: Specific contexts and tasks
- **User-centered always**: Decisions based on user needs
- **Tested thoroughly**: Verify assumptions with real usage

## Common Contextual Adaptations

### Progressive Disclosure
- Show more options as expertise grows
- Hide advanced features from beginners
- Reveal complexity gradually
- Adapt to user journey

### Task-Based Interfaces
- Writing mode vs reading mode
- Creation vs consumption
- Setup vs daily use
- Admin vs regular user

### Device Optimization
- Desktop vs mobile
- Touch vs mouse
- Large vs small screens
- Online vs offline

## Testing Contextual Designs

1. **Task-based testing**: Can users complete goals?
2. **Context switching**: Do transitions make sense?
3. **Learnability**: Can users adapt to changes?
4. **Efficiency**: Is each context optimized?
5. **Satisfaction**: Do users appreciate adaptations?

## The Right Question

Instead of asking "Is this consistent?" ask:
- Does this help users succeed?
- Does this make sense here?
- What would users expect?
- What serves them best?
