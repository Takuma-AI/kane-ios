# Chapter 85: Better, Not Beta

**Book:** Getting Real  
**Section:** Post-Launch  
**Mental Model:** Process & Execution  
**Tags:** #product-launch #accountability #beta-culture #responsibility #confidence

## Core Concept

**Don't use "beta" as a scapegoat.** These days it feels like everything is in beta stage forever. That's a cop out. An interminable beta stage tells customers you're not really committed to rolling out a finished product. It says, "Use this, but if it's not perfect, it's not our fault."

## Mental Model: Launch Accountability

**Traditional Thinking:** Keep products in beta to avoid criticism. Use beta as an excuse for problems.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Take responsibility for releases. Ship confidently without excuses.

### Decision Framework

For product status:
1. **Is this ready for public use?**
2. **Will we stand behind it?**
3. **Can we support it properly?**
4. **Are we just making excuses?**

### Key Insight

Beta passes the buck to your customers.

## The Beta Problem

"An interminable beta stage tells customers you're not really committed to rolling out a finished product."

What perpetual beta communicates:
- Lack of confidence
- Unwillingness to commit
- Excuse for problems
- Unprofessional approach
- Fear of criticism

## The Confidence Test

"If you're not confident enough about your release then how can you expect the public to be?"

This highlights:
- **Confidence is contagious**
- **Doubt spreads faster**
- **Leadership requires conviction**
- **Customers sense hesitation**
- **Commitment attracts users**

## Private vs. Public Beta

"Private betas are fine, public betas are bullshit."

The distinction:
- **Private beta**: Limited testing with selected users
- **Public beta**: Open access with disclaimer

"If it's not good enough for public consumption don't give it to the public to consume."

## The Perfection Myth

"Don't wait for your product to reach perfection. It's not gonna happen."

This acknowledges:
- Perfection is impossible
- Waiting kills momentum
- Good enough ships
- Improvement is ongoing
- Action beats planning

## Taking Responsibility

"Take responsibility for what you're releasing. Put it out and call it a release. Otherwise, you're just making excuses."

Responsibility means:
- Standing behind your work
- Accepting criticism
- Fixing problems quickly
- Supporting users fully
- Owning the experience

## Mary Hodder's Observation

"Blame Google, et al, for causing problems like this. For now, users have been trained by the aggregate of developers to think 'beta' doesn't really mean anything."

The beta devaluation:
- Lost original meaning
- Became meaningless label
- Users ignore it
- No real distinction
- Empty disclaimer

## Jim Coudal's Question

"Is it just me, or are we all in beta, all the time?"

This captures the absurdity:
- Everything is perpetual beta
- Nothing is ever "done"
- Continuous excuse making
- Lack of commitment
- Industry-wide cop out

## The Real Message

When you use perpetual beta, you're saying:
- "We're not sure about this"
- "Don't expect too much"
- "Problems aren't our fault"
- "We're not fully committed"
- "Use at your own risk"

## The Alternative Approach

Instead of beta:
1. **Launch when ready** for real users
2. **Call it version 1.0** or just launch
3. **Take ownership** of problems
4. **Iterate publicly** with confidence
5. **Communicate honestly** about state

## Beta Culture Problems

### For Your Team
- Reduces urgency
- Excuses sloppiness
- Delays decisions
- Avoids commitment
- Enables procrastination

### For Your Users
- Creates uncertainty
- Reduces trust
- Lowers expectations
- Confuses status
- Delays adoption

### For Your Business

- Delays revenue
- Reduces credibility
- Slows growth
- Enables competition

## The Quality Standard

Ship when:
- Core features work
- Critical bugs fixed
- User experience solid
- Support ready
- Team confident

Don't ship if:
- Fundamentally broken
- Unsafe for data
- Unusable interface
- No support plan
- Team not ready

## The Continuous Improvement Model

Real products can still:
- Add features regularly
- Fix bugs quickly
- Improve performance
- Enhance UI
- Evolve naturally

Without hiding behind beta.

## Communication Without Beta

Be honest about:
- Current capabilities
- Known limitations
- Improvement plans
- Update schedule
- Support availability

## Building Trust

Removing beta builds trust by:
- **Showing confidence** in product
- **Taking responsibility** for issues
- **Committing fully** to users
- **Professional presentation**
- **Clear expectations**

## The Competitive Edge

While competitors hide in beta:
- You ship real products
- You take responsibility
- You build confidence
- You attract serious users
- You move faster

## Common Excuses Debunked

"But we need user feedback" - You can get it without beta label

"But it's not perfect" - It never will be

"But competitors use beta" - Be different

"But it protects us" - From what? Success?

"But users expect it" - They expect excuses?

## The Launch Mindset

Approach launches with:
- Confidence in work
- Acceptance of imperfection
- Commitment to support
- Plans for iteration
- Pride in shipping

## Making the Transition

If currently in beta:
1. Evaluate actual readiness
2. Fix critical issues
3. Remove beta label
4. Communicate change
5. Support fully

## The Bottom Line

Beta has become:
- Meaningless label
- Perpetual excuse
- Confidence killer
- Trust breaker
- Growth limiter

Ship real products instead.

## Cultural Impact

This philosophy creates:
- Team accountability
- User confidence
- Market credibility
- Faster iteration
- Real progress

## Simple Test

Ask yourself:
- Would I use this?
- Would I pay for this?
- Would I recommend this?
- Can I support this?
- Am I proud of this?

If yes, it's not beta.
