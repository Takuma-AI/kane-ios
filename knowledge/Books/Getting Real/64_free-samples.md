## Core Concept

**Give something away for free.** It's a noisy world out there. In order to get people to notice you amid the din, give something away for free.

## The Power of Free

"Smart companies know giving away freebies is a great way to lure in customers."

### Real-World Examples

**Apple**: "They offer iTunes software for free in order to build demand for the iPod and the iTunes music store."

**Starbucks**: "Starbucks says a new purchase is stimulated for every five beverage samples they give away to customers. Not too shabby."

## Mental Model: Free as Marketing Investment

**Traditional Thinking:** Protect value by charging for everything. Free devalues your product.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Free samples create customers. Give away value to build demand for greater value.

### Decision Framework

When considering free:
1. **What can we give that shows real value?**
2. **Will this create desire for more?**
3. **Does free lead to paid naturally?**
4. **Can we afford the cost of free?**

### Key Insight

Free isn't giving away the farm—it's planting seeds for future harvest.

## The 37signals Free Strategy

### Standalone Free Apps
"For us, Writeboard and Ta-da list are completely free apps that we use to get people on the path to using our other products."

Purpose of free apps:
- Gateway to ecosystem
- Demonstrate quality
- Build trust
- Create habits
- Generate awareness

### Free Versions of Paid Apps
"Also, we always offer some sort of free version of all our apps."

The philosophy: "We want people to experience the product, the interface, the usefulness of what we've built."

## The Upgrade Path

"Once they're hooked, they're much more likely to upgrade to one of the paying plans (which allow more projects or pages and gives people access to additional features like file uploading and SSL data encryption)."

Natural progression:
1. **Try free** → 
2. **Get value** → 
3. **Hit limits** → 
4. **See benefits** → 
5. **Upgrade willingly**

## Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba on Bite-Size Chunks

"Make bite-size chunks: Devise specialized, smaller offerings to get customers to bite. Resolve to sub-divide at least one product or service into bite-size chunks that are inexpensive, easy or fun."

The chunking strategy:
- Lower barriers
- Reduce risk
- Enable trial
- Build confidence
- Create momentum

## Derek Sivers on the Hit Single Approach

"Consider giving one of your songs (per-album) as a free promotional download to the world — to be like the movie trailer — like the hit single sent to radio — the song that makes people want to go buy your music."

- **Choose your best**: Give away quality
- **Don't fear piracy**: "Let people play it, copy it, share it, give it away"
- **Have confidence**: "If the world heard it, they will pay for more"
