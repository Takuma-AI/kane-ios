## Core Concept

**Avoid long-term contracts, sign-up fees, etc.** No one likes long term contracts, early termination fees, or one time set-up fees. So avoid them.

## The 37signals Approach

"Our products bill on a month-to-month basis. There's no contract to sign and you can cancel at any time without penalty. And there are never any set-up fees."

This simple model:
- Month-to-month billing
- No contracts
- Cancel anytime
- No penalties
- No setup fees

## Mental Model: Honest Business

**Traditional Thinking:** Lock customers in with contracts and fees to ensure revenue.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Earn customer loyalty through value, not contractual tricks.

### Decision Framework

For pricing and terms:
1. **Would I want to pay this way?**
2. **Does this feel fair and transparent?**
3. **Are we earning or tricking revenue?**
4. **Will customers resent this?**

### Key Insight

Tricky pricing tactics erode trust faster than they build revenue.

## The Simple Principle

"Don't try to find 'tricky' ways to get more cash. Earn it."

This means:
- Provide value worth paying for
- Be transparent about costs
- Respect customer freedom
- Build long-term relationships
