## Core Concept

**Get bad news out there and out of the way.** If something goes wrong, tell people. Even if they never saw it in the first place.

## Mental Model: Radical Transparency

**Traditional Thinking:** Hide problems. Minimize bad news. Protect the brand image at all costs.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Be open about failures. Build trust through honesty. Control the narrative by owning it.

### Decision Framework

For handling problems:
1. **Did something go wrong?**
2. **Tell people immediately**
3. **Be specific about what happened**
4. **Explain what you're doing about it**

### Key Insight

An informed customer is your best customer.

## The Basecamp Example

"Basecamp was down once for a few hours in the middle of the night. 99% of our customers never knew, but we still posted an 'unexpected downtime' notice to our Everything Basecamp blog."

This demonstrates:
- **Proactive disclosure** even when unnoticed
- **Respect for customers** right to know
- **Building trust** through transparency
- **Setting expectations** for honesty

"We thought our customers deserved to know."

## Sample Crisis Communication

"We apologize for the downtime this morning — we had some database issues which caused major slowdowns and downtimes for some people. We've fixed the problem and are taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again…Thanks for your patience and, once again, we're sorry for the downtime."

Key elements:
1. **Direct apology** upfront
2. **Specific problem** identified
3. **Impact described** clearly
4. **Resolution confirmed**
5. **Prevention mentioned**
6. **Gratitude expressed**
7. **Apology repeated**

## The Transparency Principle

"Be as open, honest, and transparent as possible. Don't keep secrets or hide behind spin."

This means:
- **No corporate doublespeak**
- **No minimizing problems**
- **No shifting blame**
- **No hiding facts**
- **No spin control**

## Customer Psychology

"You'll realize that most of your screwups aren't even that bad in the minds of your customers."

Why this works:
- Customers understand imperfection
- Honesty builds sympathy
- Transparency creates trust
- Ownership shows maturity
- Quick disclosure prevents rumors

## The Breathing Room Effect

"Customers are usually happy to give you a little bit of breathing room as long as they know you're being honest with them."

The equation:
**Honesty + Transparency = Customer Patience**

## News Delivery Strategy

### For Bad News
"When bad news comes, get it all out in the open at once."

Why:
- Rip the bandaid off
- Control the narrative
- Prevent slow leaks
- Move to resolution
- Start healing quickly

### For Good News
"Good news, on the other hand, should be trickled out slowly. If you can prolong the good vibes, do it."

Why:
- Extend positive feelings
- Multiple touch points
- Build anticipation
- Maintain momentum
- Maximize impact

## Greg Sherwin's Perspective

From CNET's Vice President:

"It may sound strange, but the best-case scenario is when the company itself reports the bad news."

Benefits:
- **Proactive positioning** vs. reactive
- **Prevents defensive stance**
- **Controls timing**
- **Shapes narrative**
- **Demonstrates leadership**

## Building Trust Through Failure

Each transparent disclosure:
1. **Demonstrates integrity**
2. **Shows respect**
3. **Builds credibility**
4. **Creates loyalty**
5. **Strengthens relationship**

## The Compound Effect

Regular transparency creates:
