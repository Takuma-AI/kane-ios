## Core Concept

**Go from teaser to preview to launch.** If an app launches in a forest and there's no one there to use it, does it make a noise? The point here is that if you launch your app without any pre-hype, people aren't going to know about it.

To build up buzz and anticipation, go with a Hollywood-style launch: 1) Teaser, 2) Preview, and 3) Launch.

## Mental Model: Staged Revelation

**Traditional Thinking:** Build in secret, launch with a big bang, hope people notice.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Build anticipation through staged reveals, creating momentum before launch.

### Decision Framework

For launch planning:
1. **How can we tease without revealing too much?**
2. **What creates genuine anticipation?**
3. **Who are our early evangelists?**
4. **How do we maintain momentum?**

### Key Insight

A launch is a campaign, not an event. Build desire before fulfillment.

## Phase 1: Teaser

"A few months ahead of time, start dropping hints."

### Tactics
- **Announce what you're working on**
- **Post a logo**
- **Blog about development**
- **Stay vague but plant the seed**
- **Set up email collection**

### Seducing Mavens and Insiders

"At this stage, you should also start seducing mavens and insiders. These are the folks on the cutting edge. They're the tastemakers."

Strategy:
- **Appeal to vanity** and status as ahead-of-the-curve
- **Offer exclusive** sneak previews
- **Target influencers**: Boing Boing, Slashdot, Digg
- **Build relationships** early
- **Create insider feeling**

Benefits: "You'll get loads of traffic and followers. Plus, your page rank at Google will go up too."

## Phase 2: Preview

"A few weeks ahead of launch, start previewing features."

### Activities
- **Give behind-the-scenes access**
- **Describe the product theme**
- **Post screenshots**
- **Highlight key features**
- **Share philosophy**

### Building Philosophy

"Tell people about the ideas and principles behind the app. For Backpack, we posted our manifesto before launch. This got people thinking and talking about the app."

### Golden Tickets

"You can also offer some special 'golden tickets' to a few people so they can start using the app early."

Benefits:
- Beta testing feedback
- Early adopter testimonials
- Special glow of exclusivity
- Pre-launch buzz
- Bug discovery

### Email Foundation

"Encourage people to sign up so you've got a foundation of emails to blitz once you launch. By the time we launch our apps, we have thousands of emails to ping which is a big help in gaining traction."

## Phase 3: Launch

"It's release time. Now people can actually go to the 'theater' and see your app."

### Launch Activities
- **Email blast** to subscribers
- **Full marketing site** goes live
- **Maximum evangelism** push
- **Blog outreach** for links
- **Progress updates** regularly

### Maintaining Momentum

"Post about your progress: How many people have signed up? What updates/tweaks have you made? Show momentum and keep at it."

## Case Study: Blinksale's Road to Launch

Josh Williams shares their successful Hollywood launch:

### Starting with Your Base

"As soon as we knew Blinksale was really going to happen, we began floating some teasers to our mailing list."

Key insight: "If you already have permission to talk to a group of people, they are the best place to start."

### Building Permission

"About six weeks before the Blinksale launch we put up a teaser page at our website that proclaimed the coming of an easier way to send invoices online."

Teaser page strategy:
- **Just enough information** to build excitement
- **Maintain suspense** without revealing sensitive details
- **Newsletter signup** prominently displayed
- **Keep it simple** - just email required

### Viral Spread

"We spread the word to a dozen or so friends and colleagues that we felt would be interested in the product as well, and they began to spread the word about the teaser page through their blogs and websites."

Result: "Within a few days, we had thousands on our mailing list."

### Beta Testing Phase

"About two weeks before we launched, we invited a handful of friends, colleagues, and industry mavens to help us beta test Blinksale."

Important notes:
- **No forced usage** or writing requirements
- **Simply wanted visibility** and natural discussion
- **Product must deliver** to build authentic buzz
- **Otherwise** "it's like clouds without rain"

### Launch Day Execution

"When launch day arrived, we sent an email to our mailing list, notified our blogging friends, and encouraged our beta testers to speak their minds."

Results: "Shortly after launch tens of thousands had visited our site and thousands of those had signed up to use the product."
