## Core Concept

**Don't split into silos.** Too many companies separate design, development, copywriting, support, and marketing into different silos. While specialization has its advantages, it also creates a situation where staffers see just their own little world instead of the entire context of the web app.

## The Problem with Organizational Silos

Traditional organizational structures create several issues:

- **Limited perspective**: Team members only see their narrow slice of the product
- **Lost in translation**: Ideas and requirements get distorted as they pass between departments
- **Disconnected experience**: The final product feels disjointed because different teams worked in isolation
- **Slower iteration**: Handoffs between silos add time and friction to the development process

## The Getting Real Approach

### Integrate Your Team

As much as possible, integrate your team so there's a healthy back-and-forth dialogue throughout the process. Set up a system of checks and balances:

- **Copywriters work with designers** to ensure messaging and visual design align
- **Support queries are seen by developers** so they understand real user pain points
- **Designers understand technical constraints** by working closely with programmers
- **Marketing understands the actual product** by being involved in development

### Hire Multi-Talented People

"Even better, hire people with multiple talents who can wear different hats during development. The end result will be a more harmonious product."

## Mental Model: Holistic Product Development

**Traditional Thinking:** Organize by functional expertise - designers design, developers develop, writers write, each in their own department.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Organize by product understanding - everyone contributes to and understands the whole product.

### Decision Framework

When structuring your team:
1. **Can this person understand contexts beyond their specialty?**
2. **Will different perspectives interact during the process?**
3. **Are we optimizing for departmental efficiency or product harmony?**

### Key Insight

A harmonious product comes from a harmonious team where everyone understands the full context, not just their specialized piece.

## Real-World Application

### Team Structure
- Create mixed teams with diverse skills working together
- Ensure regular communication between different specialties
- Build shared understanding through collaborative work sessions

### Hiring Practices
- Look for people who can contribute beyond their primary skill
- Value curiosity about other disciplines
- Prioritize product thinking over departmental thinking

### Process Design
- Include multiple perspectives in each phase of development
- Create feedback loops between support, development, and design
- Make customer insights visible to entire team

## Benefits of Unity

1. **Better products**: Integration leads to more cohesive user experiences
2. **Faster development**: Less time lost in handoffs and translation
3. **Improved morale**: Team members understand how their work fits the whole
4. **Customer focus**: Everyone sees the customer impact of their decisions
