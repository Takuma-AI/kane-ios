## Core Concept

**Use forums or chat to let customers help each other.** Forums and web-based group chat are a great way to let customers ask questions and help one another out. By eliminating the middleman — that's you — you provide an open stream of communication and save yourself time in the process.

## Mental Model: Community as Support

**Traditional Thinking:** All support must come from the company. Control all customer interactions.

**Getting Real Thinking:** Enable customers to help each other. Build community-driven support.

### Decision Framework

For community support:
1. **Can customers answer this?**
2. **Will peer advice be valuable?**
3. **Does this build community?**
4. **Can we facilitate, not control?**

### Key Insight

Your best support agents might be your customers themselves.

## The 37signals Approach

"At our product forums, customers post tips and tricks, feature requests, stories, and more."

The company role: "We pop in from time to time to offer some assistance but the forums are mainly a place for the community to help each other and share their experiences with the product."

## The Pleasant Surprise

"You'll be surprised how much people want to help one another."

This reveals:
- **Human nature** to be helpful
- **Community desire** to contribute
- **Expertise sharing** willingly
- **Pride in knowledge** display
- **Connection through** helping
