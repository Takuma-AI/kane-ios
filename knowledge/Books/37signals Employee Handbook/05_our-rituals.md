## Core Philosophy

In a fully distributed company, rituals aren't accidental—they're **intentionally designed touchpoints** that create cohesion, maintain culture, and ensure everyone stays connected to both the mission and each other.

## The Meet-up Innovation

### Twice-Yearly In-Person Gatherings
- **Frequency**: 2x per year
- **Duration**: 1 week (Sunday arrival, Friday departure)
- **Location**: Different city each time
- **Structure**: Loosely organized with purpose

### Why Meet-ups Matter
In a remote company, these gatherings serve unique purposes:
- **Relationship building** beyond Slack avatars
- **Serendipitous conversations** that don't happen remotely
- **Energy renewal** from collective presence
- **Cultural reinforcement** through shared experience

### The Loose Structure Philosophy
Monday-Thursday includes:
- Some scheduled talks
- Plenty of unstructured time
- Cross-team interactions
- Informal gatherings

**The key**: Not over-programming. Magic happens in the margins.

## Mental Model: Structured Flexibility

**Traditional approach**: Rigid conference agendas  
**37signals approach**: Framework for connection

This creates space for:
- Organic conversations
- Natural relationship building
- Unexpected collaborations
- Genuine interactions

## The All Hands Ritual

### End-of-Cycle Gatherings
- **When**: End of every 6-week cycle
- **Where**: Zoom or in-person during meet-ups
- **Who**: Entire company
- **Led by**: COO

### What Gets Covered
- Product development updates
- Business operations insights
- New hire introductions
- Department presentations
- Strategic direction

### Why This Works
- **Regular cadence** creates predictability
- **Broad coverage** ensures alignment
- **Multiple voices** prevent monotony
- **Cycle timing** provides natural reflection point

## Everyone on Support (EOS)

### The Revolutionary Practice
Every employee, regardless of role, periodically handles customer support.

### Why This Matters
- **Breaks down silos** between teams
- **Creates empathy** for customers
- **Grounds decisions** in reality
- **Democratizes** customer insight

### How It Works
- Use Help Scout for responses
- Take shifts based on availability
- No expertise required
- Support team provides backup

### The Deeper Purpose
When the CEO answers support tickets, it sends a message: **No one is too important to help customers**.

## Decision Framework for Rituals

When evaluating rituals, ask:
1. **Does this connect people?** → Keep it
2. **Has this become rote?** → Refresh it
3. **Does everyone participate?** → Make it inclusive
4. **Is the value clear?** → Communicate it

## The Anti-Ritual Stance

### What 37signals Doesn't Do
- Daily standups
- Mandatory fun events
- Forced team building
- Elaborate ceremonies

### Why Less Is More
- Respects distributed workforce
- Avoids ritual fatigue
- Maintains authenticity
- Preserves energy for work

## Communication Rituals

### Built Into the Work
Rather than separate "culture building" activities:
- **Daily updates** create visibility
- **Weekly plans** build predictability
- **Cycle kickoffs** align teams
- **Heartbeats** enable reflection

These work rituals serve double duty as cultural touchpoints.

## The Trust Underlying Rituals

### What Makes These Work
- **Voluntary participation** spirit
- **Genuine value** delivery
- **Respect for time** zones
- **Flexibility** in implementation

### What Kills Rituals
- Mandatory attendance
- Rigid formatting
- Lost purpose
- Ritual for ritual's sake

## Geographic Inclusion

### Rotating Locations
Meet-up cities vary to:
- Share travel burden
- Expose team to different cultures
- Prevent location bias
- Create new experiences

Examples: Miami, Amsterdam, Barcelona, New Orleans

## The Ritual Evolution

### Starting Points
- Begin with clear purpose
- Keep it simple
- Measure by participation
- Adjust based on feedback

### Natural Evolution
Rituals should:
- Adapt to team needs
- Reflect company growth
- Maintain core purpose
- Die when no longer serving

## Virtual Ritual Innovation

### Making Remote Connection Real
- All Hands via Zoom when not together
- Asynchronous participation options
- Recording for different timezones
- Interactive elements despite distance

## The Support Rotation Impact

### Unexpected Benefits of EOS
- **Product improvements** from direct feedback
- **Marketing insights** from customer language
- **Engineering empathy** for user struggles
- **Design clarity** from usage patterns

### Stories from the Frontlines
When everyone does support:
- Engineers fix confusing features
- Designers simplify workflows
- Marketers refine messaging
- Leaders understand ground truth

## Warning Signs

### When Rituals Go Wrong
- Attendance drops off
- Energy feels forced
- Purpose gets lost
- Becomes checkbox exercise

### Healthy Ritual Indicators
- People look forward to them
- Natural participation
- Clear value delivery
- Organic evolution

## The Competitive Advantage

These minimal but meaningful rituals create:
- **Strong culture** without constant meetings
- **Customer empathy** across all roles
- **Team cohesion** despite distance
- **Sustainable practices** over time
