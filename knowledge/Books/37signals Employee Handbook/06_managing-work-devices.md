**Mental Model:** Security Through Simplicity  
**Tags:** #device-management #security #kandji #privacy #remote-work #trust-but-verify

## Core Philosophy

"Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon."

37signals manages devices with a clear principle: **Secure the company's data without invading employees' lives**. This balance between security and privacy reflects their broader philosophy of treating employees as trustworthy adults.

## The Mac-First Approach

### Standard Issue
- Every employee receives a **new Mac** when joining
- Configured to their specifications
- Managed through **Kandji** system
- Consistent security baseline

### Why Mac?
- Unified platform simplifies support
- Strong security features built-in
- Developer-friendly environment
- Aligns with creative tools

## Mental Model: Managed Freedom

**Traditional approach**: Lock everything down, monitor everything  
**37signals approach**: Secure what matters, trust the rest

This manifests as:
- **Essential security** without surveillance
- **Clear boundaries** without micromanagement
- **Protection** without paranoia

## Security Configuration

### Kandji's Role
Automatically configures:
- **Disk encryption** (FileVault)
- **Firewall** activation
- **Password requirements**
- **Essential app** installation
- **Security updates** enforcement

### What Kandji Doesn't Do
- Monitor your screen
- Track your keystrokes
- Report your browsing
- Surveil your activities

The distinction matters: **Configuration, not surveillance**.

## The Personal Data Boundary

### Clear Directive
"Please do not keep any personal data on your 37signals-issued laptop."

### Why This Matters
- **Legal protection** for both parties
- **Clean separation** if employment ends
- **Privacy preservation** for personal life
- **Simplified device** management

### The Recommendation
Maintain a separate personal computer for:
- Personal projects
- Private communications
- Family photos/videos
- Non-work activities

## Device Trust Hierarchy

### Fully Trusted (Managed Macs)
Can access:
- VPN connections
- Code repositories
- Production systems
- Sensitive data

### Untrusted Devices (Everything Else)
- Personal phones/tablets
- Personal computers
- Linux machines
- Windows systems

Can use:
- Communication apps (Slack, email)
- Documentation systems
- Public-facing tools

Cannot access:
- Secure systems
- Source code
- Production infrastructure

## Decision Framework for Device Use

Ask yourself:
1. **Is this sensitive company data?** → Work Mac only
2. **Is this personal activity?** → Personal device
3. **Am I accessing code/systems?** → Work Mac required
4. **Is this just communication?** → Any device OK

## The Right to Reclaim

### Company Rights
37signals reserves the right to:
- **Confiscate** devices at any point
- **Access** data on work devices
- **Remote wipe** lost/stolen devices
- **Reclaim** upon employment end

### Employee Protections
- Clear policy communication
- No personal data = no personal exposure
- Transparent about capabilities
- Trust-based implementation

## Security Without Theater

### What's Actually Secured
- Source code access
- Customer data
- Production systems
- Company secrets

### What's Not Monitored
- Your work schedule
- Your productivity metrics
- Your communication frequency
- Your location

## Device Lifecycle

### Onboarding
1. Device ordered to specs
2. Kandji configuration applied
3. Essential apps installed
4. Handed to employee ready-to-work

### During Employment
- Automatic security updates
- Configuration compliance
- Support when needed
- No invasive monitoring

### Offboarding
- Remote wipe capability
- Clean data separation
- Device return process
- No personal data complications

## The Mobile Device Strategy

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
- Install work apps on personal phones
- Access email and Slack
- Considered "untrusted" by design
- No company management software

### Why This Works
- Respects personal device ownership
- Limits company liability
- Maintains security boundaries
- Reduces complexity

## Warning Signs

### Security Theater to Avoid
- Excessive monitoring software
- Productivity tracking tools
- Location monitoring
- Keystroke logging

### Actual Security Focus
- Data encryption
- Access control
- Update management
- Incident response

## The Trust Equation

More trust = Less monitoring = Better security culture = More trust

When employees feel trusted:
- They follow security policies
- They report incidents
- They protect company assets
- They maintain boundaries

## Practical Implications

### For Employees
- Keep work on work devices
- Keep personal off work devices
- Follow security basics
- Ask when uncertain

### For the Company
- Trust but verify approach
- Focus on real threats
- Avoid security theater
- Maintain clear policies

## The Competitive Advantage

This approach creates:
- **Higher compliance** through trust
- **Better security** through simplicity
- **Improved morale** through respect
- **Reduced complexity** through clarity
