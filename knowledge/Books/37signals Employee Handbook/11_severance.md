## Core Philosophy

Even endings should reflect company values. 37signals' severance policy demonstrates that **how you part ways matters as much as how you work together**. This isn't just about legal compliance—it's about treating people well through transitions.

## The Two-Path Reality

### Eligible for Severance
✅ Terminated **without cause**:
- Position eliminated
- Restructuring decisions
- Strategic changes
- Performance issues (non-misconduct)

### Not Eligible for Severance
❌ Terminated **for cause**:
- Misconduct
- Policy violations
- Insubordination
- Substance abuse

The distinction is crucial: **circumstances matter**.

## Mental Model: Proportional Support

**Traditional approach**: Minimal legal requirements  
**37signals approach**: Graduated support based on tenure

This reflects beliefs about:
- Loyalty deserving reciprocity
- Transitions requiring time
- Financial security mattering
- Relationships outlasting employment

## The Severance Formula

### Under One Year
- **4 weeks pay** (lump sum)
- Recognition that even brief employment deserves support
- Time to find next opportunity
- No cliff for benefits

### Over One Year
- **2 weeks pay per year** of employment
- Proportional to investment
- Rewards longer tenure
- Predictable calculation

### The Four-Month Cap
- **Maximum severance**: 4 months pay
- Balances generosity with sustainability
- Provides substantial runway
- Clear upper boundary

## Beyond Cash: Continued Benefits

### Health Insurance Extension
Coverage continues for:
- Employee
- Dependents
- Transition period
- Critical protection

This recognizes that **health security shouldn't end with employment**.

### Compensation for Unused Time
Full payment for:
- **Unused vacation** days
- **Unused sabbatical** time (1-year lookback)

The message: **You earned it, you keep it**.

## The Exchange

### General Release Required
Severance comes with:
- Release of liabilities
- Standard legal protections
- Clear closure
- Professional conclusion

This isn't punitive—it's practical for both parties.

### What This Means
- No future claims
- Clean break
- Focus forward
- Protect everyone

## Decision Framework for Employees

If facing termination:
1. **Understand the cause** → Determines eligibility
2. **Calculate your tenure** → Know your formula
3. **Review unused time** → Maximize payout
4. **Consider the release** → Understand implications

## The Hourly Rate Calculation

Final compensation uses:
- Your hourly rate
- Standard calculations
- Clear methodology
- No ambiguity

This ensures **fairness and transparency** in final payments.
