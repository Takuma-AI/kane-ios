## Core Philosophy

"Approach work relationships defaulting to trust and positivity."

37signals' Code of Conduct isn't a lengthy legal document—it's a **practical framework for working together** that assumes good intentions while maintaining clear boundaries for unacceptable behavior.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Assume Good Intentions
- Default to trust
- Start with positivity
- Give benefit of doubt
- Avoid cynicism

### 2. Work Transparently
- Operate "in the open"
- Share knowledge freely
- Document decisions
- Avoid information silos

### 3. Be Respectful and Empathetic
- Consider others' perspectives
- Communicate kindly
- Value diverse viewpoints
- Practice patience

### 4. Embrace Learning and Teaching
- Stay open to new ideas
- Share expertise generously
- Accept feedback gracefully
- Admit when wrong

## Mental Model: Adult Professionalism

**Traditional approach**: Dense policies covering every scenario  
**37signals approach**: Trust professionals to act professionally

This means:
- **Principles over rules**
- **Judgment over prescription**
- **Culture over compliance**
- **Trust over surveillance**

## Clear Boundaries

### The Non-Negotiables
Despite the trust-first approach, some behaviors are absolutely unacceptable:

❌ **Discrimination** of any kind  
❌ **Harassment** in any form  
❌ **Illegal activities**  
❌ **Egregiously unethical behavior**  
❌ **Political debates** on work systems  

### The Political Boundary
"The company does not publicly weigh in on politics."

Internal communication systems are for work, not:
- Political arguments
- Partisan debates
- Campaign advocacy
- Ideological battles

This keeps the workplace focused and inclusive.

## Conflict Resolution

### Most Conflicts Don't Need Formal Process
The reality: **Most interpersonal conflicts can be resolved directly**.

Before formal reporting, consider:
- Direct conversation
- Manager mediation
- Team discussion
- Time and perspective

### When Formal Reporting Is Needed
Some situations require official intervention:
- Discrimination incidents
- Harassment experiences
- Illegal activities
- Repeated boundary violations

## The Reporting Framework

### Multiple Reporting Channels
- **Your manager** (if comfortable)
- **People Ops team** (for any issue)
- **Anonymous reporting** (extreme circumstances)
- **EEOC filing** (can pursue simultaneously)

### Confidentiality Promise
- Reports handled discretely
- Information shared minimally
- Protection from retaliation
- Professional investigation

### No Retaliation Policy
Absolute protection for:
- Good faith reporters
- Witnesses
- Investigation participants
- Those seeking help

## Consequences That Matter

### Documentation
All violations are **permanently documented** in personnel files. This creates:
- Accountability trail
- Pattern recognition
- Protection for all
- Serious consequences

### Escalating Responses
Depending on severity:
1. **Mandatory training** (education first)
2. **Formal reprimand** (documented warning)
3. **Termination** (when necessary)

The response matches the violation.

## Decision Framework

When uncertain about behavior:
1. **Would I do this in person?** → Digital doesn't change standards
2. **Does this build trust?** → Core value test
3. **Is this respectful?** → Empathy check
4. **Am I being transparent?** → Openness verification

## The Feedback Culture

### Constructive Feedback Expected
Both giving and receiving feedback should be:
- **Specific** not general
- **Actionable** not vague
- **Timely** not delayed
- **Kind** not cruel

### Growth Mindset
Feedback is about:
- Improving together
- Learning continuously
- Building excellence
- Supporting success

## Creating Psychological Safety

### What This Looks Like
- Questions welcomed
- Mistakes acknowledged
- Ideas shared freely
- Concerns raised safely

### What This Enables
- Innovation through risk-taking
- Learning from failures
- Diverse perspectives
- Honest communication

## The Competitive Advantage

This code of conduct creates:
- **Higher trust** enabling speed
- **Better collaboration** across distance
- **Stronger culture** despite remote work
- **Clearer focus** on work that matters

## Warning Signs

### Individual Level
- Avoiding transparency
- Resisting feedback
- Creating silos
- Spreading negativity

### Team Level
- Gossip increasing
- Trust eroding
- Conflicts escalating
- Productivity declining

## Living the Code

### Daily Practice
- Start conversations with trust
- Share work openly
- Give feedback kindly
- Learn from everyone

### Long-term Impact
- Relationships strengthen
- Culture deepens
- Work improves
- Company thrives

## The Underlying Message

This code of conduct says:
- **We hire adults**
- **We expect professionalism**
- **We protect everyone**
- **We value our culture**

## Special Considerations

### Remote Work Challenges
Distance can make it easier to:
- Misinterpret tone
- Feel disconnected
- Avoid difficult conversations
- Forget human element

The code counters these with intentional culture.

### International Considerations
With employees worldwide:
- Cultural sensitivity matters
- Legal requirements vary
- Communication styles differ
- Unity requires effort

The principles transcend boundaries.
