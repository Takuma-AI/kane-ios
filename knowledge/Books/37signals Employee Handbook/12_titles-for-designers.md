## Core Philosophy

The designer career track at 37signals reflects a unique belief: **Great designers shape both pixels and product strategy**. This isn't just about making things pretty—it's about deeply understanding users, technology, and business to create experiences that matter.

## The Designer's Dual Nature

### Creative + Technical
Unlike many companies that separate "creative" from "technical," 37signals expects designers to:

## Decision Framework for Designer Growth
