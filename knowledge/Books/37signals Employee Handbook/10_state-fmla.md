# Chapter 10: State Leave Provisions

**Book:** Employee Handbook  
**Section:** Policies & Compliance  
**Mental Model:** Localized Support  
**Tags:** #family-leave #state-benefits #parental-leave #caregiving #compliance #work-life-balance

## Core Philosophy

37signals recognizes that **life happens differently in different places**. Rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach, they adapt to local regulations while maintaining their commitment to supporting employees through major life events.

## The State-by-State Reality

### Why This Matters
As a distributed company with employees across the US:
- Different states offer different benefits
- Local laws provide varying protections
- Employees deserve access to all available support
- Compliance requires local knowledge

## State-Specific Programs

### California Paid Family Leave
**Coverage:**
- Up to **8 weeks** for bonding with new child
- Up to **8 weeks** for family member care

**Critical limitation:** "Does not provide job protection, only monetary benefits"

This means you get paid but aren't guaranteed your job back—a crucial distinction.

### Colorado Family and Medical Leave
**Most comprehensive coverage:**
- Up to **16 weeks** for child bonding
- Up to **12 weeks** for family care
- Up to **12 weeks** for self-care (serious illness)
- Up to **12 weeks** for military family needs
- Up to **12 weeks** for domestic violence safe leave

Colorado leads in progressive leave policies.

### Oregon Paid Leave
**Balanced approach:**
- Up to **14 weeks** for child bonding
- Up to **12 weeks** for family care
- Up to **12 weeks** for safe leave (domestic violence)

Oregon splits the difference between California and Colorado.

## Mental Model: Additive Benefits

**Traditional approach**: Company policy replaces state benefits  
**37signals approach**: Company benefits stack with state programs

This means employees get:
- State-mandated benefits
- Plus company benefits
- Maximum possible support
- No either/or choices

## Decision Framework

When considering leave:
1. **Check your state's provisions** → Know what's available
2. **Understand job protection** → Some states don't guarantee it
3. **Coordinate with 37signals** → Stack benefits appropriately
4. **Plan your return** → Smooth reintegration

## The Complexity Challenge
