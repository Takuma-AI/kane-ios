## Core Philosophy

"Advancing your career at 37signals doesn't mean giving up on your craft."

In a world that typically equates career advancement with management responsibilities, 37signals has built a system where **mastery matters more than hierarchy**. You can reach the highest levels of compensation and impact while still doing the work you love.

## The 5-Level Framework

### Universal Career Progression
Every department uses the same structure:
1. **Junior (L1)** - Learning the ropes
2. **Mid-level (L2)** - Competent contributor  
3. **Senior (L3)** - Expert practitioner
4. **Lead (L4)** - Technical leader and mentor
5. **Principal (L5)** - Industry-leading innovator

### The Reality Check
- **Most employees** will not progress beyond Senior
- **Principal level** is exceptionally rare
- **This is by design**, not limitation
- **Senior level** represents sustainable expertise

## Mental Model: Depth Over Breadth

**Traditional career path**: Individual Contributor → Manager → Director → VP  
**37signals path**: Practitioner → Expert → Master → Innovator

### Why This Matters
- Preserves expertise in roles
- Avoids the "Peter Principle"
- Values craft mastery
- Creates sustainable careers

## Progression Timelines

### Expected Velocity
- **Junior → Mid-level**: ~2 years
- **Mid-level → Senior**: ~2 years
- **Senior → Lead**: When exceptional impact demonstrated
- **Lead → Principal**: Rare, based on innovation

### The 4-Year Checkpoint
Juniors should reach Senior within 4 years. If not, there's likely a mismatch between role and person.

## Compensation Philosophy

### Top 10% Pay Strategy
- Benchmarked against **San Francisco market rates**
- Applied **globally** regardless of location
- **$73,500 minimum** salary floor
- Recognition that great talent is worth premium pay

### Radical Pay Equity
"Everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the same."

This means:
- **No negotiation** advantages
- **No gender** pay gaps
- **No favoritism** in compensation
- **Complete transparency** potential

### Annual Compensation Review
- Every **November** for all employees
- Market adjustment considerations
- Performance not tied to compensation
- Predictable, fair process

## Performance Reviews

### First Year Cadence
- **3 months**: Initial adjustment check
- **6 months**: Progress assessment
- **12 months**: Full performance review

### Ongoing Reviews
- **Annual** on your employment anniversary
- Clear performance metrics
- Frequent informal feedback
- No surprises philosophy

## The Promotion Process

### How Promotions Work
1. **Manager identifies** readiness
2. **Clear criteria** for next level
3. **Demonstrated impact** required
4. **Compensation adjusts** with level

### What Promotions Aren't
- Not automatic with tenure
- Not about managing people
- Not the only way to grow
- Not expected for everyone

## Performance Improvement

### When PIPs Make Sense
Performance Improvement Plans for:
- **Short-term** skill gaps
- **Coachable** behaviors
- **Specific** improvements needed
- **Reasonable** timeline to improve

### When PIPs Don't Apply
No PIP for fundamental mismatches:
- Core job skills lacking
- Values misalignment
- Consistent underperformance
- Better to part ways respectfully

## Decision Framework for Career Growth

Consider these questions:
1. **Am I growing in my craft?** → Focus on skill development
2. **Is my impact increasing?** → Look for bigger challenges
3. **Do I want to manage?** → Consider if leadership fits
4. **Am I sustainably engaged?** → Balance growth with life

## Alternative Growth Paths

### Beyond Vertical Progression
- **Skill expansion** within role
- **Project leadership** without title
- **Mentorship** and teaching
- **Cross-functional** collaboration
- **External speaking** and writing
