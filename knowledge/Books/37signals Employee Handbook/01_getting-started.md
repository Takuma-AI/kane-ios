## Core Philosophy

"Your responsibilities and impact will increase as you learn and gain confidence over the next few months."

37signals' onboarding is designed as a **gradual, supportive process** that recognizes new employees need time to integrate into a fully remote, autonomous culture. Rather than overwhelming newcomers, they provide structured support while building toward independence.

## The Remote-First Onboarding Model

### Pre-Arrival Preparation
Before your first day, 37signals demonstrates their operational efficiency:
- **Equipment ordering**: People team orders your laptop to your exact specifications
- **Manager coordination**: Direct instructions for Day 1 sent in advance
- **Account setup**: Ops team begins preparing your digital workspace

This isn't just logistics—it's setting expectations for a company that **values preparation and clear communication**.

### Day One: The Digital Welcome

Your first day centers around a personalized Basecamp project: **"Welcome, [your name]!"**

This project contains:
- Customized onboarding to-do lists
- Links to essential resources
- Clear next steps

The personalization signals that you're not just employee #X, but an individual whose successful integration matters.

## The Support Network

37signals provides multiple layers of support, recognizing that **different questions require different experts**:

### Your Manager
- Sets up regular 1:1s from day one
- Guides role-specific learning
- Helps navigate team dynamics

### Your 37signals Buddy
- Informal support system
- Cultural translator
- Safe space for "dumb questions"

### People Ops Team
- Policy clarification
- Benefits navigation
- Administrative support

### Ops Team
- Technical setup (hello@37signals-it.com)
- System access
- Tool training

## Mental Model: Gradual Responsibility Ramp

Traditional onboarding: "Here's everything, good luck!"  
37signals approach: "Here's what you need today, we'll build from there."

### The 90-Day Arc
- **Days 1-30**: Foundation building, learning systems, meeting people
- **Days 31-60**: Taking on real work with support
- **Days 61-90**: Operating with increasing independence
- **Day 90+**: Fully integrated team member

Most employees report feeling **fully comfortable and productive within three months**.

## Technology & Security Integration

### Device Management
- **Kandji**: Mac device management system
- **Shipshape**: Additional device configuration
- **Security-first approach**: Proper setup before access

This reflects their philosophy: **Get the foundation right before building on top**.

### Key Systems Introduction
- Basecamp for project management
- Communication tools and protocols
- Role-specific applications

## First Week Rituals

### Essential Meetings
1. **Manager 1:1**: Establish communication patterns
2. **Team check-in**: Meet your immediate colleagues  
3. **Buddy introduction**: Connect with your cultural guide
4. **People Ops session**: Understand policies and benefits

### Self-Directed Learning
- Read through handbook
- Explore Basecamp projects
- Begin understanding team workflows

## Decision Framework for New Employees

When uncertain about something:
1. **Is this covered in documentation?** → Check handbook/Basecamp
2. **Is this role-specific?** → Ask your manager
3. **Is this culture/informal?** → Ask your buddy
4. **Is this policy/benefits?** → Contact People Ops
5. **Is this technical?** → Email Ops team

## The Underlying Message

The comprehensive onboarding process sends clear signals:
- **We invest in your success**
- **Remote doesn't mean alone**
- **Structure enables autonomy**
- **Questions are encouraged**

## Warning Signs to Avoid

### For New Employees:
- Don't try to absorb everything immediately
- Don't hesitate to use your support network
- Don't assume you should know everything already

### For Managers:
- Don't dump everything on day one
- Don't assume knowledge transfers automatically
- Don't forget regular check-ins during first 90 days

## Integration Success Metrics

You'll know onboarding is working when:
- You understand where to find information
- You know who to ask for different types of help  
- You're contributing to real work
- You feel part of the team despite being remote
