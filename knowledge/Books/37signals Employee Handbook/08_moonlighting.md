## Core Philosophy

"We want to support opportunities that help you grow and make life interesting."

37signals recognizes that **creative professionals have interests beyond their day job**, and rather than forbidding outside work, they've created a framework that supports growth while protecting the company's interests.

## The Moonlighting Spectrum

### Green Light Activities
✅ **Occasional side gigs** (free or paid)  
✅ **Speaking engagements** (not excessive)  
✅ **Side businesses** (minimal time commitment)  
✅ **Advisory roles** (few hours/month)  
✅ **Volunteer work** (in moderation)  

### Red Light Activities
❌ **Competitor employment** (same industry)  
❌ **Speaking circuit career** (extensive travel)  
❌ **Competitor consulting** (direct conflict)  
❌ **Aggressive side-work marketing**  
❌ **Work-hours side projects** (time theft)  

## Mental Model: Reasonable Boundaries

**Traditional approach**: Ban all outside work  
**37signals approach**: Support growth, prevent conflicts

This creates space for:
- Personal development
- Industry contribution
- Financial diversity
- Creative outlets

While preventing:
- Divided loyalty
- Performance degradation
- Competitive conflicts
- Time theft

## The Decision Framework

### Four Key Questions
When considering moonlighting, ask:

1. **Is the work competitive?**
   - Same industry? Likely no
   - Different field? Likely yes
   - Gray area? Ask your manager

2. **Does it consume disproportionate time?**
   - Few hours/month? Fine
   - Every evening? Problem
   - Occasional weekend? Reasonable

3. **Will it require work-hours absence?**
   - After hours only? Good
   - Occasional time off? Discuss
   - Regular conflicts? Not viable

4. **Does it use the same skills 37signals pays for?**
   - Complementary skills? Encouraged
   - Exact same work? Questionable
   - Building on expertise? Case-by-case

## The Trust Equation

"Lenient within reason, strict if we see impact"

This policy works because:
- **Trust is extended** first
