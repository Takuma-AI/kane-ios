## Core Philosophy

37signals' benefits package reflects a fundamental belief: **Take care of people so they can do their best work**. This isn't about competing on perks but creating sustainable, meaningful support for employees' whole lives.

## Health & Wellness Coverage

### Medical Insurance (US Employees)
- **Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO**
- Company pays **75%** of premium
- Employee pays **25%**
- Coverage starts **day one** (no waiting period)

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **Dental**: MetLife (100% company-paid)
- **Vision**: MetLife (100% company-paid)
- **Life Insurance**: $400,000 policy (100% company-paid)
- **Short-Term Disability**: Up to 70% salary replacement

### International Employee Support
For employees outside the US:
- **75% reimbursement** of health insurance costs
- Capped at equivalent US plan costs
- Flexibility to choose local providers

## Mental Model: Trust-Based Benefits

**Traditional approach**: Rigid policies with extensive documentation  
**37signals approach**: Flexible guidelines with employee discretion

This shows up in policies like:
- **Flexible sick time** (no set number of days)
- **Work-from-anywhere** philosophy
- **Self-managed time off** coordination

## Time Off Philosophy

### Structured Flexibility
- **20 days** vacation/personal time
- **11 local holidays** (based on your location)
- **No rollover** - encouraging actual rest
- **Flexible sick time** - take what you need

### The Sabbatical Program
Every **3 years**, employees receive a **6-week paid sabbatical**:
- Fully disconnected time
- No work expectations
- Designed for true renewal
- Recognition that creativity needs rest

### Summer Hours
**May through August**: 4-day work weeks
- Same pay, fewer hours
- Acknowledges seasonal rhythms
- Forces prioritization of important work
- **"If we can't get done what we need in 32 hours, we're doing too much"**

## Financial Security

### Retirement Planning
**US Employees (401k)**:
- **100% match** up to 6% of salary
- Immediate vesting
- Automated enrollment available

**International Employees**:
- Matching contributions to local retirement accounts
- Same 6% match principle
- Adapted to local regulations

### Profit Sharing
After **2 years** of employment:
- **10% of annual profits** distributed to employees
- Based on tenure-weighted formula
- **Important philosophy**: "We ask that you think of any compensation from this program as not something to be counted upon"

This reflects realistic expectations while sharing success.

### Potential Liquidity Events
If the company is ever sold:
- **10% of proceeds** to employee pool
- Distribution based on tenure
- Again, positioned as **potential, not promised**

## Work Environment Support

### Home Office Setup
**First year**: $3,000 expense budget
- No approval needed under limit
- Trust employees to create productive spaces
- Recognizes remote work requires investment

### Ongoing Workspace Needs
- **$200/month** coworking space stipend
- Flexibility for different work styles
- No questions asked under limit

### Digital Tools
- **Free personal Basecamp account** for life
- **Free HEY email account**
- Using the tools you build creates better products

## Decision Framework for Benefits Usage

When considering benefit usage:
1. **Will this help me do better work?** → Use home office budget
2. **Do I need this for my health/family?** → Take the time off
3. **Is this supporting my long-term security?** → Maximize retirement match
4. **Am I being reasonable and fair?** → Trust your judgment

## The "No Surprises" Principle

Benefits are designed to be:
- **Clear**: No hidden conditions
- **Accessible**: Start immediately
- **Sustainable**: Built to last
- **Fair**: Same rules for everyone

## What's Notably Missing

37signals **doesn't** offer:
- Fancy office perks (they're remote)
- Unlimited PTO (they prefer clarity)
- Equity compensation (profit sharing instead)
- Complicated vesting schedules

These omissions are **intentional choices** reflecting their values.

## The Underlying Message

The benefits package communicates:
- **We trust you** to make good decisions
- **We support your whole life**, not just work hours
- **We believe in sustainability** over flash
- **We share success** when it happens

## Managing Benefits Responsibly

### Employee Responsibilities:
- Coordinate time off with your team
- Use benefits reasonably
- Think long-term about retirement
- Communicate needs clearly

### Company Philosophy:
- Benefits should enhance, not complicate
- Trust over surveillance
- Clarity over complexity
- Sustainability over trends
