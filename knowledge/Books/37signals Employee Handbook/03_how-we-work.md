# Chapter 3: How We Work

**Book:** Employee Handbook  
**Section:** Work Philosophy & Culture  
**Mental Model:** Asynchronous Autonomy  
**Tags:** #remote-work #async-communication #work-cycles #deep-work #40-hour-week #managers-of-one

## Core Philosophy

"Collaborate as though most things... will get an answer eventually, not right this second."

37signals has built a **fully distributed company** working across **5 continents** on the principle that great work happens when people have **autonomy, clear expectations, and uninterrupted time to think**.

## The Asynchronous Advantage

### Why Async Wins
Traditional synchronous work creates:
- Constant interruptions
- Timezone tyranny  
- Meeting overload
- Shallow work

37signals' async approach enables:
- **Deep focused work**
- **Global talent access**
- **Thoughtful responses**
- **Work-life flexibility**

### The Four Communication Rituals

#### 1. Daily "What did you work on?" Updates
- Posted at end of your day
- Brief summary of accomplishments
- Creates visibility without meetings
- Builds team awareness asynchronously

#### 2. Weekly Work Plans
- Posted Monday mornings
- What you intend to accomplish
- Creates predictability for teammates
- Allows coordination without synchronization

#### 3. Cycle Kickoffs
- Every 6 weeks at cycle start
- What each team is building
- Why it matters
- Sets context for the cycle

#### 4. Cycle Heartbeats
- End of each 6-week cycle
- Retrospective on what happened
- Lessons learned
- Continuous improvement mindset

## Mental Model: Managers of One

**Traditional thinking**: Employees need constant supervision  
**37signals thinking**: Hire adults who manage themselves

### What "Manager of One" Means
- **Set your own hours** (within reason)
- **Organize your own work**
- **Make decisions independently**
- **Take responsibility for outcomes**

### The Trust Equation
More trust = Less process = Better work = More trust

This virtuous cycle drives their entire work philosophy.

## The 6-Week Cycle System

### How Cycles Work
- **6 weeks on**: Focused project work
- **2 weeks off**: Cooldown period
- **Clear boundaries**: No project overlap
- **Full commitment**: Teams own their work

### Why 6 Weeks?
- Long enough to build something meaningful
- Short enough to maintain urgency
- Natural rhythm for planning
- Prevents endless projects

### The Cooldown Innovation
Those 2 weeks between cycles for:
- Technical debt cleanup
- Experimental projects
- Learning and development
- Catching your breath

## The 40-Hour Week (32 in Summer)

### Work Doesn't Expand to Fill Time
"If we can't get done what we need in 32 hours, we're doing too much."

This constraint **forces prioritization** and **prevents burnout**.

### Summer Hours Philosophy
May through August = 4-day weeks because:
- Life has seasons
- Creativity needs rest
- Constraints improve focus
- People > Productivity

### Handling Exceptions
Sometimes work requires more:
- Emergency fixes
- Critical deadlines
- Customer crises

**The rule**: Take compensatory time off. Sustainability matters.

## Location Independence

### Work From Anywhere
- No location requirements
- No timezone mandates
- No "core hours"
- Trust over surveillance

### The Responsibility Side
With freedom comes accountability:
- Maintain communication rhythms
- Be available when needed
- Deliver on commitments
- Respect team coordination needs

## Decision Framework for Daily Work

Ask yourself:
1. **Is this urgent or important?** → Important usually wins
2. **Do I need an answer now?** → Probably not, go async
3. **Am I respecting others' focus time?** → Batch communications
4. **Is this sustainable?** → Adjust if not

## Meeting Philosophy

### Meetings Are Toxic Because They:
- Break up the day
- Require synchronization
- Often lack clear outcomes
- Multiply with attendees

### When Meetings Make Sense:
- Kickoff discussions
- Sensitive conversations
- Creative brainstorming
- Rapid decision-making

**Default to async, meet by exception.**

## The Deep Work Imperative

### Creating Conditions for Flow
- **Long uninterrupted blocks** of time
- **Clear priorities** from cycles
- **Minimal status updates** via async check-ins
- **Permission to disconnect** from real-time chat

### What This Enables
- Complex problem solving
- Creative breakthroughs
- Quality output
- Sustainable pace

## Tools That Support This Philosophy

- **Basecamp**: Project management and async communication
- **HEY**: Email without the urgency addiction
- **Cycle planning**: Clear 6-week horizons
- **Written culture**: Documentation over meetings

## Warning Signs of Work Style Drift

### Individual Level:
- Working beyond 40 hours regularly
- Constant real-time availability
- Meeting overload
- Shallow task switching

### Team Level:
- Expecting immediate responses
- Scheduling across time zones
- Unclear priorities
- Process over outcomes

## The Competitive Advantage

This work style creates:
- **Higher quality output** from deep work
- **Better work-life integration** 
- **Global talent access**
- **Sustainable business practices**

Companies stuck in synchronous, location-based work can't compete with this model's advantages.
