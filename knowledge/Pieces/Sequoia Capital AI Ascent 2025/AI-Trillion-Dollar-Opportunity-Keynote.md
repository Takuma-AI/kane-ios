## Executive Summary

Sequoia Capital's partners present their updated framework for the AI transition, comparing it to the cloud transition but noting it's "at least an order of magnitude bigger." They outline the massive market opportunity, acceleration of technology adoption, and specific strategies for AI companies to compete in an increasingly crowded application layer.

## Market Analysis Framework: The Don Valentine Questions

### "So What?" - Market Size and Scope

**The Scale Comparison**: Cloud vs AI Transition
> "The cloud at 400 billion of revenue is bigger than the global software market when that transition began. If we reasoned by analogy, the market we're going after in the world of AI, services, the starting point is at least an order of magnitude bigger."

**Expanded Market Attack Surface**
> "We've actually updated our thinking. It's not just the services market that AI is going after. It's both services and software. Means that both of these profit pools are under attack. We've seen plenty of companies that start with software, gets a little bit smarter, becomes more of a co-pilot, gets a little bit smarter, becomes more of an autopilot, and they actually progress from selling a tool into software budget to selling an outcome, to selling work into labor budget."

### "Why Now?" - Technology Infrastructure Convergence

**The Stack is Ready**
> "AI is, in fact, imminent, not just inevitable. The present conditions are in place. Compute, networks, data, distribution, talent. We have all the ingredients we need, so we're ready to go."

**The Physics of Distribution Have Changed**
Three requirements for distribution success:
1. People have to know about your thing
2. They have to want your thing  
3. They have to be able to buy your thing

**Dramatic Acceleration in Adoption**
> "November 30, 2022, Chatchee PT comes out. The entire world is paying attention to AI... Somewhere between 1.2 and 1.8 billion people on these platforms today... Today it's 5.6 billion [people connected to internet]. It's effectively every household and every business in the world."

The infrastructure transformation:
> "It means the rails are in place. And when the starting gun went off, there were no barriers to adoption. This is not an AI specific phenomenon. This is the new reality of technology distribution, the physics have changed."

## Strategic Positioning: Where Value Will Accrue

### The Application Layer Thesis

**Value Concentration Pattern**
> "These logos represent the companies that got to a billion plus of revenue... during prior transitions. Most of them are at the top of the page. Most of them are at the application layer. We have believed and we continue to believe that the same will be true for AI. The value is at the application layer."

**The Competitive Reality**
> "But guess what? You got competition. We got a second scaling law. We got test time compute. We got reasoning with tool use and inter agent communication. That allows the foundation models to get pretty far into the application layer."

**Startup Defense Strategy**
> "What do you do if you're a startup and you're not building a vertically integrated business? Go from the customer back. Think vertical specific. Think function specific. Think with complex problems, it might require human in the loop."

### The Leone Merchandising Cycle for AI

**Building Moats Across the Value Chain**
> "Your customer is not sure what they want out of AI. You can have an opinion. You can give them an end to end solution that just solves the problem as opposed to throwing a tool over the fence. You can build data flywheels with the usage data of your own product. That's something that nobody else has."

**Industry-Specific Advantages**
> "You can be of the industry for the industry, kind of like what open evidence does for the medical industry. You can speak their language, Harvey sends lawyers in to talk with law firms."

## Investment Criteria: The AI-Specific 5%

### 1. Revenue Quality Assessment

**The "Vibrevenue" Warning**
> "Point number one, revenue. Vibrevenue can kill you. Everybody loves Vibrevenue. It feels so good. Oh my God, we have so much revenue. Go look at it. Okay. Is it tire kicking? Are you actually creating durable behavior change?"

**Real Metrics Matter**
> "Respect the adoption, the engagement, the retention, what are people actually doing with your products? And don't delude yourself in a thinking you have real revenue when you have Vibrevenue because it'll bite you, okay?"

### 2. Trust and Customer Relationship

**The Good Vibes Imperative**
> "You need good vibes to their customers. What does it mean? Your customers have to trust you and you have to earn that trust. This is more important than your product at this point in time. Where we are in the cycle. The products will get better. If they trust you to make it better, you're in good shape."

### 3. Margin Trajectory

**Cost Structure Evolution**
> "We don't necessarily care where your gross margin is today. The cogs component of that is probably going to keep going down. Cosper token is down 99% in the last 12 to 18 months. That cost curve is going to continue."

**Value Chain Progression**
> "If you are successfully marching from selling a tool to selling an outcome and you're going up that value chain and you can capture more of that value, your price point is probably going to go up to."

### 4. Data Flywheel Reality Check

**The Business Metric Test**
> "Raise your hand if you got a data flywheel. That business metric does that data flywheel move. Okay, I see less certainty. I got good news, I got bad news. Good news is, if you can't answer that question, I still love you. The bad news is your data flywheel is bullshit."

**Meaningful Differentiation**
> "Either you don't have a data flywheel or it just doesn't matter. It needs to tie to a business metric or it just doesn't matter. This is really important because this is one of the best modes that you can build."

## Current State Assessment: 2024 Year in Review

### User Engagement Breakthrough

**The Engagement Turnaround**
> "Back in 2023, we showed this chart of the ratio of daily to monthly active users for AI native applications versus for traditional mobile apps. And the punchline at the time was that AI apps had terrible engagement ratios, hype exceeded reality in the data. We're very pleased to report that that punchline has now changed dramatically."

**ChatGPT's Success Story**
> "It's been stunning to see, for example, the daily monthly active ratio for chat GPT climbed the curve and now getting close to reddit levels. I think this is extremely good news. It means that more and more of us are getting value out of AI."

### Breakthrough Application Categories

**Voice Technology Crossing the Uncanny Valley**
> "2024 gave us what I would call the her moment for voice. And voice generation went from almost there to fully crossing the uncanny valley."

**Coding Reaches Product-Market Fit**
> "Finally, the breakout application category of the year was coding, which reached screaming product market fit. Anthropics, clawed three, five, sonnet, dropped last fall, triggering a rapid vibe shift in the coding landscape."

**Accessibility Revolution**
> "Whether you're a veteran 10X engineer or somebody who has no idea how to code, we do think that AI is fundamentally changing the accessibility, the speed, and the economics of software creation."

### Technical Progress and Limitations

**Pre-training Scaling Challenges**
> "From the technology back, the bad news is that pre-training does seem to be slowing down. We've scaled pre-training by 9 or 10 orders of magnitude since the AlexNet days. And that means that a lot of the low hanging fruit has been picked."

**New Scaling Breakthrough: Reasoning**
> "The most important breakthrough was reasoning from OpenAI... It's not just reasoning, it's synthetic data, it's tool use, it's a genetic scaffolding, all of these things are combining, combining to create new ways for us to scale intelligence."

**Research-Product Innovation Boundary**
> "A lot of the most exciting technology innovation in AI right now is happening at that blurry boundary between research and product. And I think the two breakthrough examples of this over the last year were deep research and notebook LM."

## Agent Economy: The Next Wave

### From Assistants to Economy

**Evolution Path Prediction**
> "A year ago, AI sent was all about agents. We were talking about agents and they were just beginning to form into businesses. The topic was really these machine assistants that eventually we predicted would come together as machine networks."

**Agent Economy Definition**
> "An agent economy is one which agents don't just communicate information. They transfer resources. They can make transactions. They keep track of each other. They understand trust and reliability and they actually have their own economy."

**Human-Agent Collaboration**
> "Well, this economy doesn't cut out humans. It's all about humans. The agents work with the people and the people work with the agents in this agent economy."

### Technical Requirements for Agent Economy

**1. Persistent Identity Challenge**
> "When we talk about persistent identity, we really mean two things. The first is the agent itself needs to be persistent. If you're doing business with someone and they change day to day, you probably won't be doing business with them for very long."

> "The second type of persistence is understanding you. Similarly, if you're doing business with a person and they don't remember anything about you, they can hardly remember your name. That's also a big challenge to trust and reliability."

**2. Communication Protocols**
> "Imagine personal computing without seamless communication protocols, no TCP IP, no internet. We're just now building that protocol later and there's certainly a lot of excitement around MCP."

**3. Security Infrastructure**
> "If you can't meet the person you're doing business with, palm to palm, face to face, that importance of security and trust is even further elevated. You can't with agents."

## Mindset Shifts for the AI Era

### The Stochastic Mindset

**Departure from Determinism**
> "The stochastic mindset is a departure from determinism. You know, a lot of us fell in love with computer science because it was so deterministic, right? You program the computer to do something, it does it, even if that results in a sag fault."

**New Computing Reality**
> "If you ask a computer to remember the number 73, it'll remember that tomorrow, next week, next month. If you ask a person or an AI, well, it might remember 73. It might remember 37, 72, 74, the next prime, 79, or nothing at all."

### Management Mindset Evolution

**From IC to Manager Thinking**
> "And this management mindset is going to be all about understanding what your agents can and can't do for you. Everybody knows that being a really good IC engineer is pretty different from being a great engineering manager."

**Leverage with Uncertainty**
> "Way more leverage with significantly less certainty. We're entering a world where you can do more, but you have to be able to manage that uncertainty and manage risks."

## Strategic Imperative: Velocity

### The Market Vacuum

**Market Forces in Play**
> "Nature hits a vacuum. There is a tremendous sucking sound in the market right now for AI. All of the macroeconomic stuff, tariffs and interest rate, noise doesn't matter. The rising tide of technology adoption absolutely swamps any of the volatility that you see in the markets."

**Urgency of Action**
> "There is a tremendous sucking sound in the market. And if you don't get in front of it, somebody else will because nature hates a vacuum... you are in a run-like heck business right now. Now is the time to go at maximum velocity all of the time."

## Key Predictions and Trends

### Agent-First Companies
> "Another prediction is that many of these new companies will be agents first, and that the agencies companies are selling will evolve from prototype so they're often just pieced together today to ones that are really robust."

### Vertical Agent Specialization
> "Vertical agents are a wonderful opportunity for startup founders who deeply understand the domain. And we see companies creating agents that are trained end-to-end to excel in a very specific workflow."

**Evidence of Vertical Agent Success**:
- Security: Expo outperforming human penetration testers
- DevOps: Traversal creating superior AI troubleshooters  
- Networking: Meter exceeding networking engineers

### The Abundance Era Preview
> "We're entering an abundance era. Code as the first market category to tip will offer us a preview into what that abundance era actually means. What happens when labor is cheap and plentiful? Are we going to get a bunch of AI slop? And what happens when taste becomes the scarce asset?"

## Company Building Philosophy

### The 95/5 Rule
> "95% of building a company in AI is just building a company. It's the same old stuff. It's all an important problem in a unique and compelling way. Get great people to follow you, all that good stuff. The other 5% is AI specific."

### Future Vision: Organizational Transformation
> "Eventually, these processes and agents are going to merge. You're going to have neural networks within very large complex neural networks, a network of these neural networks. And this is going to change everything. It's going to reinvent individual work. It's going to rewire companies. And it's going to recreate the economy."
