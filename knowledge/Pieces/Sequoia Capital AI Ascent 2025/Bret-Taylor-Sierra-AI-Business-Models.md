## Executive Summary

Bret Taylor, former Facebook CTO and current Sierra CEO/OpenAI Chairman, presents his framework for the AI ecosystem, predicting outcomes-based pricing will displace SaaS subscriptions as AI agents become companies' primary digital interfaces. He advocates for vertical specialization and discusses the transformation from selling productivity to selling outcomes.

## The Three-Market AI Framework

### 1. Foundation Models: Capital-Intensive Consolidation
> "I think there's going to be a ton of consolidation in the foundation model market. It's fundamentally just a capital intensive business just like building data centers. Effectively it is building data centers you know at the core of the expense... I think it'll end up a little bit like the cloud infrastructure market, a handful of players, relatively low margin, but very very high scale and sort of collecting taxes from everyone in the AI ecosystem."

### 2. Tools and Infrastructure: Threatened by Foundation Models
> "The next market is is really making tools, the proverbial pickaxes and the gold rush... I think that will be a market that can really uh be threatened by the foundation model companies. I imagine every cloud infrastructure company has some there's probably an AWS or Azure equivalent to what they do."

### 3. Applied AI/Agents: The New SaaS
> "There's the AI applied AI market. And I actually think this will manifest its form as as agents... my view is this is sort of the new software as a service. Um companies will the form factor of purchasing AI will be purchasing an agent that does a job."

## Sierra's Vision: Every Company's Digital Interface

### The Agent-First Hypothesis
> "Every company's main digital interface will be an AI agent, you know, and maybe in in uh 20 years ago, your main digital presence was your website, your dot... Our hypothesis is you fast forward 5 years, the vast majority of digital interactions will happen via an agent."

### Singular Brand Agent Strategy
> "Every company will need their singular agent, not plural, the one that has their brand at the top that represents the whole of their customer experience."

## Outcomes-Based Pricing Revolution

### Beyond Seat-Based Models
> "At Sierra we do we call it outcomes-based pricing. So uh for our median customer that typically means when the AI agent resolves the issue for the customer autonomously there's a pre-negotiated rate for that and if we do have to escalate to a person it's free."

### Business Model Evolution Logic
> "We just thought from first principles and said hey if you're selling software that completes a job what is sort of the secular business model for that and it felt like let's pay for a job well done you know sales people get paid a sales commission you know why not the AI as well."

### Disruption of Traditional Software Models
> "If you look at particularly the enterprise software ecosystem there tends to be sort of an arms-length relationship between software vendors and customers... by the time the software is being used you know the vendor has been probably not gone they're probably going to sell them more things but effectively gone for uh 6 to 12 months."

## Market Size Transformation: From Productivity to Outcomes

### TAM Expansion Through Job Replacement
> "There's these markets where like selling enhanced productivity to attorneys is not like a huge tam and so you sort of run up against just a natural thing like even if you get you know 80% market share how big could this company be... but if you're actually selling antitrust review... that has a ton of value um because you're essentially you know providing something that very high cost labor produced before."

### Trillion-Dollar Applied AI Vision
> "If you look at the total addressable market of you know all these vertical specific domain specific agents the market is gigantic... will we see our first trillion dollar sort of applied enterprise software company? And I I think the answer is yes. Uh because you're going from selling productivity enhancement to selling outcomes and outcomes are valuable."

## Leadership Evolution: The Chameleon Approach

### The Facebook CTO Transformation
> "My most like vulnerable moment was when I was 29. and I became the CTO of Facebook... Cheryl Sandberg, who was the chief operating officer at the time, took me aside and kind of had a sort of come to Jesus conversation with me... 'You need to hold your team to as high of a standards you hold yourself. You need to stop trying to do the work yourself'."

### From Personal Comfort to Impact
> "I was going into work every day and trying to say how do I conform this job to me and my strengths. Um and instead of thinking like what's the most important thing to do in this job today even if it's not something I find delightful or interesting."

### The Reinforcement Cycle
> "I realized at that point I actually just appreciated having an impact more than I appreciated any act of doing my job... I've been a little bit of a chameleon. I've, you know, it's interesting. If I meet people from Facebook, they think of me as an engineer. If I meet people from Salesforce, they think of me like a suit."

## Startup Advantages in the AI Transition

### Business Model Freedom
> "Most people in this room are not encumbered by a business model. Um which is a funny way of thinking about it... Changing your business model is really hard... there's like a graveyard of CEOs who've been fired because they couldn't make that transition."

### Historical Business Model Disruption
> "If you look at the history of software, Salesforce beating Siebel Systems uh you know ServiceNow beating the plethora of ITSM companies that came before... closing a technology gap in your product is is hard but not impossible. Changing your business model is really hard."

## Vertical Specialization Strategy

### Why Verticals Win in AI
> "I really believe in verticals in AI. Uh I think that if you think about what the job proverbially of an AI agent is uh for a telecommunications company and you think about what's important to them uh versus uh say a commercial bank... every single one of those applications is actually quite specialized."

### Horizontal Platform Skepticism
> "I am fairly skeptical of horizontal AI platforms... pure play enterprise business. I think it's very hard to go in with a horizontal platform because there's just lots of good enough. Um, there's lots of homegrown solutions. There's lots of not invented here."

### The Salesforce Principle
> "The other thing that I I really learned uh from Marc Benioff at Salesforce is like if you have one successful customer, make it two, and if you have two, make it 10. And if you have 10, make it 100."

## Enterprise Sales Philosophy

### Customer Empathy Over Product Pitches
> "I think the key thing about selling anything is speaking the language of your customer and having empathy. Um, I think one of the things I see a lot with entrepreneurs is they'll go into a meeting and sell their product... if you ever see a really good salesperson, the first thing you'll see them do is ask a lot of questions."

### Deep Customer Research
> "One trick that I would just recommend is before you meet a customer, do deep research on them. And by that I mean like the actual feature deep research and ChatGPT. Um you know, show up educated in these conversations."

### Standing Out in Saturated Markets
> "They're being pitched by 20 AI vendors every single day. And they all sound the same. They literally all sound the same... the really opportunity right now is how do you actually stand out in such a saturated market."

## Established Company Transformation

### Cost Structure Revolution
> "You have this technology and AI that drives incredible amounts of productivity in departments that had previously been incredibly underserved uh by software... there's companies that have like 20,000 person contact centers and you know this costs hundreds of millions of dollars every single year and if you can take all of that opex and put it back into your business you can lower prices you can invest in growth."

### The Walmart vs Blockbuster Analogy
> "It's a little bit like the birth of the internet you know and you know Walmart did very well uh since the birth of the browser even in the face of Amazon, there were a lot of retailers like Blockbuster who did not."

## Pricing Strategy Insights

### Cost Savings vs Revenue Growth
> "If you're owned by a private equity firm and have a big bunch of debt, you probably say the word EBITDA like 20 times a day... in contrast you know if you're in a very competitive market like if you talk to any CEO they generally care more about growth than they do cost savings."

### Temporary Nature of Cost Savings
> "The interesting thing about cost savings is I assume those will be compressed over time. You know, right now most of your AI startups are being compared to the labor costs. 10 years from now when it's all AI agents, you're going to be compared to other AI agents... it's a temporary drug."

### Procurement Considerations
> "When LinkedIn was at one point um trying to grow the recruiting business, they started to do they started out with some usage-based model, but it turns out HR departments don't have a lot of uh license to spend like you know in a variable amount. So making it a subscription model just help with the procurement process."

## Entrepreneurial Focus and Execution

### The Dotcom Bubble Lesson
> "We talk a lot about the experience that you we were young and I not in the center of it during the dotcom bubble... the idea that hey maybe we should search the internet was not exactly novel. Um the but the actual like detailed execution of those ideas was paramount."

### Infrastructure Commoditization Benefits
> "There's just so little overhead now in terms of just like intellectual overhead. Uh, and I remember actually just how hard it was to get like credit cards for our employees... now you can, you know, print a virtual, you know, uh, credit card with, you know, things like ramp."

### Focus on Differentiation
> "Every ounce of time you're spending on something that fundamentally should be a commodity to your business is time you're not spending on like selling your product to more customers or like working on like true differentiation."

## Key Strategic Insights

1. **Three-Market Structure**: Foundation models (consolidated, low margin), tools (threatened by platforms), applied AI (highest value)

2. **Outcomes-Based Pricing**: Natural evolution from SaaS subscriptions when AI completes jobs rather than enhancing productivity

3. **Vertical Specialization**: Domain-specific agents create more defensible businesses than horizontal platforms

4. **Business Model Disruption**: Startups' greatest advantage is freedom from legacy business models

5. **Enterprise Sales Evolution**: Deep customer research and outcome focus over feature pitches

6. **Cost Structure Revolution**: AI can transform unit economics for established companies, changing competitive dynamics
