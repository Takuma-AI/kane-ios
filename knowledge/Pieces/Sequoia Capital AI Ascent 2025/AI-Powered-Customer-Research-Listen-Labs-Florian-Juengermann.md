## The Core Value Proposition: AI Customer Researcher

Florian Juengermann presents Listen Labs' AI customer researcher, a platform that democratizes and accelerates customer research by automating the entire process from question formulation to deliverables.

> **"We're building Listen, which is an AI customer researcher. So it's an AI that can go out, talk to your users, thousands of them at the same time, and then get back to you exactly what they want and why. It really helps you go all the way from your business question you have to the insights and to the deliverables within a couple hours."**

## Replacing Expert Consultants with AI Guidance

### The Traditional Research Problem

The bottleneck in traditional customer research:

> **"This is typically the step where you'd have at a larger organization a research expert come in, and sometimes even an external consultant that helps you, you know, that knows the best practices about research, helps you set up a survey or formulate the right questions."**

### AI as Research Expert

The key insight about AI replacing specialized knowledge:

> **"This is actually one of the key learnings we had, is our AI not just sets up the project for you, you know, defines the questions and so on, but it really holds your hand while doing so. It's here. It it tells you what it does. It knows the best practice of in research. It has done thousands of projects. It really knows what will work well in our platform and what doesn't work."**

### Building Trust Through Expertise

> **"And that's really the trust that you need to to not have the external researcher, the expert there, but just use it yourself in our platform."**

## The Complete Research Workflow

### Automated Project Setup

The AI handles the complex research design:

> **"So you can see, you know, it created a discussion guide for real interview with some open ended questions, some some multiple choice, and so on."**

### Video-Based Conversations

The interaction model with participants:

> **"So this is the way it works right now, you get a question, the AI asks you a question, and you can respond with a video."**

### Dynamic Follow-Up and Context Building

> **"And now, after I say that, the AI will facilitate a conversation, a deeper discussion about this, really get the full context of what I'm thinking about, and, you know, understand this, and can even do more. It can even show you things like, show you images, show you website, or show you websites, and get feedback on your on your landing page or something like that."**

## Scale Through Database and Targeting

### Millions of Participants Available

The scale advantage:

> **"So we have this database of millions of people with profile information about them, and can use that to find exactly the people that you're looking for."**

### Rapid Response Times

> **"And I can just press apply, and it goes out, and within minutes, you get the first people to give you, respond to it."**

---

## Comprehensive Output Generation

### Executive Summaries and Quantitative Insights

> **"So what you get out is everything from an executive summary, right, it has some numbers, it has some quotes, and you can click on it, you can go deep, and you can really see how people love talking about talking to it. This is like a transcript, and you can even watch the videos of, people."**

### Converting Qualitative to Quantitative

> **"We also turn those open ended conversations into quantitative insights and create those charts, show you the most interesting quotes. Again, you can always look at the quotes in context."**

### Video Highlight Reels

> **"We show you video highlight wheels where we cut together the most interesting clips from the conversations."**

### Complete Deliverable Creation

> **"And the last thing I wanna show you, we even go all the way. What typically a consultant would do is create a slide deck. So this is, like, a real PowerPoint that we create automatically, using all the cool tools that are available."**

## Building Customer Understanding Over Time

### Continuous Learning Model

> **"And, yeah, this is really just the beginning of what you can do. As listen, there's more and more of those deep, long, open ended interviews. We learn more about your customers and really build the most complete understanding of them."**

### The Mission: Customer-Centric Decision Making

> **"And our mission is to bring the customer to every decision of your company."**
