## The Core Thesis: Data Center as Computer

Chase Lochmiller presents a fundamental reframing of how we think about AI infrastructure: the data center has become the new unit of compute, not individual servers or GPUs.

> **"We're really thinking about this at the cluster layer, right? The data center is the new unit of compute and you know that's really what the AI factory is is the data center scale computer."**

## Redefining the Data Center: AI Factory vs. Traditional Infrastructure

### The Vehicle Analogy

Lochmiller emphasizes the fundamental difference between traditional and AI data centers:

> **"A data center as a you know it's a bit of an overloaded term to be honest like calling you know a data center from 20 years ago that's serving you know a web page uh the same thing as you know a high performance AI data center of today that's you know managing a you know 100,000 plus GPU cluster it's like you know calling a go-kart and like a you know uh Range Rover like both vehicles right they're both yeah they are both vehicles but like you probably wouldn't use them for the same things."**

### The Industrial Process Reality

> **"When you look at today's data center infrastructure and what what's really required to scale AI um it is a very industrial process right the amount of energy that goes into it."**

## The Scale Revolution: Numbers That Redefine Infrastructure

### Energy Scale Transformation

The magnitude of change in perspective:

> **"Northern Virginia many people would consider to be like the center of the world for data centers right that's like where most of the internet happens. Um, you know, we've been building it for decades, right? So, what's like the capacity of Northern Virginia? It's about, you know, JL published a report end of 24. It was like roughly 4 and a.5 gigawatts of total capacity in Northern Virginia."**

> **"Like, Crusoe is a 7-year-old startup. Uh, you know, we're building big AI infrastructure. We're currently working on about 2 gigawatts of, you know, capacity currently under construction. We about 20 gigawatts in the pipeline."**

### The Construction Reality

The human scale of these projects:

> **"In Abilene, Texas, you know, we have 5,000 people, you know, working there. Uh, the town of Abilene's 120,000 people, right? So, um, you're talking about employing a very substantial part of the town and and and frankly having to import a lot of labor."**

## The Bottleneck Evolution: From Chips to Infrastructure

### Shifting Constraints

> **"The bottlenecks of it you know they're constantly moving around right I mean I think there was a period of time where it was impossible to get chips uh you know and and that was the major bottleneck. I think a lot of that is you know uh eased up um as you know production both at TSMC and Nvidia have sort of uh increased to you know make make chips more available um but you know power steel data center space that that has become a major bottleneck."**

### Vertical Integration as Solution

Crusoe's approach to solving supply chain bottlenecks:

> **"Crusoe's always kind of taken this very first principled vertically integrated approach to things and so you know just to give you an example we've stood up a lot of manufacturing ourselves domestically here in the US to help accelerate operate time timelines like speed is a critical advantage for us."**

Real example of vertical integration:

> **"We've got quotes for you know low voltage switch gear right so it's basically like uh you know where all you know it's sort of the electrical control room for the data center um and the quotes we were getting were 100 weeks I was like that's insane you know 100 weeks I don't have I don't have 100 weeks so we stood up a factory and we started making switch gear ourselves now we make it in 22 weeks."**

## Competing with Big Tech: The Speed Advantage

### Structural Advantages of Startups

> **"While big tech is good at a lot of things, they're not inherently designed to move quickly. In fact, like structurally, they're designed to not move quickly, especially when there's like very big purchasing decisions."**

The decision-making contrast:

> **"When I need to make a decision to buy something, it's like it's like I just make the decision and then it like happens that day. Um, and and you know, if you look at like Microsoft, there's like 19 layers of approval that sort of go into all these processes."**

### Time-to-Market Transformation

The competitive advantage in speed:

> **"You know a big data center you know 100 megawatt plus uh would you know 3 to 5-year type programs um you know our first phase of what we're doing in Abilene we're hitting 300 days um our second phase we're actually just over 200 days so we're like massively accelerating the time to market of this infrastructure."**

## Energy-First Strategy: Geographic Transformation

### Finding Abundant Clean Energy

The strategic approach to location:

> **"Because of the scale of energy needed um for this infrastructure at scale like you know you really do need to take an energy first approach and that's really what Crusoe's done like bringing the demand for computing infrastructure to areas where we can access low-cost clean and abundant energy."**

### The West Texas Opportunity

> **"That's really what brought us to West Texas. That's what brought us to Abilene, Texas, was that uh there was a massive overbuild of of renewables, uh particularly wind, um where people were getting negatively priced power on the wind power they were generating and selling, something like 30% of the time."**

The curtailment problem:

> **"And there was actually uh an abundance of curtailment. Uh which means they could be producing power, but they actually just don't because they don't want to sell it at a negative price. And so, you know, that's sort of the opposite problem that AI has. AI like needs a lot of energy."**

## Sovereign AI and Geopolitical Implications

### Data Locality Requirements

> **"The sovereign AI comment, I think, is is a pretty interesting one. Uh, because that's the other dimension that we're seeing a lot of uh geographic uh dispersion um in the demand for this type of infrastructure. And that really has to do with like data locality."**

> **"There's there's data that you know maybe owned by a nation state or you know can't leave the uh you know four walls of the kingdom like you know it has to live there um and they want to do something very special with that."**

## The Energy Problem: Awakening Sleeping Giants

### The Utility Industry Transformation

> **"When you look at the US, like the utilities have been such a sleepy industry for such a long period of time. Like our total generation capacity hasn't really grown that much. It's kind of like flatlined uh as things have gotten more efficient."**

> **"And then AI is like this step function change in demand, right? So, um, you're sort of seeing these like sleeping giants being woken up being like, 'Hey, I need a gigawatt of power. Like, where's that going to come from?'"**

### Building Power Plants

The first-principles approach:

> **"We've sort of again sort of had to take this very first principled approach of like, okay, well, if we can't get the power from the utility, could we build a power plant? Um, so, you know, we we've done things like that."**

### Next Generation Energy Technologies

> **"We view AI as this massive opportunity to actually accelerate um next generation energy technologies as well. Um I have three different deals with uh small modular reactor companies that you know hopefully will accelerate uh uh nuclear as a as a critical uh piece of the energy to power uh the data centers of the future."**

## Manufacturing Intelligence: A Historic Moment

### The Breakthrough Perspective

> **"I think that's really what's special about this moment in time is that you know for the first time in human history we're really able to manufacture intelligence. Right? Previous to this like you know that you had to do it the organic way which is you know just having kids uh so uh you know and it takes long to you know grow them right and until they're actually productive intelligent beings you know today you know we can we can manufacture intelligence with silicon."**

## Power Density Revolution: The Technical Transformation

### Orders of Magnitude Change

> **"If you look 20 years ago a traditional data center rack might have been 2 kilowatts maybe 4 kilowatts. Um you know the NVL72 the GB200 racks are about 120 to 130 kilowatts. um you know what Jensen just announced at GTC was the uh the the Vera Rubin Ultra which will be a 600 kilowatt rack installation."**

> **"So you're talking about you know multiple orders of magnitude increase in overall power density that fundamentally changes like you know the thermodynamics like involved in in the actual data center."**

### The Water Works Reality

Physical infrastructure requirements:

> **"When you go into one of our data centers it kind of it's it's pretty interesting. It looks like the water works right. There's massive pipes uh that are moving water throughout the throughout the data center. Um you know each building has about a million gallons of water."**

Technical specifics:

> **"That sort of you know feeds cold water into you know the racks to to cool the chip with a direct to direct to chip look at cooled architecture. Um then it feeds out to a uh a chiller that that basically exhausts the heat um you know in the outside. So um there's 84 chillers per building."**

---

## Multi-Building Coherent Clusters

### The Eight-Building Vision

> **"In Abilene we have we have eight separate buildings that are under construction on that site. um all planned to be interconnected. There's 44-inch conduits that connect each network core to one another um so that you can have one coherent cluster um of GB200s, you know, and uh that'll be the biggest in the world at that, you know, once it's once it's live."**

## Energy Negotiation: The Rockefeller Parallel

### Team Building Across Industries

> **"I actually have a guy on my team that uh I don't know if anybody's a a fan of the show Land Man, but you know a guy on my team actually used to be a landman. Um and so you know he was previously negotiating with farmers and uh ranchers just around uh uh mineral rights you know basically around the subsurface of what they were doing. uh you know now he's negotiating you know large-scale energy deals."**

### Beyond Simple Power Access

> **"It's it's a lot more than just like having power to make a big AI factory happen and we've seen kind of like the two guys in a pickup truck uh saying like, 'Oh yeah, my cousin's got this big power line that runs through his property and I got a bunch of, you know, I got this ranch in Texas. Like, you know, can we build a big AI data center there?' And, you know, typically the answer is no."**

The complexity requirement:

> **"There's a confluence of a lot of different components that have to come together between uh power, networking, permitting uh to to to and and then, you know, the whole supply chain to to really make this happen."**

## Think Like a Mountaineer: Company Culture Philosophy

### The Origin Story

> **"That value to think like a mountaineer was was kind of a special one and very unique to Crusoe. Um and you know it sort of came out of the fact that you know I had actually just come back from climbing Mount Everest when when I when I founded Crusoe and it was kind of like you know I had mountaineering on my mind quite a bit."**

### Resilience and Planning

> **"When you're climbing in the mountains, uh, you have to you have to you have to have a plan A, like you know, you have a plan to get to the top and, you know, hopefully the the weather holds up and, you know, everything goes to plan, but you also have to plan for things to go wrong."**

> **"And I think that resilience and robustness really embedded into every aspect of uh our process designs and and um uh our organization designs has really led to being able to thrive amidst multiple different chaotic periods, you know, um throughout throughout the company's history."**
