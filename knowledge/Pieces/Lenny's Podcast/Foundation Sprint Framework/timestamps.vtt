00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
We would have a conversation with founders and you're saying like, gosh, I'm almost embarrassed to ask this question

00:04.800 --> 00:09.200
but who exactly is your target customer? And three co-founders have three different answers.

00:09.200 --> 00:14.320
After these hundreds of teams that we've worked with, we've seen that there's one failure mode which is

00:14.320 --> 00:18.880
they don't know what that set of basics are. Then there's this other failure mode where they never test it.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.120
Let's talk about the foundation sprint. Walk us through the process. How does it start? What are the steps?

00:23.120 --> 00:29.120
The very beginning of your project. We recommend this kind of crazy idea that you clear your calendar.

00:29.120 --> 00:35.360
So the core team come together for 10 hours roughly and go through a sequence of activities so that we

00:35.360 --> 00:39.680
can make all of the key decisions together. I think a lot of people wonder is they're hearing this is,

00:39.680 --> 00:44.080
why don't I just build something and launch it and learn? One phenomenon we've seen when teams are

00:44.080 --> 00:49.600
building things really quickly with AI is that the more AI generated or assisted they are, the more

00:49.600 --> 00:54.400
generic they tend to turn out with yourself in a situation where you can slow down and do some hard

00:54.400 --> 00:58.640
thinking, some deep thinking about what's actually going to make your product unique, going fast

00:58.640 --> 01:04.560
can actually slow you down in the long run. Today my guest are Jake Nap and John Ziratsky. The

01:04.560 --> 01:09.040
framework that Jake and John share in this conversation is basically the missing manual for

01:09.040 --> 01:13.360
founders and product teams trying to refine and test their startup or product idea. It's called

01:13.360 --> 01:18.560
the foundation sprint and it emerged out of the famous design sprint which Jake and Jay-Z co-created

01:18.560 --> 01:23.200
and also for working with over 300 teams building both new product and startups.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.920
Also with teams of larger companies like Google, Microsoft, YouTube, Slack, Uber and many more,

01:27.920 --> 01:31.600
they published a book with this framework at the beginning of this year called Click

01:31.600 --> 01:36.000
and the excerpt from that book that dives into this framework is one of my most popular

01:36.000 --> 01:40.320
post of all time and was one of the rare non-AI posts amongst the top post rankings.

01:40.320 --> 01:44.960
In this conversation make sure to get your pencils out because we go through exactly how to

01:44.960 --> 01:50.080
execute this two-day sprint where at the end of it you have a very clear hypothesis that your

01:50.080 --> 01:54.080
entire team is aligned around that clarifies what you're building, who you're building for,

01:54.080 --> 01:58.560
how different shades from competitors and how to quickly test it with real potential customers.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.520
The two days that you invest in a sprint might be the highest ROI days in the history of your product

02:03.520 --> 02:07.440
and I highly encourage you to do this if you're in the process of baking an idea.

NAP and John Ziratsky. This episode is brought to you by Brex. The financial stack used by one in

02:32.640 --> 02:39.040
every three US venture back startups. Brex knows the nearly 40% of startups fail because they run

02:39.040 --> 02:44.320
out of cash so they build a banking experience that focuses on helping founders get more from every

02:44.320 --> 02:49.280
dollar. It's a stark difference from traditional banking options that leave a startups cash sitting

02:49.280 --> 02:54.720
idle while chipping away at it with fees. To help founders protect cash and extend runway,

02:54.720 --> 03:01.520
Brex combined the best things about checking, Treasury and FDIC insurance in one powerhouse account.

03:01.520 --> 03:07.360
You can send and receive money worldwide at lightning speed. You can get 20x the standard FDIC

03:07.360 --> 03:12.240
protection through program banks and you can earn industry leading yield from your first dollar

Many of you are building AI products which is why I'm very excited to chat with Brandon Foo

03:30.000 --> 03:36.400
founder and CEO of Paragon. Hey Brandon. Hey Lenny, thanks for having me. So integrations

03:36.400 --> 03:42.160
have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that? Integrations are mission critical for AI

03:42.160 --> 03:47.120
for two reasons. First, AI products need context from the customer's business data such as

03:47.120 --> 03:53.200
Google Drive files, Slack messages or CRM records. Seconds, for AI products to automate work on

03:53.200 --> 03:58.880
behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.

03:58.880 --> 04:03.200
So we're just Paragon fittings all this. Well these integrations are a pains of build and that's

04:03.200 --> 04:08.400
why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations

04:08.400 --> 04:14.480
in just days instead of months across every use case from rag data ingestion to agentic actions.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.880
And I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the

04:18.880 --> 04:24.000
first time. Exactly. We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts in competitive

04:24.000 --> 04:30.560
advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like U.com, AI21 and hundreds of others use

04:30.560 --> 04:35.360
Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy. If you want to avoid wasting months of engineering

04:35.360 --> 04:41.200
on integrations that your customers need, check out Paragon at useparagon.com slash Lenny.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.200
Jake and Jay-Z, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

04:49.200 --> 04:54.720
Hey Lenny, thanks for having us. Yeah, thanks so much for having us on again. This is always a treat.

04:54.720 --> 04:59.440
This is going to be a very tactical conversation. We're going to be going through how to actually

04:59.440 --> 05:05.840
execute a foundation sprint. And the reason that I'm excited to do this is you guys shared an excerpt

05:05.840 --> 05:10.240
from your book where you initially shared this whole concept. It's called Click. You shared this

05:10.240 --> 05:15.760
in my newsletter and I was just looking at it and that excerpt that post is amongst the top 10,

05:15.760 --> 05:21.760
most popular post of all time in my newsletter, which is especially special because it's not an AI

05:21.760 --> 05:27.200
oriented background. It's one of the few non AI posts that are near the top 10, which just tells

05:27.200 --> 05:31.760
me how valuable this is to people and consistently it has sat there. It hasn't been usurped. It just

05:31.760 --> 05:36.320
continues to climb. So I'm really excited to just have a conversation where we shared actually

05:36.320 --> 05:41.840
how to do this. Let me just start with the beginning. Just a little backstory on how the foundation

05:41.840 --> 05:48.320
sprint came to be. I know it emerged out of the now very famous design sprint, which you guys also

05:48.320 --> 05:53.040
developed. So just give us a very brief overview of just how this came to be, this idea of this

05:53.040 --> 05:57.600
foundation sprint. Well, maybe I'll start by talking about the design sprint part because it is

05:57.600 --> 06:04.400
essential to understanding the foundation sprint. And the design sprint first developed, I had been

06:04.400 --> 06:09.440
working at the beginning of my career at Microsoft for a few years, went to Google, which is like 2007,

06:09.440 --> 06:16.320
2008, 2009. And working on the Gmail team was working on some projects that were just executing

06:16.320 --> 06:23.600
well, delivering shipping. But I had this other project, this side project that had been going on

06:23.600 --> 06:30.000
for three years with a couple of colleagues was going nowhere. And it looked like their office

06:30.000 --> 06:34.240
was going to get shut down after the financial crisis. They were in Stockholm. I went there for a

06:34.240 --> 06:39.600
week. We cleared our calendars for a week. And we created a prototype of this thing because we

06:39.600 --> 06:44.400
decided, look, we're never going to get anywhere. We've tried making the perfect pitch. We've tried

06:45.040 --> 06:51.440
to, you know, make the ideal PRD. We've tried to show the ideal design. And we just, we can't,

06:51.440 --> 06:57.040
perfection is not working. We're not able to align people. We're not able to get sort of executive

06:57.040 --> 07:02.320
support for this thing. We couldn't convince Larry and Sergey and Eric that they should fund this

07:02.320 --> 07:07.840
thing. And in that week in Stockholm, we created a prototype instead. We decided, you know what,

07:07.840 --> 07:11.520
forget it, we're just going to build something and put it in people's hands, put it in our fellow

07:11.520 --> 07:18.800
Googlers hands. And that prototype was what became Google Meet. It was this video conferencing

07:18.800 --> 07:24.240
tool that you could use in the web browser. Yeah, it was really cool. I mean, the outcome of that,

07:24.240 --> 07:30.320
that's definitely probably the most productive week I've ever had. But the thing that struck me

07:30.320 --> 07:35.520
at the time and in hindsight was, wow, it was so different to clear the calendar for a week

07:35.600 --> 07:41.680
and have the entire focal point of every person on the team be, how do we create a prototype that's

07:41.680 --> 07:46.960
so real, that works so well, that people will think it's real, that they'll react like it's real,

07:46.960 --> 07:51.760
that they'll want it. And we were in survival mode, you know, we were trying to keep that office

07:51.760 --> 07:56.720
from getting shut down. But the, the notion that maybe you could repeat that and recreate that

07:56.720 --> 08:02.480
is what led me to create the design sprint. So for a couple of years at Google, I start running

08:02.480 --> 08:07.680
these one week programs with teams trying to go at the beginning of a project from, you know,

08:07.680 --> 08:15.440
zero to a prototype at the end that we can, that we can sort of evaluate tests. And then I went

08:15.440 --> 08:21.040
to go work at Google Ventures. So separate one of the alphabet companies were investing in startups.

08:21.040 --> 08:26.800
I mean, John Ziratsky, and we start running these design sprints with, well, it turned out to be

08:26.800 --> 08:32.960
over the course of five years. I don't know, a couple hundred teams working in the early days

08:32.960 --> 08:38.240
with founders, the early days of their establishing the product for the first time, trying to build it

08:38.240 --> 08:44.480
from zero to one or launching a new marketing campaign, a new ad campaign, some big high risk

08:44.480 --> 08:48.800
endeavor. We'd get to work alongside them for a week and we ended up refining this process into

08:48.800 --> 08:57.280
a recipe. So across five days, it's map, sketch, decide prototype and test. One big focal point

08:57.280 --> 09:01.280
for each day. So at the end of the week, you've got a tested prototype and you learn like, are we

09:01.280 --> 09:09.280
on the right track or not? And that's the design sprint. That's kind of the, you know, the prologue,

09:09.280 --> 09:15.840
the backstory to this thing. And then after a few years at Google Ventures, John and I left and

09:15.840 --> 09:20.480
eventually, together with our co-founder, Eli Blie Goldman, we started our own venture firm,

09:20.480 --> 09:24.720
Character Capital. And that's kind of where the story of the foundation sprint comes in.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.840
Okay, awesome. Jay-Z, anything you wanted to add?

09:29.040 --> 09:34.160
One of our goals, probably our biggest goal for starting our own VC firm was that we wanted to

09:34.960 --> 09:40.800
be able to focus on just the kinds of companies and the stage of company building that was the

09:40.800 --> 09:45.840
most fun to us, but also was where we thought we could have the biggest impact. And so, you know,

09:45.840 --> 09:51.520
for us with our background as designers, that is the early days, the first couple of months or

09:51.520 --> 09:56.880
the first year or two years of building a new business. And at GV, you know, sometimes we did

09:56.880 --> 10:01.440
that. Sometimes we were working with companies that were already well established. And when we'd come

10:01.440 --> 10:05.760
into those companies, they kind of knew what they were doing. They knew what they stood for. They

10:05.760 --> 10:10.320
knew how they were different in the market and how they were positioned. And so we could help them,

10:10.880 --> 10:15.440
answer these big questions and solve these problems and test their prototypes with customers. But

10:15.440 --> 10:22.560
when we started investing in truly pre-seed, sometimes inception stage, pre-product, pre-revenue,

10:22.560 --> 10:28.160
pre-everything companies, there was this piece missing at the beginning of that process.

10:28.160 --> 10:33.440
So we'd run design sprints and they would be helpful. But oftentimes it felt like there was

10:33.440 --> 10:38.640
there was a foundational element of that project that we didn't quite have our hands around.

10:38.640 --> 10:44.320
And it was things like, what is the problem you're solving and who's the ideal customer?

10:44.320 --> 10:48.800
How are you different than what's in the market today? Who are your actual competitors?

10:48.800 --> 10:53.200
And there were these questions that just kept coming up again and again that led us to say,

10:53.200 --> 10:58.480
hey, we need to create a new sprint method, something that is really targeted for the very

10:58.480 --> 11:04.320
beginning of these big new projects. And so that was what led us to create the foundation sprints

11:04.400 --> 11:08.000
at character capital in 2021-2022.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.480
Okay, yeah, I was wondering the timeline on this. What I love about stuff like this,

11:12.480 --> 11:17.200
like episodes like this, is you guys have done so much work and done this so many times with so

11:17.200 --> 11:21.840
many companies, so many founders, and have learned what works and doesn't work. You said hundreds

11:21.840 --> 11:27.360
of founders, hundreds of startups. And you've just spent so many hours studying this, refining it,

11:27.360 --> 11:31.600
crafting it. And now you're just here to share all the answers, save us so much time, just like the

11:31.600 --> 11:36.880
ROI on this is incredible for us. So I appreciate you guys doing this. Let's get into it. Let's talk

11:36.880 --> 11:41.520
about the foundation sprint. Walk us through the process. How does it start? What are the steps?

11:42.160 --> 11:46.800
So specifically what we talk about with the foundation sprint is it's the very beginning of your

11:46.800 --> 11:54.560
project. We recommend this kind of crazy idea that you clear your schedule, you clear your calendar.

11:54.560 --> 12:00.480
So the core team, this is the co-founders if it's a startup. If it's a product team inside a

12:00.480 --> 12:05.600
larger organization, it's the whoever's in charge of product, it's whoever's in charge of

12:05.600 --> 12:09.520
engineering, it's whoever's in charge of design, it's whoever's in charge of marketing, the core

12:09.520 --> 12:15.040
leadership team, they're going to come together for it's going to be 10 hours roughly give or take.

12:15.600 --> 12:21.280
And during those 10 hours, we're going to go through a sequence of activities, very highly scripted

12:21.280 --> 12:27.120
sequence of activities so that we can make all of the key decisions together and identify the

12:27.120 --> 12:31.920
basics of the project, what's going to differentiate us in the marketplace and what's the best approach

12:31.920 --> 12:37.840
or implementation path. All of those together form a hypothesis and then we recommend. So you finish,

12:37.840 --> 12:41.760
now that's your foundation sprint, you've got your founding hypothesis. Once you've got that

12:41.760 --> 12:46.640
founding hypothesis, then you're going to go and do design sprints and we recommend you clear the

12:46.640 --> 12:52.080
calendar for two to three weeks at least. So you have the chance to be wrong about your hypothesis

12:52.080 --> 12:55.360
and we're going to run experiments. And again, the design sprint highly scripted,

12:56.160 --> 13:01.680
calendar clear, you know, emails off, we're just, the slack is off, we're just focused on

13:02.160 --> 13:06.240
running through these sequence of decisions, building prototypes, getting them in front of customers,

13:06.240 --> 13:10.560
learning about a scorecard that relates back to the founding hypothesis. So at the big picture,

13:10.560 --> 13:16.800
it's it's going to be anywhere from 10 hours to, you know, three to four weeks. You're going to run

13:16.800 --> 13:21.760
this detailed script of activities with your team, with their calendars clear and that's crazy.

13:21.760 --> 13:28.080
And most people won't do it. But if you do it, it confers upon you a huge advantage. Because now,

13:28.080 --> 13:33.360
you're, you've got information, you know whether or not your product clicks with customers. And

13:33.360 --> 13:37.440
that's a, we've seen that be just such a tremendous signal for, is there going to be product market fit?

13:38.320 --> 13:42.640
Okay, that was really helpful. The 10 hours is that specifically, that's the foundation sprint,

13:42.640 --> 13:46.560
time box, that's the foundation sprint. Okay, box, yeah. And it's, it's give or take, right? You might,

13:46.560 --> 13:51.280
you might go fast and be done in eight, you might have a lot of conversations and have a slightly

13:51.280 --> 13:55.840
larger team and might take you 12. So we like to spread it out over two days due to, you know, like

13:55.840 --> 14:00.080
four to six hour blocks. Okay. And then the three to four weeks ish, that's including the design

14:00.080 --> 14:04.560
sprint. That's the design sprint. Yeah. Okay. When we also print. Okay, this is incredible ROI on

14:04.560 --> 14:11.520
10 hours of work. Basically over two days, you get to have a much stronger sense of whether your idea

14:11.520 --> 14:16.960
is any good. And you can, yeah, that is that a simple way to describe it, like the just supercharge

14:17.600 --> 14:24.000
validating an idea. Exactly. Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a chance to, in the, in the 10 hours,

14:24.000 --> 14:29.120
it's a chance to get clarity about the core of your strategy, which is something that teams will

14:29.120 --> 14:36.640
often go months without really nailing down. And the, the three to four weeks, that's a chance to

14:37.520 --> 14:41.680
run experiments and get confidence, you're, you're actually building the right thing. Okay,

14:41.680 --> 14:45.600
let's talk about these two days. How does, how do you lay it out? How do you approach it? What

14:45.680 --> 14:52.000
should someone do if they want to actually try this? I don't. So there are three phases to the

14:52.000 --> 14:58.400
foundation sprint. First phase is the basics. Second phase is differentiation. And the third phase is

14:58.400 --> 15:02.720
the approach to the project. So again, all three of those are going to come together to create

15:02.720 --> 15:09.600
the founding hypothesis. So the first phase, the basics, as I mentioned, that's identifying

15:09.600 --> 15:15.200
who's your customer, what problem are you solving for the customer? What's the competition for

15:15.200 --> 15:19.600
solving that problem? How do they solve it today? And what are the alternatives? How, how else do

15:19.600 --> 15:25.680
people solve this? What are the workarounds? Those are really almost embarrassingly simple things to

15:25.680 --> 15:30.080
answer. But when we do this with a team and everybody's answering, you know, so we're proposing

15:30.080 --> 15:34.080
their answer to each question we see, everybody's got a different perspective. And then when we walk

15:34.080 --> 15:37.440
in, the decision maker on the team says, okay, it's going to be this one, it's going to be this one,

15:37.440 --> 15:41.760
it's going to be this one. Now we have clarity and, and confidence that that's the right way to go.

15:41.760 --> 15:48.320
So we'll move forward from the basics into differentiation and identify what are the things that

15:48.320 --> 15:52.400
can set us apart from those competitors. And we're going to use the advantages we have. We're

15:52.400 --> 15:56.480
going to use our, our insight. We're going to use our motivation. We're going to use our special

15:56.480 --> 16:02.640
capabilities. These are things, again, people are aware of these things. They're in tune to it,

16:02.640 --> 16:07.840
but we want to get super, super specific. And I'll, we'll go into an example in a second,

16:07.840 --> 16:11.440
and I think that'll make it more clear exactly what we mean. But going then from differentiation

16:11.440 --> 16:15.760
to staying, what are all of the different implementation paths we could take here? What's

16:15.760 --> 16:20.480
identify what those are? Put a little detail behind them. And then we have a structured path for

16:20.480 --> 16:25.680
people to take so they can weigh that decision, but move through really quickly, commit to one,

16:25.680 --> 16:30.320
have a backup plan. In case you end up feeling like you need to pivot once you start sprinting on it.

16:30.800 --> 16:37.040
And all of that together is going to form this, this kind of mad lives sentence. If we solve this

16:37.040 --> 16:42.400
problem for this customer with this approach, we think they're going to choose it over the competitors

16:42.400 --> 16:48.080
because of differentiator one and differentiator two. And it's, it's almost silly how simple this

16:48.080 --> 16:55.440
thing is, but really powerful if for founders to have that, that clarity about, okay, here it all

16:55.440 --> 17:00.160
is in one sentence. Now let's go, let's go test and make sure this is true. Amazing. Let's look at

17:00.160 --> 17:03.120
an example. That's a really good idea. I know you brought some, some examples you're going to do

17:03.120 --> 17:06.640
some screen sharing. You're going to pull it up. If you're watching on YouTube, you'll be able to

17:06.640 --> 17:10.800
see it. Also, if you're watching on Spotify, you can see the video. If you're an Apple star,

17:12.240 --> 17:14.800
but do your best to describe what we're going to be looking at.

17:15.520 --> 17:20.880
Yeah. So we're going to talk about this company called Latchit. First, this is the first company we'll

17:20.880 --> 17:28.000
talk about. And Latchit is a startup who was in our last group of character labs and we can go into

17:28.000 --> 17:34.560
to character labs later on. But essentially, this is a kind of an accelerator like program that we run

17:34.560 --> 17:39.600
a character capital where we invest in a group of companies at the same time. And we run them

17:39.600 --> 17:43.920
through that process that we were just describing where we start with a foundation sprint. And then

17:43.920 --> 17:49.920
it's going to be a sequence of three design sprints after that so that they're testing and refining

17:49.920 --> 17:54.560
that hypothesis. And so it's a great time for them. These are founders who have just started their

17:54.560 --> 18:02.160
companies. They're kind of, you know, that precede very beginning zero stage. And the progress you can

18:02.160 --> 18:09.440
see in those three and a half or weeks, it's phenomenal. So let's just let's talk about Latchit.

18:09.440 --> 18:15.440
So Latchit, a couple co-founders, Chris and James, who were, they had left Substack. They were

18:15.440 --> 18:22.720
engineers leading up the growth team at Substack. And they wanted to build a product for for

18:22.720 --> 18:29.040
artisans. So if you imagine like you're a your jewelry maker, you're a, you know, your painter,

18:29.040 --> 18:34.560
your woodworker, and you want to sell your products outside of your immediate, you know,

18:34.560 --> 18:39.360
community, the physical place where you are at a physical location. Well, you can, you know,

18:39.360 --> 18:43.680
you can build this site on Shopify, but you still have to market it. If you do that, you got to

18:43.680 --> 18:48.880
figure out how to reach those folks. You can put your products on Etsy, but Etsy has become quite

18:48.880 --> 18:54.320
commoditized. So you're going to be up against everybody everywhere. And it's going to be very hard

18:54.320 --> 18:59.280
for you to build an identity there, like to build a sense of who I am, what I'm all about.

19:00.240 --> 19:05.680
And so what Chris and James thought was, you know, maybe we could use some of the techniques and

19:05.680 --> 19:11.920
methods we, we used at Substack to help people find other, you know, other newsletter writers

19:11.920 --> 19:16.720
through their community, through recommendations they make, and, and help help out artisans in that

19:16.720 --> 19:20.400
way. It would, wouldn't that be cool? So they were kind of at that stage. They had a few different

19:20.400 --> 19:26.240
ideas about what form that might take, what that might look like when they joined character labs.

19:26.240 --> 19:30.400
And so that's kind of the backdrop to, to this little quick story I'll tell.

19:30.400 --> 19:35.040
And there's one really important thing to emphasize about Chris and James that Jake mentioned

19:35.040 --> 19:40.480
briefly, but I think is, is worth repeating, which is that they're engineers. They are builders.

19:40.480 --> 19:47.680
Their instinct is to write code. It's to build software. And they actually told us that they were

19:47.680 --> 19:52.720
excited, but nervous to come into character labs where we would be encouraging them

19:53.680 --> 20:01.040
not to write code right away, to take this time to clarify the differentiation, the, the structure

20:01.040 --> 20:05.360
of what they're building and to validate that with customers before they went all in on building

20:05.360 --> 20:11.280
a particular approach. And I think you'll see in this example how, while they were a little hesitant

20:11.440 --> 20:17.760
to do that a front, eventually they saw how much more valuable it was to work in this way versus

20:17.760 --> 20:22.000
just diving right into building something. That's actually really helpful context. And I,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.960
speaking of a sub-stack, recommendations feature was one of the most game-changing features for

20:26.960 --> 20:32.640
me with my newsletter. So because it basically supercharged my growth. So I get why they'd be so

20:32.640 --> 20:37.280
excited about bringing this learning to other, to other ideas into their own startups. So thank

20:37.280 --> 20:40.720
you guys for doing that. And yeah, I'm even more excited to see what they're building.

20:41.440 --> 20:46.320
Well, let's take a look. So the, this board here that we're looking at, this is like their

20:46.320 --> 20:50.480
mirror board. So we've got like a big template. And whether you're watching on YouTube or listening

20:50.480 --> 20:55.360
to this episode, we'll, we'll talk about at the end how you can get access to this template,

20:55.360 --> 21:00.240
which will kind of guide you through the process. But what happens in this first step in the

21:00.240 --> 21:06.000
foundation's brand, in the basics, as you said before, is that we're going through a sequence of

21:06.000 --> 21:10.640
questions. Who's the most important customer, for example, is the first question, the very first

21:10.640 --> 21:14.480
question that a team needs to answer. And as we do that, this is an important side note. We're

21:14.480 --> 21:21.200
using this tactic that we call work alone together. And specifically, the noted vote is this method

21:21.200 --> 21:26.000
where everyone's in silence. In this case, both Chris and James, but if you have a team of seven,

21:26.000 --> 21:31.200
it's all seven people, be working in silence, writing down their own answers to this question.

21:31.200 --> 21:35.760
Who's the most important customer? Who are all the different kind of customers we might consider?

21:35.760 --> 21:41.600
Writing down multiple answers. And then once we've got those answers, the team's going to vote on

21:41.600 --> 21:46.560
those. And then one person who's designated as the decider, usually it's going to be the CEO of

21:46.560 --> 21:52.080
the startup, but it could be, in some cases, maybe it's the, the, you know, chief product officer,

21:52.080 --> 21:56.160
whatever, however they decide to do it. But one person's going to say, okay, this is our decision

21:56.160 --> 22:01.680
for now. And now we're going to move on. And by doing this and using silence and using structure

22:01.680 --> 22:06.480
and then having a designated decision-making process, we can move through a lot of conversations

22:06.480 --> 22:12.320
very quickly and save some of that energy that it requires to make decisions for the decisions

22:12.320 --> 22:17.600
that matter most. In this case, what we're really worried about on day one of our foundation sprint

22:17.600 --> 22:22.000
is differentiation. So we don't want to spend too long on the basics. Anyway, we motor through

22:22.000 --> 22:27.360
customer problem, the capability, the insight, the motivation that the team has, those are all

22:27.360 --> 22:33.840
advantages. And who are the competition? And we get this, this sort of one page sheet, the basics.

22:33.840 --> 22:37.600
And it's going to have the answers to all those questions. Who's our customer? In this case,

22:37.600 --> 22:41.920
artisans who want to sell online, but they sort of find tech and marketing to be hard.

22:43.120 --> 22:49.280
The problem is sales growth. Yeah, if we, if we jump down to the competition, their number one

22:49.280 --> 22:55.120
competitor is Shopify. But Etsy is another way people approach this, as we mentioned. But there's

22:55.120 --> 22:59.680
also, you know, in-person sales and art fairs or other ways that people try to get at this problem.

22:59.680 --> 23:04.160
And realistically, if you're delivering a solution, you need to stand out from all of those.

23:05.280 --> 23:09.040
And then there's their advantages. We talked about, you know, this, this key one. They built

23:09.040 --> 23:14.800
substax network growth features. So they know how to do this thing. So now that we've established

23:14.800 --> 23:20.000
the basics, we're going to move on to differentiation. Before you do that, actually, let me ask a question

23:20.000 --> 23:24.480
here. Because I think people seeing this could think, oh, this is like, I know all this stuff.

23:24.480 --> 23:28.880
So obviously it's like, it's like, okay, I got an idea. I don't need to do this.

23:28.880 --> 23:32.560
Where do you find people most often surprised by something that emerges out of this?

23:32.560 --> 23:37.600
Is like one of these buckets often, wow, we, this is often not what you expect it, or is it

23:37.600 --> 23:40.720
generally a lot of surprises? What do you, what do you experience there?

23:41.600 --> 23:47.200
I think the moment where you immediately start to see value is when everyone on the team is

23:47.200 --> 23:52.640
writing down their answers to these questions. And then people put their heads up and look at

23:52.640 --> 23:57.920
what everyone else has written. And they realize, oh, that's not what I would, that's not what I

23:57.920 --> 24:04.960
said. Or I didn't think of that one. Or, you know, gosh, the actual concrete reality of going

24:04.960 --> 24:10.560
through with the team and being very transparent and clear about how we're making decisions too

24:10.560 --> 24:16.160
about each of these things. When that basic sheet comes together and you see the specifics,

24:16.160 --> 24:21.600
the specifics are surprising, but it's also familiar. We look at it and say, yeah, that looks,

24:21.600 --> 24:27.040
that all looks right, but I'm surprised by the specifics. They're not what I would have

24:27.040 --> 24:30.720
written if I had written it down. I might have gotten two of those things, two of the, you know,

24:30.720 --> 24:36.080
six items on there. And I think that's what's, that's what's most surprising. And I think it's also

24:36.080 --> 24:41.840
kind of a sense of relief that like, okay, well, that's very reassuring that we have, we have clarity

24:41.840 --> 24:48.320
about that and we've made it concrete. These activities that we do during the basics are

24:48.400 --> 24:55.120
impactful for different reasons. I think that problem can be really interesting because when

24:55.120 --> 25:00.800
teams sit down and think about it, it is often less clear than they thought that what the actual

25:00.800 --> 25:05.520
problem is. Like, wait, what problem do our customers really have that we're solving for them?

25:06.160 --> 25:11.920
I think competition can be sort of an aha moment when they start to think beyond just,

25:12.720 --> 25:17.440
what are the other startups in this space? Like, if this is an important problem, your

25:17.440 --> 25:22.080
customers probably already solving it somehow. It may be a workaround, it may be an alternative,

25:22.080 --> 25:26.800
it may not be a direct competitor, but if it's worth solving, they probably have some way of

25:26.800 --> 25:31.600
dealing with it today. And what is that? And when you zoom out and you look at that set of competitors,

25:32.160 --> 25:37.760
it can be a little scary, but it is also an important moment for teams. And then I think that

25:37.760 --> 25:45.680
advantage isn't necessarily immediately beneficial, but it becomes really valuable when the teams

25:45.760 --> 25:52.320
are looking at differentiation because startups can't compete with big companies on scale or on

25:53.280 --> 25:59.200
having built-in distribution advantages or having partnerships in place. So they really have

25:59.200 --> 26:04.400
to dig deep and figure out what can we do that nobody else is capable of doing? And so by taking

26:04.400 --> 26:09.920
time to sit down and do this almost unnatural act of like, wait, why are we special? And

26:10.880 --> 26:15.600
when we're able to encourage teams to really think about that, it sets them up really nicely

26:15.600 --> 26:19.760
for the next step, which is differentiation, ideally based on those advantages.

26:20.400 --> 26:25.920
What I'm hearing is a lot of the value here is also just everyone has the answers in their head

26:25.920 --> 26:32.080
in some way, but just seeing what everyone else is thinking and then aligning on one is a lot of

26:32.080 --> 26:37.920
this value. Yeah, it's like thinking deeply and quietly about it yourself and then seeing what

26:37.920 --> 26:42.800
everybody else comes up with when they are able to also think deeply and quietly about it.

26:43.760 --> 26:49.360
And then, ideally, if they're working with us and character labs, having somebody who's a bit

26:49.360 --> 26:55.520
external to push them and say, try harder. Dig deeper. What really makes you special here? How are

26:55.520 --> 26:59.760
you really going to be open AI? How are you really going to be Google at this?

26:59.760 --> 27:03.600
This whole idea of noting and voting and working in silence, such a recurring theme on this

27:03.600 --> 27:09.280
podcast of not doing brainstorms in large groups. It feels like that's just dead in every way.

27:09.280 --> 27:14.720
I just had this naming expert on the podcast who names some of the biggest companies in the world,

27:14.720 --> 27:19.840
Pentium, PowerBook, Sonos, or so. And that's their approach is they used to do brainstorms,

27:19.840 --> 27:23.360
and he's like, that doesn't work. And now they just have small teams sitting quietly in a room

27:23.360 --> 27:27.760
working together on ideas and then thinking on their own. So that's such an interesting trend.

27:27.760 --> 27:32.000
Yeah. And I feel like idea, we just created this whole, we need to brainstorm post-its and then

27:32.000 --> 27:37.360
everyone's like, that's not actually working. Let's stop doing that. And the other thing that I

27:37.440 --> 27:41.280
feel as you're talking through this, like what I'm feeling this is there's for founders,

27:41.280 --> 27:46.240
there's not like a manual for starting a company. You always have, it feels like this dark

27:46.240 --> 27:50.240
art of like, I guess I got a fine product market fit and this idea. It feels like this is almost a

27:50.240 --> 27:56.560
manual of everything you need to do to just get the basics of, is this even worth doing?

27:56.560 --> 28:02.320
Yeah. And that's why we created it because we were, we still are investing in founders who

28:03.040 --> 28:06.640
are, you know, they're, they're incredibly talented and they're smart and they have a background

28:06.640 --> 28:10.720
that is going to give them an advantage in building some particular product. But you're right,

28:10.720 --> 28:16.720
there's, there's no manual and we were just kind of solving our own problem and, you know, we,

28:16.720 --> 28:22.640
we believe in this so much and we see the ROI is being so great that this is the first thing we do

28:22.640 --> 28:26.720
when we make an investment, you know, we invest in a company and then we run a foundation sprint

28:26.720 --> 28:32.320
with them right away. We run more foundation sprints with startups than we do design sprints at this

28:32.320 --> 28:37.520
point. And you know, I don't think we can ever encapsulate every single thing that you need to know

28:37.520 --> 28:44.560
or that you need to do to start a company. But this is our, this is our best take at like what

28:44.560 --> 28:49.760
you should do in the early days to set yourself up for success and maximize the chances that you're

28:49.760 --> 28:54.480
going to reach product market fit. Amazing. Okay. Let's keep going. So we've done the basics.

28:54.480 --> 28:59.440
We'll come next. Yeah. So we've done the basics and another important thing that we've accomplished

28:59.520 --> 29:05.840
while going through the sequence of activities in the basics is to boot up the right context

29:05.840 --> 29:12.720
into everyone's head so that we're ready for the main event of this first day, which is differentiation.

29:12.720 --> 29:18.480
And I still have very firmly in my mind, like I grew up with a Mac plus computer and you'd put in,

29:18.480 --> 29:22.560
you know, the disk and the drive and you'd have to, you'd have to boot up the the app that you

29:22.560 --> 29:27.280
wanted to run that that's kind of the way our brains work. Like we have limited working memory and

29:27.280 --> 29:31.600
we've got to have the right stuff in there when we're, when we're going to make a big decision,

29:31.600 --> 29:36.800
when we're going to think hard about a certain problem or question, it's important to have the right

29:36.800 --> 29:42.480
context fresh at hand. So the basics is really the context for thinking about differentiation.

29:43.120 --> 29:48.320
And differentiation is the heart of what we're doing in the foundation spread because

29:49.680 --> 29:54.880
it goes without saying perhaps, but we like to say it, when you are making a new product,

29:55.600 --> 30:00.800
people want to ignore it. People want to not pay attention to it. And if they do have to pay

30:00.800 --> 30:05.440
attention to it, if it gets in their face, they, they want to not try it because we just are all

30:05.440 --> 30:11.680
bombarded by so many things and that's never been more true than it is now. And we, so we have

30:11.680 --> 30:15.760
defenses up to save, to save calories in our brain. We just, we don't want to engage.

30:16.560 --> 30:23.360
It's crucial then that a product has a clear promise that it makes and that that promise is,

30:24.080 --> 30:28.960
radically differentiated from the alternatives. And that that promise is strong enough that

30:28.960 --> 30:33.920
you'll try it and then that the product delivers on that promise. And so when we talk about

30:33.920 --> 30:39.200
differentiation, we're saying, look, we want you to be really clear on your promise. Not the

30:39.200 --> 30:43.760
promise you're making to investors about this technology and what's special about the technology

30:43.760 --> 30:48.480
or what's special about the market opportunity, but with the customer at the center. We've started

30:48.480 --> 30:52.880
the basics by talking about the customer and the problem they have and the way they see the world.

30:52.880 --> 30:56.960
And we want to talk about what you're going to offer to the customer and how it's going to

30:56.960 --> 31:02.240
separate from the alternatives. And so in the end of this next phase of the foundation sprint,

31:02.240 --> 31:07.360
we're going to have a two by two diagram that's going to look like a business school 101 diagram.

31:07.360 --> 31:14.080
And in fact, we often refer back to this Steve Jobs iPhone introduction slide where he talks about

31:14.080 --> 31:18.960
the the iPhone and he makes a joke about it. This is a business school 101 diagram, but

31:18.960 --> 31:23.360
it's really helpful to start developing your product with this clarity about this is the promise

31:23.360 --> 31:27.200
we'll make to customers at the end. And we're going to deliver on that promise because we can test

31:27.200 --> 31:33.680
and prove that in design sprints. So anyway, we start off, we talk about differentiators and we talk

31:33.680 --> 31:41.360
about classic differentiators, fast to slow, smart to not so smart to borrow from the iPhone slide,

31:41.360 --> 31:45.840
easy to use to hard to use and so on. And we just start off and have the team, okay, let's just

31:46.080 --> 31:51.360
score those up against the competition, put a sticky note on those continuums showing where you

31:51.360 --> 31:56.000
think the product could be. And usually you'll do this and maybe you'll start to see, well, there

31:56.000 --> 32:00.720
are a couple places where we can stand out on these classics. That's great. These classics are

32:00.720 --> 32:05.600
easily understandable by any, you know, any customer we're all sort of familiar with these kinds

32:05.600 --> 32:10.400
of things. So, okay, that's great. Then we get into writing custom differentiators. So we're

32:10.480 --> 32:15.440
going to write a bunch of, you know, good things on one end, crummy opposite on the other end,

32:15.440 --> 32:20.080
and then we're going to score those. And so for the Latchit story, we'll pick up with Chris and James

32:20.080 --> 32:27.040
here. You know, they've written, well, we could be really, we could really differentiate on network

32:27.040 --> 32:32.640
versus siloed. Our approach is networked if you're using Shopify or your siloed, right? Or we,

32:32.640 --> 32:37.200
you know, maybe we can differentiate on painless business growth versus labor intensive business

32:37.200 --> 32:42.880
growth. So that might be the specific way we describe the promise of our product. So after

32:42.880 --> 32:47.760
evaluating a bunch of these, writing a bunch of these, voting on them quietly, you know, and then

32:47.760 --> 32:50.800
the decider is going to say, all right, I want to choose a couple of these and we're going to try

32:50.800 --> 32:55.440
them out. The teams are going to, if you're running a foundation sprint, you're going to try out

32:55.440 --> 32:59.760
a few differentiators, you're going to score against your competitors. They're going to create a

32:59.760 --> 33:04.480
scale and you're going to say, okay, I'll just be honest. Let's be tough. Where do we really think

33:04.480 --> 33:10.000
we could stack up against the competitors on this differentiator we've chosen in great detail,

33:10.000 --> 33:15.600
plotting each, each company or product one at a time. Okay. So, you know, you do that for one

33:15.600 --> 33:19.120
differentiator. You do it for another. You do it until you feel like we've got two that are really

33:19.120 --> 33:24.560
strong. And then you make that business school 101 diagram. And so, you know, here's, here's

33:24.560 --> 33:29.920
this one for, so as Lyric, they changed their name to Latchet. Oh, I did that real time. I love this

33:30.160 --> 33:35.920
real time. So, yeah. So Latchets, you know, up here in the top right corner and we say, okay,

33:35.920 --> 33:41.840
look, this is a good differentiation chart because you've got this quadrant here, this quadrant here,

33:41.840 --> 33:46.480
this quadrant here, right? You've got the, so you're in the top right and you've got to be in the top

33:46.480 --> 33:51.200
right. What's it got to be in the top right? You always have to be in the top right. And if you

33:51.200 --> 33:57.920
see those others three quadrants, the top left, the bottom left, the bottom right, those form

33:57.920 --> 34:03.280
in L shape and we call that loser vill. So we want to, we want to have like a way of looking at the

34:03.280 --> 34:09.200
world that puts all of the competitors into loser vill. And then we want to say, okay, if you can

34:09.200 --> 34:13.760
deliver on that and if that promise is compelling to customers, so both those things have to be true.

34:14.480 --> 34:20.720
Can you deliver on it and do customers care and believe that that matters to them? If both of those

34:20.720 --> 34:25.760
things are true, you have a really compelling promise. You have the possibility of a very successful

34:25.760 --> 34:31.920
product. So now we've identified that and that's, that becomes a core of our hypothesis.

34:31.920 --> 34:39.840
Can we, is that differentiation true? So that's the differentiation step. Before you move on to

34:39.840 --> 34:43.520
the next step, is that where you're going next? Just so I could take a, yeah, yeah, okay,

34:43.520 --> 34:47.680
follow a couple of threads. This is so awesome. There's so many, there's just so much value here.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.800
Also just a slide at the end here, folks are watching YouTube. This is like your deck slide

34:52.800 --> 34:57.840
right where you show your competitors and you're better than them all. Yeah. And actually,

34:57.840 --> 35:04.080
I want to jump on that for a second because we've all seen two by two. Right, there's a ton of

35:04.080 --> 35:10.320
these. They're all over the place. And if you're anything like me, I just ignored these. I just

35:10.320 --> 35:16.400
thought these were pretty much BS up until like, well, whenever we started these foundations,

35:16.400 --> 35:21.360
friends, three or four years ago. And I think the reason why usually these, these two by two

35:21.360 --> 35:26.160
diagrams feel like this is just consultant below me. This is just like who we are now. It's,

35:26.160 --> 35:32.480
it's because you know, maybe one person makes this chart and they do it quickly because they need

35:32.480 --> 35:38.400
it to slide for the slide deck. And the audience they're considering, maybe it's investors. And so,

35:38.400 --> 35:42.720
you know, often these describe technology or they describe the market opportunity. They don't talk

35:42.720 --> 35:47.520
about the customer's perspective. And the other thing is that they're, they're not proven. There's

35:47.520 --> 35:52.080
no evidence behind the fact that these are these true. So if they are, if they did happen to be

35:52.080 --> 35:57.280
about customer perspective, it's unlikely that the whole team would have weighed in on on what those

35:57.280 --> 36:02.480
differentiators are. And it's very unlikely that we would have tested and proven that that that

36:02.480 --> 36:08.080
matters and that we can deliver on it. And so if you do all of those things and you do it at the

36:08.080 --> 36:12.960
beginning of the project, we think this has the potential when we've seen it, it's, it becomes this

36:13.760 --> 36:18.800
while this guiding light. Here's the North Star. We need to deliver on this. This is what we have

36:18.800 --> 36:23.840
to create. And that helps you make decisions all the way through your product development cycle.

36:23.840 --> 36:29.680
Just to point people to justification for why differentiation is so important. There's a couple

36:29.680 --> 36:35.840
episodes that I did that I'll point to in the show notes that just give you more context

36:35.840 --> 36:40.720
of why you need to differentiate. So I spoke of David Plastic, who is this naming expert that we

36:40.800 --> 36:45.520
just had on the podcast. He has whole thing is when he's coming up with a name for like sono,

36:45.520 --> 36:50.160
server cell or wind serif. It's different. It has to differentiate. And he talks about this in

36:50.160 --> 36:53.440
depth. So I'll point to that episode if you're and this is just like if you're not convinced,

36:53.440 --> 36:57.600
why we're spending so much time with differentiation. Also April Dunford, who's like the, I don't know,

36:58.640 --> 37:05.440
the, the God of positioning. She has differentiation in such a core part of her approach to positioning.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.320
And so there's just like so much evidence to tell you that you differentiation is a really

37:10.320 --> 37:15.840
important step and element of successful companies. One of the things that I've noticed about

37:15.840 --> 37:21.200
these topics that these the basics we talked about already differentiation this notion of

37:21.200 --> 37:25.360
you need a foundation for your project. It's a bit more under the radar for people. I think it's

37:25.360 --> 37:30.400
a bit harder for people to immediately see like, oh, we need this. We see the people who react the

37:30.400 --> 37:34.640
strongest to this and have the strongest like immediate affinity to this idea actually being

37:35.840 --> 37:41.360
startup founders. People who are really sophisticated like in this challenge product managers who are at,

37:41.360 --> 37:48.720
you know, we're invited in to speak at OpenAI and Anthropic about this. And we see the product

37:48.720 --> 37:52.080
people there being like, oh, my God, this is this is really powerful. This is the kind of stuff we

37:52.080 --> 37:56.960
need. I think for a lot of folks though, it can sound like this is just elementary, you know,

37:56.960 --> 38:01.440
differentiation. Of course, we need to differentiate. The problem is that all of this stuff gets

38:01.440 --> 38:06.720
background. It's something we've thought about a bit. We assume we're on the same page. We

38:06.720 --> 38:11.040
assume we're going to deliver something. But then kind of business as usual happens. We build a

38:11.040 --> 38:16.320
product. We get kind of more interested in the technology and delivering that. And we end up

38:16.320 --> 38:20.320
trying to sell it to customers at the end. We end up putting a coat of paint on it with the

38:20.320 --> 38:26.080
marketing page or sales deck. We haven't actually built from the beginning to saying that we know

38:26.080 --> 38:31.040
it's going to matter to people. One of the most useful steps here that I haven't seen before

38:31.040 --> 38:36.880
is just a starting place for how to even start thinking about differentiation. Like everyone's

38:36.880 --> 38:41.360
always probably thinking price and speed maybe. You guys have a really cool just starting list that

38:41.360 --> 38:45.200
you showed here. Anything more you can add here for helping people start to think about ways to

38:45.200 --> 38:50.320
differentiate beyond the obvious price and speed and I don't know, a couple more. So I'm just going

38:50.320 --> 38:56.400
to jump into another startup here just so we can see what this sheet looks like with scores on

38:56.400 --> 39:03.360
it. So this is a startup called mellow. Anyway, the standard classic differentiators where we start,

39:03.920 --> 39:12.880
they are fast to slow, smart to not so smart, easy to use to hard to use, free to expensive,

39:12.880 --> 39:22.720
focused to one size fits all, simple to complicated and integrated to siloed. So you could probably argue

39:22.720 --> 39:27.120
there's these others that should be included or some of those should be taken off. But what we like

39:27.120 --> 39:32.880
about this is that it's a small set. They're easy to understand. We know customers can understand

39:32.880 --> 39:38.800
these and they create a great starting place for your team to think about differentiation because

39:39.440 --> 39:44.880
you can quickly look at this list and start scoring where you think your product could be on these

39:44.880 --> 39:50.560
scales. And you know that if you can use one of these people will understand it. But it also starts to

39:50.560 --> 39:55.280
make the team comfortable with this notion of differentiation. And again, we want to make

39:55.280 --> 40:01.040
differentiation something that all of the co-founders or all of the core team can participate in.

40:01.040 --> 40:05.760
It's not just the job of the person writing the pitch deck. It's not just the job of the

40:05.760 --> 40:11.840
marketer or the salesperson, but we're getting everybody's perspectives in on it. And this is a

40:11.840 --> 40:16.080
great warm-up activity before we start to write our own custom differentiators.

40:17.280 --> 40:22.000
Awesome. And then again, this is just inspiration for coming up with more waste to differentiate.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.720
Something that is a common question I think for founders is price as a differentiator? Is there

40:26.720 --> 40:31.200
any insight you guys have there? Like how often do you land on price being a good differentiator

40:31.200 --> 40:37.840
with the startups you work with? I think price is rarely the most important differentiator.

40:37.840 --> 40:41.760
Part of what's interesting about going through these classic differentiators, these standard ones

40:41.760 --> 40:49.600
first, and then jumping into the custom ones is that the classic ones are sort of universal. But it

40:49.600 --> 40:54.800
is going to be hard to beat the competition on very many of these. Like it's going to be hard to

40:54.800 --> 40:59.600
build a product that's faster than what Google can build or what OpenAI can build. It's going to

40:59.600 --> 41:04.960
be harder to be cheaper than those competitors because they just have so many more resources.

41:04.960 --> 41:10.960
They can have loss leader products that are underpriced. Where I think pricing has become

41:11.840 --> 41:19.120
a really clear advantage for some companies is those that are leveraging AI to solve problems

41:19.120 --> 41:25.200
that were previously unsolvable with software. So we have a company that we invested in

41:25.760 --> 41:34.160
called Bindwell. They use AI to design precision pesticides. We ran a foundation sprint with them

41:34.160 --> 41:41.840
right after investing. Five years ago, you couldn't design pesticides with AI. It wasn't possible.

41:41.840 --> 41:47.440
Even if you had that idea, you wouldn't have been able to build it. Now you can. For them,

41:47.440 --> 41:53.600
one of the big advantages is these pesticides, they can be a lot cheaper because it doesn't require

41:53.600 --> 42:00.720
this massive team of R&D chemists to tinker and experiment with things in the lab to try to

42:00.720 --> 42:07.840
create new pesticides. We can design them with AI. So it is more often true in AI companies like

42:07.840 --> 42:13.760
that. But it's very difficult to compete on price in general. And we think we find that it is not

42:13.760 --> 42:19.200
as durable of an advantage as some of these other things. That is such a good point because

42:19.200 --> 42:24.640
historically price has been a don't compete on price. For exactly what you said, it's hard to

42:24.640 --> 42:28.880
do long term. It's kind of raised to the bottom. Especially if there's incumbents, they can price

42:28.880 --> 42:35.200
a lot lower. But with AI, that is a really often and strong differentiator. Like now do this thing.

42:35.200 --> 42:41.760
Like Kerser, you're basically competing on. You're saving engineering time and it's worth so

42:41.760 --> 42:47.440
much money to you. Yeah. In time, the output of the AI is probably not going to be quite as good

42:47.520 --> 42:53.120
as a human process. So it can be a little bit cheaper for now. But it has to be a lot cheaper.

42:53.120 --> 42:59.440
It has to be, you know, I've heard people offer 10X cheaper than the legacy sort of manual approach

42:59.440 --> 43:04.320
to solving that problem as a rule of thumb. That's awesome. Okay. I'll just quickly reference

43:04.320 --> 43:08.160
there is an episode that will come out before this with Motivon about pricing strategy. And

43:08.160 --> 43:12.240
there's a lot of discussion actually on this. Oh, great. Especially with how to design your price

43:12.880 --> 43:17.760
with customers as you're starting a company. Also, the episode with the founder of Superhuman

43:17.760 --> 43:22.480
Rahul, he actually spent, there's a lot of cool context on how he differentiated Superhuman.

43:22.480 --> 43:27.040
And it was actually very much on speed. Is speed actually? Yes. Speed was where he landed.

43:27.040 --> 43:31.120
And to your point, it was both, it was the Venn diagram of what you said. Can we do this

43:31.120 --> 43:36.160
and do people value it? And that's where his research pointed to is people really value this.

43:36.160 --> 43:39.600
And they were able to achieve it. One of the things that's really interesting about this

43:39.600 --> 43:45.760
example here that we're looking at in mellow is that you can see that they were not the best

43:45.760 --> 43:50.400
on all these scales. You know, it's in if teams are going through and they're being really realistic

43:50.400 --> 43:55.840
about how they stack up against the competition, it's normal and natural to find that you're not

43:55.840 --> 44:01.600
going to be the best on all these differentiators. And that is really helpful for creating clarity

44:01.600 --> 44:06.480
in your positioning and in your marketing because you're not going to show a featured checklist

44:06.480 --> 44:11.440
chart that, you know, says you're better at everything than every competitor. But if you can

44:11.440 --> 44:16.480
drive home one or two things that your customers really care about and that you can be radically

44:16.480 --> 44:22.880
better at, it's going to improve your chances of winning and finding product market fit. And

44:22.880 --> 44:26.720
we find that going through this process where you're not just thinking about one differentiator

44:26.720 --> 44:31.440
at a time, are you not trying to win on all of them, but you're looking across this scale of options

44:31.440 --> 44:36.160
and you're being just really honest about where you stack up. Can both point you in the right

44:36.160 --> 44:40.240
direction in terms of what you will win on, but also can give you the comfort to say, hey,

44:40.240 --> 44:44.480
it's okay if we're not better than every single company and every single one of these things.

44:44.480 --> 44:47.280
That's great context. That's going to make people feel a lot better, I think.

44:48.560 --> 44:53.520
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day

44:53.520 --> 44:58.240
to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. So I put the questions that I plan to

44:58.240 --> 45:03.200
ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. So I put my community resources to how I manage

45:03.360 --> 45:08.480
my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project that work and your vision

45:08.480 --> 45:13.680
is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part.

45:13.680 --> 45:17.600
In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs

45:17.600 --> 45:23.600
from project trackers and OKRs, the documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda.

45:23.600 --> 45:28.480
With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure

45:28.480 --> 45:35.040
of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI, all in one easy to organize

45:35.040 --> 45:41.280
tab. Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day and more than 50,000 teams trust Coda

45:41.280 --> 45:45.280
to keep them more aligned and focused. If your startup team looking to increase alignment

45:45.280 --> 45:50.000
and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time.

of the team plan. Coda.io slash Lenny. Anything else in differentiation before we move on to the

46:07.760 --> 46:13.200
third step of designing your approach? I think it's worth taking a look at what it looks like when

46:13.200 --> 46:19.280
you have a bunch of sort of these custom crafted differentiators. What that might look like? Because

46:19.360 --> 46:25.840
in the case of Mellow, we've got, I don't know, there must be 25 here. So they've written

46:26.800 --> 46:32.560
purposeful, magical, clear, personal, provides direction, flexible, human, creative, beautiful,

46:32.560 --> 46:38.400
all kind of, and on and on. What they're trying to get at and what we want every team to sort of

46:38.400 --> 46:44.080
think about here is what is a new version of reality, a new lens that you can offer to your

46:44.080 --> 46:48.400
customers on the world? Because a lot of times you're building a new product, you actually have to

46:48.400 --> 46:54.560
change the way people think about what's possible and what matters to them. Those classics

46:54.560 --> 46:59.440
are often already well-trodden ground where other people have differentiated they've already

46:59.440 --> 47:05.200
thought about it. But these new particular things that you know are possible with your technology

47:05.200 --> 47:09.440
that you know is possible with the customer problem, the things that you believe might matter.

47:09.440 --> 47:15.920
It's really interesting to you try some very fine-tuned list of, sometimes just a slight variation.

47:15.920 --> 47:20.960
We've slightly changed this wording or the way we describe what's great about what we do,

47:20.960 --> 47:26.000
and that is the thing we think is really going to stand out. And again, you can see even on this list

47:26.000 --> 47:31.840
that they've custom-written when we see where they score it, they're not all the way to the good

47:31.840 --> 47:34.880
end of the scale on all of them. You know, when they get honest and look through, they're like,

47:34.880 --> 47:39.920
well, actually, you know, maybe we can't deliver on this. But this one we really can, and this one

47:39.920 --> 47:46.080
we also suspect will matter to customers. Where did Mellow land on the differentiators they picked

47:46.080 --> 47:50.800
and where did Latchet land? Yeah, let's take a look. For Mellow, they tried out a bunch before

47:50.800 --> 47:57.920
they decided here. So they actually scored with the competitors on these scales. And just for

47:57.920 --> 48:07.600
context, Mellow is a tool that allows you to run very simple, very targeted, very useful AI agents

48:07.600 --> 48:15.280
for common everyday tasks like summarizing your email or cleaning up your calendar or drafting

48:15.280 --> 48:21.280
responses to messages. And one of their insights was that there's been so many AI products that

48:21.280 --> 48:28.480
have over-promised about being able to replace all humans and do anything and, you know, 10-X-year

48:28.480 --> 48:34.160
productivity. But so few of them have actually delivered on those promises. And so they have this

48:34.160 --> 48:40.080
insight that if they can be really focused and really human and really high quality and they can

48:40.080 --> 48:47.120
deliver on that promise of, you know, making your life better by offloading tedious tasks that

48:47.120 --> 48:51.200
that's going to really click with customers. That's a great context. Thank you for having that.

48:51.840 --> 48:58.000
So Mellow lands on mobile first and works out of the box if there are two differentiators. And

48:58.000 --> 49:04.160
they're trying to differentiate from, you know, gum loop and open AI as a generalized tool. And

49:04.160 --> 49:11.440
latch it, they're going to differentiate on, and we're pulling it up. If folks aren't watching,

49:11.440 --> 49:16.160
he's pulling up the mirror board to show us where they landed. Latch it, they're going to

49:16.160 --> 49:21.600
differentiate on, helps you grow and cooperative. So when they compare against Etsy, when they

49:21.600 --> 49:27.200
compare against Shopify or setting up your table at an art fair, they're going to differentiate

49:27.200 --> 49:30.880
on helps you grow and cooperative. And they think none of the competitors does both of those

49:30.880 --> 49:36.320
things well. That is cool. Thank you for sharing that. And to your point, this is where they think

49:36.320 --> 49:40.640
it will work. And then the next step is actually test this in the market, which is where we go from

49:40.640 --> 49:45.280
here. So let's move on to the next step in which is the final step of the foundation sprint.

49:45.280 --> 49:52.720
Yeah. So closing off differentiation is a short step that is just to create some project principles

49:52.720 --> 49:57.360
that will help you make decisions in line with that differentiation. And you know, you're just

49:57.360 --> 50:01.760
talking about superhuman and differentiating on speed. And when John and I worked at Google

50:01.760 --> 50:09.040
back in the 2000s, there was this list called Tim things we've found to be true. And one of the

50:09.040 --> 50:15.840
things on that list was fast is better than slow. And what was interesting is this is a mantra that

50:15.840 --> 50:20.480
you would actually hear people using in meetings to help dictate decisions. You know, well, we're

50:20.480 --> 50:29.360
considering this approach to this view or this approach, this approach renders 12 milliseconds

50:29.360 --> 50:33.040
faster. That's probably going to be the one we're going to take. As you said, you're really

50:33.040 --> 50:37.440
compelling reason for us to not go with just the one that renders faster or the one that gets the

50:37.440 --> 50:45.280
user to their benefit with one less click. And this notion that you can have a decision making

50:45.280 --> 50:52.080
guide. We think we've seen it be so useful for us in those contexts. We think, hey, this is an

50:52.080 --> 50:56.640
easy moment. You've got your differentiators kind of loaded up in your mind. Let's take a second

50:56.640 --> 51:02.800
here and just think, what's a principle? How can we turn that into a principle? So if we take a look

51:02.800 --> 51:08.160
at, watch it, you know, they've got help sellers help each other. So if they're trying to make a

51:08.160 --> 51:13.280
decision between two approaches, well, which one of these help sellers help each other? Or do the

51:13.280 --> 51:17.440
thing that makes sellers more money? If we're choosing between two things, let's do the one that

51:17.440 --> 51:24.000
helps make them more money. And so we then we've kind of moved on. We've got a mini manifesto. We

51:24.000 --> 51:29.120
call it, which is that differentiation chart. And these principles and the notion is this page,

51:29.120 --> 51:34.800
the basics page was just kind of the core simple stuff you need to know about this project.

51:34.800 --> 51:42.320
The mini manifesto in one page is your decision making guide. This is so cool. And this looks like

51:42.320 --> 51:47.760
it would take a lot of work. But again, this is just a day or two of sitting around working through

51:47.760 --> 51:52.960
this framework. Yeah, you'll get to this in, you know, four-ish hours with your, okay, by the end of

51:52.960 --> 51:58.560
the first day, you'll have a mini manifesto that describes how you win essentially as a company

51:58.560 --> 52:01.920
in a startup. Yeah. Or how you believe it's going to work. And of course, we're going to test it.

52:01.920 --> 52:06.640
Yeah. Now the next phase of the foundation sprint is just locking in on the approach we're going

52:06.640 --> 52:12.560
to start with. So we'll continue the story of latch it here to it's easier to use an example

52:12.560 --> 52:18.240
than to describe this in the abstract. So coming into character labs, latch it had sort of four

52:18.240 --> 52:23.920
approaches in mind, but they weren't sure which one to take. So they might build an app that's one

52:23.920 --> 52:28.480
approach they could take. They might build a sort of a newsletter platform. That's something

52:28.480 --> 52:33.120
obviously they knew how to do. They might build a Shopify plugin. That's a simple way to kind of

52:33.120 --> 52:36.800
piggyback on something people are already doing. They're right. They're number one competitors

52:36.800 --> 52:42.400
Shopify. Or they might have to build the full stack. And I think a big question for them was

52:42.400 --> 52:47.440
which of these and how much do we have to build before there's enough value for customers that

52:47.440 --> 52:51.680
they're actually going to adopt it. We're actually going to get some traction and get this thing going.

52:51.680 --> 52:56.560
And it's important to call out here that all four of these approaches solve the same problem

52:56.560 --> 53:02.720
for the same customer. And they are all likely to differentiate from the competition in the same

53:02.800 --> 53:08.960
ways based on the unique advantages that the founders, Chris and James bring to this company.

53:08.960 --> 53:14.400
So these are not like wildly different product ideas or company ideas. These are just different

53:14.400 --> 53:19.040
approaches. You have the same destination in mind, but you say, hey, which path can we take? It's

53:19.040 --> 53:23.440
like pulling up directions on Google Maps. This one's a little faster. This one uses less fuel.

53:23.440 --> 53:27.360
This one avoids tolls. What's the right approach for us to take?

53:27.360 --> 53:32.400
And I love that the work you did on that first day eliminates a lot of ideas you probably had

53:32.480 --> 53:35.840
that you would have probably spent time building and then realizing, okay, this doesn't make any

53:35.840 --> 53:42.800
sense. It's just like whatever it else has. Totally, totally. Yeah. And we usually see teams

53:42.800 --> 53:48.960
starting projects in one of two states. And one state is the state that latch it, find

53:48.960 --> 53:53.440
themselves in where gosh, there's a few different ways we could do this. How do we decide?

53:54.000 --> 53:58.960
We can discuss and discuss and discuss, but you know, that could go on forever. So that's state one.

53:58.960 --> 54:05.200
We know there are some options. And state two is we're pretty locked in on one approach already.

54:05.200 --> 54:11.520
We think we've got this figured out. In either of those cases, we think it's worth taking again,

54:11.520 --> 54:18.720
like about, you know, four hours ish to be really careful to lay out the options. If you think

54:18.720 --> 54:22.560
there's only one option to sort of force yourself to think, well, what if this doesn't work?

54:22.560 --> 54:27.440
What's another alternative? Or is there another alternative that we have previously considered

54:27.440 --> 54:33.440
and dismissed that we should maybe reconsider just to make sure? And end with a situation where

54:33.440 --> 54:38.480
you've made a decision clearly about, okay, we've considered alternatives. This is our first choice.

54:38.480 --> 54:45.120
And you've also identified, this is our backup plan so that failure doesn't seem quite so scary

54:45.120 --> 54:50.320
when we start to run experiments. And we're really able to pivot fast if should that happen.

54:52.160 --> 54:56.880
So what we're going to do on the second day of the foundation spread through this sort of

54:56.880 --> 55:04.160
third phase, which is the approach is to identify those different paths. So for latch it here,

55:04.160 --> 55:09.200
they've got ABC and D options. We're going to color code those. And then we're going to plot them

55:09.200 --> 55:14.640
on these charts. So we've got these different lenses. We call this activity magic lenses. And the

55:14.640 --> 55:19.920
notion is, if we had a discussion about it and we could, as investors, if we could imagine,

55:19.920 --> 55:26.160
like waving a magic wand and putting the perfect team of advisors in place to counsel the founders

55:26.160 --> 55:32.800
on this decision, we would love for them to have a customer expert, somebody who's just brilliant

55:32.800 --> 55:37.920
vision for the product and the customer experience. And they're hammering their fist on the table,

55:37.920 --> 55:42.160
saying the customer, the customer, the customer, make the decision that's best for the customer.

55:42.160 --> 55:48.960
And so we'll plot those options on these axes of easy to use versus hard to use and perfect

55:48.960 --> 55:53.200
solution to the customer problem versus just an okay solution to the customer problem.

55:54.080 --> 55:58.960
And then similarly, we want some an advisor who's going to pound their fist on the table for

55:59.680 --> 56:03.600
building something cheap and fast, getting it out in the market, being pragmatic, get it out

56:03.600 --> 56:07.840
there as fast as possible. That's the pragmatic lens. We want somebody who's going to advocate

56:07.840 --> 56:12.480
for growth. What's the way to reach the most customers, get it in people's hands as fast as

56:12.480 --> 56:18.000
possible, easy to adopt. We want somebody who's going to advocate for money for the financial

56:18.000 --> 56:22.640
health of the business. So what's going to create long-term value for the customers, where's

56:22.640 --> 56:28.000
where's the biggest audience of these folks? We want to look at differentiation, which we spent,

56:28.000 --> 56:31.840
you know, the first half of the foundation spread establishing, well, we want to consider these

56:31.840 --> 56:37.760
approaches through that lens as well. And so what the teams will do is to plot these options

56:37.760 --> 56:43.360
on these lenses. They'll almost always create some lenses of their own, some custom lenses that

56:43.440 --> 56:48.480
matter to them. You know, they might have one about their conviction. I think there's sort of a

56:48.480 --> 56:55.120
humorous one from Melo, where it's like, which, you know, founder is like, yes, exactly when I

56:55.120 --> 57:00.720
want to build. And on the other end of the spectrum, it's like, you know, nah, just kind of the

57:00.720 --> 57:04.640
the sort of heat of excitement that you feel, that might be a really important decision.

57:04.640 --> 57:07.920
That feels really important. Like that feels like that should be one year. You call these the

57:07.920 --> 57:12.160
magic lenses. Yeah. Yeah. It probably should be. It probably should. Just like how excited are

57:12.160 --> 57:16.880
you to build this? It feels like a really important piece. Yeah. We saw that one in this is the

57:16.880 --> 57:22.400
our cohort of labs that's going on right now. And I'll bring that one that one up for context.

57:22.400 --> 57:26.480
If we add it, we can call it the Lenny lens. Lenny lens. Yeah. Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah.

57:26.480 --> 57:33.840
Yeah. So yeah. So here it is. And you can see that Marie is more likely to swear than

57:33.920 --> 57:39.200
been, apparently, but it's it's crucial, right? And many founders, they'll have different.

57:39.200 --> 57:43.840
One of the challenges is that for each founder, I think, each set of founders, there's maybe a different

57:43.840 --> 57:49.200
way that they phrase what that means. What conviction means to them. And sometimes, and maybe it's

57:49.200 --> 57:53.200
as simple as this. It's just, I just feel it. I just know. And sometimes it's a little bit more like,

57:53.200 --> 57:59.200
well, I'd, you know, it's, it's a, it's conviction, but it's also what's the data that we have behind

57:59.520 --> 58:05.760
it. And that's what forms my intuition about it. Awesome. I love that lens. I love that your

58:05.760 --> 58:11.840
asterisk out. So it's not a little bit, a little bit, a little, a little slightly concealed slightly.

58:11.840 --> 58:19.680
That's the part. Yeah. If you zoom in, it's actually not censored. So the cool thing about this

58:19.680 --> 58:24.640
lens is the end. You've done all that. You've plotted it all out. And if you're having a conversation

58:24.640 --> 58:28.560
like that, you just have to sort of maintain and memory. What did that person say? What did that

58:28.560 --> 58:33.280
other person say? What's that conversation? I had, you know, a week ago, whatever. Here,

58:33.280 --> 58:38.400
it's all laid out. And sometimes you zoom out. And it's honestly as simple as like, Oh, hey,

58:38.400 --> 58:44.960
look, you know, the, the blue one is in the top right quadrant of almost every single lens. Like,

58:44.960 --> 58:50.560
what, what is that one? What's going on? That might just be an easy decision. Sometimes you zoom out

58:50.560 --> 58:56.320
and you say, Oh, clearly, like nothing wins in every lens. And that's actually really reassuring.

58:56.320 --> 59:00.960
Because then you know, there is no perfect decision. There's nothing that checks all the boxes.

59:00.960 --> 59:06.960
And that's going to help us decide because now we decide which is the most important lens,

59:06.960 --> 59:12.400
which is the most important viewpoint to take. And you can, you can actually move forward in either

59:12.400 --> 59:18.160
to either way, either situation you get in where there's sort of consistency across all the lens is

59:18.160 --> 59:23.280
or there's not you either pick a lens or you just pick the, the consensus winner.

59:23.440 --> 59:29.200
I love that this step answers a question that's been in the back of my mind that I think a lot of

59:29.200 --> 59:33.440
people wonder is they're hearing this is just why don't I just build something and launch it and learn

59:33.440 --> 59:39.520
and like, what am I spending all this time sitting in a room? And this is, and this to me is a big part

59:39.520 --> 59:44.880
of the answer is just like spending an hour or two thinking through here's the ideas we have.

59:45.520 --> 59:49.920
How do they compare on the, how do they look on these magical lenses, which makes so much sense.

59:50.400 --> 59:54.560
How do they just filter on what customers will love most will help us grow the fastest,

59:54.560 --> 01:00:00.000
will drive the most money, things like that. It's such a simple quick exercise that will save you

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.040
so much time building and launching and having to spend time learning. That is weekdays,

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.640
months of work versus a couple of hours can save you so much of that time.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.440
And it's also the case that you start building something. It's exciting. You can move fast.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.480
It's easy to easier and easier to see progress now with AI tools.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.840
And that act of building and starting to create something has a

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.080
momentum of its own that can be hard to stop. And if you're headed in the wrong direction,

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.680
you can spend a lot of time building and making progress. But it's just, if it's not progress in

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.720
the right direction, it's actually hurting you. And that's why we want people to pause and take

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:52.560
this. It's really, as you said earlier, the ROI is high. But it feels very unnatural to pause

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.360
when you're so excited at the beginning and ready to go to pause and say, okay, let's make sure

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.600
we're taking the right path. But you know, you just imagine your, you know, your Gandalf,

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.080
your Frodo, you're starting off, you're trying to get to Mordor, it's a long trip.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.920
You don't want to take the wrong path. You want to take the, you know, think before you start

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.320
marching through, you know, the swaps or whatever. One phenomenon we've seen when teams are

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:22.240
building things really quickly with AI is that the more AI generated or assisted they are,

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.080
the more generic, they tend to turn out, which makes sense if you think about how

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.120
LLMs were developed, you know, they're all basically pre-trained on the same data. And so in this

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.040
excitement and this rush to say, wow, look at how fast we can build it, you actually end up with

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:41.120
something that is less differentiated than what already exists in the world. And then, you know,

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.440
let's say you launch it and that, you know, takes longer than building sort of a clickable prototype,

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.800
but you launch it because you're moving so fast. And then you get data from the people who managed

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.320
to find that thing about what they did with it, but you don't get any data about what they didn't

01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:01.040
do with it. And you certainly don't get any data about the people who never found it, who never,

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.960
you know, tried it, maybe they landed on your website and they're like, blah, another like,

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:12.320
another generic AI generated thing, like that's not worth my time. And so we think it's really helpful

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:18.880
to basically put yourself in a situation where you can slow down a little bit and do some like

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.600
some some hard thinking, some deep thinking about what's actually going to make your product unique.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.640
And then you can switch into this mode of like, okay, great, now let's go as fast as possible and

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.960
get that out into customers hands. But if you don't take this step first, it's actually kind of

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:40.640
counterintuitive that going fast can actually slow you down in the long run. Yeah, to build on that,

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:48.080
I had this guest recently, Bob Baxley. Yeah, I was. Okay. So he has this really interesting insight.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:53.600
He calls, he calls it, I think he calls it the primal mark. Essentially his feedback is

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.960
way as long as possible to start any sort of sketch or prototype because as soon as you start

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:05.440
drawing what you're building, it now everything you do will be a response to that. And so the more

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.240
time you can spend before starting to concept out the solution, the more likely art of land on

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:17.600
something that works. Yeah, that is super interesting. And you know, it's it is counterintuitive.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.560
Yeah. And I find myself challenged to think about it in the context of the sprints that we run

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:29.360
with founders, but I think one way to interpret that in in the work that we do is that we used to

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.400
just run design sprints with with every team like that was our hammer and and you know, everything

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.280
looked like a nail. And part of what we found so valuable about doing the foundation sprints is

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:46.240
that it it keeps you away from ideation for just a little bit longer and it it forces you to think

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:52.480
about, you know, why you're unique and and the market that you're going into before you get to

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.000
that moment of creating something that looks realistic and then maybe being a little bit locked

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.840
into to that approach. That's such a like I love that that this emerge out of that. Like you guys

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.800
are we're so design sprint oriented and it's just like cool. It's just make prototype. Let's

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.440
design. Let's make it real. Let's show people. And that's like I think where a lot of people's

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.920
minds are at more and more or and maybe as a result. And then this is almost like a okay,

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.080
maybe that wasn't the right approach to start. Maybe it's actually better to think a little bit

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.240
of what we want to design and build before. And so just the fact that you guys spent so much your

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:31.600
life and time on that and then realize this is actually potentially even more important to do

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:38.880
is it says a lot. Well, and I ideas always get to still down to like one thing that people

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:44.560
grab onto and they they focus on. And I think with the design sprint, it got to still down to

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:51.920
just build a prototype. Just quit messing around and build something. But the reality is when

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.240
you run a design sprint, it's five days and you don't build the prototype until the fourth day.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:02.880
So you do a bunch of work to figure out how does our customer learn about this thing?

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:07.920
What are the different ideas that we're bringing to what our solution could look like?

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.800
Which of those are the most likely to work? And only then at the end of the week, are you building

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:18.640
a prototype? But I do think that as the that method has become really widely known, people just

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:24.800
think about the, you know, let's build something. And then once you multiply that times the power of AI,

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:31.280
it definitely creates this narrative that the only way to build something new is to just create

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.880
the product as quickly as possible. And that doesn't really match our experience. You know,

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.320
that doesn't really kind of fit the pattern of what we've seen working best across the few

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.760
hundred companies that we've worked with. I think this validates in some ways the role of a

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:54.240
product manager, where PM's job is to help the team figure out what should we be building. And

01:05:54.240 --> 01:06:00.000
are we all aligned on what we're building before we start designing and building? And so this is

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.120
almost like, like this process is almost like the product requirements document of a company.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.360
Wait, I think a lot of product people listening to this will feel really good about.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:16.560
Yeah, we see this as a great tool for product people. It's a way to give you a structure

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:23.760
for leading your team through those decisions and a way to give the all the folks on a team,

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:29.040
including the person who's the product leader, but the person who's the engineering leader,

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.280
the person who's the marketing leader, the sales leader, the design leaders.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:40.000
The exact right opportunity to contribute and participate in forming the strategy,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.160
the exact right opportunity as we get into design sprints following the foundation sprints

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:51.440
to then make it real and, you know, turn that idea, that hypothesis about what might work

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.560
into hopefully evidence that it does work. I feel like it's actually more helpful than

01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:02.000
to engineers, like non-product people, because I think a PM brain would be like, I want to do this

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:07.200
intuitively, whether they do it right or not. I think it's other functions almost. They're like,

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:12.640
no, just jump straight to design, straight to prototyping. Let me ask you, like, what we're in this

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.960
tangent, we're in this wild tangent out of this process, but I want to, as this question has been

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:23.680
my mind, because I recently had a founder on the podcast, Mayor, who built this company called

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:29.760
Base 44, he built it, it sold in six months for $80 million to weeks. And this journey of that is,

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.320
he just had a problem, he wanted to solve for himself, for his girlfriend, for a scouts program,

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:39.760
he built it, people started using it, he kind of evolved it from there. And obviously he didn't go

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:45.840
through a process like this. Thoughts on just like, is it okay to just do that? When should someone

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.400
think about, okay, I should actually set a site time to do a foundation sprint versus, like,

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.200
I'm just motivated to solve a problem for my friend, so I'm just gonna build it, evolve it, iterate

01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:03.280
with them, kind of go from there. One of the observations from our hundreds of experiences

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.480
working alongside founders in the early days of their projects and watching them make decisions

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:18.880
and watching them try things and succeed or fail is that there are so many founders who are

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:25.680
incredibly bright, incredibly capable. They have great insights about the market, about an

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:32.880
opportunity. And yet, their startup does not work out. And we, there's a problem with

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.800
selection bias that we, you know, we, we hear from the folks who, they were brilliant, they were,

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.640
you know, they checked all those boxes I just described, they saw a great opportunity,

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.560
they were smart, they executed well, they had courage and conviction and they did it.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.840
And it worked out and it was a tremendous success. And I think that the danger in thinking like,

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.960
well, they didn't follow the process, so I don't need to. And, you know, that may be true. And,

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:04.880
you know, that's, that maybe, maybe you don't need it. But what we believe is you have a better,

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:10.480
this just increases your odds. This is a chance to get more clear on, is this a good opportunity,

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:17.360
to get more clear on, will the thing I build click with customers? And, you know, if you've already

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.600
figured out that, no, this thing's my, my product has taken off, my product is working. We've

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.960
actually had founders and labs who, well, they started off character labs and they said, you know,

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.480
I started selling this thing and it's already taking off. I want to stop running experiments. And

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:36.400
we're like, yeah, stop running experiments. You don't need to do this. If you've got a product

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.800
market fit, if you've got evidence that this thing is clicking and you're, you have conviction,

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.560
run with it. But if you're not there, this is a great path to get you going.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.440
And if you're not sure if the thing you're going to build is going to turn into that, you know,

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:58.080
$80 million exit in, you know, six months, we believe this is a good chance to improve your odds.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.480
People hearing this might feel like, I haven't heard of any company doing this. That has become a

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.960
trillion dollar IPO success. What, what would make me believe that this is a, the process I should

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.760
follow versus just, I'm just going to do what I hear on YC, just build it, launch it, or rate that

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.920
anything. What can you share to give people confidence? This is the approach to take.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.560
Well, the first thing I'd say is give us some time where we're pretty new to this. We started

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.600
character labs about three years ago. We created the foundation sprint about three years ago.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:35.600
But more seriously, when we were creating this method, one of the things that we did was look back

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:40.640
across all the projects we've been involved in and the ones that were really successful. And we

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:47.040
looked for patterns. And while those teams didn't have the foundation sprint, they ended up having

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.880
really clear differentiation in a really clear view of what made them unique, that they were

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.840
able to build on. And as we ran design sprints with them, we were able to test and validate

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:04.160
against that differentiation. So we believe that this is sort of a key to success, even if those

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.960
teams didn't have access to this exact same methodology. So what I'm hearing is this is essentially

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.880
like alpha in starting a company. This is a new process that companies are just starting to use.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:21.120
You guys are working closely with founders and it's rooted in the success of many, many,

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.960
many companies that you guys that were involved in early on and continue to be involved in.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.200
Yeah, it's based off of this thing we've seen again and again in the most successful projects.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.000
When we're inside the room in the early days and we're seeing people make decisions,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.840
this is what drives those decisions. It's differentiation. And so if we look back across,

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:48.480
you know, all of the sprints that we've been a part of over the years and John and I have been

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.240
inside lots of these rooms, lots of these conversations. And if you're not watching on YouTube,

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.920
by the way, there's a cool visual that Jake is showing. Yeah, it spans across Google, Google Ventures,

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.840
Character Capital. And if you're watching on YouTube, you'll see all these little white circles

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.320
and each one sort of represents, you know, a company that we've seen inside of during these

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:12.000
design sprints. And there are a lot of really great success stories in there. You know, we've

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:17.280
had the chance to, I mentioned the story of Google Mead and being there and figuring out what is it

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:22.960
that's going to make this thing stand out. That was what made the project finally start to take off.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:28.720
And to this day is still sort of what animates it. Being inside of, you know, the early days of

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.760
what became Google photos or Google trips and some of the early design sprints and there's a lot

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:39.200
of other on here. But honestly, of course, we've also seen inside a lot that didn't work out.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.280
If we looked inside the greatest hits, though, the real smash successes, we looked inside all of

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:53.840
those. We realized there is a common element and that common element and all of them is differentiation

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:58.720
that there was clarity around. This is what we're trying to prove to customers. This is the promise

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.600
we're making. And so we've been on those teams where we've worked alongside those founders who

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:09.200
have this clear idea of differentiation. And sometimes they're not right. They run the experiments

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.920
and they change it. But the thing is, they're keyed into differentiation as being crucial. They're

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:18.160
not just thinking about the product and trying to get the right shape of the product or trying to

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.360
make it usable or whatever. They're really keyed in on differentiation. And how do we find the

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:29.040
right promise and deliver on that promise and express that promise to customers? So to explain a

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.840
little bit quickly of what I mean by differentiation and how this is manifested in products we've seen,

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:39.280
if you go back to the early days of Gmail in the 2000s, you know, if you had email, you were probably

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:43.840
using hotmail or Yahoo and it worked fine and you didn't have to think about it and this new product

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.480
comes along and you're like, God, I'm not going to want to switch my email address. What a hassle.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:55.920
Who wants to do that? No one. Gmail's promise was, hey, massive storage, great search. And as we

01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:01.120
were building the product out and, you know, marketing and explaining it to people and making

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:07.200
decisions inside the project, we had to continue to deliver on great search, great search, great

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:12.640
search. That was that was key to standing out. Fast forward 2014 and we're working with this

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.880
tiny company who's now competing with Gmail, who's now like sort of the market leader people are

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:23.760
used to using in, you know, their teams. And here's this new messaging software called Slack

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:28.640
and they're trying to reach new customers and gosh, switching to Slack isn't even bigger hassle

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:34.080
than switching to your email address because everybody on the team has to switch. Well, Slack says,

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:39.920
hey, if you believe that having fun and boosting teamwork is important, it's going to be clear

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.040
to you. This is a new way of looking at the world. And when they were making their decisions in their

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.680
first big ad campaign, their first big marketing campaign, this was what they were trying to convey

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.920
to customers. So we kind of kind of see that from the inside. Another one, we didn't see this one

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.440
from the inside, but one that we're all sort of familiar with is what happened with, with

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.640
Chagy PT, you know, it goes from this trusted, I don't have to think about it, I'm going to run

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.040
a Google search to, oh, wow, it's a new way of looking at the world. There's zero clicks, just

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.960
tells you the answer, busing is great. This is also something that we've seen in some of the

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:18.240
early success stories from our own portfolio. So 2019, this company called Reclaim going after

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.040
calendar management. And, you know, most of us manage our own calendars, most of us don't have

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.520
administrators helping us out with that. And you know, it's free. We're in control. Reclaims

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:33.360
argument was, hey, we can automatically, we can use AI to help you focus and automatically

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.200
prioritize your calendar. And that animated enough people to take the plunge and switch and try it

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.840
out that they were able to build up an audience of, you know, tens of thousands of users and drop

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.680
box acquired them last year. A great answer to my question, you guys, who will prepare it for,

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:56.560
for those skeptics. Part of our motivation, our, our selfless motivation with this foundation

01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:01.600
sprint is that, you know, now that we are investing our own money into companies and we're working

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.800
with all these founders, we want them to have that same clarity on differentiation. You know,

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:12.080
we saw how important that was to Gmail and to Slack and to all these other companies. And we

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.920
want to bring that, we want to sort of give them that same advantage and help them avoid the,

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.920
you know, the pitfalls that all the other unsuccessful teams and companies that we've seen have fallen

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.960
into. So that's, that's kind of what we're trying to do here is bring the lessons from these really

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:32.800
successful teams into, you know, any team that reads the book and runs this process.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:39.120
And the special sauce that John and I bring is that we're obsessed with the sequence of

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:44.720
decisions that you make and how you work together with your team to make good decisions quickly.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:52.240
And that specificity about the method is something that we, we do have a lot of evidence behind

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.320
it working well because of what's happened with the design sprint and with how many successful

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:02.160
teams have ever owned that at those companies who are, you know, trillion dollar or whatever kind

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:08.000
of genetics of team, all kinds of teams run design sprints. This is that same methodology around

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.200
how we work together at high velocity and high quality. And it's just brought to a different part

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:20.160
of the process. Excellent answer. Speaking of the method, we went on the world's most epic tangent.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.160
I want to bring us back. We haven't finished actually going through the process. I think we're

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.840
towards the tail end of it. So let's just finish that. What else do you do? So you have this,

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:33.760
this, uh, yeah, I guess, yeah, let's catch us up. Let's catch up with Latchit. So as a refresher,

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:40.320
for you who forgot Latchit are building this tool for artisans. They want to help them sell with

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:46.480
the community networking features. Like you might find one sub stack and they've identified their

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:52.960
differentiation. They've identified their approach now using magic lenses and all of this is

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:58.720
going to come together to create a founding hypothesis. So if we help artisans solve online

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.920
sales growth with a social sales app and then they've also got their backup plan or we could build

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.880
the full stack solution. If that doesn't work, we believe they're going to choose it over Shopify

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.120
and Etsy because our solution is cooperative and easy to use. And in this single sentence,

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.400
we've laid bare their strategy and now they're going to try to find out was that work?

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:26.800
So that is so cool. So the output of the sprint is the founding hypothesis. And I love that the

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:32.240
term hypothesis is a part of this because it's not telling you this will work. This is the thing

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:40.800
you will now test. Absolutely. And every project has at its core, every new product has at its core

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:47.040
a hypothesis. There is a founding hypothesis. It's just usually not explicit. It's usually hidden

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.200
and different people on the team may have different ideas about what it is. And because it's not

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:57.360
explicit, it's very hard to interrogate it and test it and find out if the different variables in

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:02.080
it are right variables. I'm curious what's in that photo. It's at the right as you're showing the

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:08.000
YouTube. Oh, yeah. If you're on YouTube. So this is just we did this sprint together in person

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.960
and so on Latchet's board. And you're going to see that like here's where they wrote it out and

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.400
took a photo of it and dropped it in and then later filled it out on the mirror board. Beautiful.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.560
And it has their old name there there. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Every brand that lyric which

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.160
it turns out is not the easiest for SEO. So a lot of lyrics out there. There's a lot of lyrics. I

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:33.200
know some lyrics. And just to understand is the next step, the design sprint and that's where you

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.840
actually start testing. Exactly. So we zoom out now. We see now they're going to head into a

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:42.320
sequence of design spreads running one after another. Each of those design spreads starts with the

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:47.360
founding hypothesis. Then the team is going to say, okay, what are the biggest risks that you

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:52.800
know that hypothesis not being true? What do we need to assess right now? Going to make a map

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.120
of how customers discover the product, what that core experience looks like and then figure out

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:02.640
using that map. Where's the where's the key moment for assessing that risk that so for them,

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.320
the biggest risk is do people even, well, these artisans even want this thing? Are they actually

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:13.200
going to want to have a community sharing sort of sales platform? And they decide the key moment

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.440
for us to test that's actually on the landing page. They figure we can prototype landing pages

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:22.720
that describe the product and learn a lot for our first experiment just just with landing pages.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:27.760
They're going to sketch solutions. This will be familiar to anyone who's you know heard about

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:32.960
design spreads. I guess each person sketching their own proposal for how that key moment should

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.400
choose the strongest of those. In this case, they choose they're going to actually prototype

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:43.520
three things. So they test three things head to head against each other, fake brands for each one.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:48.160
So they look like three different products. And then this is a really key part. At the end of

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:52.960
the design sprint, we've got a scorecard. And this is actually a new innovation. This is not in

01:20:52.960 --> 01:21:00.640
the sprint. Oh shit. Here we go. A lot of the presses design sprint improvement. So this scorecard

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.240
is going to break down the founding hypothesis. Hey, as we talked to each customer,

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:09.120
was this the right person as the right kind of customer for us? Do they have the problem that we

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:14.320
think they have? Was this the right approach for them? Did they choose it over the competition?

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.240
They're going to test these prototypes head to head and also show people like, okay, here's Etsy.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:23.840
Here's Shopify. Now out of all these five options, think about out loud about, you know,

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:29.360
what do you, how do you compare these? So do we believe they'd actually choose it? That the

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:35.920
differentiation actually work for those differentiators valuable and motivating to them? Does it click?

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:42.880
So our new book is called click. And you know, the idea there is you can see when a product clicks

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:48.320
with one person. And that's a, that's a helpful signal. Now granted, these interviews are kind of a

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:53.680
simulation. It's not like the real world, but there are helpful signal that we're on track for

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:58.800
product market set. If we see, gosh, this product seems to be clicking with customer after customer,

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.080
that's a really strong signal. And that's when people start to get the confidence that it's

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.080
time to build. That's a really good term, by the way. That's a such a good way to describe what

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.880
it feels like. It doesn't just click with them. Just kind of clicks. Yeah. And if you look across

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.800
latch hits first scorecard, there's a ton of red. It's a lot of things that didn't work.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.400
The conclusion at the end in this last column, there's a conclusion. Hey, we interviewed,

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:26.800
this case, they interviewed four customers. Well, it looks like this is the right customer. It

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.600
looks like they have this problem, but everything else kind of didn't work about the hypothesis.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.560
The approach wasn't working. Differentiation wasn't working. There's some mini hypotheses,

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:42.480
kind of about the prototype itself, just lots of red on here. So they spread again. And just zooming

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:48.880
out for a second, this is a team who just started working on this new company. And you know, sometimes

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:54.320
it can feel slow. We talked about it feeling slow to go through all these steps, but they're only

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:59.600
a week in. And they've already built three prototypes. And they've tested those three prototypes.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.880
It was four real customers. And they have this super detailed scorecard of here's what's working.

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:10.480
Here's not what's not working. That's after a week. So it's interesting how what can feel slow

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:16.800
in the hour to hour actually can really speed you up in the weeks and months time scale.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:21.920
That was such good context because I was feeling that and to your point, most founders do not do this

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:27.280
much testing, iterating, learning in the first few weeks of their startup. They might spend a few

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:32.160
weeks just talking to customers without showing a prototype. And then they might spend a few months

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:36.960
building an MVP. And then they might, you know, maybe they're going to spend some more time talking

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:41.360
to customers while showing them the MVP, maybe they'll do manual onboarding, something like that.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:45.440
But yeah, that plays out over months. And it fits with what founders tell us. You know, it's,

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:51.040
of course, it's a subjective measure. But founders who go through this process with us, they say that

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:55.920
they're able to accelerate three to four months of work into the three or four weeks back-to-back

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:00.480
sprints that we're doing together in character labs. Excellent context. Thanks for throwing that in

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.640
there. And these conversations with customers are so much more fruitful and pointed when you've

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:11.600
got the context that I know exactly what my hypothesis is and you have prototypes to show them.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:17.520
We have a founder in our group of startups in character labs at the moment. I'm thinking of Maruti,

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:24.640
John, who comes from doing sales at Rippling. And we had been talking to tons of customers while

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:31.440
starting off his company. And he said, you know, I had 50 conversations over the past month,

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:36.960
but I learned so much more from even the first conversation when I had a hypothesis and I had a

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:43.600
prototype or a couple prototypes to show them. It's like night and day. That is a great example.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.200
This all makes sense. As you guys describe it, like you're actually testing something very

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:55.280
concrete that your entire team is aligned behind and actual prototypes and you've thought about

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.520
different directions. So it's you're testing something very specific versus just generally

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:05.600
testing at your general concept. As we go into the second design sprint for

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:13.680
Latchit, they're making some edits to their founding hypothesis now. They're, you know,

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:20.160
revising a few things, making new sketches, new proposals for what this solution might look like.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:26.160
They've learned a lot in that first sprint, a new prototype that got a prototype that has more

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.120
detail now. So they are engineers. They're starting to actually write some code and put some more

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.840
detail behind the product. It's more robust. And again, they're trying to fix that positioning.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.200
Here's their scorecard. And if you're watching on YouTube, you'll be able to see it. But again,

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:47.120
there's a lot of red here. At first blush, the scorecard is bleeding. But there are some promising

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:51.760
signs. There's like maybe a few little sunbreaks. There's some spots where some of the red has

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:57.440
started to flip to yellow. And so if we look at the conclusion on the far right, they're starting to

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.160
believe their differentiation is dialed in. And they're starting to believe that this could be

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.240
the right approach. They may be able to get people to choose it to the competition, even though

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:10.080
they haven't done it yet. So those are starting to become yellow lights on the scorecard.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:17.440
And now they'll take what they've learned. And now we're into the third consecutive week of

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.840
design sprints. Again, they're going to sort of review that founding hypothesis. They're going to

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.120
sketch. They're recruiting a new slate of customers as they do each week. A new prototype,

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:33.440
again, more code in the prototype. It's becoming more and more robust, more realistic as they're

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.400
also adjusting the marketing and the positioning at the same time. So all of these things kind of

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:43.440
go in concert, the product itself and the marketing are sort of one as they're as they're moving along.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.240
And this is an extreme example of everything is green. Everything's green. If you can't see

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:56.240
every single one is green. And this is this is extreme, but it is a pattern that we see this is

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:02.080
real again and again. This is a real example. Wow. How do I invest in this round? This is great.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:09.840
Yeah, this is great. So we see this again and again. And I can share a couple of other

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.200
boards of ones that are in progress. We're also constantly adjusting the template so you can

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.240
get to see a little bit more how the how people will edit their their founding hypothesis from

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.200
sprint to sprint. So you know, mellow, who we were talking about, here's their first prototype.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.200
And you know, here's their first scorecard. Lots of lots of yellow for them. Maybe they're a little

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:34.800
bit more likely to use yellow than red. And then here's the edits to their founding hypothesis

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:39.360
after the first sprint. So you can kind of see in red, they're changing, slightly changing the

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:44.320
definition of their target customer from the first week. It's slightly changing the problem that

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:49.440
they're solving, slightly changing the approach, slightly changing the competition. They've dialed

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.520
in. They've gotten more crisp on who are we up against? They've gotten a little bit more crisp,

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:59.360
just a tiny tweak on what how do we explain this to people to get them excited about it? What's the

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.160
differentiation? They sprint again, they prototype again. And if we just jump down and just looking at

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.200
hypotheses, they learn a bunch and out. There's another slight tweak to that founding hypothesis.

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.960
And so week after week, you're learning, but you're also really able to,

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.000
able to track exactly what is it that we learned and how does that affect our strategy?

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:25.920
Okay, guys, this was incredible. I think we've covered the entire process. I love that you also

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:31.520
covered the design sprint pieces, which isn't part of this book, but it's such a core. If

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.240
clearly these things are very connected and meant to work together. So you go from here's the

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:41.440
thing we should be building to actually test it. Let me ask you before we wrap up. Is there

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:46.320
anything else that you think is really important for people to know before they start trying this

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.280
process at home? And is there anything you can point them to to actually try this at home?

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:58.240
One thing we didn't talk about, we use an example of a company who's not building an AI first

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:05.760
product. Latchets building, you know, this networked community sales platform for artisans.

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:11.360
It'd probably be interesting to look at how people use this when they are building a very technical

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.680
product. When they're vibe coding prototypes, that's a question we're getting all the time.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.760
What's the influence on this of the speed with which you can build something? That's an awesome idea.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:23.840
Let's definitely do that. Okay, so let's jump in here and take a look at a company, again,

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:30.160
in our current group of labs teams. Actually, on Orbital, it's called, and the founder, Denny J,

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:35.200
is actually running this whole process solo, which is pretty cool too. He's a remarkable guy.

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:41.360
We have a couple of solo founders right now who are able to generate, you can see, just give

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:45.120
like a sneak peek. He's generating when we talk about customers, all these sticky notes himself

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.320
and making the decisions himself about which is the right one. But to ground us in this story,

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:56.800
his founding hypothesis is he wants to help geospatial devs solve these sort of complex workflows with

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:03.840
a browser-based no-code development environment. We'll take a look just really quickly at what his

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:12.480
prototypes look like. In the first week, I can show you this prototype right here. It's a marketing

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:21.680
page, and on this marketing page, there's a link to a video. So if I click find out more,

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:29.040
I'm going to see this video, and this video, we're going to kind of hear Denny J talking over it,

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:34.560
and it's going to kind of walk through a screen share of a very rudimentary version of what

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:39.520
this product might look like. Now, if you're watching on YouTube and you see this prototype,

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:42.560
you might think, boy, that marketing page and the demo itself,

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:49.520
pretty bare bones, not the most polished looking. This doesn't look super compelling.

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:55.600
So he was focusing in that first sprint on the messaging, on finding those people who actually

01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:01.840
have that role, testing it with them, and he learned a lot. So if we go back to his scorecard,

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:06.880
we'll see, okay, that was a pretty good one. Actually, a lot of green on his first scorecard,

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:11.360
but he also felt like what he tested was pretty incomplete. Now, one thing that's cool here,

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:15.520
we saw the big leap with Latchit from one week to another in terms of their learnings in the

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.640
scorecards. One of the things that's interesting here is to go from Denny J's first prototype here

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:27.840
to his second prototype, and it's obvious he's been able to just build a ton in the next week.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:32.640
And he's using AI-based tools. He's doing a lot of work. He's also just a terrific engineer,

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:38.400
but here we've got like a much more real looking marketing page, very detailed. And an important

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:44.400
thing that he's done here with this is he's built out a lot and created a video of something so

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:50.080
that the product, while not fully functional, you can see exactly how it works. So if we sort of

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:56.160
play this video, he's created this demonstration of what it looks like when you type in a query into

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:02.400
the engine and exactly the kinds of results you get. And by doing a combination of vibe coding,

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:08.240
real coding, all of which is based off of, you know, pencil sketches, we can go back and see the

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:11.920
sketches he's doing on paper to define, this is what I think needs to be in there to make this

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:16.720
compelling to deliver on my differentiation. And then he's using a product video so that the

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:23.520
entire thing doesn't have to work fully freeform. That's what it can look like when a team is

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:29.360
building something that's, you know, more AI-centric when it's a more sophisticated tool when people

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.760
are going to be curious about the sort of the ins and outs of it. So along those lines,

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:39.360
where do you find people are leveraging AI most in helping them through these sprints,

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:44.720
through either the foundation sprint or the design sprint? And mostly you just vibe coding prototypes.

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:53.040
That's definitely the first and biggest use of AI in sprint so far is making prototypes that

01:32:53.040 --> 01:33:00.720
look more realistic faster. And, you know, it's kind of like having an entire prototyping team

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:05.200
on standby, right? So that you don't have to just make it yourself and sort of piece things together,

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:10.400
but you can have a ton of people ready to jump in, make something look really realistic.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:16.800
But it's also really critical we found that while you're outsourcing that prototyping work,

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:23.600
you don't outsource the thinking. You don't kind of skip over the part where you think about,

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:28.560
well, what is the actual copy on the website? How do I actually describe what the product is? How

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:35.680
it's differentiated? And so it's one of the reasons why doing the foundation sprint first and then

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:43.840
doing a design sprint can really help you. And, you know, because it allows you to spend time working on

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:49.200
that harder part of what it means to design and build a product. And then once you have a

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:54.560
clear view of that, then you can use AI tools to go really fast. And, you know, in this example,

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:58.880
that Jake is showing of action and orbital, people get really clever about which parts of this need

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:03.360
to be real, which parts of this can be vibe coded, which parts of this can just be a static Figma mockup.

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:09.520
And it's all about kind of creating a simulation, something that looks realistic that you can put

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:15.440
in front of real customers to help you answer the key questions. That's a really good point

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.280
that you're making. And again, it's just a reminder, you will move faster if you slow down a little

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.840
bit at the beginning, that because prototyping is so easy now and just things that look, it's so

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:27.680
easy to make something that looks really nice and kind of doing what you want, but spending a

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.880
little time making sure you understand what you're testing and what you want becomes more important.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.840
We had a couple of teams in this current group of character labs where they jumped to vibe coding

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:45.680
prototypes right away, at the very beginning. And when you generate something using an LLM,

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:51.680
using an AI tool, it looks pretty real. It looks believable. And so I think there's a temptation to

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:57.680
say like, okay, this is good to go. It looks close enough that I'm just going to show that to

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:05.040
customers. And then what they found was actually it was super generic. It didn't really describe

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:10.640
what the product was. It didn't really describe how it was different because it was generated by

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:17.520
a model that is trained on existing products. And so in that second sprint, that was when they

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:22.880
really took a step back and said, okay, let's think through this and then shift into prototyping mode.

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:26.880
So it's definitely helping people speed up, but we also think there's an important lesson here

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:31.600
that while you're outsourcing prototyping, don't outsource the thinking as well.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:36.160
I see pulling something up, Jake, that might be. Yeah, I imagine you want to show.

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:41.200
Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting to see the sketches that went into Denny J's prototype,

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.880
the Axi and Orbital prototype that we just looked at, because they are super detailed. And

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.600
this is doing this level of thought where you're pausing, you're being really intentional about

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:56.960
what does the customer need to know, what needs to happen for them to find a solution to their

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:04.000
problem on, you know, and within the product. That's a way of doing your prompt engineering.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.040
If you end up via coding this prototype, but you start off with a very clear plan about this is

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:14.960
what the thing needs to look at, look like, rather than going immediately into a conversational mode,

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:20.400
where you're sort of co-designing with the LLM and going back and forth via chat conversation,

01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:27.200
this is much like clear to yield an opinionated product that makes sense that's very clearly

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:31.680
defined around the problem that you're trying to solve, the tasks that need to happen to solve

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.560
that problem, and the right messaging, the right wording, it's really crisply aligned with what

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.960
you know about your customers, what you know about what they care about. That's such a good point.

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:45.760
Again, just the concept of the primal mark is ringing in my head as you talk about this,

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:50.400
just as soon as you make that prototype, everything from that point is a response to that

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:55.040
first idea versus have I actually thought through what this should be. Guys, we did it. This is

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:59.920
incredible. I think this is going to help a lot of people think through and actually save a lot of

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:06.080
time. Is there anything else that you want to share, leave listeners with, maybe a last nugget

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:10.720
or something you want to, I don't know, just double down on to leave folks with before we wrap up?

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:17.360
Well, one quick thing is that we've shared a lot of examples in this conversation,

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:23.280
and we actually have a Miro template that folks can use if they want to run their own

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.440
foundation sprint. It's the template that we use. When we're working with founders,

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:31.440
taking them through these sprints, we do our work in Miro, even if we're in person with them,

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:36.000
we're usually working in Miro or maybe working on paper and then capturing it in Miro because

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:42.080
it's just such a great canvas to work on. We'll make that template available so anybody who's

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:47.200
who's listening or watching can grab that and use it to run their own foundation sprint.

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:50.800
That's amazing. You answered the question and asked that. I forgot to come back to you.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.560
Can we give people a URL? We'll put in the show notes, but is it at your, yeah, I guess where can

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:03.280
folks find it? You should find it at character.vc and you can go there. We'll have a page for you

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:10.320
too. That is awesome. Obviously, you can also read the book and that goes through a lot of

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:14.800
this process, but I think the template is just like a plug-in plate. Let's just do this at home.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:20.160
Obviously, if they want to go deeper, they can work with you guys. It's such a win. They take money.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:25.520
You give them money and you help them figure out what they have to build. What a deal.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.800
And that's also character.vc. They want to explore that. Yeah.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.600
Amazing. Okay. Is there anything else Jake that you wanted to share before we close up?

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:41.200
Now, just, you know, if you made it this far, hopefully your mind and heart is open to this idea,

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:47.600
but we know it's a lot to ask to clear the calendar and follow these steps. But if

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:55.440
John and I weren't so convinced that beginnings are essential to getting your best efforts

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:59.600
in the hands of people and to achieving the things you want for your customers,

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:04.000
we wouldn't be doing this. We wouldn't be going to all the trouble. They're simpler things.

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:13.040
The kind of cool thing we've found about working in this way, though we've focused a lot on

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:17.280
finding product markets and building your business, getting started, getting momentum,

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:21.440
getting alignment, all these things that tactically are important, that business-wise are important.

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.000
But another part of it that's a nice side benefit that actually maybe is the most important

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:34.080
thing of all is how close it brings you to your customers to the people who you're building for

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:38.000
because you're interacting with them. You're focusing on them as you plan and you're interacting

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:44.720
with them on a weekly basis when you work in this way. And how close it brings teammates together.

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:49.280
In a very authentic way, we're working together on the most important things and we don't have to

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:55.360
navigate the usual social dynamics of conversations where one person has an idea and they're pitching it.

01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:01.440
We don't have to navigate the constant context switches of the calendar that dominates our days.

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:07.280
We're just working on the most important thing and the structure takes care of a lot of the difficulty

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:15.520
of the process of what we should do and we just find people come out of it with renewed motivation,

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:20.400
renewed energy, and renewed enthusiasm around. The fact that they get to work on what actually matters

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.800
to them. Yeah, and it just feels like really fun, just this part of the process is so fun,

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:28.480
and then not having to decide how to approach it, having someone just give you here's a framework

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:32.720
to follow. It's like a yoga class, right? I don't know how to do yoga, but it's explained to me,

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:40.560
step by step. Yoga for startups, that'll be the title of this episode. Guys, this was awesome.

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.960
I'm going to skip the lighting around just because we've gone long and I guess just working

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.760
for explaining online and how can listeners be useful to you? You can find me on LinkedIn,

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:55.360
John, I think you find you on LinkedIn too. We'd love for people to apply to character labs,

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:59.840
or if you know a founder, apply to character labs, get in touch with us, character.vc.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:03.600
There we go. All right, guys. Thank you so much for being here and for sharing.

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.880
