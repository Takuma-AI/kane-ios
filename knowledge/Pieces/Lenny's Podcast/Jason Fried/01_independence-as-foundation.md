## The Core Philosophy

> "Independence is the root of all the things we're able to do"

Jason Fried identifies independence as principle #01 at 37signals - it's not just a nice-to-have, it's the **foundation that enables everything else**. Without investors, without a board, without plans to sell or go public, 37signals has created a fundamentally different type of business that optimizes for different outcomes than venture-backed companies.

The power of this approach is simple: **"We don't have to ask anyone for permission. No one can tell us no."** This isn't about rebellion - it's about maintaining the ability to be true entrepreneurs who work for themselves and make decisions based on what they believe is right, not what external parties demand.

## The Problem with Traditional Funding

### The One-Path Problem
**Traditional Logic:** Take venture funding to grow faster and bigger
**37signals Logic:** Stay independent to maintain optionality

"There really is only one outcome for venture-backed companies, which is go huge. If you think about all of the space between a small business and a massive, huge unicorn-y business, there's so much room there that you could normally find your own way, and slide into a slot or a place that makes sense for you. But if you're venture-backed, you just don't even have the opportunity."

### The Work-for-Someone-Else Trap
"The moment you go out and take money or have these big obligations, you end up working for someone else."

Jason describes the typical venture exit scenario with visceral distaste: "In five years you have to stop doing what you're doing, you're going to get a big paycheck maybe, but you got to stop doing what you're doing because we're going to sell this business, and you're going to have to go work for this other company for two years and do their thing."

## Mental Model: The All-Terrain Vehicle

**Traditional Thinking:** A business is defined by its products and market
**37signals Thinking:** A business is a vehicle that can go anywhere you want

"We can turn this into anything we want. It's this vehicle, more so than it is a software business. There's no limits to what it could be, and that's a fun way to go through life too, in this all-terrain vehicle which can anywhere, on-road, off-road, whatever."

### Decision Framework
When facing any business decision:
1. **Can we do this without permission?**
2. **Does this preserve our independence?**
3. **Are we still working for ourselves after this?**

## The Economics of Independence

37signals demonstrates that independence doesn't mean small or unsuccessful:
- **No investors, no board**
- **No plans to go public**
- **Never want to sell the business**
- **Over 100,000 customers**
- **Tens of millions in profit annually**
- **All profit flows to founders and employees**

"Most VC-backed companies never make a dollar of [profit]" - while 37signals has been profitable for 24 years straight.

## What Independence Enables

### Product Simplicity
"What that allows us to do is to just build one product, do a really nice job, keep it tight, and simple, and clear" - avoiding "the complexity that comes with trying to service and satisfy so many different kinds of companies at different price levels."

### Freedom from Expectations
"Another thing we rarely have here are expectations. We launch a new product, I don't know what's going to happen. We don't say, 'If this gets 20,000 users, then it's a success.' I don't know. We don't care. It doesn't even matter."

### Direct Connection to Work
Jason uses the metaphor of a stick shift car: "I think we have a very stick shift business. We have a very direct business. Everything's very, very tight, very straightforward. There are not a lot of layers of abstractions. There are not a lot of things in the middle between the work we do and the way it feels."

## The Control Philosophy

"The only thing you can really control are your costs. You can't control the alternatives in the market. The competition, you can't control them. You can't determine the market itself. You can't control the economy. You can't control how much advertising costs, but you control your own costs."

This focus on what you can control - enabled by independence - creates a fundamentally different approach to business.

## Real-World Application

### For Entrepreneurs
- **Before taking funding**, ask: "What am I giving up beyond equity?"
- **Consider the path** you're choosing - is it the only path to your goals?
- **Value optionality** - keeping multiple possible futures open

### For Product Teams
- **Simplicity becomes possible** when you don't need to satisfy investor growth demands
- **One product done well** can beat multiple products done poorly
- **Direct connection to customers** without layers of abstraction

### For Company Building
- **Profit as practice** - when you need it from day one, you get good at it
- **No external timelines** - work at the pace that makes sense
- **Freedom to experiment** - try ONCE products, change directions, explore

## The Ultimate Test

"I think staying independent is a wonderfully fulfilling experience, and it's very hard to do when you're beholden to someone else's timeframe and expectations."

The question isn't whether you can raise money - it's whether you should. Independence isn't just about ownership percentages; it's about preserving the ability to build the business and life you actually want.
