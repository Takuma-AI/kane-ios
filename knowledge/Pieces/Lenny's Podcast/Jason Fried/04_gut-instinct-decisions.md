## The Core Philosophy

> "I've always been intuition driven and gut driven. And frankly, to be honest, I think everyone actually is."

Jason Fried champions an approach to decision-making that runs counter to the data-obsessed culture of modern tech companies. He argues that **everything is ultimately a judgment call**, and that gut instinct deserves to be celebrated rather than dismissed. This isn't about being anti-data - it's about recognizing that human judgment, informed by experience and intuition, is what actually drives decisions.

## The Problem with Pure Data

### The Illusion of Objectivity
> "I think everything's a judgment call. And so yeah, data can play a part. All sorts of things can play a part, but unless you're letting a machine make the decision, that's purely rational. If you're asking a human to make it's a judgment call."

### The Thank You Test
> "What is the value of saying thank you to somebody? Would you want to A/B test that and, if it turned out that it was worse to say thank you to somebody, would you not do that? No, you would do it because it's still the right thing to do. So a lot of our things are, what feels right? What seems like the decent thing to do?"

## Mental Model: Intuition as Accumulator

**Traditional Thinking:** Decisions should be based on data and analysis
**37signals Thinking:** Your gut has absorbed everything, including things you don't consciously know

> "Give your intuition credit. Give your gut credit. It's absorbed everything. And plus the things that you don't know it absorbed that are valuable."

### Decision Framework
When making decisions:
1. **What do you think?** (not "What do you know?")
2. **How does this feel?**
3. **What does your gut say?**
4. **Trust the absorption**

## The Language of Feeling

Jason deliberately uses feeling-based language throughout the company:

> "I'll often say, what do you think or what do you feel or how does this feel? Is something we talk more about at work than pretty much anything else, which is like, how does this screen feel? How does this flow feel? How does this feature feel? How does this word feel? How does this sentence feel? How does this paragraph feel? How does this website feel? How does these colors feel? Because human beings feel."

This isn't soft or fuzzy - it's acknowledging that **humans are feeling creatures** and that those feelings contain valuable information.

## No Metrics Theater

### What They Don't Do
- **No OKRs or KPIs**
- **No revenue targets**
- **No growth targets**
- **No customer acquisition goals**
- **No product-level P&Ls**

### What They Do Instead
> "I am not driven by data, or I don't have different P&Ls for each product in a way where we're looking at them very carefully. It's in total, collectively, are we making more money than we spend? That's the only thing we ultimately look at."

## Hiring for Intuition

### Looking for Taste
> "When I hire designers, I'm curious about their tastes. I'm curious about what they like. I'm curious about what other products they think are good. I'm curious about what they've seen that they admire or who they... I'm always asking about that because that helps me get a sense of who they are and what lens they see the world through and what kind of influences they're going to bring to bear."

### The Riffing Test
> "To me, that is where you can see they don't have any time to think. So where does their gut go? What are their instincts? Where do they arrive after having to riff on the spot with something?"

### Why Executives Get Hired
> "When companies hire executives, what are they looking for in executive? They typically go judgment and experience. They're not like they can read an Excel spreadsheet. That's not the thing that matters. Anyone can read that or anyone can learn to do that. They're looking for judgment and experience, which is a very amorphous thing."

## The Charlie Munger Validation

Jason asked Charlie Munger about doing something well when you know nothing about it:

> "I really loved his answer, which was, 'I would just... trust your instinct on that,' which is like, a lot of great things happen because you don't know how to do them. In fact, a lot of innovations happen because you don't know how other people do them, and all you have is your gut. All you have is your intuition. All you have is how you feel about the thing."

## Creating Space for Intuition

### In Meetings
- Ask "What do you think?" not "What do you know?"
- Use phrases like "How does this feel?"
- Never demand justification with data

### In Culture
> "We almost never, sometimes we look at numbers to sort of be an input, but it's never prove that. I'll never say justify that. That's just not terminology or lingo that we ever bring up."

### In Decision-Making
> "I don't really know why I'm making these calls, but I'm making these calls regardless. And I'm not looking at a number and going, if this is fifty-one percent versus forty-nine, I'm going this way for sure. That could be an input perhaps, but it's not the only input."

## Real-World Application

### For Leaders
- **Model intuition-based language** - say "I feel" and "I think"
- **Create psychological safety** for gut-based opinions
- **Hire for taste and judgment**, not just skills

### For Product Teams
- **Ask how features feel**, not just how they perform
- **Trust designer and developer instincts**
- **Value qualitative feedback** as much as quantitative

### For Entrepreneurs
- **Start with your gut** - what feels right?
- **Don't wait for data** to validate every decision
- **Build the muscle** of trusting your intuition

## The Ultimate Business Book

> "I think we need to celebrate gut and intuition more in business. And most business books are not about that. They're about the opposite in many ways."

Jason is writing a book on this topic because he believes intuition deserves recognition as a legitimate business tool. It's not about rejecting data - it's about acknowledging that **all decisions are ultimately human judgments**, and those judgments are informed by far more than spreadsheets.

## The Bottom Line

> "I'm still looking for people who just, their gut is filled with ideas."

In a world obsessed with data-driven decision making, 37signals proves that trusting your gut can lead to 24 years of profitability, happy customers, and a fulfilling work life. The key is recognizing that your intuition has been absorbing information your entire life - give it credit.
