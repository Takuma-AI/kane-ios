## The Core Philosophy

> "The reason I think it's great for entrepreneurs to start bootstrapping is because they just have more practice making money, and they get better, and better, and better at the fundamental skill you need to have ultimately to run a successful business, which is to make money."

Bootstrapping isn't just about not raising money - it's about developing the **fundamental skill** that every business ultimately needs: making more money than you spend. Jason sees this as a practice, like learning an instrument, where repetition and necessity create competence.

## The Guitar Metaphor

Jason's guitar metaphor perfectly captures why venture-funded companies often struggle with profitability:

> "If you're playing guitar, if I give you a guitar and ask you to go up on stage and play guitar, you're going to suck. It's going to be horribly embarrassing and you're going to be terrible at it. You might be terrible at it a month later, but you'll be slightly better at it. You do it for six months or a year, you're going to be better and better. And then, five years and you're really getting good."

The parallel to business:

> "Why do we think that a business that is sloppy, that doesn't have to make their own money, that is just getting pumped full of money by somebody else, can all of a sudden turn on the profit spigot and all of a sudden be profitable? What you see is that they oftentimes cannot because they're just not set up to be that way. They've never played guitar before, and now they're being asked to play guitar."

## Mental Model: Making Money vs. Spending Money

**Traditional Thinking:** Focus on growth, worry about profitability later
**Bootstrapping Logic:** Practice making money from day one

### The Skills Gap
- **Practicing spending money**: What venture-funded companies do
- **Practicing making money**: What bootstrapped companies must do
- **Result**: "Getting good at spending money is not a valuable skill as getting good at making money"

### Decision Framework
When evaluating any initiative:
1. **Will this help us make money?**
2. **Can we afford this with current profits?**
3. **Does this keep us practicing the right skills?**

## The Power of Constraints

> "I think what you need are constraints, is what I'm actually trying to get at. You need constraints. When you have just loads of money, you basically have very few constraints. That's what tends to lead to slop."

### Why Constraints Work

**Necessity drives innovation**: "If we don't figure this out, we can't make payroll next week or next month. You just start to figure things out."

**Constraints breed focus**: "So we think that constraints, simplicity, small teams actually are where it's at, and keep us honest, and allow us to do great work for our customer base that we know."

## The RXBAR Lesson

Jason shares a powerful story about scrappy entrepreneurship:

> "His dad's like, 'Hey, go sell 1,000 fucking bars and come back and talk to me.' He's like, 'Just sell some fucking bar. Get out on the street and sell some bars, man. You've got products? Sell products. Go, sell.' Versus all the things you could possibly do. 'Go sell some bars.' It's just such great advice and it just cuts through all the crap."

This encapsulates the bootstrapping mindset: **Stop planning, start selling.**

## The Economics of Software

### The Silicon Valley Paradox

> "What's interesting is that Silicon Valley has found a way to make the most profitable style of business the least profitable. Software, there's no physical costs. The margin should be close to 80 or 90%. It turns out that they're barely even, most of them positive in the end, or they're just sliding by basically."

### 37signals' Approach
- **24 years of continuous profitability**
- **Double-digit millions in annual profit**
- **80-90% margins as standard**
- **All profit flows to founders and employees**

## Profitability as North Star

> "Now, on the business side of things, we have to be profitable. That doesn't mean that everything we do needs to be profitable... It's in total, collectively, are we making more money than we spend? That's the only thing we ultimately look at."

### What This Enables
- **Freedom to experiment**: "have good healthy margins which allow us to experiment, and play"
- **Peace of mind**: "not be afraid to do things that may not work"
- **Enjoyment**: "and just enjoy ourselves"

## You're Not the Outlier

> "The majority of companies on this planet run like ours. They're bootstrapped, they don't have any money. No one's willing to give them a penny and they open up a shop somewhere, they do something, they put their shingle out and they launch a website or whatever and they try to make it work."

Despite how it feels in tech, **bootstrapping is the norm**, not the exception. Every restaurant, retail shop, and service business operates this way. The venture path is the actual outlier.

## Real-World Application

### For New Entrepreneurs
- **Start selling immediately** - don't wait for perfection
- **Track profitability from day one** - make it a habit
- **Embrace constraints** - they'll make you more creative

### For Growing Companies
- **Efficiency over growth** - sustainable beats spectacular
- **Keep teams small** - constraints maintain quality
- **Question every expense** - does this help us make money?

### For Decision Making
- **When facing challenges**: "If we don't figure this out, we can't make payroll"
- **When evaluating opportunities**: "Will this teach us to make or spend money?"
- **When setting goals**: "Are we collectively making more than we spend?"

## The Ultimate Measure

> "I don't want to spend money on things we don't need."

This simple statement captures the entire philosophy. When you bootstrap, every dollar matters. This creates a discipline and focus that often disappears when outside money arrives. The constraint becomes the catalyst for building a fundamentally healthier business.
