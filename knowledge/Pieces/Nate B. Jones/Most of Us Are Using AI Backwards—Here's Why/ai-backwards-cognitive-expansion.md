## The Core Insight

"I want to suggest that most of us are using AI a little bit backwards... We are using AI primarily for information compression."

Nate B Jones argues that while AI compression tools are useful, the real value lies in using AI to expand our cognitive capacity and deepen our thinking, not just to summarize and compress information.

## The Compression Trap

### Common Usage Patterns
- "Take my meeting notes and turn them into really neat outputs"
- "Take this large product requirements doc, turn it into this for engineers, and this for my executive stakeholders"
- "Take this 100-page PDF, and turn it into something succinct"
- "Take Nate's super long sub-stack and make it into something I can digest"

### The Fundamental Problem
"But something that I heard that's been really sticking with me is the idea that the brain doesn't process compressed information in the same way."

**Key Insight**: "A lot of the learning that you get, when you read a large book, a deep book on a big subject, it comes from your brain forming new connections as it spends extended time in the subject."

## The Learning Differential

### Compressed Learning
"If you get, and you can, a very short one-pager, you will get a precee, a summary, an executive briefing on the book."

### Deep Learning
"You are unlikely to have the kind of life-changing experience that you had if you really dipped into it."

**The Trade-off**: Compression gives you information, but not transformation.

## The Right Approach

### Not Anti-Compression
"Now, there are people who will take that insight and say, wow, so AI is the problem. I actually think the way we use it is the problem. Not that it's bad to use it for compression."

"I too use it for adjusting my meeting notes. I too use it for sending different messages to different stakeholders for routine business communication."

### The Deep Thinking Alternative
"But if you need to do really deep thinking, you need to spend time on a subject. You need to optimize your cognitive workload to enable you to do your best thinking. And AI actually can really help with that."

## Mental Model: Bicycle vs Car

### Prompting as Bicycle
"Learning how to prompt well is a skill, but it's sort of like learning to write a bicycle versus learning to drive a car. Both are helpful. The car is going to take you farther if you learn how to do it well."

**Prompting Characteristics**:
- "Incredibly efficient if you master it"
- "Everybody should know how to do it"
- "Should be a universal skill"
- "Provides a durable edge"
- "Like the bicycle skill"

### Cognitive Partnership as Car
"But if you can learn to actually cognitively partner beyond an individual prompt with AI, that's like driving a car. That's like actually going farther."

**Key Difference**: "Prompting really optimizes for one way communication."

## Case Study: Book Writing Process

### The Challenge
"I am contemplating writing a book on AI. Writing a book is a hard task. It's much harder, exponentially harder than a single article."

### The Need
"It's that I need to work with AI in a way that helps my brain expand and kick around the subject matter."

### Step 1: Conversational Thinking (Advanced Voice Mode)
"I spent 25 minutes in advanced voice mode talking with open AI... What it was that was distinct and special was it was there when I needed to talk out loud."

**The Dynamic**:
- "It would let me talk out loud for a while"
- "It actually listened"
- "It actually took notes"
- "It actually responded with just enough interest, engagement and riffing to keep my brain flowing"

### The Conversational Advantage
"Because I had an idea that I wanted to talk out. I knew I couldn't just dictate into the transcription device for 25 minutes and get it. But if I had someone talk back to me in the right cadence, I'd probably be able to fish it out of my brain because we're conversational people."

### Step 2: Deep Analysis (O3)
"I literally pulled the transcript out into a Google doc and I stuck it into O3 as a raw transcript... Really, this is where I iteratively arrived because I find that a lot of time when you're talking out loud, you're sort of naming the work as you go."

**The Process**:
1. Voice conversation to externalize thinking
2. Transcript capture
3. Higher-level model analysis
4. Iterative refinement

### The Cognitive Journey
"And that's part of the cognitive journey that we've kept inside our heads for 200,000 years. And now we have a partner to do it with."

## The Unique AI Dynamic

### Different from Human Collaboration
"And it's true that sometimes if you did paired work together with humans, you could kind of get to this. But I actually think it's a distinct dynamic with AI."

"It's like this crossover between the way a therapist listens to you and the way a colleague listens to you, and you'd never expect a human to do that."

### What You Can Ask of AI
- "I wouldn't ask a human to do the kind of listening that I asked advanced voicemode to do"
- "I also wouldn't really ask a human to work on sharpening my thesis for an outline the way I would ask a three to do it"
- "I wouldn't ask a human to go and like necessarily do the research and do the thinking and the... cognitive shaping on the thesis with me"

## The Multi-Model Approach

### Model Selection Strategy
"I need to pick a different cognitive partner. And if you're wondering, how do I pick models? I put a whole thing up on subsdeck on how I sort of pick models for different tasks."

### Example Workflow
1. **Advanced Voice Mode (GPT-4)**: For conversational thinking
2. **O3**: For deep analysis and thesis development
3. **Opus 4**: For idea shaping and conceptual refinement

"It's deciding the kind of task I need and then making sure that I approach AI and ask myself what is the model that I can choose that will most help me to optimize for getting my brain deeply into the subject matter."

## The Value Proposition

### Investment vs Return
"This is real expense, right? I'm on pro subscribers to open it, right? Like I pay my 200 bucks a month... But for me, whatever your investment level is in AI, the value you get is so much greater if you use it in this way."

### The Upside
"As a way of giving your brain time on subject, optimizing for time on subject, versus optimizing for just compressing and repurposing information... helping your brain work better has a lot more upside over time."

## The Corporate Reality

### Current State
"Most of the use cases I see from companies if they are not super fluent in AI, end up being around compressing and repurposing information, which is fine. There are some cost savings there."

### The Missed Opportunity
"But helping your brain work better has a lot more upside over time. And I think we talk about it a whole lot less. And I wish we would talk about it more."

## The Anti-Shortcut Philosophy

### Common Misconception
"It's antithetical to this idea that AI lets you go cheap on your brain, right? It lets you skip the brain power, it lets you not do the work, it lets you read the one page or not the full book."

### The Reality
"I don't think it has to. I think it can actually help you to think better. I find it does, but it's how you use it."

## The Strategic Decision

### When to Compress vs Expand
"It's about knowing when to sort of pull the thinking button and say I want to use this to actually expand my time thinking about this because this is really important."

### Quality Recognition
"This is work that needs and deserves the cream of my brain and I need to orient my approach to AI so that I can spend more time marinating on this in a way that works for my brain."

## The Personalization Reality

### No Magic Formula
"And part of why there's no magic prompt for this is our brains are wired pretty uniquely. The way I choose to like walk around and talk and like talk my ideas out loud may not work for everybody."

### Individual Variation
"There are people for whom they need to write it out by hand. Take a picture of it, get a transcription and maybe that's the way they start. I think your mileage is going to vary because your brain varies."

### Universal Principle
"But the concept of optimizing for having your brain in the subject is something that allows us to view AI as an expander not just as a compression tool."

## The Core Framework

### Two Modes of AI Usage

**Compression Mode**:
- Information summarization
- Format transformation
- Routine communication
- Cost/time saving

**Expansion Mode**:
- Cognitive partnership
- Deep thinking support
- Idea development
- Understanding creation

### The Key Question
"When do we want to tolerate less brain time on a subject versus when do we want to actually optimize our partnership with AI? So we spend more brain time marinating in what really matters."

## Key Takeaway

The real power of AI isn't in replacing our thinking but in amplifying it. By using AI as a cognitive partner rather than just a compression tool, we can:

- **Expand our cognitive capacity** instead of diminishing it
- **Deepen our understanding** instead of just getting summaries
- **Enhance our thinking process** instead of bypassing it
- **Create more value** than just cutting costs

The choice isn't between using AI or not—it's between using AI to think less or to think better.
