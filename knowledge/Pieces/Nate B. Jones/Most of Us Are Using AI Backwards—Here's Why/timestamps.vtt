00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
I want to suggest that most of us are using AI a little bit backwards.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.400
Stay with me, this is worth it.

00:07.400 --> 00:11.720
We are using AI primarily for information compression.

00:11.720 --> 00:16.560
So take my meeting notes and turn them into really neat outputs.

00:16.560 --> 00:20.320
Take this large product requirements doc, turn it into this for engineers,

00:20.320 --> 00:22.720
and this for my executive stakeholders.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.360
Take this 100-page PDF, and turn it into something succinct.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.880
Take Nate's super long sub-stack and make it into something I can digest.

00:29.880 --> 00:33.160
I kid you not people do that, it's kind of hilarious.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.680
The point is we're using it to compress information.

00:36.680 --> 00:41.080
But something that I heard that's been really sticking with me

00:41.080 --> 00:47.800
is the idea that the brain doesn't process compressed information in the same way.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.360
And one of the things that we need to learn to think about

00:51.360 --> 00:58.840
is when do we want to tolerate less brain time on a subject

00:58.840 --> 01:05.200
versus when do we want to actually optimize our partnership with AI?

01:05.200 --> 01:08.840
So we spend more brain time marinating in what really matters.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.680
So a lot of the learning that you get,

01:12.680 --> 01:18.000
when you read a large book, a deep book on a big subject,

01:18.000 --> 01:21.720
it comes from your brain forming new connections

01:21.720 --> 01:24.840
as it spends extended time in the subject.

01:24.840 --> 01:29.240
If you get, and you can, a very short one-pager,

01:29.240 --> 01:32.480
you will get a precee, a summary,

01:32.480 --> 01:35.840
an executive briefing on the book.

01:35.840 --> 01:39.520
You are unlikely to have the kind of life-changing experience

01:39.520 --> 01:41.920
that you had if you really dipped into it.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.480
Now, there are people who will take that insight and say,

01:45.480 --> 01:47.720
wow, so AI is the problem.

01:47.720 --> 01:53.400
I actually think the way we use it is the problem.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.680
Not that it's bad to use it for compression.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.280
I too use it for adjusting my meeting notes.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.240
I too use it for sending different messages to different stakeholders

02:02.240 --> 02:04.600
for routine business communication.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.880
But if you need to do really deep thinking,

02:08.880 --> 02:11.440
you need to spend time on a subject.

02:11.440 --> 02:15.200
You need to optimize your cognitive workload

02:15.200 --> 02:17.840
to enable you to do your best thinking.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.080
And AI actually can really help with that.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.080
And I'll give you a specific example.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.560
I am contemplating writing a book on AI.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.120
Writing a book is a hard task.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.160
It's much harder, exponentially harder

02:30.160 --> 02:32.520
than a single article.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.000
It needs to be useful, especially with AI,

02:35.000 --> 02:36.960
some of the challenges in having something

02:36.960 --> 02:39.080
that stands the test of time, et cetera.

02:39.080 --> 02:43.160
And I find that when I'm contemplating writing a book,

02:43.160 --> 02:47.000
the thing that is most difficult for me,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.040
it's not the information compression.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.960
It's not that I need it to go out and tell me all the news

02:51.960 --> 02:52.800
about AI.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.440
I already get plenty of news, trust me.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.400
It's that I need to work with AI in a way

02:58.400 --> 03:03.600
that helps my brain expand and kick around the subject matter.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.360
And we don't really optimize for that

03:06.360 --> 03:08.920
when we only talk about prompting.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.800
Because prompting really optimizes

03:10.800 --> 03:13.120
for one way communication.

03:13.120 --> 03:16.200
Learning how to prompt well is a skill,

03:16.200 --> 03:19.440
but it's sort of like learning to write a bicycle

03:19.440 --> 03:22.200
versus learning to drive a car.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.400
Both are helpful.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.000
The car is going to take you farther

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
if you learn how to do it well.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.760
And I think increasingly prompting

03:28.760 --> 03:30.200
is like the bicycle skill.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.440
It's an incredibly efficient if you master it.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.280
Everybody should know how to do it.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.400
It should be a universal skill.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.200
I do think we're going to need it for a while.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.760
I think it provides a durable edge

03:39.760 --> 03:42.480
if you can write well, if you can prompt well.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.720
And I love it.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.080
But if you can learn to actually cognitively partner

03:48.080 --> 03:50.880
beyond an individual prompt with AI,

03:50.880 --> 03:52.360
that's like driving a car.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.280
That's like actually going farther.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.720
And so in my case with the book, just a circle back,

03:57.720 --> 04:02.720
I spent 25 minutes in advanced voice mode

04:03.520 --> 04:07.200
talking with open AI.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.280
And it was, I think they used like a variant

04:09.280 --> 04:12.320
of their 40 model in advanced voice mode.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.760
And you might be waiting for me to say,

04:13.760 --> 04:16.360
I had the most profound insights.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.760
Like the AI really helped me.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.920
It really wasn't that.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.440
In fact, I sometimes told that this is really vanilla.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.440
I don't love this.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.760
What it was that was distinct and special

04:27.760 --> 04:32.000
was it was there when I needed to talk out loud.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.480
It would let me talk out loud for a while.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.640
It actually listened.

04:35.640 --> 04:36.960
It actually took notes.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.880
And it actually responded with just enough interest,

04:40.880 --> 04:44.960
engagement and riffing to keep my brain flowing.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.200
So I could keep the idea coming.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.400
Because I had an idea that I wanted to talk out.

04:49.400 --> 04:53.640
I knew I couldn't just dictate into the transcription device

04:53.640 --> 04:55.840
for 25 minutes and get it.

04:55.840 --> 04:59.200
But if I had someone talk back to me in the right cadence,

04:59.200 --> 05:01.360
I'd probably be able to fish it out of my brain

05:01.360 --> 05:03.160
because we're conversational people.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.280
And so a conversational AI was the right choice.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.280
In this case, advanced voice mode really has gotten better

05:10.280 --> 05:14.400
since they shipped that update that makes it, you know,

05:14.400 --> 05:16.840
more aware of when it interrupts you.

05:16.840 --> 05:21.240
It uses more discontinuities verbally like it just sounds

05:21.240 --> 05:23.240
more natural and it allows you to forget it's there

05:23.240 --> 05:26.440
and just focus on the subject, which is what I needed to do.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.960
That's just step one.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.240
I did the verbal piece.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.320
And then the second piece was I really needed to wrestle

05:33.320 --> 05:37.160
with what the terrain of the idea looked like.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.240
And I knew 40 wasn't strong enough to do it.

05:40.240 --> 05:44.200
And so instead of trying to force it inside that conversation,

05:44.200 --> 05:47.800
I literally pulled the transcript out into a Google doc

05:47.800 --> 05:51.000
and I stuck it into O3 as a raw transcript.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.080
And I said, this is a transcript.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.960
This is my perspective on the transcript.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.200
This was the intent I had with this idea.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.880
Really, this is where I iteratively arrived

06:00.880 --> 06:03.320
because I find that a lot of time when you're talking out loud,

06:03.320 --> 06:05.840
you're sort of naming the work as you go.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.560
And that's part of the cognitive journey

06:07.560 --> 06:10.600
that we've kept inside our heads for 200,000 years.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.040
And now we have a partner to do it with.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.520
And it's true that sometimes if you did paired work together

06:16.520 --> 06:18.280
with humans, you could kind of get to this.

06:18.280 --> 06:22.120
But I actually think it's a distinct dynamic with AI.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.440
I have not worked, and I have worked in offices.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.040
I've worked in person with teams.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.120
I love that dynamic.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.880
I don't want it to go away when we work well together

06:30.880 --> 06:33.520
with good human colleagues.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.560
But it's not the same as a good AI colleague,

06:36.560 --> 06:40.480
an AI colleague that you can brainstorm with in that way,

06:40.480 --> 06:43.160
where they listen and just riff with you.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.560
It's like this crossover between the way a therapist listens

06:46.560 --> 06:48.120
to you and the way a colleague listens to you,

06:48.120 --> 06:50.480
and you'd never expect a human to do that.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.600
But it's super helpful for your thinking.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.360
So we do that.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.480
We name the work.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.000
We get to O3 through the Google Doc.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.360
O3, and honestly, it's not just O3.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.400
I don't want to just rep open AI here, right?

07:02.400 --> 07:07.920
Like you can go and do this in Opus, the Cloud Model, Opus 4.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.320
You could do this in Gemini 2.5 Pro.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.720
You'd get similar results.

07:11.720 --> 07:18.080
The idea is you want to think deeply and critique

07:18.080 --> 07:23.280
the model results that you get from the 4.0 conversation.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.280
Basically, take my intent, take what I was able to articulate,

07:27.280 --> 07:30.680
take the riffing that Advanced Voice Mode did,

07:30.680 --> 07:33.480
and help me get to a crystal clear understanding

07:33.480 --> 07:35.840
of the heart of the idea.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.280
That's what you want in the next step.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.200
It's basically help me to define the coordinates

07:40.240 --> 07:43.920
of the terrain that I'm in, now that I've named the work.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.880
And once we do that, this sky becomes the limit.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.080
We can open up to understanding what

07:49.080 --> 07:52.000
are the partnership dynamics that work from here.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.600
So as a specific example, I thought

07:54.600 --> 07:59.360
O3 did a good job getting to the heart of the thesis

07:59.360 --> 07:59.960
for the book.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.760
I thought the outline felt a little bit heavy.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.720
I need to go into a different model.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.640
I'll probably choose Opus 4 for this

08:07.640 --> 08:09.440
to start to refine what that looks

08:09.480 --> 08:10.560
like a little bit more.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.560
I need to pick a different cognitive partner.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.000
And if you're wondering, how do I pick models?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.680
I put a whole thing up on subsdeck

08:17.680 --> 08:20.040
on how I sort of pick models for different tasks.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.960
To me, I think the piece that I keep coming back to,

08:25.960 --> 08:28.920
stepping back, reflecting on all of this,

08:28.920 --> 08:32.640
is that I find the most value.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.480
This is real expense, right?

08:34.480 --> 08:38.080
I'm on pro subscribers to open it, right?

08:38.080 --> 08:40.320
Like I pay my 200 bucks a month.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.040
Not everybody has to, I don't think you have to

08:42.040 --> 08:43.280
to go ton of value out of it.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.160
I saw the article that said is free,

08:45.160 --> 08:46.680
so good that you don't need plus.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.880
I think for a lot of people it is.

08:48.880 --> 08:53.880
But for me, whatever your investment level is in AI,

08:54.920 --> 08:58.680
the value you get is so much greater

08:58.680 --> 09:01.280
if you use it in this way.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.520
As a way of giving your brain time on subject,

09:05.520 --> 09:08.800
optimizing for time on subject,

09:08.800 --> 09:13.320
versus optimizing for just compressing

09:13.320 --> 09:15.560
and repurposing information.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.080
Most of the use cases I see from companies

09:18.080 --> 09:20.680
if they are not super fluent in AI,

09:20.680 --> 09:22.520
end up being around compressing

09:22.520 --> 09:24.600
and repurposing information, which is fine.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.920
There are some cost savings there.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.680
But helping your brain work better

09:28.680 --> 09:31.440
has a lot more upside over time.

09:31.440 --> 09:35.960
And I think we talk about it a whole lot less.

09:35.960 --> 09:39.120
And I wish we would talk about it more.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.080
I wish we would not get so far

09:41.080 --> 09:43.200
into the compression trap that we don't think

09:43.200 --> 09:46.960
about this idea that AI can help us map

09:46.960 --> 09:50.000
and expand the cognitive territory that we work in

09:50.000 --> 09:54.120
by partnering with us in a way that is somewhat reminiscent

09:54.120 --> 09:56.560
of what we would do with a human, but also distinct.

09:56.560 --> 10:00.120
I also, just as I said, I wouldn't ask a human

10:00.120 --> 10:02.280
to do the kind of listening that I asked

10:02.280 --> 10:04.160
advanced voicemode to do.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.760
I also wouldn't really ask a human to work

10:06.760 --> 10:10.080
on sharpening my thesis for an outline

10:10.080 --> 10:11.800
the way I would ask a three to do it.

10:12.760 --> 10:16.840
I wouldn't ask a human to go and like necessarily do

10:16.840 --> 10:19.320
the research and do the thinking

10:19.320 --> 10:21.920
and the, for lack of a better term,

10:21.920 --> 10:25.920
cognitive shaping on the thesis with me,

10:25.920 --> 10:28.280
it's not just doing it on its own,

10:28.280 --> 10:31.000
that I would ask of Opus 4.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Opus 4 is great for shaping ideas

10:33.000 --> 10:34.840
and really thinking through concepts.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.760
And so I'm finding in a sense that my brain

10:37.760 --> 10:41.080
is able to think better by spending more time

10:41.080 --> 10:44.760
with AI models if they're carefully modulated.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.920
It's not just throwing prompts in there.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.640
There's no secret prompt to this.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.440
It's deciding the kind of task I need

10:53.440 --> 10:57.440
and then making sure that I approach AI

10:59.520 --> 11:04.520
and ask myself what is the model that I can choose

11:05.440 --> 11:09.440
that will most help me to optimize

11:09.440 --> 11:12.280
for getting my brain deeply into the subject matter

11:12.280 --> 11:15.680
so that I become someone who truly understands it.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.600
That in and of itself is opposed to.

11:18.600 --> 11:22.040
It's antithetical to this idea

11:22.160 --> 11:25.640
that AI lets you go cheap on your brain, right?

11:25.640 --> 11:27.200
It lets you skip the brain power,

11:27.200 --> 11:28.400
it lets you not do the work,

11:28.400 --> 11:31.480
it lets you read the one page or not the full book.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.560
I don't think it has to.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.880
I think it can actually help you to think better.

11:34.880 --> 11:39.560
I find it does, but it's how you use it.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.840
And it's not to say at all that like, again,

11:41.840 --> 11:44.320
I started this by saying I use the compression stuff too.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.800
I think we all do, we all will.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.240
It helps us save time.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.520
It's about knowing when to sort of pull the thinking button

11:50.520 --> 11:53.160
and say I want to use this to actually expand my time

11:53.160 --> 11:55.640
thinking about this because this is really important.

11:55.640 --> 11:59.320
This is work that needs and deserves the cream of my brain

11:59.320 --> 12:02.000
and I need to orient my approach to AI

12:02.000 --> 12:05.920
so that I can spend more time marinating

12:05.920 --> 12:07.520
on this in a way that works for my brain.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.680
And part of why there's no magic prompt for this

12:09.680 --> 12:12.160
is our brains are wired pretty uniquely.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.040
The way I choose to like walk around and talk

12:16.040 --> 12:19.080
and like talk my ideas out loud may not work for everybody.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.000
There are people for whom they need to write it out by hand.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Take a picture of it, get a transcription

12:24.000 --> 12:27.600
and maybe that's the way they start.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.200
I think your mileage is going to vary

12:29.200 --> 12:32.520
because your brain varies, but the concept of optimizing

12:32.520 --> 12:34.920
for having your brain in the subject

12:34.920 --> 12:38.480
is something that allows us to view AI as an expander

12:38.480 --> 12:40.640
not just as a compression tool.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.520
It's something that optimizes for what we can create

12:44.520 --> 12:47.800
not just how we can cut costs by compressing information,

12:47.800 --> 12:49.000
even if that's useful.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.760
So thinking about this was helpful for me.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.640
I hope it kind of turns the wheels for you

12:52.640 --> 12:55.600
maybe helps you think about AI a bit differently

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
and try out advanced voice mode, it's fun.
