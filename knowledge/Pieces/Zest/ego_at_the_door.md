# Zest Debates: Taking a step back and checking ego

# Are you defending yourself or the idea

1. No idea is bad. Questions and constructive feedback are not an indictment on you but rather a challenge to flesh out your thought process (because you and your idea are resilient enough to evolve through the challenge) 
2. Few ideas are permanent: as we learn more, we adjust. 

# Tactic

- “I don’t know, let me get back to you”
    - This is a perfectly reasonable thing to tell someone when you are being questioned. [It is your responsibility to get them an answer in an agreed upon timeline](https://www.notion.so/How-Zest-Thinks-About-Work-Ethic-a72b707c19cb43baaa2fb8cf8cf910bc?pvs=21) but questions DO NOT need to be resolved live.
    - This can take the shape of an answer to a question (”I don’t know the answer yet”) or an anxiety (”This makes me nervous but I don’t know why yet”)
- Restate what you’re hearing
    - People often think they are having the same debate but actually they are speaking past each other (Chinese idiom is, “sleeping in the same bed and having two different dreams”).
    - When the conversation is getting heated, take a step back, apologize, and restate the persons position to them. This gives them the space to clarify what they are saying without judgement.
- No because…
    - Do not reject ideas out of hand. Fight the urge and explain your position.
