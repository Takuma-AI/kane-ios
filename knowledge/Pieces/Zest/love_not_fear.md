# Build from Love, Not Fear

We are fundamentally at our best when we build from love not fear. 

Love of:

1. Jobs to be done / know your customer
    1. Deliver better than anyone else
    2. Ask did we deliver on their outcomes
    3. If it doesn’t go well - do not beat shit out of self
    4. Win or learn (WD 40 or eddison quote “‘I have not failed, but found 1000 ways to not make a light bulb”
2. Employees
    1. Can you make them the highest version of themselves
    2. Can you develop them
3. Product
    1. “It’s not enough” - wrong mindset
    2. Visualize perfection and make it reality
    3. Must be love and not frustration
