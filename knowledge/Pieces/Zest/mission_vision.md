Trust the people you’re working with.
Don’t let issues fester, talk about them proactively. 
Check your ego at the door. 
Be mindful about the battles you choose.
The most important part of any discussion is the definition of terms.
Understand why you want to do something. 
Think of 3 other ways to solve the problem, even if you go with the first. 
Assume there is more to know than what is known.
A whole-assed half is better than a half-assed whole.
More cooks in the kitchen doesn’t make a better meal. 
Work for the team, not for yourself. 
Have a system for how to:
prioritize
get things done
be accountable
process information 
Think beyond yourself, you are not the user.
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Do things that move the needle. Don’t do things that don’t.
Off-time makes on time.
Above all else, kindness.
