Zest Team Charter

Below are the founding tenets of our team charter and ideology. These are the methods and ideologies by which we function: 

Present and Participate: Commit to always being present and participating in meetings. 
If items are arising that can be handled between two people, call it out and they will handle it outside of the meeting 
If an item is being inefficiently discussed, call it out so that the group can reassess and course correct 
Call out others who are not present and participating
Work for the Team: Commit to working for the betterment of Zest rather than ego/the betterment of an individual part of the team (when cooking, all the ingredients come together, you do not cook and eat each ingredient separately. Similarly, development, product, brand, and growth all operate hand in hand and are useless in a vacuum.) 
Always ask how before you jump to yes or no 
Accountability: Own your actions. Do not let ego get in the way of improvement. 
Scoping Work: 
Establish painfully specific objectives that are precisely defined and fully agreed to (verbally or written). This means they all must have DRIs and Due Dates
If you are ever going to break an agreement, let the full agreement circle know that it will be broken as early as you realize and propose a viable mitigation
For any activity, use areas of responsibility (AORs) with directly responsible individuals (DRIs) and backups 
If you ever say something to yourself/someone twice, write it down + send it in an email 
Consequences for not hitting agreements:
1. Missed agreement is pointed out (apologies are not necessary, all that is necessary is adherence to the agreement by completion or by altering the agreement as early as possible) 
2. Continuous failures to do either of those two things will result in offender no longer being a part of the company 
Honesty and Transparency: Always speak up if you are unhappy/have frustrations as they arise. 
Always speak your mind on the quality/output of team members in order to make sure that everyone is on the same page. If you aren’t honest when things need work then a compliment also carries no weight. 
Be honest with personal circumstances as proactively as possible so the team can be there to support
Send at least one message of acknowledgement or thanks weekly to a team member who is embodying Zest’s values and team charter
Punctuality: Punctuality to and from meetings is extremely important as everyone deeply values their time. 
If you are going to be late/not able to make a commitment, let the affected parties know as early as possible. 
Deep Work: We, as a team, will commit to 2 hours of deep work time a day. That is, we will set aside at least this block of time to work on our macro, top-level goal. 
Off Time: Commit to times when we will not talk about work to avoid a culture of always being on. It is fine to work on your own time but we want everyone to be able to perform to the best of their abilities. 
Don’t expect an answer past 7PM local time
Friday night to Sunday morning is going to be don’t reach out unless necessary (batch requests) 
Lunch is sacred (no lunch meetings) 
Goal Tracking: Each team member must have a dedicated, active individual goal tracking system running. The system can evolve and grow but something must always be in use. (GTD Method is known and effective) 
System Replicability: If you do an activity more than twice write down how and record it in the company Wiki on Notion. This is paramount for our ability to critically asses processes as a team and teach new people the ropes. It also avoids allowing tasks to become show stoppers.
Fitness: It is of the utmost importance to maintain mental and physical wellness along this journey. Prioritize these so that your mind and body can handle the journey we’re embarking on. 
Your family and happiness are also important. We should always maintain perspective as we grow.
