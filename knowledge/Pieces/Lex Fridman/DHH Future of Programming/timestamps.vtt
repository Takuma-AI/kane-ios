WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.900
No one anywhere who's serious believes that cookie banners does anything good for anyone yet

00:05.900 --> 00:09.680
We've been unable to get rid of it. This is the thing that really gets me about cookie banners, too

00:09.940 --> 00:16.160
It's not just the EU. It's the entire world. You can't hide from cookie banners anywhere on this planet

00:16.160 --> 00:21.160
If you go to got them Mars on one of Elon's rockets and you try to access a

00:21.440 --> 00:26.040
Wepage who still see a cookie banner. No one in the universe is safe from this nonsense

00:26.040 --> 00:33.240
It sometimes feels like we're barely better off like web pages aren't that different from what they were in the late 90s

00:33.240 --> 00:38.360
Early 2000s. They're still just forms. They're still just right to databases a lot of people

00:38.360 --> 00:42.880
I think are very uncomfortable with the fact that they are essentially crud monkeys

00:43.400 --> 00:47.760
They just make systems that create read update or delete

00:48.120 --> 00:51.520
Rose in a database and they have to compensate for that

00:52.520 --> 00:59.440
Existential dread by over complicating things. That's a huge part of the satisfaction of driving a race car

00:59.440 --> 01:03.000
It's driving in at the edge of adhesion as we call it where

01:03.320 --> 01:09.200
You're essentially just a tiny movement away from spinning out doesn't take much then the car starts rotating once it starts

01:09.200 --> 01:12.320
Rotating you lose grip and you're going for the wall

01:13.200 --> 01:14.720
that

01:14.720 --> 01:19.080
Balance of danger and skill is what's so intoxicating

01:21.520 --> 01:26.920
The following is a conversation with David Heinemeyer Hansen also known as DHH

01:27.280 --> 01:32.680
He is a legend in the programming and tech world brilliant and insightful

01:33.200 --> 01:38.880
Sometimes controversial and always fun to talk to he's the creator of Ruby on rails

01:39.080 --> 01:45.880
Which is an influential web development framework behind many websites used by millions of people including Shopify

01:46.240 --> 01:48.240
GitHub and Air B&B

01:48.840 --> 01:55.920
He is the co-owner and CTO of 37 signals that created base camp hey and once

01:56.720 --> 02:03.480
He is a New York Times bestselling author together with his co-author Jason Fried of four books

02:04.240 --> 02:05.280
rework

02:05.280 --> 02:09.240
Remote getting real and it doesn't have to be crazy at work

02:09.240 --> 02:12.680
And on top of that, he's also a race car driver

02:13.080 --> 02:18.280
Including being a class winner at the legendary 24-hour limon race

02:19.080 --> 02:21.680

Now dear friends here's DHH

02:32.280 --> 02:35.360
For someone who became a legendary programmer

02:35.680 --> 02:39.960
You officially got into programming late in life and I guess that's because

02:40.960 --> 02:48.320
You tried to learn how to program a few times and you failed so can you tell me the the full story the saga of

02:48.560 --> 02:52.160
Your failures to learn programming was Commodore 64 involved

02:52.920 --> 02:57.200
Commodore 64 was the inspiration. I really wanted a Commodore 64

02:57.200 --> 03:02.800
That was the first computer I ever sat down in front and the way I sat down in front of it was I was five years old

03:02.800 --> 03:06.400
And there was this one kid on my street who had a Commodore 64

03:06.680 --> 03:12.160
No one else had a computer so we were all the kids just getting over there and we were all playing

03:12.160 --> 03:14.320
Year Kung Fu. I don't know if you've ever seen that game

03:14.320 --> 03:17.240
It was one of the original fighting games. It's really a great game

03:17.240 --> 03:22.440
And I was playing that for the first time at five years old and we were like seven kids sitting up in this

03:22.880 --> 03:26.760
One kid's bedroom all taking our turn to play the game

03:26.760 --> 03:33.160
And I just found that unbelievably interesting and I begged and I begged and I begged my dad

03:33.320 --> 03:37.160
Could I get a computer and he finally comes home?

03:37.160 --> 03:43.600
It's like I got your computer. I was like yes my own Commodore 64 and he pulls out this black

03:44.000 --> 03:49.800
Green and blue keyboard. That's an Armstrong 464. I was like

03:50.800 --> 03:52.800
Dad, what's this

03:54.320 --> 03:58.160
This is not a Commodore 64, but it was a computer

03:58.400 --> 04:00.400
So I

04:00.400 --> 04:06.280
Got my first computer at essentially six years old that Armstrong 464 and of course the first thing I wanted to do

04:06.280 --> 04:13.760
I wanted to play video games and I think the computer which he by the way had traded for a TV and a sterile

04:13.760 --> 04:18.160
Recorder or something like that came with like two games one was this frogger game

04:18.160 --> 04:22.600
We had to escape from underground. It was actually kind of dark like this frog

04:22.600 --> 04:27.440
You're trying to get it out from underground. I was just I was pretty bad at it and I only had those two games and then

04:28.160 --> 04:30.160
I wanted more games and

04:30.440 --> 04:33.760
One way to get more games when you're a kid who don't have a lot of money

04:33.760 --> 04:38.080
I can't just buy a bunch of games is to type them in yourself back in

04:38.720 --> 04:40.200
84 85

04:40.200 --> 04:46.480
Magazines would literally print source code at the back of their magazines and you could just sit and type it in

04:46.480 --> 04:51.080
So I tried to do that and they would take like two hours to print this

04:51.440 --> 04:58.120
Game into the armrest rod and of course that makes some spelling mistake along the way and something wouldn't work and the whole thing

04:58.720 --> 05:01.040
I was in that good of English. I was pointing Denmark

05:01.760 --> 05:05.200
So I was really trying to get into it because I wanted all these games

05:05.200 --> 05:10.000
I didn't have the money to buy him and I tried quite hard for quite a while to get into it

05:10.000 --> 05:14.600
But it just never clicked and then I discovered the magic of piracy and after that

05:14.600 --> 05:19.120
I kind of basically just took some time off from learning to program because

05:19.680 --> 05:21.920
Well now suddenly I had access to all sorts of games

05:22.640 --> 05:25.680
So that was the first attempt like around six seven years old

05:26.640 --> 05:33.040
And what's funny is I remember these fragments. I remember not understanding the purpose of a variable

05:33.760 --> 05:37.440
If if there's a thing and you sign something why would you assign another thing to it?

05:37.440 --> 05:42.240
So for some reason I understand it constants a constants made sense to be but variables didn't

05:43.200 --> 05:45.200
Then maybe I'm 11 to 12

05:45.840 --> 05:49.280
I've gotten into the amiga at this point the amiga by the way

05:49.840 --> 05:50.800
Still

05:50.800 --> 05:56.800
Perhaps my favorite computer of all time. I mean, this is one of those things where you're like people get older and they're like all the music from the 80s

05:56.800 --> 06:02.240
Was amazing to me even as someone who loves computers. I love new computers the amiga

06:02.960 --> 06:12.160
Was this magical machine that was made by the same company that produced the Commodore 64 and I got the amiga

06:12.800 --> 06:19.200
500 I think in 87 look at this sexy thing that is a sexy machine right there

06:19.280 --> 06:21.040
This is from an age by the way

06:21.040 --> 06:26.880
We're computing wasn't global in the same sense the different territories had different computers that were popular

06:27.120 --> 06:29.120
The amiga was really popular in Europe

06:29.600 --> 06:33.760
But it wasn't very popular at all in the US as far as I understand it wasn't popular in Japan

06:34.160 --> 06:38.320
There were just different machines the apple two was a big thing in the US

06:38.320 --> 06:42.160
I'd never even heard of apple in the 80s in Copenhagen

06:42.320 --> 06:46.720
But the amiga 500 was the machine that brought me to want to try it again

06:47.040 --> 06:52.000
And you know what's funny the reason I wanted to try it again was I remembered the first time to learn

06:52.080 --> 06:55.040
And then there was this programming language that was literally called

06:55.680 --> 06:57.680
easy amus

06:57.680 --> 07:03.680
Like the easy version of amus I'm like if it's if it's easy amus how hard can it be I got to be able to figure this out

07:04.640 --> 07:06.160
And this time I tried harder

07:06.960 --> 07:12.400
I got into conditionals. I got into loops. I got into all these things and I still I couldn't do it

07:13.360 --> 07:18.560
And on the second attempt I really got to the point like maybe this is maybe I'm not smart enough

07:19.360 --> 07:25.760
Maybe programming she's not maybe it's too much math like I like math in this sort of superficial way

07:25.840 --> 07:28.160
I don't like it in the deep way that some are my

07:28.720 --> 07:33.600
Perhaps like your nerdy of friends did who are tremendous respect for my I'm not that person

07:34.080 --> 07:37.200
I'm not the math math geek who's going to figure it all out

07:38.080 --> 07:39.840
so after that

07:39.920 --> 07:46.560
Attempt with easy amus and failing to even get I don't even think I completed one even very basic game

07:47.440 --> 07:51.440
I thought the program is just not for me. I'm gonna have to do something else. I still love computers

07:51.760 --> 07:53.280
I still love video games

07:53.600 --> 07:59.520
I actually at that time had already begun making friends with people who knew how to program who weren't even program in easy amus

07:59.520 --> 08:03.600
They were program and freaking assembler and I would sit down and just go

08:04.320 --> 08:08.880
I'm how do you the moves and the memories and the copies? How do you even do this?

08:08.880 --> 08:12.640
I don't even understand how you go from this to

08:13.280 --> 08:18.080
Amiga demos for example that was the big thing with the Amiga it had this wonderful demo scene in Europe

08:19.280 --> 08:22.080
It's this really interesting period of time

08:22.960 --> 08:29.120
In the Amiga's history where you had all these programmers spread out mostly all over Europe who would compete on

08:30.640 --> 08:34.160
Graphic competitions where you could probably bring one of these

08:35.600 --> 08:37.600
This thing they would make these little

08:39.120 --> 08:40.880
Almost like music videos

08:40.880 --> 08:46.320
Combining some MIDI music combining some cool graphics and they would do all of it in like 4k

08:47.040 --> 08:52.080
4 kilobytes that is not 4k is a revolution 4 kilobytes of of memory

08:52.400 --> 08:55.280
And I just thought that was such a cool scene. This was obviously

08:56.000 --> 08:59.120
Pre-Internat it was even pre-bbs

08:59.680 --> 09:04.000
Bulletin board systems to some extent it was you swap your

09:04.640 --> 09:08.240
Demo software with someone else by sending them a disc in the mail

09:09.040 --> 09:13.360
Like the 3.5's and I just I was enamored with that whole scene

09:13.440 --> 09:16.880
I was enamored with what they were able to create and I just wanted to be a part of it

09:16.960 --> 09:19.600
Even though I kind of didn't have any skills to contribute

09:20.240 --> 09:22.000
And that's how I got into running

09:22.000 --> 09:28.640
BBSs. I didn't learn programming then and I wouldn't learn programming until much later until I was almost 20 years old

09:28.960 --> 09:32.640
The Bulletin board systems existed in this funny space where they were part

09:33.120 --> 09:37.920
Lee as servers to the demo scenes allowing all these demo groups to distribute their

09:38.720 --> 09:44.240
Amazing demos and then it was also a place to trade piracy software pirated software

09:44.720 --> 09:50.800
And I ended up starting one of those when I was 14 years old in my tiny little bedroom in Copenhagen

09:50.960 --> 09:54.000
I had my at that point amiga 4000

09:54.720 --> 09:56.800
I had three

09:56.800 --> 09:59.600
Telephone lines coming into make tiny room nice

10:00.400 --> 10:04.880
Which was funny because again, I'm 14 years old by the time I was in sterling my third line

10:04.880 --> 10:07.440
You had to get someone from the telephone company to come do it

10:07.680 --> 10:13.120
I get this guy and he's just looking around like what is this why the hell is a 14-year-old

10:13.680 --> 10:21.440
Having three phone lines into their tiny little bedroom. What are what's going on here? Why are all these modems blinking red and

10:21.920 --> 10:24.800
Black and making funny sounds. Did your parents know they

10:25.600 --> 10:29.360
Did and they didn't they knew I had the phone lines then you had the computer

10:29.680 --> 10:35.760
I don't think they really understood that I was trading pirated software that was both illegal and

10:36.720 --> 10:43.040
Whatever else was going on. I wish to probably say that in Europe. Maybe you can comment on this in especially in Eastern Europe

10:43.040 --> 10:48.720
But Europe in general piracy. I think was more acceptable than it was in the United States. I don't know there

10:49.440 --> 10:53.440
Maybe maybe it's just my upbringing conversation. Yeah, it wasn't present

10:53.680 --> 11:00.160
I never spoke to anyone growing up in Denmark has any moral qualms whatsoever about piracy

11:00.320 --> 11:02.080
It was just completely accepted that

11:02.960 --> 11:06.800
Your kid you want a lot of games you don't have a lot of money. What do you do?

11:07.360 --> 11:13.600
You trade yeah some people would occasionally buy a game. I mean I once bought a second master system

11:14.320 --> 11:17.520
And the I bought one game because that was what I could afford

11:17.600 --> 11:21.200
I got afterburner to I don't know if you've ever played that game. It's pretty bad

11:21.760 --> 11:24.640
implementation on the second master system

11:25.040 --> 11:26.480
But it was like

11:26.480 --> 11:30.080
600 crowners and I was making money at that time

11:30.960 --> 11:35.600
Doing newspaper delivery. I had to do that for a month to afford one game

11:36.320 --> 11:39.840
I like video games way too much to wait a month just to get one game

11:40.160 --> 11:42.160
So piracy was just the way you did it

11:42.960 --> 11:45.680
And that was how I got into running this bulletin board system

11:46.160 --> 11:47.680
Being part of the demo scene

11:47.920 --> 11:53.200
Being part of the piracy scene to some extent and then also at some point realizing oh

11:53.760 --> 12:00.240
You can actually also make money on this and this can fund buying more phone lines and buying more modems and buying more megas

12:00.960 --> 12:05.760
Oh, yeah, that was one of the demo parties. These were amazing things. What am I looking at?

12:06.000 --> 12:10.640
Isn't that all those CRT monitors all these CRT monsters again when I was 14

12:11.440 --> 12:14.400
I don't understand fully why my parents allowed this

12:15.120 --> 12:17.680
But I traveled from Copenhagen

12:18.400 --> 12:25.760
The capital of Denmark to all this tiny little town in juddling on the train with a bunch of dudes who were like

12:26.160 --> 12:31.840
Late teens in their 20s. I'm 14 years old. I'm lugging my 14-inch CRT monitor

12:32.160 --> 12:36.080
With my computer in the back to go to the party. That was what it was called

12:36.080 --> 12:40.080
That was the biggest demo scene party at that time and it was exactly as you see in that picture

12:40.640 --> 12:47.600
Thousands of people just lining up with the computers programming demos all day long and trading these things back and forth

12:48.480 --> 12:51.360
That's kind of awesome. Not gonna lie. It's a little ridiculous

12:52.080 --> 12:57.600
It's totally awesome and I I miss it in ways where the internet has connected people in some ways

12:58.000 --> 13:01.120
But the connection you get from sitting right next to someone else

13:01.680 --> 13:05.600
Who has their own CRT monitor who's lucked at halfway around the country to get there?

13:06.000 --> 13:10.080
It's truly special because it was also just this burst of creativity

13:10.240 --> 13:14.080
You constantly running around you constantly surrounded by people who are really good at what they could do

13:14.080 --> 13:17.840
They're really good at programming computers. It's infectious. It was part of that

13:18.640 --> 13:24.800
Pang I felt then going like oh man. Why can't I figure this out? I mean, why can't I even figure out easy? Amos

13:26.240 --> 13:30.240
I was kind of frustrating but on your third attempt you'll be more successful

13:30.800 --> 13:34.480
So third attempt is when I start getting it. This is when I start

13:35.440 --> 13:37.440
Helping out let's say

13:37.440 --> 13:39.440
Building things for the internet

13:39.440 --> 13:43.440
So around 95 I think it is or 96. I

13:44.160 --> 13:48.080
Discovered the internet actually in ninth grade. That was my first experience. I went to

13:48.800 --> 13:50.800
some university in

13:51.360 --> 13:57.960
Denmark and in ninth grade we had this excursion and they sat us down in front of a computer and the computer had a

13:57.960 --> 14:02.240
Netscape navigator the first version or maybe it was even the precursor to that

14:03.120 --> 14:07.200
And they had a text editor and us kids just got like hey built something on the internet

14:07.200 --> 14:11.920
And we should say CML and the first thing you do is like oh, I can make the text text blink

14:12.240 --> 14:14.240
By just putting in this tag and saving it

14:14.640 --> 14:16.400
that was that

14:16.400 --> 14:22.960
Moment that was actually when I re-awakened the urge to want to learn the program because I got a positive experience

14:23.120 --> 14:25.600
All the other experiences I had with programming was I

14:26.160 --> 14:30.160
Spend hours typing something in I click run and it wouldn't work

14:30.480 --> 14:36.240
And I'd get an error message that made no sense to me as a kid either at six or seven or at 12

14:36.560 --> 14:41.360
And here I am sitting in front of a computer connected to the internet and I'm making text blink

14:41.840 --> 14:44.960
I'm making it larger. I'm turning it into an h1 or an h2

14:46.160 --> 14:52.560
And these guys out here we just did it for like an hour and a half and suddenly I go oh, I can make things for the internet

14:52.960 --> 14:54.560
That's someone in

14:54.560 --> 14:58.640
Germany can be able to access and see and I don't have to ask anyone for permission

14:59.200 --> 15:01.200
This is super cool. I got to do more of this

15:01.280 --> 15:04.560
So I got into to the internet. I got into working with html

15:04.560 --> 15:06.720
And I still had all these friends from these demo parties

15:07.360 --> 15:10.640
And I started working with them on creating gaming websites

15:11.120 --> 15:13.120
I'd rather buy the video games. I'd review them

15:13.120 --> 15:17.840
This was another good way of getting new video games was to walk down to some store and say like hey

15:17.840 --> 15:19.040
I'm a journalist

15:19.040 --> 15:23.040
I'm like this 15-year-old kid and they're they're looking at you're journalist

15:23.040 --> 15:28.160
Yeah, can I borrow some some games because this was when games moved on to the PlayStation and these other things

15:28.160 --> 15:33.600
You couldn't just as easily pirate at least not at first. So I went down there did all that and

15:34.880 --> 15:40.400
That started the journey of the internet for me. It started working on these gaming websites working with programmers

15:41.680 --> 15:45.360
Figuring out that I could do something I could work on the h2ml party's not really programming

15:45.360 --> 15:48.720
But it kind of smells like it. You're talking to a computer. You're making it put

15:49.200 --> 15:52.720
Text on the screen and you're communicating with someone halfway around the world

15:53.200 --> 15:55.200
so that became my

15:55.280 --> 15:59.600
Pathway back into programming and then slowly I picked up more and more of it first

16:00.560 --> 16:06.720
Website I did with someone one of these programmers from the demo scene that was dynamic was ASP.net

16:07.280 --> 16:11.280
I wasn't even actually called that net that was what we started on and then we moved on to PHP

16:11.600 --> 16:15.120
And PHP was when I finally got it when it finally clicked

16:15.680 --> 16:22.720
When conditionals and loops and variables and all that stuff started to make sense enough to me

16:23.520 --> 16:32.720
That I thought I can do this. So would it be fair to say that we wouldn't have dhh without PHP and therefore you oh all your success to PHP

16:33.440 --> 16:38.320
A hundred percent that's true and it's even better than that because as PHP to me

16:39.120 --> 16:42.400
Didn't just give me a start in terms of making my own web applications

16:42.880 --> 16:51.680
It actually gave me a bar in many ways. I think the pinnacle of developer web developer ergonomics is late 90s PHP

16:52.320 --> 16:58.080
You write this script you ftp it to a server and instantly it's deployed

16:58.640 --> 17:04.720
Instantly it's available you change anything in that file and you reload boom. It's right there. There's no web servers

17:04.880 --> 17:09.680
There's no setup. There's just an Apache that runs mod PHP

17:10.480 --> 17:14.720
And it was essentially the easiest way to get a dynamic web page up and going

17:15.280 --> 17:19.840
And this is one of the things I've been chasing that high for basically the rest of my career

17:20.320 --> 17:25.440
That it was so easy to make things for the internet in the mid to late 90s

17:26.000 --> 17:31.280
How did we lose the sensibilities that allowed us to not just work this way

17:31.680 --> 17:37.200
But get new people into the industry to give them that was success experiences that I had

17:38.160 --> 17:45.600
Adding a freaking blint tag to an HTML page ftp a PHP page to an Apache web server without knowing

17:46.240 --> 17:51.040
Really anything about anything without knowing anything about frameworks without knowing anything about setup

17:52.080 --> 17:57.920
All of that stuff have really taken us to a place where it sometimes feels like we're barely better off

17:58.400 --> 18:03.200
Like web pages aren't that different from what they were in the late 90s early 2000s

18:03.440 --> 18:07.360
They're still just forms they're still just right to databases a lot of people

18:07.360 --> 18:11.920
I think are very uncomfortable with the fact that they are essentially crud monkeys

18:12.640 --> 18:16.800
They just make systems that create read update or delete

18:17.440 --> 18:20.560
Rose in a database and they have to compensate for that

18:21.600 --> 18:26.320
Existential dread by over complicating things now. That's a bit of a character

18:26.320 --> 18:30.480
There's more to it and there's things you can learn for more sophisticated ways of thinking about this

18:30.480 --> 18:36.480
But there's still an ideal here, which is why I was so happy you had pedal levels on because he's still basically works like this

18:36.800 --> 18:38.720
Yeah, and I look at that and go like man, that's amazing

18:38.800 --> 18:44.320
Yeah, you're chasing that high. He's been high all along. Yes, using using PHP

18:44.720 --> 18:46.720
jQuery and

18:46.720 --> 18:49.760
SQLite I think it's amazing because he's proving

18:50.560 --> 18:58.080
That this isn't just an nostalgic dream. He's actually doing it. He's running all these businesses now some of that is as he would admit

18:59.200 --> 19:05.760
Up first up front is that he's just one guy and you could do different things when you just want guy when you're working in a team

19:05.920 --> 19:10.880
When I start working on a team when I start working with Jason freed on base cam

19:11.680 --> 19:13.120
We at first

19:13.120 --> 19:18.800
Didn't use version control together. I used version control for myself and then I thought do you know what?

19:19.440 --> 19:21.440
designers

19:21.440 --> 19:23.440
Departing not smart enough to figure out CBS

19:24.320 --> 19:28.400
And therefore I just like no, no, no, you just FTP it up. You just FTP it

19:28.400 --> 19:34.080
I knew they knew how to do FTP and then after the third time I had overridden their changes as I got damn it

19:34.080 --> 19:38.640
I guess I got to teach Jason CBS to not do that again, but

19:39.600 --> 19:41.280
I think there's

19:41.280 --> 19:47.360
Still way more truth to the fact that we can work the way we did in the 90s work the way Peter works today

19:48.080 --> 19:57.040
Even in the team context and that we've been far too willing to hand over far too much of our developer ergonomics to the merchants of complexity

19:57.200 --> 19:59.760
And you've been chasing that with Rails 8

19:59.760 --> 20:06.000
So how do you bring all the cool features of a modern framework and make it no build?

20:06.400 --> 20:08.400
Make it as easy to

20:08.880 --> 20:13.200
Create something and to ship it as it was in the 90s with just php

20:13.440 --> 20:16.400
It's very difficult for me to beat the peter levels approach

20:17.680 --> 20:22.960
Of just just it's so easy to just ship some php and it should be

20:23.440 --> 20:26.480
Why should it be harder than that our computers today are

20:26.960 --> 20:30.320
Almost infinitely faster than what they were in the 90s

20:30.800 --> 20:33.680
So shouldn't we be able to work in even easier ways

20:34.320 --> 20:37.920
We should be looking back on the 90s and go like oh that was way too complicated

20:38.000 --> 20:44.320
Now we have more sophisticated technology that's way faster and it allows us to work in these easier to use ways

20:44.560 --> 20:46.560
But that's not true

20:46.560 --> 20:51.440
But now you can see the line I draw in my work with Ruby and Rails and especially with Rails 8

20:51.840 --> 20:53.840
No built to me is

20:54.480 --> 21:02.400
Reaching back to that 90s feeling and going now we can do some of those things without giving up on all the progress

21:02.400 --> 21:05.840
Because I do think you can get to nostalgic. I do think you can start

21:06.800 --> 21:09.760
Just fantasizing that everything was better in the 90s. It wasn't

21:10.080 --> 21:15.600
I mean, I was there. There was a lot of things that sucked and if we can somehow find a way to combine

21:15.920 --> 21:22.960
The advantages and advances we've had over the past 20 years with that ease of developer ergonomics

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
We can win no built is

21:26.160 --> 21:31.600
A rejection of the part of web development. I've hated the most in the past 1015 years

21:32.000 --> 21:34.400
Which is the java script seen

21:35.360 --> 21:37.760
And I don't say that as someone who hate java script

21:37.920 --> 21:41.680
I mean, I often joke that java script is my second favorite programming language

21:42.080 --> 21:45.200
It's a very distant second. Ruby is by far and away number one

21:45.600 --> 21:49.760
But I actually like java script. I don't think it's a bad language. It gets a lot of

21:50.640 --> 21:55.360
Flack people add a string of two plus of one and give something nonsense

21:55.360 --> 21:58.560
And I just go like yeah, but why why would you do that? Just don't do that

21:58.800 --> 22:00.800
The language is actually quite lovely

22:00.880 --> 22:06.640
Especially the modern version ES6 that really introduced a proper class syntax to it

22:06.640 --> 22:10.960
So I could work with java script in many of the same ways that I love working with Ruby

22:11.520 --> 22:13.520
may think so much better

22:13.680 --> 22:21.040
But in the early 2010s until quite recently all of that advancement happened in

22:21.920 --> 22:27.920
pre-processing happened in build pipelines the browsers couldn't speak a dialect of java script

22:27.920 --> 22:34.080
That was a pleasant to work with so everyone started to pre-compiling their java script to be able to use more modern

22:34.880 --> 22:40.800
Ways of programming with a browser that was seen as stuck with an ancient version of java script

22:40.800 --> 22:44.080
That no one actually wanted to work with and that made sense to me

22:44.480 --> 22:46.480
But it was also deeply unpleasant

22:46.480 --> 22:51.680
And I remember thinking during that time the dark ages as I refer to them with java script that

22:52.960 --> 22:56.000
This cannot be the final destination

22:56.000 --> 23:02.800
There's no way that we have managed to turn the internet into such an unpleasant place to work

23:03.440 --> 23:09.440
Where I would start working on a project in java script using webpack and all of these dependencies

23:09.440 --> 23:13.600
And I would put it down for literally five minutes and the thing wouldn't compile anymore

23:14.240 --> 23:20.720
The amount of churn that the java script community especially with its frameworks and its tooling went through

23:20.720 --> 23:24.240
In the decade from 2010 to 2020 was absurd

23:25.200 --> 23:27.200
And you had to be

23:27.760 --> 23:33.920
trapped inside of that asylum to not realize what an utterly

23:33.920 --> 23:38.160
perverse situation we had landed ourselves in

23:38.800 --> 23:41.280
Why does everything break all the time?

23:41.680 --> 23:45.200
I mean the joke wouldn't be just that the software would break that would annoy me personally

23:45.200 --> 23:51.280
But then I'd go on hacker news and I'd see some thread on the latest java script release of some framework

23:51.840 --> 23:53.840
And the thread would be like

23:53.840 --> 23:54.800
um

23:54.800 --> 24:00.160
Someone would ask well aren't we using the thing we just used three months ago and people would be like that thing is so outdated

24:00.160 --> 24:02.160
That's so three months ago

24:02.720 --> 24:07.600
You got to get with the new program. We're completely rewriting everything for the team time

24:07.840 --> 24:11.200
And anything you've learned in the framework you've been spending the

24:12.080 --> 24:16.080
Last amount of time on it's all useless. You got to throw everything out and you got to start over

24:16.560 --> 24:21.760
Why aren't you doing it stupid idiot? Is that a kind of mass hysteria that took over the developer community?

24:21.760 --> 24:27.440
You think like where you have to keep creating new frameworks and new frameworks and we are we past that

24:28.000 --> 24:29.520
Dark age

24:29.520 --> 24:35.200
I think we're getting out of it and we're getting out of it because browsers have gotten so much better

24:35.840 --> 24:41.840
There was a stagnation in browser technology some of it was an overhang all the way back from iE5

24:42.880 --> 24:48.720
So iE5 essentially put the whole internet development experience into a deep freeze because

24:48.880 --> 24:52.480
Microsoft won the browser wars in the mid 2000s

24:52.960 --> 24:57.360
And then they basically expanded their browser development team because they're all right job done

24:57.680 --> 25:03.840
We don't need any more innovation on the internet. Can we just go back to writing windows forms or something now that we control everything

25:04.880 --> 25:06.880
And it really wasn't until

25:07.520 --> 25:15.520
Obviously Firefox kind of kindled a little bit of something then chrome got into the scene and google got serious about moving to web forward

25:16.000 --> 25:17.360
that

25:17.360 --> 25:20.480
You had a kindling of maybe the browser could be better

25:20.560 --> 25:25.360
Maybe the browser wasn't frozen in time in 2005 maybe the browser could actually

25:26.080 --> 25:29.200
Evolved like at the development platform that it is

25:29.760 --> 25:30.960
But then what happened was

25:31.840 --> 25:33.600
You had a lot of smart people

25:33.600 --> 25:36.560
Who poured in to the web because the web

25:37.120 --> 25:40.640
Turned out to be the greatest application development platform of all time

25:40.880 --> 25:45.120
This was where all the money was being made this were this was where all the billionaires were being minted

25:45.360 --> 25:51.040
This was where the Facebook send whatever of the world came to be so you had all of this

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
Brainpower applied to the problem of how to work with the web and there were some very smart people

25:58.720 --> 26:03.120
With some i'm sure very good ideas who did not have

26:04.720 --> 26:10.880
Programmer happiness as their motivation number one they had other priorities

26:11.680 --> 26:14.160
And those parties

26:14.160 --> 26:20.400
allowed them to discount and even rationalize the complexity they were injecting everywhere

26:21.200 --> 26:26.240
Some of that complexity came from organizational structure when you have a company like Facebook for example

26:26.320 --> 26:31.040
That does depend on the web and want to push it forward but have sliced the development

26:31.600 --> 26:36.480
Roll job into these tiny little niches. I'm a front-end

26:37.360 --> 26:38.640
glob

26:38.640 --> 26:45.360
Pipeline a configurator. Oh, yeah, well. I'm a front-end whatever engineer and suddenly

26:45.920 --> 26:50.000
The web developer was no longer one person. It was 15 different rolls

26:50.240 --> 26:53.680
That in itself injected a ton of complexity, but I also want to give it

26:54.720 --> 26:58.720
The bold case here which was that some of that complexity was necessary

26:59.200 --> 27:03.200
To get to where we are today that the complexity was a bridge

27:03.840 --> 27:09.360
It wasn't the destination, but we have to cross that bridge to get to where we are today where browsers are

27:09.680 --> 27:13.520
Frankly incredible the java script you can write in a text file

27:14.160 --> 27:17.840
And then serve on a web server for browser to ingest is amazing

27:17.920 --> 27:23.520
It's actually a really good experience. You don't need any pre-processing. You can just write text files send up to a browser

27:24.080 --> 27:29.280
And you have an incredible development and we should also say that it can kind of be broken at least the HTML

27:29.280 --> 27:32.880
But even the javascript could be a little bit broken and it kind of still works

27:33.680 --> 27:35.680
Like maybe it half-ass works

27:35.760 --> 27:38.400
But like just the amount of mess

27:39.200 --> 27:43.440
Of smelly code that a browser has to deal with is insane

27:44.080 --> 27:51.440
This is one of the hardest problems in computing today is to parse the entire internet because thankfully

27:52.240 --> 27:56.320
For us as web developers, but perhaps not so much for the browser developers

27:56.880 --> 28:02.800
Every web page that has ever been created minus the brief period would flash still runs today

28:04.080 --> 28:10.480
The web page I did in ninth grade would render on a modern browser today 30 years later easy

28:11.040 --> 28:17.040
That is completely crazy when you think about the amount of evolution we've had with the web how much better

28:17.040 --> 28:20.960
We've made it how many more standards browsers have adopted it's

28:21.520 --> 28:24.640
Essentially in the paul of project today to create a new browser

28:24.640 --> 28:30.880
Which is why it doesn't happen very often which is why even companies like Microsoft have to throw into towel and say we can't do it

28:31.120 --> 28:33.760
Now I actually don't think that's good for the web

28:33.920 --> 28:39.600
There is the danger of the monoculture if we just get a single browser engine that runs everything and we are in danger of that

28:39.920 --> 28:45.680
I love the fact that the lady bird project for example is trying to make a new browser engine from scratch

28:46.000 --> 28:50.960
I've supported that project. I would encourage people to look into that. It's really a wonderful

28:51.680 --> 28:58.800
Thing it's staff by a bunch of people who worked on other browser projects in the past truly independent web browser

28:59.280 --> 29:01.040
We really need that

29:01.040 --> 29:06.240
But I can hold that thought in my head at the same time. I hold the thought in my head that

29:07.200 --> 29:09.200
Google's Chrome

29:09.200 --> 29:14.320
Was pivotal to the web surviving as the premier web development platform

29:14.640 --> 29:21.120
If it had not been for Google and their entire business depending on a thriving open web

29:22.960 --> 29:24.080
Apple

29:24.080 --> 29:31.520
Microsoft I think would have been just as fine to see the web go away to disappear into being something that just served

29:32.000 --> 29:37.920
Native web application or native mobile applications and native desktop applications that they could completely control

29:38.400 --> 29:39.600
so

29:39.600 --> 29:45.600
I have also the problems with Google, but it's not chrome chrome is a complete gift to

29:46.080 --> 29:50.080
Web developers everywhere to the web as a development platform and

29:51.200 --> 29:54.640
They deserve an enormous amount of credit. I think for that even if

29:55.280 --> 29:58.560
It's entangled with their business model and a half of

29:59.040 --> 30:02.080
Chrome is code that spies on you or informs

30:02.800 --> 30:05.440
Targeted ads and a bunch of things. I'm not a big fan of

30:05.920 --> 30:12.480
I can divorce that from the fact that we need champions in the corner of the web who have trillions of dollars

30:13.120 --> 30:19.440
Of market cap value riding on the open web. We're gonna take tangents upon a tangents upon a tangents

30:19.440 --> 30:21.440
So let's go to chrome. I think

30:21.840 --> 30:27.120
Chrome positive impact on humanities is immeasurable for reasons that you just described

30:27.920 --> 30:32.720
On the technology front the features that present the competition they created. It's spurred on this

30:33.200 --> 30:37.520
Wonderful flourishing of web technologies, but anyway. I have to ask you about the

30:38.400 --> 30:44.480
The recent stuff with the DOJ trying to split up chrome and google. Do you think this is a good idea?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.960
Do you think this does harm?

30:47.120 --> 30:49.120
Is this a disaster?

30:49.120 --> 30:53.600
And I say that as someone who's been very sympathetic to the antitrust

30:54.400 --> 30:57.840
Fight because I do think we have antitrust problems in technology

30:58.160 --> 31:01.120
But the one place where we don't have them

31:01.760 --> 31:04.800
By and large is with browsers is with

31:05.600 --> 31:10.080
The tools we used to access the open web. First of all, we have Firefox

31:10.720 --> 31:16.320
Now Firefox is not doing all that great and Firefox has been propped up by google for many years

31:16.880 --> 31:21.760
To deter from exactly what's going on with the DOJ that they were the only game in town

31:22.560 --> 31:25.680
Apple has safari. I have a bunch of problems with apple too

31:26.080 --> 31:32.160
But I love safari. I love the fact that we have a premiere browser running on a premiere operating system

31:32.480 --> 31:36.160
That people can't turn the web into just a chrome experience

31:36.960 --> 31:44.080
But I also think that the open web needs this trillion dollar champion or at least benefits from it

31:44.080 --> 31:46.960
Maybe doesn't need it, but it certainly benefits from it

31:47.040 --> 31:51.920
And of all the things that are wrong with monopoly formation in technology

31:52.560 --> 31:56.720
Chrome is the last thing and this is why I get so frustrated sometimes about the

31:57.200 --> 32:01.040
Anti or the monopoly fight that there are real problems

32:01.040 --> 32:06.400
And we should be focusing on the premiere problems first like the toll booths on our

32:07.040 --> 32:08.000
mobile phones

32:08.000 --> 32:12.080
They're far bigger problem. It's not the open web. It's not the tools that we used to access the open web

32:12.560 --> 32:16.160
If I don't want to use chrome if my

32:16.720 --> 32:20.480
Customers of my businesses that run on the internet don't want to use chrome

32:20.480 --> 32:24.800
They don't have to we're never forced to go through it the open internet is still open

32:25.360 --> 32:27.360
So I think it's a real shame

32:28.080 --> 32:31.680
That the DOJ has chosen to pursue google in this way

32:31.840 --> 32:34.480
I do think there are other things you can nail google for and they're

32:35.040 --> 32:37.280
Adminopoly maybe or the

32:38.080 --> 32:42.560
Shenanigans they've done in controlling both sides of the ad ledger that they both

32:43.040 --> 32:48.080
Control the supply end of the man there are problems chrome isn't it and you end up making

32:48.880 --> 32:54.800
The web much worse and this is the thing we always got to remember when we think about legislation when we think about

32:56.080 --> 32:57.680
monopoly fights is

32:57.680 --> 33:01.520
You may not like how things look today and you may want to do something about it

33:02.240 --> 33:04.240
But you may also make it worse

33:05.200 --> 33:07.840
The good intentions behind the GDPR in Europe

33:08.560 --> 33:17.200
Currently has amounted to what cookie banners that everyone on the internet hates that helps no one do anything better

33:17.680 --> 33:27.600
Anything more efficient that saves no privacy in any way shape a form has been a complete boondoggle that has only enriched lawyers and accountants and

33:28.080 --> 33:36.480
Pure crafts. Yeah, you said that the cookie banner is a monument for why Europe is losing is is doing the worst

33:37.600 --> 33:39.600
Of all the regions in tech

33:40.000 --> 33:45.520
It's it's a monument to good intentions leading straight to hell

33:47.520 --> 33:52.720
And the Europe is actually world class in good intentions leading straight to hell

33:52.800 --> 33:58.000
So hell is the cookie except button they have to accept all cookies

33:58.080 --> 34:00.080
That's what hell looks like over and over

34:00.720 --> 34:08.640
You don't actually ever get to the web page just on a human scale try to imagine how many hours every day are wasted

34:09.280 --> 34:15.360
Clicking that away and how much harm we've done to the web as a platform that people enjoy

34:16.160 --> 34:17.520
Because of them

34:17.520 --> 34:20.560
The internet is ugly in part because of cookie banners

34:21.360 --> 34:27.040
Cookie banners were supposed to save us from advertisement and advertisement can make the web ugly

34:27.120 --> 34:28.400
There's plenty of examples of that

34:28.480 --> 34:31.360
But cookie banners made the entire internet ugly in one

34:32.160 --> 34:34.400
Spelt swoop and that's a complete tragedy

34:34.400 --> 34:39.600
But what's even worse and this is why I call it out as a monument to everything the EU gets wrong

34:39.920 --> 34:41.920
Is that we have known this for a decade

34:42.640 --> 34:48.160
No one anywhere who's serious believes that cookie banners does anything good for anyone yet

34:48.160 --> 34:49.920
We've been unable to get rid of it

34:50.000 --> 34:54.320
There's this one piece of legislation that's now I think 10 to 12 years old

34:54.320 --> 34:57.520
It's complete failure on every conceivable metric

34:57.520 --> 35:01.040
Everyone hates it universally yet we can't seem to do anything about it

35:02.080 --> 35:04.720
That's a bankrupt seat declaration for any

35:05.680 --> 35:11.200
Body of bureaucrats who pretend or pretend to make things better for

35:11.920 --> 35:13.920
Not just citizens, but people around the world

35:14.560 --> 35:16.880
This is the thing that really gets me about cookie banners too

35:17.440 --> 35:19.040
It's not just the EU

35:19.040 --> 35:23.280
It's the entire world you can't hide from cookie banners anywhere on this planet

35:23.680 --> 35:29.120
If you go to got that Mars on one of Elon's rockets and you try to access a web page

35:29.120 --> 35:34.960
You'll still see a cookie banner no one in the universe is safe from this nonsense probably the interface on

35:36.000 --> 35:38.240
On the rocket you will have basically

35:38.960 --> 35:45.520
150 second ping time. Yeah, so it'll take you 45 seconds just to get through the cookie banners from Mars

35:46.480 --> 35:52.240
All right, let's walk back up the stack of this recursive tangents we've been taking so chrome

35:53.040 --> 35:55.040
We should say at least in my opinion

35:56.000 --> 36:02.720
Is not winning unfairly it's winning in the fairway by just being better

36:03.520 --> 36:06.880
It is if I was gonna steal man the other side just for a half second

36:07.920 --> 36:10.320
People would say well maybe yes

36:11.120 --> 36:12.800
Most people do

36:12.800 --> 36:15.520
Sort of begrudgingly agreed that chrome is a pretty good browser

36:15.600 --> 36:18.720
But then they'll say the reason it got dominance was distribution

36:19.280 --> 36:23.520
And the reason it got distribution was because Google also controls android

36:23.920 --> 36:27.520
And therefore can make chrome the default browser on all these phones now

36:28.880 --> 36:32.560
I don't buy that and the reason I don't buy that is because unandroid

36:32.960 --> 36:38.400
You're actually allowed to ship a different browser that has a browser engine that's not the same as chrome

36:38.800 --> 36:40.640
Unlike on iOS where

36:41.360 --> 36:47.120
If you want to ship a browser chrome for example ships for iOS, but it's not chrome. It's a farie wrapped in a dress

36:48.160 --> 36:48.960
and

36:48.960 --> 36:55.040
Every single alternative browser on iOS have to use the safari web engine. That's not competition

36:55.200 --> 37:00.160
That's not what happened on android again. I think there are some nuances to it

37:00.160 --> 37:07.120
But if you zoom out and you look at all the problems we have with big tech chrome is not it chrome one on merits

37:07.520 --> 37:14.320
I be grudgingly have switched to chrome on that realization alone as a web developer. I just prefer it

37:14.960 --> 37:17.840
I like Firefox in many ways. I like the ethos of it

37:18.080 --> 37:23.040
But chrome is a better browser than Firefox full stop and by the way, we've never mentioned edge

37:23.520 --> 37:25.520
Edge is also a good browser

37:25.760 --> 37:30.880
Because it's also chrome in a dress, but it never gets the love. I don't think I've ever used Bing

37:31.760 --> 37:33.760
And I'm sure Bing is really nice

37:33.840 --> 37:37.680
Maybe you have because you know what is Bing in a dress what duck duck go

37:38.400 --> 37:41.520
Which is actually the search engine that I use duck duck go

37:42.240 --> 37:46.880
Gets its search results from Bing or at least it used to if they changed that that would be news to me

37:47.200 --> 37:48.720
Well, maybe

37:48.720 --> 37:50.080
everything

37:50.080 --> 37:54.560
It's just a wrap or a dress everything is wearing a dress underneath. There's some other

37:54.560 --> 38:01.120
There's some of those it turns all the dresses all the way down. Okay. Well, we're talking about they we got there from javascript and from you

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Learning how to program. So eventually

38:05.680 --> 38:09.920
The big success stories when you built them with just stuff with php

38:11.520 --> 38:17.920
And you're like actually chipping things. Yes, and that's when the the ruby story came so what

38:19.200 --> 38:26.320
Your big love affair with programming began there. So can you take me there? What is ruby tell the story of ruby?

38:26.800 --> 38:28.320
Explain ruby to me

38:28.320 --> 38:31.920
php was what converted me from just being able to

38:32.640 --> 38:38.880
fondle html and turn out some web pages to actually being able to produce web applications myself

38:40.160 --> 38:46.640
So I owe a tremendous gratitude to php in that regard, but I never thought of php as a calling

38:47.040 --> 38:51.200
I never thought I'm a professional programmer who writes php

38:51.200 --> 38:53.200
That's why I am and that's what I do

38:53.360 --> 38:56.480
I thought of php as a tool. I needed to

38:57.040 --> 39:02.880
smack the computer with until it produced web applications. I wanted it was very much a means to an end

39:04.080 --> 39:06.080
I didn't fall in love with php

39:06.960 --> 39:14.080
I'm very grateful that it taught me the basics of programming and I'm very grateful that it set the bar for the economics

39:14.320 --> 39:21.600
But it really wasn't until ruby that I started thinking of myself as a programmer and the way that came about was

39:22.320 --> 39:28.720
That the first time I ever got hired as a professional programmer to write code was actually

39:29.120 --> 39:33.760
By Jason freed my business partner still all the way back in 2001

39:34.400 --> 39:39.200
I had been working on these gaming websites in php for essentially 18 months at that point

39:39.600 --> 39:43.200
No one had been paying me to do code in that regard and I

39:43.840 --> 39:45.840
Connected with Jason freed

39:45.840 --> 39:50.480
over an email sent from Copenhagen denmark to Chicago, Illinois

39:51.120 --> 39:53.600
To a person who didn't know who I was. I was just offering

39:54.320 --> 40:00.080
Solicit advice Jason had asked a question on the internet and I had sent them the answer and he was asking in php

40:00.880 --> 40:04.480
And I had sent them the answer to that question and we started talking and then we started working

40:04.480 --> 40:07.280
Which by the way is a miracle of what the internet can allow?

40:07.360 --> 40:13.200
How can a kid in Copenhagen who's never met this guy in Chicago connect just over

40:14.080 --> 40:17.520
Email and start working together and by the way, we're still working together now

40:18.160 --> 40:20.960
24 years later that's incredible

40:21.120 --> 40:24.720
But we started working together and we started working together on some client projects

40:25.040 --> 40:29.760
Jason would do the design 37 signals would do design. I would bring the programming php

40:30.400 --> 40:34.800
And everyone did we work on I think two or three client projects together in php

40:35.920 --> 40:37.920
We kept hitting the same problem

40:38.720 --> 40:43.600
That whenever you work with a client you start that project off an email. Oh, yeah

40:43.680 --> 40:48.160
Let's work together. Here's what we're building and you start trading more and more emails and

40:48.880 --> 40:52.320
Before a few weeks have passed you got to add someone to the project

40:53.440 --> 40:57.600
They don't have the emails. They don't have the context. You send them. Where's the latest file?

40:57.760 --> 41:04.560
Oh, I've uploaded on the ftp. It's like final final v06 2.0 right that's the one to get it's just a mess

41:05.200 --> 41:09.840
A beautiful mess in some ways a mess that still runs the vast majority of projects to this day

41:10.240 --> 41:12.240
Email is the lowest common denominator

41:12.480 --> 41:13.680
That's wonderful

41:13.680 --> 41:18.640
But we had dropped the ball a couple of times in serious ways with customers and we thought

41:19.360 --> 41:23.600
We can do better. We know how to make web applications. Can't we just make a system

41:24.240 --> 41:27.840
That's better than email for managing projects. It can't be that hard

41:28.320 --> 41:34.720
We've been doing blogs. We've been doing to do list. Let's put some of these things together and just make a system where

41:34.960 --> 41:40.880
Everything that anyone involved in the project needs is on one page and it has to be simple enough that

41:41.040 --> 41:46.000
I'm not going to run a seminar teaching you how to use the system. I'm just going to give you the login code

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
You're going to jump into it. So that's base camp and when we started working on base camp

41:53.280 --> 42:00.160
I for the first time in the experience I have with Jason hat the freedom of technology choice

42:00.400 --> 42:07.120
There was no client telling me. Yeah, PHP. That sounds good. We know PHP. Can you build it in PHP? I had free reigns

42:08.080 --> 42:12.240
And at that time I'd been reading I triple E magazine

42:13.200 --> 42:16.000
And a couple of other magazines back from the early 2000s

42:16.720 --> 42:24.640
where Dave Thomas and Martin Fowler had been writing about programming patterns and

42:25.680 --> 42:29.840
How to write better code and these two guys in particular

42:30.320 --> 42:36.240
We're both using Ruby to explain their concepts because Ruby looked like pseudocode

42:36.800 --> 42:39.680
Whether you were programming in C or Java or PHP

42:40.320 --> 42:44.080
All three constituencies could understand Ruby because it basically just reads language

42:44.800 --> 42:48.720
So these guys were using Ruby to describe the concepts and first of all

42:49.120 --> 42:52.720
I would read these articles for just the concepts they were explaining and

42:53.680 --> 42:57.600
I'd be like, what is this program language? I mean, I like the concept you're explaining

42:57.600 --> 42:59.600
But I also want to see the program language

43:00.800 --> 43:03.520
Why haven't I heard of this? So I started looking into Ruby

43:04.480 --> 43:09.200
And I realized at that time Ruby might not be known by anyone

43:09.200 --> 43:11.200
But it's actually been around for a long time

43:11.200 --> 43:16.800
Matt's the Japanese creative Ruby had started working on Ruby back in 93

43:17.360 --> 43:19.280
Before the internet was even a thing

43:20.000 --> 43:24.320
And here I am in 2003 10 years later

43:24.880 --> 43:31.520
Picking up what seems like this hidden gem that's just laying in obscurity and plain sight

43:32.240 --> 43:35.200
But Dave Thomas and Martin Fowler I think

43:36.560 --> 43:39.840
successfully put me and a handful of other people on

43:40.480 --> 43:46.560
The trail of a programming language that hadn't been used much in the West but could be

43:47.040 --> 43:48.800
So I picked up Ruby and I thought

43:49.680 --> 43:51.680
This is this is very different

43:52.640 --> 43:54.800
First of all, where are all the semicolons?

43:55.600 --> 44:00.480
I'd been programming in PHP and ASP and even done some Pascal

44:00.960 --> 44:03.680
Looked at some C there are semicolons everywhere

44:04.640 --> 44:07.520
And that was the first thing that struck me is where are the damn semicolons

44:08.320 --> 44:12.480
And I started thinking actually why do we have semicolons in programming

44:13.200 --> 44:17.760
They're to tell the interpreter that there's a new line of instructions

44:18.560 --> 44:21.520
But I don't need him as a human. How? Oh

44:22.400 --> 44:25.760
Someone is looking out for the human here not for the machine

44:26.480 --> 44:28.800
So that really got me interested and then

44:29.680 --> 44:32.160
I thought to myself. Do you know what? I know PHP quite well

44:32.400 --> 44:37.840
I'm not an amazing programmer. I haven't been working in programming for all that long

44:39.200 --> 44:42.320
But maybe I can figure it out. I'm going to give myself two weeks

44:42.880 --> 44:46.400
I'm going to write a proof of concept where I talked to a database

44:47.120 --> 44:53.280
I pulled some records. I format them a bit and I display them on an HTML page. Can I figure that out in a couple weeks?

44:54.560 --> 44:57.440
It took about one weekend and I was completely

44:58.160 --> 45:00.400
Mesmerized. I was completely

45:01.120 --> 45:02.880
mind-blown

45:02.880 --> 45:04.880
because ruby

45:05.440 --> 45:09.600
Was made from my brain like a perfect tailored glove

45:10.560 --> 45:15.200
By someone I'd never met like how is this even possible? We should say maybe

45:15.920 --> 45:18.560
Like paint the picture of the certain qualities that ruby has

45:19.120 --> 45:22.720
Maybe even compared to PHP. We should also say that there's a ridiculous

45:23.440 --> 45:30.240
Thing that I'm used to that if you get about that there's dollar signs everywhere. Yes, I mean that there's line noise

45:30.640 --> 45:34.800
That line noise line noise. That's such a beautiful phrase

45:35.360 --> 45:40.080
Yeah, so there's all this things that look like programs and with ruby

45:40.320 --> 45:42.480
I mean, there's some similarities and Python there

45:43.360 --> 45:48.560
It just looks kind of like natural language. You can read it normally. Here's a while loop that does a

45:49.360 --> 45:53.040
Five iterations you can literally type the number five

45:53.920 --> 45:57.280
Dot now. I'm calling a method under number five by the way

45:57.280 --> 46:00.720
That's one of the beautiful aspects of ruby that primitives

46:01.280 --> 46:05.760
Like integers or also objects and you can call five dot

46:07.040 --> 46:09.040
times

46:09.120 --> 46:11.520
Start brackets now you're iterating over

46:12.160 --> 46:15.920
The code in that bracket five times that's it. Okay. That's nice

46:16.640 --> 46:23.280
That's not just nice. That's exceptional. There's literally no other programming language that I know of that has managed to boil away

46:23.440 --> 46:32.320
The line noise that almost every other programming language would inject into a five-time iteration over block code to that extent

46:32.640 --> 46:36.800
That's a really nice. Oh, thank you for giving that example. That's a beautiful example

46:37.600 --> 46:42.000
Wow, I don't think I know a programming language that does that. That's really nice ruby is full of that

46:42.720 --> 46:47.360
And there's so let me dive into a couple of examples because I really think it helps paint the picture and

46:47.840 --> 46:51.600
Let me preface this by saying I actually I like the ethos of Python

46:51.680 --> 46:56.160
I think the ruby and the python community share a lot of similarities

46:56.560 --> 47:00.960
They're both dynamic interpretive languages. They're both focused on

47:02.240 --> 47:05.360
immediacy and productivity and ease of use in a bunch of ways

47:05.440 --> 47:10.880
But then there are also very different in many other ways and one of the one ways they're very different this aesthetically

47:11.840 --> 47:17.840
Python to me, I hope I don't offend people too much. I've said this before. It's just it's ugly

47:18.400 --> 47:21.600
And it's ugly at it in its base because it's full of

47:22.160 --> 47:23.680
superfluous

47:23.680 --> 47:27.120
Instructions that are necessary for legacy reasons

47:28.320 --> 47:31.360
Of when Guido made Python back in 87

47:32.480 --> 47:38.080
That are still here in 2025 and my brain can't cope with that. Let me give you a basic example

47:38.640 --> 47:45.040
When you make a class in Python the initialize a method the starting method is deaf. Okay, fair enough

47:45.040 --> 47:48.000
That's actually the same as ruby def definition of a method

47:48.960 --> 47:50.960
Then it is underscore

47:51.680 --> 47:52.880
Not one

47:52.880 --> 47:55.760
underscore two in it

47:56.960 --> 47:59.120
underscore underscore

47:59.120 --> 48:00.880
parentheses start

48:00.880 --> 48:01.920
Self

48:01.920 --> 48:04.880
comma and then the first argument. Yeah, the whole self thing. Yeah

48:05.840 --> 48:09.040
I look at that and go. I'm sorry. I'm out. I can't do it

48:10.320 --> 48:14.880
It's just it's everything about it. Offense my sensibilities to the core here

48:14.880 --> 48:22.400
You have the most important method that all new objects or classes have to implement and it is one of the most

48:22.800 --> 48:26.640
aesthetically offensive ways of typing initialize that I've ever seen anywhere

48:27.520 --> 48:30.480
And you guys are okay with this. Yeah, you're making me you know where

48:31.040 --> 48:34.880
You're like talking about my marriage or something like this and I'm not realizing

48:34.880 --> 48:38.480
I've been in a toxic relationship all along. Yeah, I just get used to it

48:39.440 --> 48:44.000
That to me by the way was the magic of ruby it opened my eyes to how beautiful

48:44.320 --> 48:49.680
Programs could be I didn't know I'd been working at SP. I'd been working at PHP

48:49.840 --> 48:57.280
I didn't even have the concept that aesthetics beautiful code was something we could optimize for that something

48:57.280 --> 49:02.720
We could pursue and even more than that that we could pursue it above other objectives

49:03.280 --> 49:08.240
That ruby is as beautiful as it is is not an accident and it's not easy

49:08.480 --> 49:13.760
Ruby itself is implemented and see it's very difficult to parse ruby code

49:14.160 --> 49:18.480
Because ruby is written for humans and humans are messy creatures

49:19.040 --> 49:22.960
They like things in just the right way. I can't fully explain

49:23.520 --> 49:27.360
Why the underscore underscore in it underscore underscore make me

49:28.080 --> 49:36.240
Repulse but it does and when I look at the ruby alternative. It's really instructive. So it's death same part df

49:36.960 --> 49:38.400
space

49:38.400 --> 49:40.000
Initialize

49:40.000 --> 49:43.360
parentheses not even parentheses if you don't need to call it within the arguments

49:43.360 --> 49:48.880
There's not even a parentheses that in itself is actually also a major part if the human doesn't need the additional characters

49:48.880 --> 49:53.440
We're not just going to put them in because it be nicer to parse for the computer

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
We're going to get rid of the semicolons. We're going to get rid of the parentheses. We're going to get rid of

49:59.280 --> 50:05.520
The underscores. We're going to get rid of all that ugly and is all the line noise and boil it down to its pure essentials

50:06.800 --> 50:09.040
And at the same time, we're not going to abbreviate

50:09.760 --> 50:13.760
This is a key difference in the aesthetics between ruby and python as well

50:14.480 --> 50:19.120
In it is short of type it's only five characters initialize is a lot longer

50:19.200 --> 50:22.720
But it looks a lot better and you don't type it very often

50:22.880 --> 50:27.840
So you should look at something pretty if you don't have to do it all the time. It's okay that it's long

50:29.040 --> 50:35.680
Those kinds of aesthetic evaluations are rife all over the ruby language, but let me give you an even better example

50:36.880 --> 50:43.360
The if conditional that's the bedrock of all programming languages. They have the if conditional

50:43.920 --> 50:50.960
If you take most programming languages, they'll have if that's basically the same in almost every language space start parentheses

50:51.120 --> 50:53.600
We all do that and then you have

50:55.200 --> 50:59.360
Perhaps let's say you're calling a object called user

51:00.880 --> 51:07.600
Dot is admin close parentheses close parentheses start brackets

51:08.560 --> 51:12.720
And here's what we're going to do if the user's an admin right that would be a normal programming language

51:13.280 --> 51:15.040
Ruby doesn't do it like that

51:15.040 --> 51:18.320
Ruby boils almost all of it away. We start with the if okay, that's the same

51:19.040 --> 51:26.320
No parentheses necessary because there's no ambiguity for the human to distinguish that the next part is

51:26.800 --> 51:31.520
Just a single statement. So you do if space user dot

51:32.800 --> 51:35.280
admin question mark

51:35.440 --> 51:37.440
Ha

51:37.520 --> 51:45.840
Yeah, no open brackets. No parentheses. No nothing next open line. Here's your conditional that

51:47.120 --> 51:49.840
Question mark means nothing to the computer

51:50.960 --> 51:54.800
But it meets something to the human Ruby put in the

51:55.520 --> 51:58.000
predicate method style

51:58.080 --> 52:01.680
purely as a communication tool between humans

52:02.480 --> 52:08.080
It's actually more work for the interpreter to be able to see that this question market is here

52:08.240 --> 52:15.280
Why is this question mark in here because it just reads so nicely if user admin question mark

52:15.440 --> 52:19.040
That's a very human phrase, but it gets better

52:20.240 --> 52:23.840
You can turn this around you can have your

52:24.480 --> 52:29.200
Statement you want to execute before the conditional you can do user dot

52:29.760 --> 52:32.720
Upgrade you say you're calling an upgrade method on a user

52:33.920 --> 52:41.040
Space if space user dot admin question mark we do the thing if the thing is true

52:41.280 --> 52:45.120
Instead of saying if the thing is true do the thing but it gets even better

52:45.360 --> 52:48.800
This is why I love this example with the conditional because you can keep diving into it. So

52:49.600 --> 52:51.600
Let's flip it around

52:51.600 --> 52:54.080
user dot down great if

52:55.280 --> 52:56.800
exclamation point not

52:57.760 --> 53:01.200
user dot admin right that'd be a typical way of writing it

53:02.000 --> 53:03.360
Ruby goes

53:03.360 --> 53:05.840
That exclamation point is light noise

53:05.840 --> 53:11.600
Why do we have if and then an exclamation point that's ugly we could do user dot down great

53:12.240 --> 53:14.240
unless

53:14.240 --> 53:16.640
user admin question mark

53:17.680 --> 53:20.800
That to me is an encapsulation of the incredible

53:21.680 --> 53:23.040
beauty

53:23.040 --> 53:26.160
That Ruby affords the programmer through ambiguity

53:27.120 --> 53:33.200
That is only to serve the human reader and writer all of these statements. We've just discussed

53:33.280 --> 53:36.960
They're the same for the computer. It'll combine down to the same C code

53:37.040 --> 53:39.440
They'll compile down to the same assembly code

53:39.440 --> 53:43.840
It makes no difference whatsoever. In fact, it just makes it harder to write an interpreter

53:44.160 --> 53:50.800
But for the human who gets to choose whether the statement comes before the conditional or the predicate method has

53:51.440 --> 53:54.880
It's just incredible. It reads like poetry at some point

53:55.120 --> 53:59.040
It's it's also incredible that you know one language designer is creating that

53:59.920 --> 54:05.920
You know wheat of an awesome also. It's like one person gets to make these extremely difficult decision because

54:06.480 --> 54:09.600
It's you have to think about how does that all get parsed

54:10.720 --> 54:17.200
And you have to think about the thousands if it's a popular language of millions of people that end up using this

54:17.680 --> 54:22.880
And what they feel what that question mark on the for the if statement what does that feel like

54:23.600 --> 54:28.800
For that's what matt's thought about because he started his entire mission off a different premise

54:29.280 --> 54:34.000
Then almost every programming language designer that I'd heard at least articulate the vision

54:34.480 --> 54:39.920
That his number one goal was programmer happiness that his number one goal was the

54:41.200 --> 54:46.800
affordances that would allow programmers to articulate code in ways that not just

54:47.680 --> 54:49.680
executed correctly

54:50.240 --> 54:54.560
But we're a joy to write and we're a joy to read and that

54:55.440 --> 54:58.160
vision is based on a fundamentally different

54:59.040 --> 55:01.040
view of humanity

55:01.120 --> 55:08.000
There's no greater contrast between matt's and James Gosling the designer of Java. I once listened to

55:08.960 --> 55:12.640
James talk about the design of Java. Why was it the way it was?

55:12.800 --> 55:16.720
Why was it so rigid and he was very blunt about it which by the way

55:16.800 --> 55:20.640
Really appreciate and I think Gosling's done a tremendous job with Java

55:20.720 --> 55:26.480
But his view of humanity's rather dark his view of humanity was programmers

55:27.200 --> 55:29.760
At the average or stupid creatures

55:30.960 --> 55:32.960
They cannot be trusted

55:33.680 --> 55:37.600
With sophisticated programming languages because they're going to shoot their

55:38.080 --> 55:42.960
Foot off or their hand off and that would be kind of inconvenient to the

55:43.440 --> 55:51.120
Regional development office of a mid-tier insurance company writing code that has to last for 20 years

55:52.560 --> 55:53.520
Now

55:53.520 --> 56:01.040
It's actually a very Thomas Saul view of constrained capacity in humans that I've come to appreciate much later in life

56:01.040 --> 56:08.240
But it's also a very depressing view of programmers that there are just certain programmers who are too dumb to appreciate

56:08.880 --> 56:13.920
Code poetry. They're too ignorant to learn how to write it well

56:14.160 --> 56:18.960
We need to give them a sandbox where they just won't hurt themselves too much

56:20.320 --> 56:25.120
matt's when the complete opposite direction he believes in humanity

56:25.440 --> 56:27.440
He believes in the unlimited

56:27.600 --> 56:32.240
capacity of programmers to learn and become better so much so

56:33.520 --> 56:35.840
That he's willing to put the

56:35.840 --> 56:41.840
Stranger at his own level. This is the second part. I truly appreciate about Ruby

56:42.400 --> 56:46.000
Ruby allows you to extend base classes

56:46.720 --> 56:50.400
You know how we just talked about five dot times is a way to iterate over

56:51.840 --> 56:55.280
A statement five times that five is obviously a base class

56:56.080 --> 57:00.160
It's a number. Do you know what you can add your own methods to that

57:01.280 --> 57:02.480
I did

57:02.480 --> 57:10.400
extensively in Rails we have something called active support which is essentially my dialect of Ruby for programming web applications

57:11.600 --> 57:14.560
And I'll give you one example. I've added a method called

57:15.520 --> 57:19.680
Days to the number. So if you do five dot days

57:20.480 --> 57:27.440
You get five days in seconds because seconds is the way we set cash exploration times and other things like that

57:27.440 --> 57:29.280
So you can say

57:29.280 --> 57:36.000
Cash expires in five dot days and you're gonna get whatever five times

57:36.880 --> 57:40.160
24 times 60 times 60 years or whatever the

57:40.720 --> 57:45.440
Math is right very humanly readable in a normal programming language you would type out

57:46.160 --> 57:50.720
The seconds and then you would have a little comment above it saying this represent five days

57:51.280 --> 57:55.920
In Ruby you get to write five days, but even better than that matt's didn't come up with it

57:56.560 --> 58:01.200
Matt's didn't need the five days. I needed that because I needed to expire cashess

58:01.600 --> 58:07.600
I was allowed by matt's to extend his story with my own chapters

58:08.720 --> 58:16.080
Unequal footing such that a reader of Ruby could not tell the difference between the code Matt's wrote and the code that I wrote

58:16.480 --> 58:24.160
He trusted me as a complete stranger from Denmark who would never met to mess with his beautiful story

58:25.120 --> 58:31.120
That level of trust is essentially unheard of. I know there are other program languages that allow things with macros and so forth

58:31.440 --> 58:41.120
But none do it in a way like Ruby does it none does it with an articulated vision of humanity a trust in humanity like matt's does

58:42.800 --> 58:51.040
That is the opposite end of the spectrum of Java. Yeah, I mean for my aesthetic sensibilities just the way you describe five dot days

58:52.000 --> 58:56.080
That's really pleasant to me like I could see myself sitting alone

58:57.360 --> 59:04.080
Sleep deprived and just writing that it's just an easy thing you can write it in a long way with a comment

59:04.080 --> 59:06.080
You can you can write a multiple lines you could do

59:06.800 --> 59:11.680
And now with AI, I'm sure it's going to generate a correct but there's something really pleasant about the simplicity of that

59:11.680 --> 59:15.600
I'm not sure what that is but you're right. There is a good feeling there

59:16.640 --> 59:20.480
And I'm sure we'll talk about happiness from all kinds of philosophical angles

59:20.480 --> 59:22.160
But you know

59:22.960 --> 59:28.240
That is what happiness is made up that little exactly a good feeling there

59:28.560 --> 59:31.680
It's the good feeling that come out of a concept

59:32.400 --> 59:38.960
Compressed to its pure essence. There's nothing you can take away from that statement. That's a purpose

59:38.960 --> 59:42.160
But see I also want to push back a little bit because it's not

59:43.120 --> 59:45.520
Because I also a program at Pearl a bunch

59:46.320 --> 59:47.840
But just just to be cool

59:49.040 --> 59:51.040
So like it's not all about compression

59:51.520 --> 59:53.360
No, you can compress it too far

59:53.360 --> 59:56.480
Pearl Gulf is a thing where you can turn

59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.640
Programs into something that's unreadable for humans. Now the great thing about Pearl was that it came out before Ruby

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.200
Matt's was a great student of

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:06.880
Wall

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.640
Was a great student of pearl was a great student of python and small talk and lisp

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.520
He took inspiration from all of these prior attempts at creating good programming languages

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.240
And really edited down the very best bits into this

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:29.280
So he was able to learn from his lessons but what I found incredible about Ruby is that here we are 2025

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.360
Ruby has been worked on for over 30 years and essentially the first draft

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.960
Is 90% of what we're still using there was almost a sense of divine inspiration

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.080
possible in wherever Matt's was writing that initial version of Ruby that

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.440
Transcended time to such a degree that no one has still even begun to reach it

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.200
This is the other thing I was fine fascinating

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.720
I

01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:00.080
Generally believe in the efficient market theory that if someone comes up with a better mouse trap or better idea

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:06.640
Others will eventually copy them to such an extent that perhaps the original mouse trap is no longer even remembered

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.920
No one has been able to copy that essence of Ruby

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.080
They borrowed elements and that's totally fine, but Ruby still stands

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:22.000
taller than everyone else on these metrics on this trust in humanity and programmers and we should also say like

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.000
You know

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.320
Maybe the perfect programming language is that that metric and then there's the successful language and those are often different

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.320
There's something wonderful about the brand-in-ike story of creating javascript. Yes

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.080
Of

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.160
There's something truly beautiful

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.640
About the way javascript took over the world

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:49.360
I've recently got to visit the Amazon jungle and just one of my favorite things to do is just to wash the ants take over anything

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.120
Everything and it's just like it's a nice distributed system

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.400
It's a messy thing that doesn't seem to be order, but it just works and the machinery of it

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:05.120
Worse this better. I mean, that's actually the name of a pattern for in in suffer development and other ways of how do

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:13.440
Is the pattern of linux linux was quantifiably worse than I think it was minics at the time other ways of it that were more

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.600
Cathedral

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.600
less bizarre and

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.840
It's still one that there's something to it that the imperfections

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.280
Can help something go forward. It's actually a trick. I've

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.920
Studied to the degree that I now incorporated in almost all open source that I do

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.840
I make sure that when I release the first version of any new thing I work on

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.840
It's a little broken

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:42.960
It's a little busted in ways that invite people to come in and help me because there's no easier way to get the

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.760
collaboration of other programmers

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.760
Then to put something out that they know how to fix and improve. Yeah, that's awesome

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.840
Ruby is somehow

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.120
Or was at least a little bit different in that regard not in all regards

01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.000
Matt's got the ethos of the language the design of language just right

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.040
But the first versions of ruby were terribly slow

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.360
it's taken

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.200
I mean hundreds of

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.160
Manures to get ruby to be both this beautiful yet also

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:20.400
highly efficient and really fast and we should say that the thing that made you fall in love with this particular programming language is meta programming

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:26.560
Yes, so that takes all of these elements. We've just talked about and turned them up to 11

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:33.760
I'll explain meta programming real soon meta programming is essentially a version of the five dot days

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.120
You get to add keywords to the language

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.000
Active record is the part of rails that communicates with the database

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.520
This is a system where every

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:53.760
Table in the database is represented by a class. So if we take the user example again. You do class user

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.280
um

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.960
The sends from active record base

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:04.160
And then the first line you can write is this. I want my users to have many posts or have many comments

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.800
Let's do that. We're making some system where users can make comments

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.160
The very next line is has underscore many space

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.040
colon comments

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:21.280
Now you've set up a dependency between users and comments that will give you a whole host of

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:29.680
Access and factory methods for users to be able to own comments to create comments to update comments in that line alone

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.520
Has many

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.640
Looks like a keyword. It looks like it's part of the Ruby language. That's meta programming when

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.760
Rails is able to add these elements to

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:46.640
How you define a class and then that runs code that adds a bunch of methods to the user class

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.120
That's meta programming and when meta programming is used in this way

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.680
We call it domain specific languages

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:59.520
You take a generic language like Ruby and you tailor it to a certain domain like describing

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.400
Relationships in the database at a object level

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.480
and

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.480
This is one of those early examples where you can do

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.040
user has many comments

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:16.800
Belongs underscore two space colon account now you've set up a

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.480
one-to-one relationship before we had I want to many relationship

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.920
Rails is rife with all this kind of domain-specific languages were

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.520
At sometimes it doesn't even look like Ruby you can't identify Ruby keywords

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.320
You can just identify what looks like

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:39.760
Keywords in its own programming language now again. I know that lisp and others

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:47.040
Also do this stuff. They just do it with the maximum amount of line noise that can ever be crammed into a

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:55.840
Programming language and Ruby does it at a level where you cannot tell my meta programming from mattes keywords and with zero line noise

01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:01.280
Yeah, I should say that my first love was lisp. So there's a slow tear that you can't see

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.560
I've actually never written any real lisp myself. Well, how can you judge it so harshly then

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:13.520
Because I have two eyes and I can look at code and my aesthetic sensibilities forbid me to even go much further

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:20.000
Which is a limitation? I know I should actually dive into lisp because I found that I've learned a lot just diving into

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.240
Maybe I'm insulting lisp again here, but the past of programming languages with small talk for example

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.560
I think small talk is a

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.560
incredible

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.840
Experiment that also worked but isn't suitable for today's programming environments

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:42.800
I love that we're talking about Ruby so much and what beautiful code is what a beautiful programming language is so one of the things

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.280
That is I think implied maybe you made explicit in your

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.760
Descriptions there is that Ruby is dynamic typing versus strict typing and you have been

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.640
Not just saying that it's a nice thing

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:04.000
But that you will defend dynamic typing to the death like that freedom is a powerful freedom to preserve

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.880
It's the essence of what makes Ruby Ruby

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.360
This is why I don't fully understand when people call for Ruby to add static typing because to me

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:21.440
It's the bedrock of what this is why would you want to turn one of the most beautiful languages into something far uglier

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.080
This is one of my primary objections to

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:30.080
Static typing. It's not just that it limits you in certain ways. It makes meta programming harder

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.880
I write a bunch of meta programming. I've seen what it takes to do meta programming type script

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.960
I was actually one of the things that just

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:43.600
Really sent me on a tear of getting meta or getting type script out of some of the projects that I'm involved with we pulled type script out of

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:51.520
Turbo one of the front end frameworks that we have because I tried to write the meta programming in type script

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.480
And I was just infuriated. I don't want that experience

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.520
But I also don't want it from an aesthetic point of view

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:04.880
I hate repetition. We've just talked about how much I love that Ruby boils all of these expressions down to its

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:12.400
Essence you can't remove one dot you can't remove one character without losing something this moment

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:17.440
You go for static typing that you declare at least. I know there are ways to do implied typing and so forth

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.520
But let's just take the stereotypical case of the java example for example

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.320
capital you

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:31.920
User I'm declaring the type of the variable lower case user. I'm now naming my variable equals

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:36.800
uppercase user or new uppercase user. I've repeated user three times

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.760
I don't have time for this

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.160
I don't have sensibilities for this. I don't want my Ruby

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:53.120
Polluted with this now. I understand all the arguments for why people like static typing when the primary arguments is that it makes tooling easier

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.560
It makes it easier to do auto complete in editors for example

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:03.120
It makes it easier to find certain kinds of bugs because maybe you're calling methods that don't exist

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.720
On an object and the editor can actually catch that bug before you even run it

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.120
I don't care

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:16.880
First of all, I don't write code with tools. I write them with text editors

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.200
I chisel them out of the screen with my bare hands

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.560
I don't auto complete and this is why I love Ruby so much and this is why I continue to

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.560
Be in love with the text editor rather than the IDE

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.880
I don't want an IDE

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:39.760
I want my fingers to have to individually type out every element of it because it will force me

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.720
To stay in the world where Ruby is beautiful because as soon as it gets easy to type a lot of boilerplate

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.120
Well, guess what you can have a lot of boilerplate every single language

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:57.760
Basically that has great tooling support has a much higher tolerance for boilerplate because the thinking is

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.680
Well, you're not typing it anyway. You're just auto completing it. I don't want that at all. I want something where

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.360
The fabric I'm working in it's just a text file. There's nothing else to it

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:10.960
so

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.560
These things play together. There's the aesthetic part. There's the tooling part

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.400
There's the meta programming part. There's the fact that Ruby's

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.960
Ethos of duck typing. I don't know if you've heard that term before

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.680
It's essentially not about can I call this method if a

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:34.000
Object is of a certain class. It is can I call this method if the method response?

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:39.520
It's very out of small talk in that regard. You don't actually check of whether that

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:47.920
Class has the method which allows you to dynamically add methods at runtime and do all sorts of really interesting things that underpin

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.320
All the beautiful meta programming that we do in Ruby. I don't want to lose any of that

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.160
And I don't care for the benefits one of the benefits

01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.960
I've seen touted over and over again is that it's much easier to write correct software

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.440
You're gonna have fewer bugs. You're gonna have

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.480
Less null pointer exceptions you're gonna have unless all this stuff. Yeah, I don't have any of that

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.960
It's just not something that occurs in my standard mode of aberration

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.360
I'm not saying I don't have bugs. Of course I do

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.720
But I catch those bugs with unit testing with integration testing those are the kinds of

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.200
precautions that will catch logical bugs things that compile but are wrong

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.480
Along with the uncapulable stuff

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:36.240
So I've never been drawn into this world and part of it is because I work on a certain class of systems

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.280
I fully accept that if you're writing systems that have

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.880
510 50 million lines of code with

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.160
hundreds

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.360
Thousands or tens of thousands of programmers. I fully accept that you need different methods

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:56.160
What I object to is the idea that what's right for a code base of 10 million lines of code with a hundred thousand

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.400
Programmers working on it is also the same thing

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.280
I should be using in my bedroom to create base camp because I'm just a single individual

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.760
That's complete nonsense in the real world

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:09.280
We would know that that makes no sense at all that you don't

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.760
I don't know you sure pagani to go pick up groceries at Costco

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.600
It's a bad vehicle for that. It just doesn't have the space. You don't want to muddy the beautiful seats

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600
You don't want to do any of those things. We know

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.120
that

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.440
Certain things that are very good in certain domains don't apply to all in programming languages

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.840
It seems like we forget that now to be fair

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.160
I also had a little bit perhaps of a repetition for getting that when I first learned ruby

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.040
I was so head over heels in love with this program language that I almost found it

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.960
Unconceivable that anyone would choose any other program language at all to write web applications

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:53.920
And I kind of engaged the evangelism of ruby and rails in that spirit as a crusade as I just need to teach you the gospel

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:59.440
I just need to show you this conditional code that we just talked about and you will convert at the

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.920
point of a sharp argument now

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:07.600
I learned that's not the way and part of the reason it's not the way is the programmers think differently our brains

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:15.440
Are configured differently my brain is configured perfectly for ruby perfectly for a dynamically

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:21.520
duct-typed language that I can chisel code out of a text editor with

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.200
and other people need the security of

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:29.200
An IDE they want the security of

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:33.040
Classes that won't compile unless you call the methods on it

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.400
I have come to accept that but most programmers don't they're still stuck in essentially

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:45.200
I like static typing therefore static typing is the only way to create reliable correct systems

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.680
Which is just such a mind-blowing

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.240
To be blunt idiotic thing to say in the face of evidence

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.880
Mountains of evidence to the contrary

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.920
This is one of the reasons I'm so in love with Shopify as the

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.760
flagship

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.760
Application for ruby and rails

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:10.720
Shopify exists at a scale that most programmers will never touch on black friday

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.880
I think Shopify did one million requests per second

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:22.560
That's not one million requests of images. That's of dynamic requests that are funneling through the pipeline of commerce

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:28.640
I mean Shopify runs something like 30% of all e-commerce stores on the damn internet

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:36.000
A huge portion of all commerce and total runs through Shopify and that runs on ruby and rails so

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.400
Ruby and rails is able to scale up to that level without using

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.520
Static typing in all of what it does now. I know they've done certain experiments in certain ways

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.120
Because they are hitting some of the limits that you will hit with dynamic typing

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.680
And some of those limits you hit with dynamic typing are actually by the way

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.160
Just limits you hit when you write five million lines of code

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.480
I think the Shopify monolith is about five million lines of code at that scale

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.280
Everything breaks because you're at the frontier of what humans are capable of doing with programming languages

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:15.760
The difference in part is that ruby is such a succinct language that those five million if they'd been written in

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.560
Let's just say go or Java would have been 50 or 25 now

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.200
That might have alleviated some of the problems that you have when you work on huge systems with many programmers

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.600
But it certainly would also have compounded them trying to understand 25 million lines of code

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.880
So the thing does scale that's the persistent myth that it doesn't scale

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.520
Shopify and others but Shopify things a great example

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:47.920
By the way, I love Shopify and I love Toby you got to be on. Yeah, sure this morning for sure

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.200
He's a brilliant. I got to hang out with him and then does it somewhere forget in Utah. He's just a brilliant human

01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:00.080
And and Shopify Shopify.com slash lux has been supporting this podcast for the longest time

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.280
I don't think actually Toby knows that they sponsor this podcast and it is a big company, right?

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.040
It's a huge company. I think just under 10,000 employees market cap of 120 billion

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.840
GMV of a quarter of a trillion every quarter and he's involved with the details

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.800
He has very much so funny story about Toby

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.640
Toby was on the rails core team back in the mid 2000s

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:32.400
Toby himself wrote active merchant which is one of the frameworks for creating shops

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.960
He wrote the liquid templating language that Shopify still uses to this day

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:44.000
He has a huge list of contributions to the rails ecosystem and he's the CEO of the company

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.360
I think it's just

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.000
It's very inspiring to me because it's such at the opposite end of what I like to do

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I like to chisel code with my own hands most of the day

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.240
He runs a company of almost 10,000 people that is literally

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:05.440
Like world commerce depends on it a level of criticality. I can't even begin to understand

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.920
And yet we can see eye to eye on so many of these fundamental questions in computer science and program development

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.800
That is a

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:23.680
Dynamic range to be able to encompass rails being a great tool for the one developer who's just starting out with an idea

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:29.840
Who don't even fully know everything who is right at the level where PHP would have been a good fit in those late 90s

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.960
Because yeah, I can probably upload something to an FTP server and so on

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.280
Rails does have more complexity than that

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:39.840
But it also has so much longer runway the runway goes all the way to got them Shopify

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:46.400
That is about the most convincing argument I can make for sort of dynamic range that we can do a lot of it and

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.800
Even having said that

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.800
Shopify is the outlier of course

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:55.840
I don't think about Shopify as the primary target when I write rails

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.040
I think of the single developer actually I do think about Shopify

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.080
But I don't think about Shopify now. I think of Shopify when Toby was writing snow devil

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.720
Which was the first e-commerce store to sell snowboards that he created that was the pre

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.080
Shopify Shopify he created all by himself and that was possible because

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.440
Ruby and Rails isn't just about beautiful code. It's just as much about productivity

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:26.800
It's just as much about the impact and an individual programmer is able to have that they can build system where they can keep the whole thing in their head

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:33.280
And be able to move it forward such that you can go from one developer sitting and working on something

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.960
And that something is Shopify and turned into what it is today

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.960
When we talk about programming languages and we compare them we often compare them at a very late stage

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:49.200
Like what is the better programming language for let's say Twitter in 2009 when it's already a huge success

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.600
Twitter was started on Ruby and Rails

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.080
They then hit some scaling problems. It was a big debacle at the time. They end up

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.760
Then I think writing it in some other language

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:06.480
Which by the way, I think is the best advertisement ever for Ruby and Rails because nothing fucking happened for 10 years after

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.840
They switched over right essentially zero innovation

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:20.160
Some of that was because they were doing a long conversion and all of the early success in part came because they had the agility quickly change and adopt and so forth

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:26.480
That's what startups needs. That's what Shopify needed. That's what Twitter needed. That's what everyone needs and that's

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.640
The number one priority for Ruby and Rails to make sure that we don't lose that because what happens so often when

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:38.640
Development tools and programming language are driven by huge companies is that they mirror their org chart

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:46.800
React and everything else needed to use that is in some ways a reflection of how meta builds

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.640
Facebook because of course it is because of course it's a distraction of that

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.640
I'm not saying react isn't a great tool and that can't be used by smaller teams. Of course it can

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.960
But it's born in a very different context than something like Ruby and Rails

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:05.120
Let me say it's the smallest side because I think we might return to Shopify and celebrate it often

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.520
just sort of personal note

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:13.680
This particular podcast has way more sponsors and sponsors that want to be sponsors

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.400
That I can possibly ever have and it's really really important for me

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.480
To not give a shit and to be able to celebrate

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:26.240
People like I celebrate people I celebrate companies

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:31.120
And it has I don't care that they're sponsoring. I really don't care

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:36.800
I just want to make that very explicit because we're going to continue saying positive things about Shopify

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.400
I don't care stop sponsoring. It doesn't really matter to me

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:46.240
But yeah, I just want to make that explicit so but to linger on the scaling thing with the Twitter and the Shopify

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.040
Can you just explain to me?

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.080
What Shopify is doing with the with the jet?

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.600
What did they have to try to do to scale this?

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.720
Thing because that's kind of an incredible story, right?

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.080
Yeah, so one of the great contributions that Shopify has made to the entire Ruby ecosystem

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.480
Not just Rails, but in particular Rails is

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:13.760
Why jit so why jit is their compiler for for Ruby that just makes everything a lot more efficient and at

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.680
Shopify scale

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:23.040
Eaking out even a five ten percent improvement in rubies overhead and execution time is a huge deal

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.320
Now Shopify didn't need why jit

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:34.640
Shopify was already running on the initial version of Ruby that was I think 10 times slower than what we have today

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:41.200
If you look back upon the Ruby 186 that Topi probably started on just as I started on

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.200
And that was enough to propel Shopify to the scale that it has today

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.840
A lot of the scaling

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.480
Conversation in is lost in a failure to distinguish two things

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.920
Scale is kind of one package we talk about when there are really multiple packages inside of it one

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:05.360
Is runtime performance latency? How fast can you execute a single request?

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.440
Can it happen fast enough that the user will

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:16.080
Not notice if your Rails request takes a second and a half to execute the user's gonna notice your app is gonna feel slow and sluggish

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:21.760
You have to get that response time down below let's say at least 300 milliseconds

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.560
I like to target a hundred milliseconds as my latency. That's kind of performance

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.240
How much performance of that kind of latency can you squeeze out of a single CPU core?

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.920
That tells you something about what the price of a single request will be

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.400
But then whether you can

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:42.720
Deal with one million requests a second like Shopify is doing right now

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:50.080
If you have one box that can do a thousand requests a second you just need xboxes to get up to a million

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.440
And what you'll actually find is that when it comes to programming languages

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.640
They're all the same in this way. They all scale

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:05.440
Largely beautifully horizontally you just add more boxes the hard parts of scaling a Shopify is typically not

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.520
The program language is the database and that's actually one of the

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.280
um

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:20.560
Challenges the Shopify has now is how do you deal with my sequel at the scale that they're operating at when do you need to move to other

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:28.080
Databases to get worldwide performance all of these things the questions about scaling Ruby are economic questions

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.640
If we're spending so and so much on

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.280
Application servers if we can get just 5% more performance out of Ruby well

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.720
We could save 5% of those servers and that could filter down into the budget

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.880
Now that analysis concludes into basically one thing

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.480
Ruby is a luxury language

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:52.080
It's a luxury the highest luxury in my opinion. It is the

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:58.720
Coco Chanel a programming languages something that not everyone can afford and I mean this in the best possible way

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.480
There are some applications on the internet where each request

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:08.560
Has so little value you can't afford to use a luxurious language like Ruby

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.720
To program in it you simply have to slum it

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:19.440
With a C or a go or some other low-level language or rust talk about line noise there for a second thrift store of languages

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:24.160
Exactly where you need kind of just you need a very low level to do it

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.160
You can't afford to use a luxury language to you to to build it with

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.600
That's not true of Shopify. It was in true of base camp even back in 2004

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:42.320
It's not been true of 99% of all web applications ever created because the main cost component of 99% of web applications

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.720
It's not CPU course

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:51.680
It's wet course. It's human course. It's human capacity to understand and involve systems

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.840
It's their personal productivity. I did a calculation once when someone had for the 400th time

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.120
Said that oh if you switch from Ruby to some faster language you could save a bunch of money

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:08.800
And I calculated it out that at the time and I think the last time I did this calculation was almost a decade ago

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:14.880
We were spending about 15% of our operating budget on Ruby application servers

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.800
so

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.040
For me to improve my cost profile of the business

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.120
um

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.320
By seven percentage points. I'd have to pick something twice as fast

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:27.680
That's quite hard

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.280
Versus if Ruby and Ruby and Rails was even 10% more productive than something else

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.720
I would move the needle far more because making individual programmers more productive actually matters a lot more

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.880
This is why people are so excited about AI

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:48.480
This is why they're freaking out over the fact that a single programmer in silicon value makes 300 thousand dollars a year

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.160
Can now do the work of three or five at least in theory

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.200
I haven't actually seen that fully in practice, but let's just assume the theory is correct

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.920
If not now then in six months

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:05.680
That's a huge deal that matters so much more than whether you can squeeze a few more cycles out of the CPU

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.880
When it comes to these kinds of business applications if you're making

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.000
Unreal engine rendering stuff like Tim Sweeney you had on mm-hmm

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.880
Yeah, he needs to really sweat all those details the nanite engine can't run on Ruby

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.920
It's never going to it would not meant for that fine

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.440
These kinds of business applications absolutely can and

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:32.880
Everything that people are excited about AI for right now that extra capacity to just do more

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.480
That was why we were excited about Ruby back in the early 2000s

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:43.680
That was because I saw that we could even squeeze out a 10% improvement of the human programmer

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.720
We'd be able to do so much more for so much less probably argue about this

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.640
but

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:53.200
I really like working together with AI

01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.160
Collaborating with AI and I would argue that the kind of code you want AI to generate is human readable human interpretable

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.600
Yes, if it's generating pearl golf code

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.560
It's just it's not a collaboration

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:11.200
So it has to be speaking the human it's not just you're writing the prompts in English

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:17.280
You also want to read the responses in the human interpretable language I can Ruby right?

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.800
So it's it's actually it's beneficial for AI too because you kind of

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:25.280
Said that for you the sculptor the sort of the elitist

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:32.240
Coco Chanel sculptor you want to on your fancy keyboard to type every single letter yourself for your own fingers

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.240
but it's also

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.600
that

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.560
The benefit of Ruby also applies in one's that is written by AI and you're actually doing with your own fingers the editing

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.640
Yes, because you can interact with it because it's human interpretable

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.000
The paradigm I really love for this was something Elon actually said on one of your shows when you guys were talking about neural link

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.760
That neural link allows the bandwidth

01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:03.200
Between you and the machine to increase that language either spoken or written is very low bandwidth

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:09.520
If you are to calculate just how many bits we can exchange is we're sitting here. It's very slow

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.720
Ruby

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.440
Has a much higher bandwidth of communication

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.320
Revealed conveys so much more concept per

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.000
Character than most other programming language do

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.720
So when you are collaborating with AI you want really high bandwidth you wanted to be able to produce

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.360
Programs with you whether you're letting it write the code or not

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.200
that

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.440
Both of you can actually understand really quickly and that you can compress a

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:47.760
Grand comp or a grand concept a grand system into far fewer parts

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.840
That both of you can understand now. I actually love collaborating with AI too

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:57.120
I love chiseling my code and the way I use AI is in a separate window

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.360
I don't let it drive my code. I've tried that

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.400
I've tried the cursors and the wind serves and I don't enjoy that way of writing and one of the reasons

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:08.000
I don't enjoy that way of writing is I can literally feel

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.320
Competence draining out of my fingers like that

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.080
level of immediacy with the material

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:20.640
Disappears and the where I felt is the most was I did this

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.720
remix of Ubuntu called omacube when I switched to Linux and it's all written in bash

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.120
I'd never written any

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:34.720
Serious amount of code in bash before yeah, so he's using AI to collaborate to write a bunch of bash with me

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.400
Because I needed all this. I knew what I wanted. I could express it in Ruby

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.280
But I thought it was an interesting challenge to

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:45.360
Fildered through bash because what I was doing was setting up a Linux machine

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.640
That's basically what bash was designed for is a great constraint

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:57.360
But what I found myself doing was asking AI for the same way of expressing a conditional for example in bash over and over again

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.600
That by not typing it. I wasn't learning it. I was using it. I was getting

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.760
The expression I wanted but I wasn't learning it and I got a little scared

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:14.000
I got a little scared. Is this the end of learning and I no longer learning if I'm not typing and the way I

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.320
For me recast that was I don't want to give up on the AI

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.360
It is such a better experience as a programmer to look up API's to

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.920
Get a second opinion on something to do a draft

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:31.840
But I have to do it the typing myself because you learn with your fingers

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:36.240
If you're learning how to play the guitar you can watch as many YouTube videos as you want

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:43.760
You're not going to learn the guitar you have to put your fingers on the strings to actually learn the motions

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.160
And I think there is a parallel here to programming where programming has to be learned in part

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:56.640
By the actual typing. I'm just really this is this is fascinating listen part of my brain agrees with you 100% part doesn't

01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.200
I

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:04.960
Think AI should be in the loop of learning now current systems don't do that

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.240
But I think it's very possible for cursor to say

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.680
To basically force you to type certain things

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.880
So like if you set the mode of learning. I just I don't want to be this

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:24.080
Sort of give up on AI. I really I think I think vibe coding is a skill

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.080
So

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:30.480
For an experienced programmer is too easy to dismiss vibe coding as a thing

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:32.240
I wouldn't dismiss it

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.120
But I think you need to start building that skill

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:42.400
And start to figure out how do you prevent the competency from slipping away from your fingers and brain

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:47.120
Like how do you develop that skill in parallel to the other to the other skill?

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.640
I don't know I just it's I think it's a fascinating puzzle though

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:56.640
I know too many really strong programmers that just kind of avoid AI because it's currently a little too dumb

01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.760
Yes, it's a little too slow is actually my main problem

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:03.600
It's a little too dumb in some ways, but it's a little too slow in other ways when I use

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.040
Claude's code

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:13.600
The terminal version of a cloud which is actually my preferred way of using it. I just I get too impatient

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:19.120
It feels like I'm going back to a time where code had to compile and I had to go do something else

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.160
Abort some tea while the code is compiling while I've been working in Ruby for 20 years. I

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.680
Don't have compile weight in me anymore

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.840
So there's that aspect of it

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:34.000
But I think the more crucial aspect for me is I really care about the competence

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:39.760
And I've seen what happens to even great programmers the moment they put away the keyboard

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.840
Because even before AI this would happen as soon as people would get promoted

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:51.920
Most great programmers who work in large businesses stop writing code on a daily basis because they simply have too many meetings to attend to

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:56.080
They have too many other things to do and invariably they lose touch

01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:00.160
With programming that doesn't mean they forget everything

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:05.360
But if you don't have your fingers in the sauce the source

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.200
You are going to lose touch with it. There's just no other way

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.680
I don't want that because I enjoy it too much

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:16.400
This is not just about outcomes. This is what's crucial to understand

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:22.880
Programming for programmers who like to code is not just about the programs they get out of it

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.200
That may be the economic value

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:29.680
It's not the only human value the human values just much in the expression

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.000
When someone who sits down on a guitar and plays stairways to heaven

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.920
There's a perfect recording of that that will last in eternity

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.360
You can just put it on Spotify. You don't actually need to do it. The joy

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:46.240
Is to command the guitar yourself

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:51.200
The joy of the programmer of me as a programmer is to type the code myself

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.120
If I elevate myself if my promote myself out of programming

01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.240
I turn myself into a project manager a project manager of a murder of AI

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.240
Crows as I wrote the other day

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:05.440
I could have become a project manager my whole career

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.520
I could have become a project manager 20 years ago if I didn't care to write code myself

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.480
And I just wanted outcomes. That's how it got started in programming

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.080
I just wanted outcomes

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:18.960
Then I fell in love with programming and now I'd rather retire than give it up

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.480
Now that doesn't mean you can't have your cake in need to do

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:28.640
I've done some vibe coding where I didn't care that I wasn't playing myself

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:31.360
I just wanted to see something that was an idea in my head

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360
I wanted to see something

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:36.400
That's fine. I also use AI all day long

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:40.080
In fact, I'm already at the point where if you took it away from me

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.440
I'd be like oh my god

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.440
How do we even look things up on the internet anymore?

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.440
It's stack overflow still around

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.600
Or I'm still a thing

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.280
Like how do I even find answers to some of these questions I have all day long

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.560
I don't want to give up AI

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.680
In fact, let's say the way I like to use AI

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.000
I'm getting smarter every day because of AI

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Because I'm using AI

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.840
To have it explain things to me even stupid questions

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.400
I would be a little embarrassed to even enter into Google

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.960
AI is perfectly willing to give me the

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:13.920
ELI-5 explanation of some Unix command

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.360
I should have known already

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.960
But I don't I'm sorry

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.600
Can you just explain it to me and now I know the thing

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.360
So at the end of the day of me working with AI all day long

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.800
I'm a little bit smarter

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.360
Wait

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.400
5%

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.760
Sorry, not 5%

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.200
Half a percent maybe

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:30.960
That compounds over time

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.240
But what I've also seen

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:34.080
When I worked on the umaku project

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.560
And I tried to let AI drive for me

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.880
I felt I was maybe half a percent

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.880
Dumber at the end of the day

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.480
Okay, you said a lot interesting things

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.280
First of all

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.200
Let's just start with the very fact that

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.560
Asking dumb questions

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.480
If you go to stack overflow and ask a dumb question

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.280
Or read somebody else's dumb question

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.400
And the answer to it

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.600
There's a lot of judgment there

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.080
Yes

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.440
AI

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.880
Sometimes to an excessive degree

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.240
Has no judgment

01:35:58.240 --> 01:35:59.200
It usually says

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:00.320
Oh, that's a great question

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.000
To a fault

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:02.720
Yeah

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:03.680
Oh, that's wonderful

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.080
Yeah, I mean

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:10.320
It's such a it's so conducive to learning

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:11.760
It's such a wonderful tooth learning

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.680
And I would I too would miss it

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:16.160
And it's a great basically search engine

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.760
And you know all kinds of nuances of a particular programming language

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:21.760
Especially if you don't know it that well

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.040
Or like API's

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.400
You can load in documentation

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.240
It's just so grateful learning

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.440
For me personally

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:28.800
It

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I mean on the happiness scale

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.400
It makes me more excited to program

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.600
I don't know what that is exactly

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.720
Part of that is then

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.640
I'm really sorry stack overflow is an incredible website

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.080
There is a negativity there

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.080
There's a judgment there

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:48.240
There's just exciting to be out like

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:51.120
With a hype man next to me

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.080
Just like say

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.760
Yeah, that's a great idea

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.400
And I'll say

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.600
No, that's wrong

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.280
I'll correct the AI

01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:59.120
And then the AI will say

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.560
You absolutely right

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.080
How did I not think about that

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.360
You know we're right to code

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.400
I'm like holy shit

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.120
I'm having

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.640
It's like a buddy

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.760
That's like

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:09.200
Really being positive

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.560
And it's very smart

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.840
And it's challenging me to think

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.800
And even if I never use the code to generate

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.160
I'm already a better programmer

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.120
But actually

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.200
The deeper thing is for some reason

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.440
I'm having more fun

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:23.280
That's a really really important thing

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.880
I like to think of it as a pair programmer

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.240
For exactly that reason

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.640
Per programming came

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.240
Boge in like the 2000s

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:32.800
Where you'd have two programmers in front of one machine

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.000
And you'd

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.680
Push the keyboard between you

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.520
One program would be driving

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.640
They'd be typing in

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.320
The other programmer would essentially sit

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.640
And watch the code suggest improvements

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.600
Look something up

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.480
That was a really interesting dynamic

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.760
Now unfortunately I'm an introvert

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.920
So I can do that for about five minutes before

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.000
I want to jump off a bridge

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.800
So it doesn't work for me as a full-time occupation

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.400
But AI allows me to have all the best of that experience

01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:59.360
All the time

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.360
Now I think what's really interesting when you said about

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.560
It makes it more fun

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:03.840
I hadn't actually thought about that

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.200
But

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:07.360
What it's made more fun to me

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.960
Is to be a beginner again

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:09.760
It's made me

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.480
It made it more fun to learn bash

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:14.240
Successfully for the first time

01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:15.840
Now I had to do the detour

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.280
Where I let it write all the code for me

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.760
And I realized I wasn't learning nearly as much

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.040
As I hoped I would

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:24.080
And that I started doing once I typed it out myself

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.400
But it gave me the confidence that

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.120
Do you know what if I need to do some iOS programming myself

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.160
I haven't done that in probably six years

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.520
Was the last time I dabbled in it

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.520
I never really built anything for real

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.200
I feel highly confident now

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.560
That I could sit down with AI

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.320
And I could have something in the app store

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.600
By the end of the week

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.520
I would not have that confidence

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:46.320
Unless I had a pair of programming body like AI

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.400
I don't actually use it very much for Ruby code

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.560
I'm occasionally impressed

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.520
Whenever I tried

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.120
They're like oh it's got this one thing right

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.800
That is truly remarkable

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.000
And it's actually pretty good

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.360
And then I'll ask you two more questions

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.960
And I go like oh yeah okay

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.280
If you were my junior programmer

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.440
I'd start tapping my fingers and going like

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.960
You got to you got to shape up

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.240
Now the great thing of course is

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.440
We can just wait five minutes

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:11.440
The in drop xco seems to think that

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:14.000
90% of all code by the end of the year is going to be written by AI

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.400
I'm more than a little bit skeptical about that

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.960
But I'm open-minded about the prospect

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.080
Programming potentially

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.680
We'll turn into a horse when done manually

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.440
Something we do recreationally

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:30.720
It's no longer a mode of transportation to get around LA

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.160
You're not going to saddle up

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.920
And go to the grocery store

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.080
And pick up stuff from whole foods in your saddlebags

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.680
That's just not a thing anymore

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:40.480
That could be the future for programming

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:42.080
For manual programming

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.840
Entirely possible

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.360
I also don't care

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.120
Even though we have great renditions of all the best songs

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:49.680
As I said

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:52.560
There are millions of people who love to play the guitar

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:55.440
It may no longer have as much economic value as it once did

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:56.960
I think that

01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.960
I'm quite convinced it's true

01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:00.880
That we perhaps have seen the peak

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.720
Now I understand the paradox

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:04.320
When the price of something goes down

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.320
Actually the overall usage goes up

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:09.040
And total spend on that activity goes up

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:10.720
That could also happen maybe

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.480
But what we're seeing right now

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.880
Is that a lot of the big shops

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.640
A lot of the companies

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:19.280
Are not hiring like they were five years ago

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.520
They're not anticipating they're going to need

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.040
Tons more programmers

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:28.000
Controversially Tobi actually put out a memo inside of Shopify

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.320
Asking everyone who's considering hiring someone

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.440
To ask the question

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.880
Could this be done by AI?

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.880
Now he's further ahead on this question

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:35.520
Then I am

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.360
I look at some of the code in trenches

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.400
And I go like

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:39.680
I'd love to use AI more

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:41.280
And I see how it's making us more productive

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.600
But it's not yet at the level where I just go

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.560
Like oh we have this project

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.400
Let me just give it to the AI agent

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.520
And it's going to go off and do it

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:48.880
But let's just be honest

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.480
You're like a Clint Eastwood type character

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.480
Cobboy on a horse

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.880
At the seeing cars going around

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.440
And you're like

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:55.920
Well

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.880
That's part of it

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.680
And I think it is important to have that humility

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.440
That what you are good at

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.800
May no longer be what society values

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:06.960
This has happened a million times in history

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.000
That you could have been

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.480
Exceptually good at saddle making for example

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.480
That's something that a lot of people used to care about

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.240
Because everyone rode a horse

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:17.040
And then suddenly riding a horse became this niche

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.040
Hoppy

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.320
That there's some people care about it

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.840
But not nearly as many

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:22.720
That's okay

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.400
Now the other thing of this is

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.160
I've had the good fortune

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:26.960
To

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.200
I've been a programmer for nearly 30 years

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:30.400
That's a great run

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.880
I try to look at life in this way

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:35.360
That I've already been blessed

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:38.640
With decades of economically viable

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:41.680
Highly valuable

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.760
Ways of translating what I like best

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.600
In the working world

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.040
To write Ruby code

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.400
That that was so valuable

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.360
That I could make millions and millions of dollars doing it

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.360
And if that's over tomorrow

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.880
I shouldn't look at that with regret

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.880
I should look at it with gratitude

01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.400
But you're also highly experienced

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:01.360
Brilliant

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.360
And opinionated

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.320
Human beings

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.320
So it's really interesting to

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.720
Get your opinion on the future of the horse

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:10.560
Because it

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.480
You know, there's a lot of young people listening to this

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.520
Who love programming

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.120
Or who are excited by the

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.040
Possibility of building stuff with software

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:19.360
With a Ruby

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.040
With Ruby with Ruby on Rails

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:21.920
That kind of language

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.080
And now the possibility

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.040
Is it a career

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.000
Is it a career

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.280
And

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.280
How

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:32.080
If indeed a single person can build

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.000
More and more and more with a hub of AI

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.640
Like how do they learn that skill

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.400
Is this a good skill to learn

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.680
I mean that to me is the real

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:43.840
Mystery here because I think it's still absolutely true

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:46.960
That you have to learn how to program from scratch

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.160
Currently

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.720
But how do you balance those two skills

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.680
Because I too

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.720
As I'm thinking now

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.360
There is a scary slipping away of skill that happens

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.320
And a matter of like

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:00.720
Really minutes

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.320
On a particular piece of code

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.520
It's just

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:04.480
It's scary

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.360
Not the way

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.080
Driving

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:08.880
You know, when you have

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.200
A car drive for you

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.680
Doesn't quite slip away that fast

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.320
So that really scares me

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.920
So when somebody comes up to me

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.480
And asks me like

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.160
How do I learn to program

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.440
I don't know what the advice is

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:22.800
Because

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.520
I think it's not enough to just use cursor

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.640
Or a copilot of the generate code

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:29.760
It's absolutely not enough

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.040
Not if you want to learn

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.880
None of you want to become better at it

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.800
If you just become a tap monkey

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:37.120
Maybe you're productive in a second

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.320
But then you have to realize

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.000
Well, can anyone just tap

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:40.800
If that's all we're doing

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.880
Is just sitting around all day long tapping

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.400
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.560
That's not a marketable skill

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.920
Now

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.120
I always preface this

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:49.920
Both to myself

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.280
And when I speak to others about it

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.160
Is

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.440
Rule number one

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.200
Nobody fucking knows anything

01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:57.840
No one can predict even six months ahead

01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:58.480
Right now

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:01.600
We're probably at peak AI future hype

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.040
Because we see all the promise

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.960
Because so much of it is real

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.440
And so many people have experienced it themselves

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:10.960
This mind boggling thing

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:13.680
That the silicon is thinking

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.960
In some way

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.760
That feels eerily reminiscent of humans

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.120
I'd actually say

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.000
The big thing for me

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.120
Wasn't even chat gpt

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:22.000
Wasn't even clawed

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.280
It was deep seek

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.720
Running deep seek locally

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.800
And seeing the think box

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:28.080
Where it

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:29.600
Converses with itself

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:30.880
About how to

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:33.200
Formulate the response

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.320
I almost want to think

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.680
Is this a gimmick

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:36.880
Is it doing this

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.720
As a performance for my benefit

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.480
But that's not actually how it thinks

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.920
If this is how it actually thinks

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.360
Okay, I'm a little scared

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.320
This is

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.320
Incredibly human

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.320
How it thinks in this way

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.600
But where does that go

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.120
So

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.560
In 95

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.920
One of my favorite movies

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.120
One of my favorite B movies

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:55.680
Came out

01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:56.640
The lawnmower man

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:57.200
Great movie

01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:00.160
Incredible movie about virtual reality

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.160
Being an avatar and living in VR

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.360
Like the story was a mess

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.240
But the aesthetics

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.400
The world that build up was incredible

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.080
And I thought

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:09.520
We're five years away

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:11.520
I'm going to be living in VR now

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.200
I'm just going to be floating around

01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.160
I'm going to be an avatar

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:15.440
This is where most humans

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:17.440
Can spend most of the day

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.200
That didn't happen

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.200
We're 30 years later

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.400
VR

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:23.920
Is still

01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:24.880
Not here

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:26.000
It's here for gaming

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.920
It's here for some specialized

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:28.960
Applications

01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:31.840
My oldest loves playing gorilla tag

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:32.880
I don't know if you've tried that

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.360
That's basically the hottest VR game

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:35.920
Wonderful

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:37.200
That's great

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.440
It's really hard to predict the future

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:40.480
Because we just don't know

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.480
And then when you factor in AI

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.480
And you have

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:46.560
Even the smartest people

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.040
Go like

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.280
I don't think we fully understand how this works

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.240
But then on the flip side

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.240
You have Moore's Law that

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.440
Seems to have worked for many many many years

01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:58.080
Decreasing the size of the transistor

01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:58.880
For example

01:45:58.880 --> 01:45:59.840
So like

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:00.800
You know

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.440
Flash didn't take over the internet

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.280
But Moore's Law works

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.080
So we don't know which one AI is

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.080
And this is what I find so fascinating

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:11.840
To have a kid who did this presentation

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.200
But someone in the web community

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.720
Did this great presentation

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:17.280
On the history of the airplane

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.040
So you go from the right

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.360
Brothers flying in one of the 1903

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:22.640
Or something like that

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.640
And 40 years later

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.880
You have a jet flight

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.760
Just an unbelievable amount of progress

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.600
In four decades

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.360
Then in 56

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:34.400
I think it was

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.160
The halt design

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:39.040
For the Boeing 747

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.320
Essentially precursor

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.280
Was designed

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:43.040
And basically nothing has happened since

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:45.360
Just minor tweets and improvements

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.720
On the flying experience

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.720
Since the 50s

01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.000
Somehow

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.360
If you were to predict

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.320
Where flying was going to go

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.320
And you were sitting in 42

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:55.520
And you'd seen

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:58.720
You'd remember the right brothers flying in 03

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.240
And you were seeing that

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:01.040
Jet engines coming

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:01.520
You're like

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.440
We're going to fly the stars

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.560
In another two decades

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.760
We're going to invent

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.400
Super mega hypersonic flights

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:10.080
That's going to traverse the earth

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:11.440
In two hours

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:12.400
And then that didn't happen

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:13.600
It tapped out

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.240
This is what's so hard about the future

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:17.840
We can be so excited in the moment

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:20.160
Because we're drawing a line

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.320
Through early dots on a chart

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.680
And it looks like those early dots

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:24.720
Is just going up and to the right

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.480
And sometimes it's just flatten out

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.920
This is also one of those things

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:28.960
Where

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.480
We have so much critical infrastructure

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.080
For example, that still runs on cobalt

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.920
That about five humans around the world

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:34.880
Really understand

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.160
Truly, deeply

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.280
That there's all

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:38.880
It's possible for society

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.160
To lose a competence

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.600
It still needs

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:44.400
Because it's chasing the future

01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.080
Cobalt is still with us

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:47.600
This is one of the things I think about

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:48.960
With programming

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.520
Ruby and Rails is at such a level now

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:52.880
That in 50 years from now

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.640
It's exceedingly likely

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.280
That there's still a ton of Ruby and Rails systems running around

01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.400
And very hard to predict

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.480
What that exact world is going to be like

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:02.160
But yesterday's weather tells us that

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:05.200
If there's still cobalt code from the 70s

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:07.280
Operating social security today

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.160
And we haven't figured out a clean way to convert that

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.840
Let alone understand it

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.320
We should certainly be

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.320
Humble about predicting the future

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:17.840
I don't think any of the programmers

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:20.160
Who wrote that cobalt code back in the 70s

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.360
Had any damn idea

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.880
Then in 2025

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.480
Chacks were still being cut

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:27.200
Of the business logic that they had encoded back then

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.640
But that just brings me

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.240
To the conclusion on the question

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:32.320
For what should a young programmer do

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:33.920
You're not going to be able to predict the future

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:36.080
No one's going to be able to predict the future

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:37.280
If you like programming

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.640
You should learn programming

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:40.320
Now is that going to be a career forever?

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:40.880
I don't know

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.720
But what's going to be a career forever

01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:44.000
Who knows

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.440
Like a second ago

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.360
We thought that it was the

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:49.840
Blue color labor that was going to be extracted first

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.840
It was the robots that were going to take over

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.680
Then Gen AI comes out

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:55.440
And then all the artists suddenly look like

01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:56.320
Holy shit

01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:57.920
Is this going to do all animation now

01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.440
Is going to do all music now

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:00.640
They get really scared

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.120
And now I see the latest Tesla robot

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:03.680
Going like

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:06.480
Maybe we're back now to blue color being in trouble

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.240
Because if it can dance like that

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.240
It can probably fix a toilet

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:13.760
So no one knows anything

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.520
And you have to then

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:17.680
Precision yourself for the future in such a way

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:19.680
That

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.120
It doesn't matter

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:22.560
That you pick a

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.080
Profession or path

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.840
Where if it turns out

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:28.080
That you have to retool and re-skill

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:30.160
You're not going to regret the path you took

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.440
That's a general

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.720
Life principle for me

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:34.720
How I look at all endeavors

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.000
I involve myself in

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.920
Is I want to be

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.440
Content with all outcomes

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:41.280
When we start working on a new product

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.480
At 37 signals

01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:45.520
I set up my mental model for success

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:46.320
And I go

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.120
Do you know what?

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:48.880
If no one wants this

01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:51.120
I will have had another opportunity

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.120
To write beautiful Ruby code

01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:54.960
To explore a greenfield domain

01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:56.400
To learn something new

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:58.160
To build a system I want

01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.520
Even if no one else wants it

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.520
What a blessing

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:03.120
What a privilege

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:05.040
If a bunch of people want it

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:05.920
That's great

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:07.920
We can pay some salaries

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:09.280
We can keep the business running

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:11.200
And if it's a blow away success

01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:11.760
Wonderful

01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.440
I get to impact a bunch of people

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.400
I think one of the big open questions to me

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.760
Is

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.760
How far you can get with vibe coding

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.240
Whether an approach for a young developer

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:23.440
To invest

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:24.880
Most of the time into vibe coding

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.040
Or into writing code from scratch

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:30.560
So vibe coding meaning

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:32.560
So I'm leaning into the meme a little bit

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.280
But vibe coding meaning you generate code

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.160
You have this idea of a thing you want to create

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.680
You generate the code

01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:41.200
And then you fix it

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.200
With both natural language to the prompts

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:44.160
And manually

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.880
You learn enough to manually fix it

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:48.160
So that's the learning process

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:50.400
How you fix code that's generated

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:51.840
Or you

01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:55.120
You write code from scratch

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.120
And have the LLM's kind of

01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:57.920
Tab

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.040
Tab, tab, tab

01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:00.560
Add extra code

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:03.520
Like which part do you lean on

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.920
I think to be safe

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.600
You should find the beauty

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:10.240
And the artistry

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:11.600
And the skill in both

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:12.480
Right from scratch

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:14.000
So there should be some percent of your time

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:14.960
Just writing from scratch

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.480
And some percent vibe coding

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.160
There should be more

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:19.440
Of the time writing from scratch

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.360
If you are interested in learning how to program

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.840
Unfortunately you're not going to get fit

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.760
By watching fitness videos

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.440
You're not going to learn how to play the guitar

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:29.360
By watching YouTube guitar videos

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.280
You have to actually play yourself

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.560
You have to do the sit-ups

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:34.800
Programming, understanding

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.400
Learning almost anything

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:37.600
Requires you to do

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:41.120
Humans are not built to absorb information

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.440
In a way that transforms into skills

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:45.600
By just watching others from afar

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.480
Now ironically it seems AI is actually quite good at that

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:49.760
But humans are not

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.480
If you want to learn how to become a competent programmer

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:54.560
You have to program

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.080
It's really not

01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.480
That difficult to understand

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.240
Now I understand the temptation

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:01.680
And the temptation is there

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:04.080
Because vibe coding can produce things

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:05.120
Perhaps in this moment

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.040
Especially in a new domain you're not familiar with

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:08.320
With tools you don't know

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:09.200
Perfectly well

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.720
That's better than what you could do

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:13.040
Or that you would take much longer

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:13.760
To get at

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.360
But you're not going to learn anything

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.960
You're going to learn in this

01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:19.680
Superficial way that feels like learning

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:21.920
But it's completely empty calories

01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:22.960
And secondly

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.440
If you can just vibe coded

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:26.560
You're not a programmer

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.440
Then anyone could do it

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.800
Which may be wonderful

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:30.160
That's essentially what happened

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:31.520
With the access database

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:33.200
That's what happened with Excel

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:36.400
It took the capacity of accountants

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:39.280
To become software developers

01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:41.360
Because the tools became so accessible to them

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.880
That they could build a model

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.880
For how the business was going to do next week

01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:47.280
That required a programmer prior to excel

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.160
Now it didn't because they could do it themselves

01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:54.640
Vibe coding enables non programmers

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.560
To explore their ideas

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:58.560
In a way that I find absolutely wonderful

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.880
But it doesn't make your programmer

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:02.560
I agree with you

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.560
But I want to allow for room

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.080
For both of us be wrong

01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:07.280
For example

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.440
There could be vibe coding

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.560
Could actually be a skill

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.040
That if you train it

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.400
And by vibe coding let's include the step of correction

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.600
The iterative correction

01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:21.120
It's possible if you get really good at that

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:22.480
That you're outperforming

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:24.080
That people that have right from scratch

01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.960
That you can come up with truly innovative things

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:30.240
Especially at this moment in history

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.280
While the LLMs are a little bit too dumb

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:34.880
To create super novel things

01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:36.320
And a complete product

01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.480
But they're starting to creep close to that

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.320
So if you're investing time now

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.480
Into becoming a really good vibe coder

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:44.160
Maybe

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.680
This is the right thing to do

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:48.480
If it's indeed a skill

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:50.240
We'll kind of meme about vibe coding

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.440
You just be like sitting back

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:53.200
And it's in the name

01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:54.800
But if you treat it seriously

01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:56.960
A competitive vibe coder

01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:59.760
And get good at riding the wave of AI

01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:04.240
And get good at the skill of editing code

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:06.160
Versus writing code from scratch

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:07.120
It's possible

01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:11.920
That you can actually get farther in a long term

01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:14.720
Maybe editing is a fundamentally different task

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:16.560
Than writing from scratch

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.960
If you take that seriously as a skill that you develop

01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:21.120
I see, to me that's an open question

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.120
I just think I'm

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.480
I personally

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:26.160
And now you're on another level

01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:27.120
But just me

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:29.120
Just personally

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:31.360
I'm not as good at editing

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.520
The code

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:35.200
That I didn't write

01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:36.880
There's a difference

01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:37.760
No one is

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.760
Of this generation

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:42.720
But maybe that's a skill

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:45.360
Maybe if you get on the same page as the AI

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.120
Because there's a consistency to the AI

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:48.320
It's like

01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.320
It really is a pair of programmer

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.360
With a consistent style, structure, and so on

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:55.040
Plus with your own property

01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.280
You can control the kind of road code you write

01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:58.880
I mean, it could generally be a skill

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:01.360
That's the dream of the prompt engineer

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.440
I think it's complete pipe dream

01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:06.000
I don't think editors

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.720
Exist that aren't good at writing

01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:09.840
I've written a number of books

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:12.000
I've had a number of professional editors

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:15.280
Not all of them wrote their own great books

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:17.520
But all of them were great writers in some regard

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.360
You cannot give someone pointers

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.440
If you don't know how to do it

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.120
It's very difficult for an editor

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:27.360
To be able to spot what's wrong with a problem

01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:30.880
If you think it couldn't make the solution themselves

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:33.920
Editing in my opinion is the reward

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:36.240
The capacity to be a good editor

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.880
Is the reward you get from being a good doer

01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:40.480
You have to be a doer first

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:42.400
Now that's not the same as saying

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:44.720
That

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:46.880
Vibe coding prompt engineering

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:49.440
Won't be able to produce fully formed

01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.760
Amazing systems even shortly

01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:53.520
I think that's entirely possible

01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:55.040
But then there's no skill left

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:57.440
Which maybe is the greatest payoff at all

01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.680
Wasn't that the whole promise of AI anyway

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:01.520
That it was just all natural language

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.040
That even my clumsy way of formulating a question

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:07.760
Could result in a beautiful succinct answer

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.320
That actually to me is a much more appealing vision

01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:12.960
That there's going to be these special prompt engineering wizards

01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:15.120
Who know how to tackle the AI

01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:17.200
Just right to produce what they want

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.600
The beauty of AI is to think

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:22.000
That someone who doesn't know the first thing about

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.680
How AI actually works

01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:27.440
Is able to formulate their idea and their aspirations

01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:28.560
For what they want

01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:32.160
And the AI could somehow take that messy clump

01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:34.560
Of ideas and produce something that someone wants

01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:37.680
That's actually what programming has always been

01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:40.960
There's very often been people who didn't know how to program

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:43.680
Who wanted programs, who then hired programmers

01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:46.240
Who gave the messy descriptions of what they wanted

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:48.800
And then when the programmers delivered that back

01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:50.480
Said oh no, actually that's not what I meant

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.480
I want something else

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:55.920
AI may be able to provide that cycle

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:58.480
If that happens to the fullest extent of it

01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:00.480
Yeah, there's not going to be as many programmers around

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:00.880
Right

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.320
But hopefully

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.320
Presumably someone

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.320
Still at least for the foreseeable future

01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:08.720
Have to understand whether what the AI is producing

01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:11.200
Actually works or not

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.720
As an interesting case study

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:14.160
Maybe a thought experiment

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:16.720
If I wanted to vibe code

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.320
Basecamp

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.160
Or hey

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:22.160
And some of the products

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:23.520
You built

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:26.320
Like what would be the bottlenecks

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:28.880
What would I fail along the way?

01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:31.760
What I've seen when I've been trying to do this

01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:34.000
Trying to use vibe coding to build something real

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.440
Is you actually failed really early

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.280
The vibe coding is able to build a veneer

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.760
At the current present moment

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.680
Of something that looks like it works

01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.040
But it's flawed in all sorts of ways

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.320
There are the obvious ways

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:49.920
The meme ways that it's leaking all your API keys

01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:52.400
It's storing your password in plain text

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:54.640
I think that's ultimately solvable

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:55.920
Like it's going to figure that out

01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:57.920
Or at least it's going to get better at that

01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:01.360
But its capacity to get lost in its own labyrinth

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:03.120
Is very great right now

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:04.400
You let

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:05.440
It code something

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:06.880
And then you want to change something

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.320
And it becomes a game of whack-a-mole

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:09.120
Real quick

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.840
Peter levels who've been doing this wonderful flight simulator

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:12.640
Was talking to that

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:14.560
Where at a certain scale

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.560
The thing just keeps biting its own tail

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:17.600
You want to fix something

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:18.720
And it breaks five other things

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:20.960
Which I think is actually uniquely human

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:23.120
Because that's how most bad programmers are

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:25.520
At a certain level of complexity

01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:26.400
With the domain

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.720
They can't fix one thing without

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:30.240
Breaking three other things

01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.200
So in that way

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:32.640
I'm actually

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:34.560
In some way it's almost a positive signal

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.000
For that the AI is going to figure this out

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.280
Because it's done an extremely human trajectory right now

01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:40.880
The kind of mistakes it's making

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.520
Or the kind of mistakes that junior programmers make all the time

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:44.720
Yeah

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:45.520
Uh

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:47.760
Can we zoom out

01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:48.720
And look at the vision

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:49.520
The manifesto

01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.280
The doctrine of rails

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:54.080
What are some of the things that make

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:55.520
A programming language

01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:57.040
A framework great

01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:58.320
Especially for web development

01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.000
So we talked about happiness

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:00.400
Yes

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.800
The underlying objective of Ruby

01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:04.640
What else

01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:06.480
So you're looking at the nine points

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:08.480
I wrote out in I think 2012

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:10.000
And first before we dive into it

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.400
I want to say the reason I wrote it down

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:13.680
Is that

01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:17.280
If you want a community to endure

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:19.280
You have to record its values

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:20.960
And you have to record its practices

01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:22.080
If you don't

01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:25.360
Eventually you're going to get enough new people come in

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.680
Who have their own ideas of where this thing should go

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.120
And if we don't have a

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:30.880
A guiding light

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:32.720
Helping us to make decisions

01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:34.000
We're going to start

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:34.560
Flailing

01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:36.000
We're going to start actually falling apart

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.440
I think this is one of the key reasons

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:39.280
That institutions of all kinds

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:40.480
Start falling apart

01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:41.520
We forget

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:43.840
Why Chester Tons fence is there

01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:44.400
We just go like

01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:45.440
Why is that fence there?

01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:46.480
Let's see and get out

01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:48.160
Oh it was to keep the wolves out

01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:49.280
Now we're all dead

01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:50.640
Oops

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:52.800
So I wanted to write these things down

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:54.720
And if we just take them quick one by one

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.880
You talked about optimizing for programmer happiness

01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:00.160
I put that at number one in homage of maths

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:04.000
And that's a lot about accepting that there is occasionally a trade-off

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.680
Between writing beautiful code

02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:07.120
And other things we want out of systems

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:08.800
There can be a runtime trade-off

02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:10.560
There can be a performance trade-off

02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:13.040
But we're going to do it nonetheless

02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:14.960
We're also going to

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:17.040
Allow ambiguity in a way that

02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:20.560
Many programmers by default are uncomfortable with

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:22.560
I give the example actually here

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:25.920
Of in the interactive Ruby shell

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.200
Where you can play with the language or even interact with your domain model

02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:31.440
You can quit it in two ways

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.880
At least that I found

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.400
You can write exit

02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:35.760
Boom you're out of the program

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:37.040
You can write quit

02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:38.080
Boom you're out of the program

02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:39.280
They do the same thing

02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:41.440
We just wrote both exit or the people built that

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.880
Wrote both exit and quit

02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.440
Because they knew humans were likely to pick one or the other

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:49.120
Python is the perfect contrast to this

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:51.520
In the Python interactive protocol

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:52.960
If you write exit

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:53.760
It won't exit

02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:55.680
It'll give you a fucking lesson

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:58.080
It'll basically tell you to read the fucking manual

02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:01.680
It says use exit parentheses

02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:06.080
Or control d i e and a file to exit

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:07.760
I'm like

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.280
One is very human and another is very engineer

02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:12.560
And I mean that

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:15.120
Both of them in the best possible way

02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:16.880
Python is pedantic

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.880
Python's

02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.160
The value

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:21.280
From the start stated

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:23.440
Is that this should be preferably one

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.320
And only one way to do a certain thing

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:28.000
Ruby goes to complete opposite

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.520
No, we want the full expression that fits

02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:32.880
Different human brains

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:35.040
Such that it seems like the

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:37.680
Language is guessing just what they want

02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:41.200
And part of that is also you describe the principle of Lee's surprise

02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:44.400
Which is a difficult thing to engineer into a language

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:45.440
Because you have to kind of

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:46.720
Is a subjective thing

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:48.320
Which is why you can't do it in one way

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:50.800
Which is why you use the example of both exit and quit

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.840
The principle of Lee's surprise for some people would be

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.880
Like oh exit that's how I get out of the prompt

02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:58.320
For other people would be quit

02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:00.320
Why don't we just do both

02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:04.160
Okay so what's the convention over configuration

02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:05.120
That's a big one

02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:06.720
That's a big one that's a huge one

02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:10.400
And it was born out of a frustration I had in the early days

02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:12.160
With especially Java frameworks

02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:14.480
Where when you were setting up a web application framework

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:15.760
For Java back in the day

02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:18.160
It was not uncommon to literally write

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:22.800
Hundreds of thousands of lines of XML configuration files

02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:27.680
Oh and it is I want the database to use the foreign keys

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:29.680
As post underscore id

02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:33.120
No no no I want it as post capital id

02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:36.640
Oh no no no you have to do a capital p id

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:40.240
There are all these ways where you can configure how

02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:42.400
Foreign relation keys should work in a database

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:43.840
And none of them matter

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:45.440
We just need to pick one

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:46.480
And then that's fine

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:49.280
And if we pick one and we can depend on it

02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:50.560
It becomes a convention

02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.880
And if it's a convention we don't have to configure it

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:54.080
And if we don't have to configure it

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:56.720
You can get started with you actually care about much quicker

02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:01.440
So convention over configuration is essentially to take that idea

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:04.160
That the system should come preassembled

02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:06.640
I'm not just handing you about the fucking Legos

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:08.800
And asking you to build the Millennium Falcon

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:10.400
I'm giving you a finished toy

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.600
You can edit you can change it

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:12.800
It's still build out of Legos

02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:15.280
You can still take some pieces off and put in some other pieces

02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:16.880
But I'm giving you the final product

02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:20.800
And this cuts against the grain of what most programmers love

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.240
They love a box of Legos

02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:24.480
They love to put everything together from scratch

02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:26.880
They love to make all these detailed little decisions

02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:28.400
That just don't matter at all

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:29.680
And I want to elevate that up

02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:32.560
So it's that hey I'm not trying to take the decisions away from you

02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:35.520
I just want you to focus on decisions that actually matter

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:38.080
Did you truly care about no one cares about

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:41.680
Whether it's post underscore id or post id or pit

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.880
Yeah great defaults

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:45.280
Yeah it's just a wonderful thing

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:46.640
You have all these aspirations

02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:48.400
They're going to do some kind of custom

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.720
Most beautiful Legos castle

02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:52.480
That nobody's ever built from these pieces

02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:54.640
But in reality to be productive

02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:56.960
And most situations you just need to

02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.040
Build the basic thing

02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:03.120
And then on top of that is where your creativity comes

02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:03.760
Absolutely

02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:07.120
And I think this is one of those part of the doctrine

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.040
That a lot of programmers who

02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:11.440
Get to use Ruby Enrails

02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.520
begrudgingly will acknowledge

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:14.800
It's a nice thing

02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.320
Even if they don't really like it

02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:18.080
Like it's hard to beat the

02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.800
Sort of attraction

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:22.640
To building with Legos from scratch

02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:23.360
Out of programmers

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:24.400
That's just what we like

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:26.000
This is why we're programmers in the first place

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Because we'd like to put these little pieces together

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
But we can direct that instinct

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.800
Towards a more productive end of the stack

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:34.800
Okay what are some of the other ones

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:37.440
The menu is Omakasa

02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:39.200
It actually comes out of the same principle

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:41.760
That great default really matter

02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:44.800
If you look at everything that's wrong with the JavaScript ecosystem

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.080
Right now for example

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:49.200
It is that no one is in charge of the menu

02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:51.200
There are a billion different dishes

02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:53.760
And you can configure just your tailored

02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:56.160
Specific configuration of it

02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:59.040
But no one done the work to make sure it all fits together

02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:00.800
So you have all these unique problems

02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:02.480
In the JavaScript ecosystem for example

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:07.760
There's probably 25 major ways of just doing the controller layer

02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:10.640
And then as many of how to talk to the database

02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:13.520
So you get this permutation of n times n times n

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:16.800
Of no one is using the same thing

02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:18.160
And if they are using the same thing

02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:20.000
They're only using the same thing for about five minutes

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.600
So we have no

02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:22.880
Retained wisdom

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:25.040
We build up no durable skills

02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:28.240
Rails goes the complete opposite way of saying

02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:29.680
Do you know what? Rails is not just

02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.840
A way framework

02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:35.920
It is a complete attempt at solving the web problem

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.520
It's complete attempt at solving

02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.640
Everything you need to build a great web application

02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:46.000
And every piece of that puzzle should ideally be in the box

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.240
Pre-configured, pre-assembled

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.000
If you want to change some of those pieces later

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:50.800
That's wonderful

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:52.000
But on day one

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.560
You'll get a full menu

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:58.480
Designed by chef really cared about every piece of the ingredient

02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:00.080
And you're going to enjoy it

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:03.840
And that's again one of those things

02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.280
Many programmers think like I know better

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:10.880
And they do in some hyper-local sense of it

02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:12.000
Every programmer knows better

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.520
This is what Ruby is built on

02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:15.520
That every programmer knows better

02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:16.800
In their specific situation

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:18.720
Maybe they can do something dangerous

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:20.800
Maybe they think they know better

02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:22.160
And then they blow their foot off

02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:23.360
And then they truly will know better

02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:24.720
Because they've blown their foot off once

02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:26.080
And won't do it again

02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:28.560
But the menu is on the causes that

02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:32.720
So you in general see the value in the model with

02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.800
Yes, the integrated system

02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.280
Integrated

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.280
Someone thought of the whole problem

02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:38.400
This is one of the reasons why

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:41.680
I've been on a crusade against microservices

02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:43.600
Since the term was coined

02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:47.440
Micro-services was born out of essentially a good idea

02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:49.600
What do you do at Netflix scale

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:53.440
When you have thousands of engineers working on millions of lines of code

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:55.760
No one can keep that entire system in their head at one time

02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:56.800
You have to break it down

02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:59.200
Micro-services can be a reasonable way to do that

02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:00.800
When you're at Netflix scale

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:04.720
When you apply that pattern to a team of 20 programmers

02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:07.360
Working on a code base of half a million lines of code

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:08.960
You're an idiot

02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:10.960
You just don't need to turn

02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:14.480
Method invocations into network calls

02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:17.360
It is the first rule of distributed programming

02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:20.000
Do not distribute your programming

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.840
It makes everything harder

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.440
All the failure conditions

02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:24.960
You have to consider as a programmer

02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:26.400
Just becomes infinitely harder

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.240
When there's a network cable involved

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:33.200
So I hate the idea of premature decomposition

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:35.040
And microservices is exactly that

02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:36.640
The monolith says

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:39.040
Let's try to focus on building a whole system

02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:41.200
That a single human can actually understand

02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:44.560
And push that paradigm as far as possible

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.000
By compressing all the concepts

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.080
System more of it will fit into memory

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:50.080
Of a single operating human

02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:51.600
And then we can have a system

02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:53.680
Where I can actually understand all of base cap

02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:55.600
I can actually understand all of hey

02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:58.800
Both of those systems are just over 100,000 lines of code

02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:00.720
I've seen people do this that maybe twice

02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:01.760
Maybe three times that scale

02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:02.800
And then it starts breaking down

02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:05.600
Once you get north of certainly half a million lines of code

02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:07.680
No individual human can do it

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:11.440
And that's when you get into maybe some degree of microservices can make sense

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.840
Basecamp and hey are both 100,000

02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.960
100,000 lines of code

02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:16.400
Wow, that's small

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:17.200
It is

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:18.560
Considering the fact that Basecamp

02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:21.360
I think has something like 420 screens

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.600
Different ways and configurations

02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:25.680
Do you include the front end in that?

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:26.720
No, that's the Ruby code

02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:30.640
Well it's front end in the sense that some of that Ruby code is beneficial to the front

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:32.480
But it's not JavaScript for example

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:34.480
Now the other thing we might talk about later is

02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:38.000
We write very little JavaScript actually for all of our applications

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.640
Hey, which is a Gmail competitor

02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:44.480
Gmail ships I think 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript

02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:46.320
If you compress it I think it's about 6 megabytes

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:47.200
28 megabytes

02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:48.720
Think about how many lines of code that is

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:51.920
When hey launched we shipped 40 kilobytes

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:55.040
It's trying to solve the same problem

02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:58.080
You can solve the email client problem

02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:00.720
With either 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript

02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:02.160
Or with 40 kilobytes

02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:04.320
If you do things differently

02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:06.800
But that comes to the same problem essentially

02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:10.080
This is why I have fiercely fought

02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:12.560
Splitting front end and back into part

02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:15.600
That in my opinion this was one of the great crimes

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.520
Against West Development

02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:20.160
That we are still atoning for

02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:22.800
That we separated and divided

02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:27.680
What was and should be a unified problem-solving mechanism

02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:29.680
When you are working both on front end and back

02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:31.680
And you understand the whole system

02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:33.840
And you're not going to get into these camps

02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:35.360
The decompose and eventually end up

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:36.640
Which shit like GraphQL

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:39.840
Okay

02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:42.960
Let's fly through the rest of the doctrine

02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:44.480
No one paradigm

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:46.480
No one paradigm goes to the fact that Ruby

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.800
Is a fiercely object-oriented programming language

02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:49.520
At its core

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:52.240
But it's also a functional programming language

02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:54.960
This five times I told you about

02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:58.720
You can essentially do these anonymous function calls

02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:00.080
And you can chain them together

02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:04.160
Very much in the spirit of how true functional programming languages work

02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:06.960
Ruby has even moved closer towards the functional programming

02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:10.000
End of the scale by making strings immutable

02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:14.720
There are ideas from all different disciplines

02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:16.960
Of and all different paradigms of software development

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.960
That can fit together

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.000
Small talk for example

02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:21.840
With the only object-oriented

02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:22.720
And that was just it

02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:25.200
Ruby tries to be mainly object-oriented

02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:27.440
But borrow a little bit of functional programming

02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:28.640
A little bit of imperative programming

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:30.320
Be able to do all of that

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.920
Rails tries to do the same thing

02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:34.000
We're not just going to pick one paradigm

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.440
And run it through everything

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:38.160
Object orientation is at the center of it

02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:40.560
But it's okay to invite all these other disciplines

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.840
And it's okay to be inspired

02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.440
It's okay to remix it

02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:47.360
I actually think one of the main benefits of rails

02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:48.720
Is that it's a remix

02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:50.560
I didn't invent all these ideas

02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.240
I didn't come up with active record

02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:54.160
I didn't come up with the MVC

02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:55.840
Way of dividing and application

02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:58.160
I took all the great ideas that I had learned

02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:01.040
And picked up from every different camp

02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:02.240
And I put it together

02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:06.560
Not because there was going to be just one single overarching theory of everything

02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:08.240
But I was going to have a cohesive unit

02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:09.840
That incorporated the best from everywhere

02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:12.480
Is that idea a bit attention

02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.320
With the beauty of the monolith system

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:16.160
I think the monolith

02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:19.840
Can be thought of as quite roomy

02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:21.920
Quite as a big tent

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:24.720
That the monolith needs actually

02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:26.880
To borrow a little bit of functional programming

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:29.520
For the kinds of problems that that excels

02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:31.040
That discipline excels at solving

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.480
And that paradigm excels at solving

02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:36.000
If you also want optical orientation as core

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.840
I actually think when I've looked at functional

02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:38.800
Programming languages

02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:40.160
There's a lot to love

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:42.320
And then I see some of the

02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:45.120
Crazy contortions they have to go through

02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:49.120
When part of the problem they're solving calls for mutating something

02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:50.880
And you go like

02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:51.680
Holy shit

02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:55.920
This is a great paradigm for 90% of the problem

02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:58.320
And then you're twisting yourself completely out of shape

02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:00.080
When you try to solve the last 10

02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:02.800
Ooh, exalt beautiful code is the next one

02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:04.000
We've talked about that at length

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.120
And here's a great example

02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:07.120
That really summarizes the

02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:10.560
Domain-specific language quality of Ruby and Rails

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:11.360
That you can make

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:13.120
Code

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:15.920
Actually pleasant to write and read

02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:17.600
Which is really funny to me because

02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:19.840
As we talked about when I started learning programming

02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:21.280
It wasn't even a consideration

02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:23.680
I didn't even know that that could be part of the premise

02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:25.040
That that could be part of the

02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:26.080
solution

02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:27.200
That

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.720
Writing code could feel as good as writing a poem

02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:32.800
Class project

02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:35.120
Application record belongs to account

02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:36.640
Has many participants

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:38.240
Class name person

02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:40.320
Validates presence of name

02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:42.800
You could read it out

02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:44.160
You didn't even change anything

02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:45.440
High-cool or something

02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:46.160
Right

02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:47.200
Isn't that beautiful

02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:48.400
Yes, nice

02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.840
It's really nice

02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:51.840
There's an intuitive nature to it

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:54.640
Okay, so I have specific questions there

02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.240
I mean active record

02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:57.840
Just to take that tangent

02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:00.240
That has to be your favorite feature

02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:01.600
It's the crown jewel

02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:02.640
Of Rails

02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:03.440
It really is

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:06.080
It is the defining characteristic of

02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:07.840
How to work with Ruby and Rails

02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:12.240
And it's born in an interesting level of controversy

02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:14.000
Because it actually uses the pattern

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.840
That had been described by Martin Fowler

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:17.440
In the patterns of enterprise

02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:18.640
Application architecture

02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:19.760
One of the

02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:23.440
Greatest books for anyone working on business systems

02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:24.400
And if you had not read it

02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:26.000
You must pick it up immediately

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.480
Patterns of enterprise application architecture

02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:30.560
I think it was published in 2001

02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:33.280
It is one of the very few programming books

02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:35.200
That I have read many times over

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:36.400
It's incredible

02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:37.840
In it

02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:39.520
Martin describes

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:40.880
A bunch of different patterns

02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:42.880
Of how to build business systems this century

02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:45.520
An active record is a little bit of a footnote in there

02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:47.120
The pattern is literally called active record

02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:48.080
You can look it up in nice

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:48.880
It's called active record

02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:49.840
I wouldn't even

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:52.560
Creative enough to come up with a name of my own

02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:55.600
But it allows the creation

02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:58.480
The marriage of database and object orientation

02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:01.360
In a way that a lot of programmers find

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:03.760
A little off-putting

02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:05.600
They don't actually want to

02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:09.040
Pollute the beautiful object oriented nature

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:11.200
Of that kind of programming with

02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:12.240
Sequel

02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:14.640
There was a rant by Uncle Bob the other day

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:16.720
About how sequel is the worst thing ever

02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:18.240
Baba

02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:19.600
Okay fine whatever

02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:20.560
I don't care

02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:22.320
This is practical

02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:24.800
We are making crowd applications

02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:26.640
You're taking things out of an HTML form

02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:28.480
And you're sticking them into a damn database

02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:30.080
It's not more complicated than that

02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:31.680
The more abstractions you put in

02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:34.480
Between those two ends of the spectrum

02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:36.080
The more you just fooling yourself

02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:37.040
This is what we're doing

02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:39.040
We're talking to sequel databases

02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:40.720
By the way, quick aside

02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:42.240
Sequel was one of those things

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.080
That have endured the onslaught of no sequel databases

02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.600
Structuralist data

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:49.040
For a better part of a decade

02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.640
And still rain supreme

02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:53.440
Sequel was a good thing to invest your time in learning

02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:55.360
Every programmer working with the web

02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:56.320
Should know

02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:58.160
Sequel to a fair degree

02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:00.160
Even if they're working with an ORM

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.440
An object relational mapper

02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:02.480
As active record

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:04.400
You still need to understand sequel

02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:05.840
What active record does

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:08.480
Is not so much try to abstract the sequel

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:10.320
A way behind a different kind of paradigm

02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:12.720
It's just making less cumbersome to write

02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:16.080
Making it more amenable to build

02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:19.920
Domain models on top of other domain models

02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:21.920
In a way since you don't have to write every damn

02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:23.120
Sequel statement by hand

02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.080
We'll just say that active record is an ORM

02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:29.920
Which is a layer that makes it intuitive

02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:31.600
And human interpretable

02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:33.360
To communicate with a database

02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:34.720
Even simpler than that

02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:37.120
It turns tables into classes

02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:39.120
And rows into objects

02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:42.080
I actually think sequels very easy to understand

02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:44.080
Most of it you can write some sequel golf too

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:45.520
That's very hard to understand

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.040
But sequel at its base

02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:48.640
And much of the criticism against sequel

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:51.040
Was it was written for human consumption

02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:52.800
It's actually quite verbose

02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:55.520
Especially if you're doing things like inserts over and over again

02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:56.480
It's quite verbose

02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:59.120
Insert into table parentheses

02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.760
Enumerate every column you want to insert

02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:03.600
Values, parentheses

02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:05.600
Every value that fits with that column

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.800
It gets tedious to write sequel by hand

02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:10.480
But it's actually very humanly readable

02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:15.360
Active record just takes that tediousness away

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:17.520
It makes it possible to combine things in a way

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:19.440
That a humanly

02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.960
Describable language just doesn't

02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:22.480
It composes things into methods

02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:23.840
And you can combine these methods

02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:25.520
And you can build structures around them

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:27.520
So I don't dislike sequel

02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.040
I dislike a lot of things in programming

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:30.320
I try to get rid of them

02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:32.000
Sequel wasn't really one of them

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.760
It was just a sense of

02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:35.520
I don't want to write the same thing over and over again

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:36.560
It was a

02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:38.000
Can we be a little more succinct

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.320
Can we match it just slightly better to

02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:41.600
The object orientation

02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:43.600
Without trying to hide

02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:45.680
A way the fact that we're persisting

02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:47.520
These objects into a database

02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:50.320
That's where I think a lot of ORMs went wrong

02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:54.320
They tried to live in the pure world of objects

02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:56.320
Never to consider that those objects had to be

02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:58.000
Consisted into a sequel database

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.040
And then they came up with

02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:02.160
A convoluted way of translating back and forth

02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:03.680
Active record says

02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:05.200
Do you know what just accepted

02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:06.960
This record, this object

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:08.560
It's not going to get saved into some

02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:09.760
No-sequel database

02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:12.240
It's not going to be saved into a sequel database

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:14.640
So it's just structured the whole thing around that

02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:15.920
It's going to have attributes

02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:17.120
Those attributes are going to

02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:19.120
Respond to columns in the database

02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:20.480
It's not more complicated than that

02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:22.080
Stop making it so

02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:23.280
Yeah, but as you say

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:24.800
So I personally love sequel

02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:27.040
Because I'm an algorithmist person

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:28.480
And so I love optimization

02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:31.120
And I love to know how the databases actually work

02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:34.560
So I can match the sequel queries

02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:36.160
And the design of the tables

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:38.720
Such that there is

02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:40.160
You know optimal

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:42.480
Squeeze the optimal performance out of the table

02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:46.400
Okay, based on the actually way that that table is used

02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:48.560
So I mean, I think that pushes to the point

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:50.880
That like there is value in learning

02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:53.280
In understanding sequel

02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:55.280
I wonder

02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.360
Because I started looking at active record

02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:58.880
And it looks really awesome

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:00.640
Does that make you lazy?

02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:01.920
Not you

02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:06.320
But a person that rolls in and starts using rails

02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:09.360
You can probably get away with never really learning sequel

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:09.920
Right

02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:13.360
As long as you want to stay at the entry level of competence

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:16.400
And this is actually my overarching mission with rails

02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:20.160
Is to lower the barrier of entry so far down

02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:22.960
That someone can start seeing

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:24.400
Stuff on the browser

02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:26.400
Without basically understanding anything

02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:28.880
They can run rails new

02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:29.920
Blog

02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:31.600
Run a couple of generators

02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:32.400
They have a whole system

02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:34.160
They don't understand anything

02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:36.640
But it's an invitation to learn more

02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:37.680
Where I get fired up

02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:40.080
And this ties back to the AI discussion

02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:42.080
Is when that's turned into

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:45.200
This meme that programmers no longer have to be competent

02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:47.360
They can just, I mean, the AI is going to figure it out

02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:49.040
The generators is going to figure it out

02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:50.400
I don't need to know sequel

02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:52.240
Active record is going to abstract it away from me

02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.080
No, no, no, dude

02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:55.120
Hold up

02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:56.960
The path here is competence

02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:58.480
I'm trying to teach you things

02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:01.200
I understand I can't teach you everything in five minutes

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:04.560
No one who's ever become good at anything worthwhile

02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:06.400
Could be taught everything in five minutes

02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:10.400
If you want to be a fully well-rounded web application developer

02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:12.000
That takes years

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
But you can actually become

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.360
Somewhat productive

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:16.640
In a few days

02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:17.840
You can have fun in a few days

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:19.760
For sure, you can have fun in a few minutes

02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:20.800
And a few hours

02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:23.040
And over time, I can teach you a little more

02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:25.360
Active record says like, yeah, yeah, all right

02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:26.720
Start to hear

02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:28.400
And then like next week

02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:30.080
We'll do a class on sequel

02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:32.640
And actually, you have this beautiful expression that I love

02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:34.800
That a great programming language

02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:37.200
Like Ruby has a soft ramp

02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:38.880
The ramp goes to infinity

02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:39.760
That's exactly right

02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:42.080
So yeah, it's super accessible

02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.280
Super easy to get started

02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:44.560
And it never stops

02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:45.200
It never stops

02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:46.160
There's always more to learn

02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:48.960
This is one of the reasons I'm still having fun programming

02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:50.160
That I'm still learning new things

02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:51.360
I can still incorporate new things

02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:53.440
The web is deep enough as a domain

02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:56.000
You're never going to learn all of it

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.840
Provide sharp knives

02:19:57.840 --> 02:19:58.560
This is a good one

02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:00.080
Because another way of saying this

02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:01.680
The opposite way of saying this

02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:03.280
The Java way of saying is

02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:05.600
Do not provide foot guns

02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:06.320
Right?

02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:08.320
I don't want to give you sharp knives

02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:09.120
You're a child

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:10.560
You can't handle a sharp knife

02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:12.000
Here's a dull butter knife

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:13.360
Cut your damn steak

02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:13.760
Right?

02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:15.280
That's a very frustrating experience

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:16.720
You want a sharp knife

02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:19.040
Even though you might be able to cut yourself

02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:22.560
I trust humans in the same way that maps trust humans

02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:25.040
Maybe you cut off a finger

02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:26.640
All right, you're not going to do that again

02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:28.640
Thankfully, there's a virtual finger

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:29.840
It's going to grow back out

02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:31.680
Your competence is going to grow

02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:34.800
It's more fun to work with sharp tools

02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:38.560
And that actually contributes to the ramp that goes to infinity

02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:39.440
To the learning

02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.760
Value integrated systems

02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:42.720
We kind of hit on that one

02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:45.600
This is rails are trying to solve the whole problem of the web

02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:47.120
Not just one little component

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:48.160
It's not leaving you

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:49.920
A bunch of pieces you have to put together

02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:50.720
Yourself

02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:52.320
Progress over stability

02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:54.080
Know what, if there's one that's dated

02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:55.440
It's probably that one

02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:59.200
At this stage rails has been incredibly stable

02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:01.840
Over many many generations

02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:04.480
The last major release rails eight

02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:06.560
Was basically a no-up upgrade

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:08.240
For anyone running rail seven

02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:10.320
Rail seven was almost a no-up upgrade

02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:12.240
For anyone running rail six

02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:15.600
I used to think it required more churn

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:17.760
To get progress

02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:20.400
To stay on the leading edge of new stuff

02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:22.640
And I wrote this

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:25.200
Before I experienced the indignity

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:28.400
Of the 2010s in the JavaScript community

02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:30.800
Where it seemed like stability

02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:32.640
Was not just unvalued

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:34.560
It was actually despised

02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:36.720
The churn in and off itself

02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:38.160
Was a value we should be pursuing

02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:40.720
Did you you were still working with the same framework

02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:41.920
Three months later

02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:43.040
You were an idiot

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:44.480
And I saw that and I actually

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:47.120
Recall that if I was going to write the doctrine today

02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:48.160
I'd write that differently

02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:50.480
I wouldn't say progress over stability

02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:53.120
Or maybe there'd be a function of the

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:55.280
Age of the programming language also

02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:58.960
Maybe or a deeper understanding of the problem

02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:01.600
I think part of what's so fascinating about technology

02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:03.040
Is that we have this perception

02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:06.240
That everything constantly moves so fast

02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:07.280
No it doesn't

02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:09.520
Everything moves at a glacial pace

02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:13.120
There is occasionally a paradigm shift

02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:15.920
Like what's happening with AI right now

02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:19.920
Like what happened with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007

02:22:19.920 --> 02:22:22.320
Like what happened with the internet in 95

02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:24.560
That's basically a total sum of my career

02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.920
Three things changed

02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:31.440
Everything else in between was incremental small improvements

02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:35.440
You can recognize a Rails application written in 2003

02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:38.400
I know because the basecamp I wrote back then

02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:41.200
Is still operating, making millions of dollars in ARR

02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:44.720
Servings and customers on the initial version that was launched back then

02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:48.240
And it looks like the Rails code if I squint a little that I would write today

02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:50.240
So most things don't change

02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:52.720
Even in computing and that's actually a good thing

02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:55.360
We saw with the JavaScript ecosystem

02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:58.880
What happens when everyone gets just mad about constant churn

02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:00.160
Things don't change that often

02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:02.480
By the way on that small tangent

02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:06.560
You just sort of visibly, verbally changed your mind

02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:09.760
With the U of 15 years ago

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:10.720
Yes

02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:12.000
That's interesting

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.240
Have you noticed yourself changing your mind

02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:16.320
Quite a bit over the years

02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:18.240
I would say

02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:19.920
Oh yes

02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:21.280
And then also oh no

02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:23.840
In the sense that there are absolutely fundamental things

02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:25.440
Both about human nature

02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:27.440
About institutions, about programming

02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:30.080
About business that I've changed my mind on

02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:33.440
And then I've also had experiences that are almost even more interesting

02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:35.840
Where I thought I had changed my mind

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.360
And I tried it a new way

02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:40.880
Realized why I had the original opinion in the first place

02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:42.560
And then gone back to it

02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:44.080
So it happens both ways

02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:45.920
An example of the later part

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:49.360
For example, was managers at 37 signals

02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:50.400
For the longest time

02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:53.360
I would rail against engineering managers

02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:56.080
As an unnecessary burden

02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:58.400
On a smaller even medium-sized company

02:23:58.400 --> 02:23:59.280
And at one point

02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:01.360
I actually started doubting myself a little bit

02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:02.560
I started thinking like

02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:03.440
You know what?

02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:07.120
Maybe all programmers do need a one-on-one therapy session

02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:09.040
Every week with their engineering manager

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:11.360
To be a whole individual

02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:12.960
So we tried that for a couple of years

02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:15.200
Where we hired some very good engineering managers

02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:16.720
Who did engineering management

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:18.000
The way you're supposed to do it

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:19.760
The way it's done all over the place

02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:22.400
And after that I thought like

02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:23.600
No

02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:24.560
No I was right

02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:25.360
This was correct

02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:26.560
We should not have had managers

02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:29.840
Not every programmer needs a therapy session

02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:31.680
With an engineering manager every week

02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:35.120
We don't need these endlessly scheduled huddles

02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:36.320
We don't need all these meetings

02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:38.720
We just need to leave people the hell alone

02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:41.120
To work on problems that they enjoy

02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:43.760
For long stretches of uninterrupted time

02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:45.680
That is where happiness is found

02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:47.280
That's where productivity is found

02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:49.120
And if you can get away with it

02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:50.480
You absolutely should

02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:53.360
Engineering management is a necessary evil

02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:54.800
When that breaks down

02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:57.120
What's the case for managers then?

02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:58.560
The case for managers is that

02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.160
If you do have a lot of people

02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:02.560
There's a bunch of work that kind of just crops up

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.000
The one-on-one is one example

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.240
That programmers need someone to check in with

02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:08.480
There's another idealized version

02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:11.600
That someone needs to guide the career of juniors for example

02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:13.680
To give them redirecting feedback

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:15.040
And all this other stuff

02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:16.880
And it's not that

02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:19.920
In the abstract I don't agree with some of those things

02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:22.720
But in practice I've found that

02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:25.440
They often create more problems that they solve

02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:28.240
And a good example here is

02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:29.920
Can you get feedback

02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:33.440
From someone who's not better at your job than you are

02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:34.480
You get some feedback

02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:36.640
You can get feedback on how you show up at work

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:38.960
Are you being courteous to others

02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:40.720
Are you being a good communicator

02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:41.760
Okay, yes

02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:42.960
But you can't get feedback on your work

02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:44.000
And that's more important

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.320
It's more important that you work under

02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:49.440
And with someone who's better at your job than you are

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:51.280
If you wish to progress in your career

02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:53.600
And every single program I've ever worked with

02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:56.080
Was far more interested in progressing in their career

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.360
On that metric

02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:58.880
Getting better at their craft

02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:01.600
Than they were in picking up pointers

02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:02.880
That

02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:04.560
A middle manager could teach them

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:06.320
That's not saying that there isn't value in it

02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:08.640
It's not saying there isn't value in being a better person

02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:09.440
Or a better communicator

02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:10.640
Of course there is all those things

02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:12.720
But if I have to choose one or the other

02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:15.360
I value competence higher

02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:17.360
Like that's again

02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:18.960
I cavit this a million times

02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:20.800
Because I know what people sometimes hear

02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:23.440
They hear the genius asshole

02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:24.320
It's just fine

02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:25.120
And that's great

02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:28.320
And you should excuse also to malicious behavior

02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:29.920
If someone is just really good at what they do

02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:31.520
I'm not saying that at all

02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:34.640
What I am saying is that the history of competence

02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:37.440
Is a history of learning from people who are better than you

02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:41.600
And that relationship should take precedence over all else

02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:44.400
And that relationship gets put aside

02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:46.960
A bit when engineering managers introduced

02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:48.160
Now the funny thing is

02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:51.600
This conversation ties back to the early things we were talking about

02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:54.160
Most engineering managers are actually former programmers

02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:56.400
They at least know programming to some extent

02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:58.880
But what I've seen time and again is that they lose their

02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:02.960
Touch their field with it very very quickly

02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:07.280
And turn into pointy haired bosses very very quickly

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:10.240
Who are really good at checking for updates

02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:12.800
Just seeing where we are on project A here

02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:15.200
If you need anything or we really should deliver to

02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:17.120
Okay yes

02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:18.480
And also no

02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:19.280
Just shut up

02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:20.560
Leave me the hell alone

02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:21.520
Let me program

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:22.640
And then I'll come up for air

02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:24.320
I'll talk with other programmers

02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:26.080
Who I can spar with

02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.040
That we can learn something with

02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:28.640
That I can turn the problems over with

02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:29.840
And we can move forward

02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:31.600
If you look back on the history of

02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:33.440
Computer industry

02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:35.280
All the great innovation that's happened

02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:37.920
It's all been done by tiny teams

02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:39.920
With no engineering managers

02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:43.520
Just full of highly skilled individuals

02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:45.280
You've had John Carmigan here

02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:48.880
I used to look up to its offer so much

02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:50.400
Not just because I love quick

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:52.240
Not just because I loved what they were doing

02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:55.440
But because he shared a bit about how the company worked

02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:56.400
There are no managers

02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:58.560
Or maybe they had one business guy doing some business stuff

02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:00.320
But that was just to get paid

02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:02.320
Everything else was basically just designers

02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:03.200
And programmers

02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:04.320
And there were about eight of them

02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.400
And they created Got Damn Quake 2

02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.800
So why do you need all these people again

02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:10.640
Why do you need all these managers again

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.600
I think again at a certain scale

02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:15.440
It does break down

02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:17.040
It's hard to just have

02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:18.720
100,000 programmers running around

02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:19.680
Wild without any

02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:21.840
Product, Mommies, or Daddies

02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:22.880
Telling them what to do

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:24.080
I understand that

02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:25.280
And then even as I say that

02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:26.560
I also don't understand it

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:28.400
Because if you look at something like Gmail for example

02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:29.920
That was like a side project

02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:31.280
Done by Bushe

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.440
At Google at the time

02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:36.720
So much of the enduring long-term value

02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:38.480
Of even all these huge companies

02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:41.120
Were created by people who didn't have a Got Damn Manager

02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:42.880
And that's not an accident

02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:44.800
That's a direct cause and effect

02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:47.600
So I've turned in some way even more militant

02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:49.840
Over the years against this notion of management

02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:50.880
At least for myself

02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:53.040
And knowing who I am and how I want to work

02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:54.640
Because the other part of this is

02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:56.000
I don't want to be manager

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
And maybe this is just me projecting the fact

02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.920
And I'm an introvert who don't like to talk to people

02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:01.760
And one on one calls every week

02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:04.480
But it also encapsulates how

02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:06.640
I was able to progress my career

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:08.560
I did not really go to the next level

02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:09.680
With Ruby or otherwise

02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:11.120
Until I had a door

02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:12.800
I could close and no one could bother me

02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:13.920
For six hours straight

02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:16.080
So in companies probably

02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:18.000
One of the reasons is

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.400
It's very easy to hire managers

02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:23.360
And managers also

02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:26.160
Delgair responsibility from you

02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:29.520
So if you just have a bunch of programmers running around

02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:30.720
Your kind of response

02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:32.960
It's work

02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:34.000
It's intellectual work

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.200
To have to deal with the first principles

02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:38.800
Of every problem that's going on

02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:40.560
So managers like

02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:41.600
You can relax

02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:42.800
I'll be taking care of

02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:46.720
But they then hire their own managers

02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:48.000
And it just multiplies them

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.200
multiplies them

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:50.000
I would love it if

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.920
Some of the great companies

02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:54.720
We have in the United States

02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:56.640
If there was like an extra side branch

02:29:56.640 --> 02:29:57.680
That we could always run

02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:00.400
Maybe physicists can come up

02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:01.920
How to split the simulation

02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:04.160
To where just all the managers are removed

02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:06.000
Also

02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:07.760
Just in that branch

02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:09.040
Just the PR and the comms

02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:10.400
People also

02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:12.000
And even the lawyers

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:13.280
Just the engineers

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:14.640
And let's just see

02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:16.240
And then we merge your back

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:17.600
I've essentially run that branch

02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:19.600
At 37 signals for 20 years

02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:21.040
And I've experimented

02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:22.720
With forking back on the other side

02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:25.120
I've experimented with having a full time lawyer on staff

02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:27.360
I've experimented with having engineering managers

02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:28.880
And I can tell you

02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:30.240
Life is much better

02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:31.760
At 50-60 people

02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:33.600
When none of those individuals

02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:34.720
Or none of those roles

02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:35.920
It's never about the individuals

02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:37.200
It's about the roles

02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:38.320
None of those roles

02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:39.840
Are in your organization full time

02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:42.320
Occasionally you need a manager

02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:44.720
Occasionally you need a lawyer

02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:46.800
I can play the role of manager

02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:47.600
Occasionally

02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:48.960
Fine

02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:51.120
And then I can set it back down to zero

02:30:51.120 --> 02:30:52.400
It's almost like the

02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:53.760
Like a cloud surface

02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:55.360
I want to manage your service

02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:58.000
I can call on for seven hours this week

02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.760
And then I want to take it down to zero

02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:00.880
For the next three months

02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:01.440
Yeah, I read

02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:02.560
I don't know if it's still the case

02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:04.240
That base camp is an LLC

02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:05.280
It doesn't have a CFO

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:07.600
Like a full time accountant

02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:08.080
Is that

02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:09.040
So was that

02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:09.920
It's obvious

02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:11.680
These days we do have a head of finance

02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:13.280
We did not for the first

02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:15.840
19 years of life

02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:17.040
I think

02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:19.120
We got away with basically just having

02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:20.560
An accountant

02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:23.360
Do our books in the same way you do a small ice cream shop

02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:24.480
Except we were

02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:26.720
Over the times I've done hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:29.280
The scale seemed quirky

02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:30.720
And at some point

02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:32.720
You can also fall in love with your own quirkiness

02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:34.720
To a degree that isn't actually healthy

02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:36.320
And I've certainly done that over time

02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:38.320
And we should have had someone mount

02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:39.840
Or count the beans

02:31:39.840 --> 02:31:40.880
A little more diligently

02:31:40.880 --> 02:31:41.840
A little earlier

02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:42.640
This was part of a

02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:45.600
Blessing of just being wildly profitable

02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:48.400
And selling software that can have infinite margins

02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:49.040
Basically

02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:50.720
Did you kind of can get away with a bunch of stuff

02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:52.160
That you perhaps shouldn't

02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:54.400
What partially taught me this lesson

02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:55.600
Was when

02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:58.160
We realized we had not been collecting sales tax

02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:01.760
In different US states where we had nexus

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:03.360
And it took us about two years

02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:04.800
And five million dollars

02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:07.600
In settlements and cleanups to get out of that mess

02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:08.800
And after that I went like

02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:10.800
Okay fine we can hire a finance person

02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:11.360
Okay

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:13.520
And we now have a wonderful finance person Ron

02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:15.120
Who actually ended up

02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:16.480
Replacing something else we used to have

02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:18.640
We used to have a full-time data analytics person

02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:20.000
Who would do all sorts of

02:32:20.960 --> 02:32:22.320
Insight mining

02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:23.920
For why are people signing up for this thing

02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:26.080
We ran that for 10 years and realized

02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:26.480
You know what

02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:28.320
If I can have either a data analytics person

02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:29.040
Or an accountant

02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:30.240
I'm picking the accountant

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:32.960
I love this so much on so many levels

02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:34.160
Can we just link on that advice

02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:35.200
That you've given

02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:37.120
That small teams are better

02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:39.680
I think that's really

02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:41.200
Less

02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:42.560
Less is

02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:43.840
More what would you say before

02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:44.800
Wres is better

02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:47.520
Okay, I'm sorry

02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:49.040
We're better on adoption

02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:50.320
With technology a lot of time

02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:50.640
Yeah

02:32:50.640 --> 02:32:52.560
And I think actually comes out of the same thing

02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:54.400
It comes out of the fact that

02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:56.640
Many of the great breakthroughs

02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:57.760
Are created by

02:32:57.760 --> 02:32:58.880
Not even just tiny teams

02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:00.320
But individuals

02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:02.080
Individuals writing something

02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:02.800
And

02:33:02.800 --> 02:33:04.400
In individual writing something

02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:06.000
On some parameter

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:07.520
What they do is worse

02:33:07.520 --> 02:33:08.480
Of course it's worse

02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:10.800
When one person has to make something

02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:12.080
That a huge company

02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:12.880
Have hundreds

02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:14.080
If not thousands of developers

02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:14.960
That they can have

02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:15.920
Work on that problem

02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:18.240
But in so many other parameters

02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:20.560
That worseness is the value

02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:22.720
That less is the value

02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:23.760
In getting real

02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:25.360
Which we wrote back in 2006

02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:27.840
We talk about this notion of less software

02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:30.240
When we first got started with base camp

02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:31.360
Back in 2004

02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:32.720
People would ask us all the time

02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:35.520
Aren't you petrified of Microsoft

02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:37.200
They have so many more resources

02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:39.120
They have so many more programmers

02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:42.240
What if they take a liking to your little niche here

02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:43.200
And they show up

02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:46.400
And they just throw a thousand programmers at the problem

02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:47.600
And my answer

02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:49.120
Perhaps partly

02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:51.600
Because I was like 24

02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:52.400
Was first of all

02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:54.160
No, no care in the world

02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:55.680
But the real answer was

02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:57.200
They're not going to produce the same thing

02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:58.880
You cannot produce the kind of software

02:33:58.880 --> 02:33:59.760
That base camp is

02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:02.000
With a team of a thousand people

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
You will build the kind of software

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
That a thousand people builds

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.640
And that's not the same thing at all

02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:11.760
So so much of the main breakthrough

02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:13.120
In both end user systems

02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:15.280
But also in open source systems

02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:16.160
In fundamental systems

02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:17.360
They're done by individuals

02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:18.880
Or very small teams

02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:22.880
Even all these classical histories of Apple

02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:23.920
Has always been like

02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.440
Well, there's a big organization

02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:26.560
But then you had the team

02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:27.840
That was actually working on the breakthrough

02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:28.880
It was four people

02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:29.920
It was eight people

02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:31.520
It was never 200

02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:35.920
And the large team seems to slow things down

02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:36.960
Yes

02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:38.160
It's so fascinating

02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:40.240
Part of it is the manager thing

02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:42.320
Because humans don't scale

02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:44.320
Communication between humans

02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:45.520
Certainly don't scale

02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:48.480
You basically get the network cost effect

02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:50.320
Every time you add a new node

02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:51.680
It goes up exponentially

02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:54.080
This is

02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:55.520
Perhaps the key thing

02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:57.840
Of why I get to be so fond

02:34:57.840 --> 02:34:59.040
Of having no managers

02:34:59.040 --> 02:34:59.920
At base camp

02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:01.840
Because our default team size is two

02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:04.240
One programmer

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:05.440
One designer

02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:06.240
One feature

02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:09.200
When you're operating at that level of scale

02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:11.040
You don't need sophistication

02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:14.320
You don't need advanced methodologies

02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:16.400
You don't need multiple layers of management

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:18.240
Because you can just do

02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:19.840
The magic of small teams

02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:21.040
Is that they just do

02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:22.480
They don't have to argue

02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:24.160
Because we don't have to set direction

02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:26.160
We have to worry about the roadmap

02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:28.560
We can just sit down and make something

02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:29.760
And then see if it's good

02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:31.600
When you can get away with just making things

02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:32.480
You don't have to plan

02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:35.040
And if you can get out of planning

02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:37.920
You can follow the truth

02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:40.160
That emerges from the code

02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:40.880
From the product

02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:42.320
From the thing you're working on

02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:43.120
In the moment

02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:46.800
You know far more about what the great next step is

02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:48.320
When you're one step behind

02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:50.000
Rather than if you try

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.520
18 months in advance

02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:52.960
To map out all the steps

02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:55.200
How do we get from here to very far away

02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:56.640
You know what?

02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:58.960
That's difficult to imagine in advance

02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:01.520
Because humans are very poor at that

02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:04.320
Maybe AI one day will be much better than us

02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:06.960
But humans can take one foot

02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:08.480
Or put one foot in front of each other

02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:09.200
That's not that hard

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.560
And that allows you to get away

02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:14.080
With all that sophistication

02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:15.840
So the process has become much simpler

02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:17.120
You need far fewer people

02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:17.840
It compounds

02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:19.840
You need much less process

02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:22.080
You need to waste less time in meetings

02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:23.680
You can just spend these long

02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:25.760
Glorious days and weeks

02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:26.880
Of uninterrupted times

02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:28.080
Solving real problems

02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:29.840
You care about and that are valuable

02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:31.840
And you're going to find that

02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:33.760
That's what the market actually wants

02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:35.520
No one is buying something

02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:37.600
Because there's a huge company behind it

02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:38.480
Most of the time

02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:40.400
They're buying something because it's good

02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:42.160
And the way you get something good is

02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:46.160
You don't set it around to have a meal

02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:46.640
About it

02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:47.520
You try stuff

02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:48.320
You build stuff

02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:49.920
It really is kind of incredible

02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:50.960
One person

02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:53.200
Honestly one person can do

02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.600
In 100 hours of deep work

02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:57.120
Of focused work

02:36:57.120 --> 02:36:58.240
Even less

02:36:58.240 --> 02:36:59.440
So I'll tell you this

02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:01.680
I tracked exactly the number of hours

02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:03.440
I spend on the first version of base camp

02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:05.840
And I was doing this because at the time I was working

02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:07.680
On a contract basis

02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:08.960
For Jason

02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:10.400
He was paying me

02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:12.160
I was going to say $15 an hour

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:12.960
That's what I got paid

02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:13.680
When we first got started

02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:16.080
I think he had bumped my pay to a glorious 25

02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:18.400
But I was billing him

02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:20.000
And I know that the invoice

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.800
For the first version of base camp was $400

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:24.000
That's what it took

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.320
For one sole individual

02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:28.000
In 2004

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.520
To create an entire system

02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:30.400
That has then gone on

02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:32.160
To gross hundreds of millions of dollars

02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:35.520
And continues to do extremely well

02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:36.560
One person

02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:38.560
Just me setting up everything

02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:39.680
Part of that story is

02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:40.720
Ruby, part of that story

02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:41.200
Rails

02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:42.880
But a lot of it is also just

02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:44.560
Me plus Jason

02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:46.240
Plus Ryan plus Matt

02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:48.960
That was the entire company at the time

02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:51.280
And we could create something

02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:53.200
Of sheer sustaining value

02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:54.400
With such a tiny team

02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:55.840
Because we were a tiny team

02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:57.120
Not despite of

02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:58.800
Small is not a stepping stone

02:37:58.800 --> 02:37:59.600
This is the other thing

02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:01.360
That people get into their head

02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:03.040
This is one of the big topics

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:04.480
Out of rework

02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:06.000
That it gave entrepreneurs

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:07.440
The permission to embrace

02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:09.280
Being a small team

02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:10.640
Not as a waypoint

02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:12.400
Not as like I'm trying to become

02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:14.080
A thousand people

02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:16.080
No, I actually like being a small team

02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:17.520
Small teams are more fun

02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:18.800
If you ask almost anyone

02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:21.440
I'm sure Toby would say this too

02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:23.040
Even at his scale

02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:25.360
The sheer enjoyment of building something

02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:28.560
Is in the enjoyment of building it with a tiny team

02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:30.320
Now you can have impact

02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:31.440
At a different scale

02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:32.400
When you have a huge company

02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:33.360
I fully recognize that

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:35.280
And I see the appeal of it

02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:37.040
But in the actual building of things

02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:38.640
It's always small teams

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:39.600
Always

02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:41.280
How do you protect the small team

02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:43.120
Basecamp says successfully

02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:44.080
Stayed small

02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:46.720
It's been the dragon you had to fight off

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:49.280
That like basically you make a lot of money

02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:52.320
There's a temptation to grow

02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:54.320
So how do you not grow

02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:56.320
Don't take venture capital

02:38:57.200 --> 02:38:58.800
Okay, that is the point

02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:00.000
Point number one

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.280
Point number two is

02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:02.560
Everybody takes venture capital

02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:03.520
So you're ready

02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:04.960
You're ready what

02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:06.960
I mean that's been the the answer for the longest time

02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:08.560
Because the problem isn't just venture capital

02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:10.240
It's other people's money

02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:12.160
One should take other people's money

02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:13.520
Completely understandably

02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:14.560
They want a return

02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:17.120
And they would prefer to have the largest return possible

02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:18.320
Because not them

02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:19.440
Sitting in the code

02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:21.200
Not them getting the daily satisfaction

02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:22.240
Out of building something

02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:24.000
Chiseling beautiful

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.840
Code poems out of the editor

02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:27.520
Right they don't get that satisfaction

02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:28.480
They get the satisfaction

02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:30.640
Maybe of seeing something nice put into the world

02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:31.440
That's fair

02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:34.160
But they certainly also get a satisfaction of a higher return

02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:35.920
And there is this sense

02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:36.640
Certainly

02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:37.600
Inventure capital

02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:38.160
Stated

02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:39.280
Inventure capital

02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:41.360
That the whole point of you taking the money

02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:43.760
Is to get to a billion dollars or more

02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:44.560
Now

02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:46.000
The path to that

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:47.360
Usually does go through

02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:49.440
Running established playbooks

02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:50.960
And when it comes to software

02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:52.480
The enterprise sales playbook

02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:53.200
Is

02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:54.320
That playbook

02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:55.600
If you're doing B2B

02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:57.280
Software ass

02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:58.160
You will

02:39:58.160 --> 02:39:59.600
Try to find product market fit

02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:00.640
And the second you have it

02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:03.360
You will abandon your small and medium sized accounts

02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:04.960
To chase the big whales

02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:06.480
With a huge sales force

02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:08.640
And by then you're a thousand people in life sucks

02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:09.920
Uh-huh

02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:10.880
That said

02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:11.760
You uh

02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:13.760
I mean people are just curious about this

02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:15.760
I've gotten the chance

02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:17.280
To get to know each other

02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:19.040
He invested

02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:21.040
In base camp

02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:22.560
Not controlling

02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:24.400
He bought secondaries

02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:25.920
So this was the funny thing

02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:27.280
Is that when

02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:29.280
Investing have these two dual meanings

02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:30.960
Normally when people think about investing

02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:33.360
They think you're putting in growth

02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:34.480
Growth capital

02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:36.720
Because you want the business to hire more people

02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:37.920
To do more R&Ds

02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:39.440
That can grow bigger

02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:40.960
Basis didn't do that actually

02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:43.280
He bought a ownership stake

02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:44.800
Directly from Jason and I

02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:46.720
And 100% of the pro

02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:47.600
Pro seats of that

02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:49.040
Purchase went into

02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:50.800
My and Jason's bank account

02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:52.000
Personal bank account

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.360
Not a single cent

02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:55.360
Went into the account of the company

02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:57.200
Because we didn't need the money to grow

02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:58.720
Well, we needed

02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:00.880
Or what we certainly enjoyed

02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:02.480
Was

02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:04.720
To some extent maybe the vote of confidence

02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:07.040
But more so

02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:10.400
The security of taking a little bit off the table

02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:11.360
So that we

02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:14.480
Dare turn down the big bucks from venture couples

02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:16.640
It was essentially a vaccine

02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:19.200
Against wanting to take a larger check

02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:21.600
From people who then wanted to take the company

02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:24.080
To something enormous that we didn't want to go with it

02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:26.320
So Jeff

02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:28.160
Gabe Jason or I just enough money

02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:29.680
That we were comfortable

02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:31.200
Turning all these people down

02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:34.080
In a way where if it had turned belly up

02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:35.120
Like six months later

02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:36.640
We wouldn't have been kicking ourselves

02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:38.400
And gone and we had something here

02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:39.920
That was worth millions

02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:41.440
And now we have nothing

02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:44.160
And I have to worry about rent and groceries again

02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:45.520
It is a vote of confidence

02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:46.880
I wonder from

02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:49.760
I'd love to hear just side of the story

02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.520
Of like why

02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:53.920
Because he he doesn't need like the money

02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:57.680
So it's really I think it probably is

02:41:57.680 --> 02:41:59.040
Just believing in people

02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:01.040
And wanting to have cool stuff

02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:02.560
Be creative in the world

02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:03.760
And make money off of it

02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:04.800
But not like

02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:05.760
A hundred percent

02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:08.240
The motivation for Jeff was in a return

02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:10.480
Because he actually has a team

02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:12.880
He's just private office

02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:14.480
That runs these investments

02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:17.440
Who did the calculus on the investment pitch

02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:18.400
We gave him

02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:20.000
Which was so ridiculous

02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:22.320
That Jason and I were laughing our asses off

02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:24.640
When we were writing down our metrics

02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:26.080
I was like no one's going to pay this

02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:28.080
No one is going to give us this multiple

02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:29.840
Of this amount of revenue

02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:30.800
And that's fine

02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:32.720
I mean we took the call

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:33.840
Essentially out of

02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:35.760
Kind of an awe

02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:37.920
The Jeff Bezos even wanted to look at us

02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:38.640
And like do you know what

02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:39.520
We don't want Vegicabra

02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:40.880
We don't need other people's money

02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:43.200
But like let's just give him a bullshit number

02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:45.280
The no sane person would actually say yes to

02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:47.920
And then I mean we can we can each go our own way

02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:49.120
And his investment team said

02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:50.240
Like Jeff no way

02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:52.160
This makes no economic sense at all

02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:53.680
They're asking for way too much money

02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:55.360
With way too little revenue

02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:56.240
And Jeff just went like

02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:56.720
I don't care

02:42:56.720 --> 02:42:58.000
I want to invest in these guys

02:42:58.000 --> 02:42:59.280
Because to him at the time

02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:01.040
It was a jump change right

02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:03.600
Like Jason and I each got a few million dollars

02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:05.920
I mean whatever the currency swing

02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:07.520
Between the yen and the dollar

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:09.600
That day probably move 10x

02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:10.720
That for his network

02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:12.320
Then our investment did

02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:14.400
Jeff's seen genuinely interested in

02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:17.280
Being around interesting people

02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:19.280
Interesting companies helping

02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:20.480
Someone go to distance

02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:22.560
And I actually

02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:24.240
Look back on that relationship

02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:25.840
With some degree of regret

02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:28.080
Because I took that

02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:29.680
Vote of confidence for granted

02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:31.680
In ways that I'm a little bit ashamed of

02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:33.440
Over the years I've been

02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:35.280
More critical about some of the things

02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:36.720
That Amazon had done

02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:40.160
That I feel now is sort of justified

02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:43.120
So that's just sort of part of that processing

02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:45.680
Of it but on the economic sense

02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:48.480
He gave us that confidence

02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:49.680
He gave us the economic confidence

02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:52.000
But then he also gave us the confidence

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:53.520
Of a CEO running

02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:55.520
Perhaps at the time the most important

02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:57.520
Internet business in the US

02:43:58.320 --> 02:43:59.520
Showing up to our calls

02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:02.000
Which we would have with him like once a year

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.520
And basically just going like

02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:05.040
Yeah, you guys are doing awesome stuff

02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:06.640
You should just keep doing awesome stuff

02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:07.520
I read your book

02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:08.240
It's awesome

02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:09.120
You launched this thing

02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:09.600
It's awesome

02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:10.640
You should just do more of that

02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:12.000
I don't actually know how to run your business

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:12.640
You guys know

02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:13.520
So the book was out

02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:16.640
I'm just sort of from a fan perspective

02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:21.280
I'm curious about how Jeff Bezos was able to see

02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:22.960
Because to me you're adjacent like

02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:25.120
Special humans in the space of tech

02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:27.280
And the fact that Jeff was able to see that

02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:27.680
Right

02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:29.120
How hard is it to see that

02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:30.720
He certainly saw it very early

02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:32.480
And I think this is something that Jeff does

02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:34.160
Better than almost anyone else

02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:36.560
He spots that opportunity

02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:37.680
So far in advance

02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:39.760
Of anyone else even opened their eyes to it

02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:42.160
Or certainly is willing to bet on it

02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:45.040
Far early and far harder than anyone else is

02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:47.040
And he's just right time and again

02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:49.680
I mean we were not the only investment that he made

02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:55.520
And certainly Amazon had an extremely long-term vision

02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:59.840
So far longer than I have ever had the gumption to keep

02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:02.400
Like I think of myself as a long-term thinker

02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:04.400
I'm playing a child's game

02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:06.240
Compared to the game that Jeff is playing

02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:08.000
Like when I looked at

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.800
Amazon's economics around the .com boom and bust

02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:12.160
They looked ridiculous

02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:13.920
Like they were losing so much money

02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:15.600
They were so hated by the market

02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:18.720
They were no one believed that it was going to turn into what it is

02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:19.680
But Jeff did

02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:22.000
In a way that that level of conviction

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:23.120
I really aspire to

02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:26.000
And I think that's one of the main things I've taken away

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:27.520
From that relationship

02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:30.480
Is that you can just believe in yourself

02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:32.080
To that degree

02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:33.760
Against those odds

02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:35.120
That's ridiculous

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:38.400
He did that at so many times our level

02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:40.880
That it's pathetic if I'm doubting myself

02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:45.360
Yeah I think Amazon is one of those companies

02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:49.440
I mean it's coming under a bunch of criticism over the years

02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:54.080
This is something about humans that don't appreciate so much

02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:57.120
That we take for granted the positive that a thing brings

02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:00.400
Real quick and then we just start criticizing the thing

02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:02.400
It's with the Wi-Fi and the airplanes

02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:03.360
That's exactly

02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:05.280
But I think I think Amazon

02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:07.680
There could be a case made

02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:10.240
That Amazon is

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.800
One of the greatest companies in the last 100 years

02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:17.200
Sure I think it's an easy case to make

02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:19.440
What I also think is that

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.720
The price you pay to be one of the greatest companies

02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:24.000
Than the last 100 years

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.240
Is a lot of the tractors

02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:27.280
A lot of pushback

02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:28.640
A lot of criticism

02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:31.920
That this is actually order restored in the universe

02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:35.440
One of my favorite teachers in all the time I've been on the internet

02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:36.960
Is Kathy Sierra

02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:38.480
I don't know if you know her work

02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:39.920
But she was actually burned

02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:43.280
If you've short years before the cruel internet ran her off

02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:45.920
But she wrote a blog called Creating Passioned Users

02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:49.280
And she carved into my brain

02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:52.000
This notion of balance in the universe

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:53.760
If you're creating something of value

02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:55.360
That a lot of people love

02:46:56.080 --> 02:46:58.320
You must create an equal

02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:00.960
An opposite force of haters

02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:03.360
You cannot have people who love what you do

02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:05.680
Without also having people who hate what you do

02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:08.320
The only escape from that is mediocrity

02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:11.120
If you are so boring and so uninteresting

02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:13.200
That no one gives a damn whether you exist or not

02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:14.880
Yeah, you don't get the haters

02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:18.160
But you also don't get the impact of people who really enjoy your work

02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:21.200
And I think Amazon is that just at the massive scale

02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:24.320
Right, they brought so much value and change

02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:27.120
To technology, to commerce

02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:30.800
That they must simply have a black hole size of haters

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:33.280
Otherwise, the universe is simply going to tip over

02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:36.560
Let me ask you about small teams

02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:39.120
So you mentioned Jason a bunch of times, Jason Fried

02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:42.080
You have been partners for a long, long time

02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:45.120
Perhaps it's fair to say he's more in the sort of the design

02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:48.960
Business side and you're like the tech, the engineering wizard

02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:52.080
How have you guys over all these years

02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:55.200
Creating so many amazing products not murder each other

02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:57.680
It's a great story of like partnership

02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:00.560
What's what can you say about collaboration

02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:04.880
What can you say about Jason the that you love that you've learned from

02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:07.440
Why does this work?

02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:11.440
So first I'll say we have tried to murder each other several times over the years

02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:14.560
But far less I think in the last decade

02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:17.760
In the early days our product

02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:21.600
Discussions were so fierce

02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:24.160
Then when we were having them in the office

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:26.320
And there were other employees around

02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:29.840
Some of them were legitimately worried that the company was about to fall apart

02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:34.400
Because the volume coming out of the room

02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:38.000
Would be so high and sound so acrimonious

02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:42.000
That they were legitimately worried the whole thing was going to fall apart

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.920
But you know what's funny is that it never felt like that in the moment

02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:51.760
It always felt like just a peak vigorous search for something better

02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:59.360
And that we were able to stomach that level of adversity

02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:04.640
On the merits of an idea because it was about the idea

02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:08.640
It wasn't about the person and it never really got

02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:11.840
Personal not even never really it didn't get personal

02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:14.400
It wasn't like Jason you're an asshole

02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:16.480
It was like Jason you're an idiot

02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:19.600
And you're an idiot because you're looking at this problem the wrong way

02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:21.200
And let me tell you the right way to do it

02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:24.320
As a small tangent let me say that some people have said

02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:28.240
They'll probably return to this that you're sometimes

02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:34.560
Can have flights of temper on the internet and so on

02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:37.760
I never take it that way because it is the same kind of

02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:39.680
Ilk maybe I haven't seen the right kind of

02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:45.440
Traces of temper but usually it's about the idea and it's just excited passionate human

02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:48.720
That's exactly what I like to think of it

02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:50.640
It doesn't always come across as that

02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:53.680
And I can see why spectators in particular sometimes

02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:58.880
Would see something that looks like I'm going after the man rather than the ball

02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:02.160
And I do think I've tried to get better at that

02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:04.320
But in my relationship with Jason

02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:09.760
I think it's worked so well because we have our own distinct areas of competence

02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:11.760
Where we fully trust each other

02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:15.520
Jason trust me to make the correct technical decisions

02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:19.680
I trust him to make the correct design and product direction decisions

02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:22.560
And then we can overlap and share on the business

02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:25.760
Unmarketing on writing on other aspects of it

02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:28.240
So that's one thing is that

02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:32.160
If you're starting a business with someone where you do exactly the same as they do

02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:34.560
And you're constantly contesting

02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:36.480
Who's the more competent person?

02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:40.160
I think that's far more difficult and far more volatile

02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:44.000
So if you're starting a business and you're both programmers and you both work on the same kind of programming

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.160
Ah good luck

02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:49.120
I think that's hard

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:52.080
I tried to pick an easier path working with a designer

02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:55.280
Where I knew that at least half of the time

02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:58.720
I could just delegate to his experience and competence and say

02:50:58.720 --> 02:50:59.440
Like do you know what?

02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:01.920
I may have an opinion, I have an opinion all the time on design

02:51:02.720 --> 02:51:05.760
But I don't have to win the argument because I trust you

02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:10.400
Now occasionally we would have overlaps on business or direction

02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:13.840
Where we'd both feel like we had a strong stake in the game

02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:17.280
And we both had a claim to competence in that area

02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:22.480
But then for whatever reason we also both had a long-term vision

02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:23.920
Where I would go, do you know what?

02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:25.280
I think we're wrong here

02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:27.520
But as I learned from Jeff Bezos by the way

02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:29.280
I'm going to disagree and commit

02:51:29.280 --> 02:51:31.120
That was one of those early lessons he gave us

02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:32.400
That was absolute accruation

02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:38.320
Perhaps even instrumental in ensuring that Jason and I have been working together for a quarter of a century

02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:42.160
Disagree in commit is one of the all-time Jeff Bezos grades

02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:45.440
I'm just surprised that Yoko Ono hasn't come along

02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:51.280
You know what I mean like there's so many Yoko's in this world

02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:54.320
It might have happened if not in part

02:51:54.320 --> 02:51:56.960
Because we don't sit on each other's lap all the time

02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:00.800
Most of our careers we haven't even lived in the same city

02:52:01.760 --> 02:52:04.080
Like I lived in Chicago for a couple of years

02:52:04.080 --> 02:52:07.680
While we were getting going after it moved to the US in 2005

02:52:07.680 --> 02:52:09.920
But then I moved to Malibu and then I lived in Spain

02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:12.320
And then I lived in Copenhagen and Jason Rye

02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:15.120
From the foundation of our relationship

02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:18.080
Learned how to work together

02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:23.280
In a remarkably efficient way where we didn't have to actually talk that much

02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:27.120
On any given week I'd be surprised if Jason and I spent more than

02:52:27.920 --> 02:52:32.800
Two hours of direct exchange and communication

02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:35.840
Yeah sometimes it's the basic human frictions

02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:38.640
Yes I think you can rob up against another person

02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:41.520
That person damn well better be your spouse

02:52:41.520 --> 02:52:42.800
If it's too much for too long

02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:43.760
Yeah but even there

02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:44.400
Even there

02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:46.880
COVID has really touched the relationship

02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:47.920
It was fascinating to watch

02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:48.800
It has

02:52:48.800 --> 02:52:51.200
And I do think that having some separation

02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:52.640
Which is kind of counterintuitive

02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:54.240
Because I think a lot of people think

02:52:54.240 --> 02:52:56.640
The more collaboration you can have the better

02:52:56.640 --> 02:52:59.200
The more ideas they can bounce back and forth the better

02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:01.360
And both Jason and I for whatever reason

02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:03.120
Came to the conclusion early on in careers

02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:04.080
Absolutely not

02:53:04.080 --> 02:53:05.920
That's completely below me

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:09.120
This is why we were huge proponents of remote work

02:53:09.120 --> 02:53:12.720
This is why I enjoy working in my home office

02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:16.960
Where I can close the door and not see another human for like six hours at the time

02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:19.440
I don't want to bounce ideas off you all the time

02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:21.840
I want to bounce ideas off you occasionally

02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:24.320
And then I want to go off and implement those ideas

02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:26.720
There's way too much bouncing going off

02:53:26.720 --> 02:53:28.800
And not enough scoring, not not dunking

02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:34.480
And I think this is one of the great traps of executive rule

02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:39.200
Once a founder elevates themselves all the way up to an executive

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:41.360
Where what they're doing is just telling other people what to do

02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:44.160
That's the realm they live in 24-7

02:53:44.160 --> 02:53:45.680
They just live in the idea realm

02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:47.920
Oh I can just tell more people more things what to do

02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:48.880
And we can just see it happen

02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:51.200
If you actually have to be part of implementing that

02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:52.240
You slow your horse

02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:53.120
You think like do you know what?

02:53:53.120 --> 02:53:54.640
I had a good idea last week

02:53:55.280 --> 02:53:57.680
I'm going to save the rest of my good ideas until next month

02:53:58.480 --> 02:54:00.400
There is a temptation for the managers

02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:02.640
And for the people in the executive

02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:06.400
layer to do something

02:54:06.400 --> 02:54:08.480
Which that's something usually means a meeting

02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:09.280
Yes

02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:10.880
And so that's why you say

02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:12.880
Their job is telling other people what to do

02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:13.520
Yeah

02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:14.480
And the meeting

02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:16.640
So this is one of the big things you're against

02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:18.480
It's meetings of toxic

02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:18.880
Yeah

02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:22.480
And this really I think ties into this with Jason Rye

02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:25.360
If I had to count out the total number of meetings

02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:28.320
We've had in 24 years of collaborations

02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:31.920
Where we in person sat in front of each other and discussed a topic

02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:34.720
I probably it'd be less than whatever three months

02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:35.760
Out of a fan company

02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:38.080
We just haven't done that that much

02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:39.520
We haven't worn it out

02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:41.520
One of this funny metaphors

02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:44.480
That Trump came up with at one point

02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:48.320
Was a human has like a limited number of steps in their life

02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:48.560
Right

02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:50.480
Like that's the longevity argument here

02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:52.080
You can do so much activity

02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:52.800
And then you run out

02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:55.120
There's some kernel in that idea

02:54:55.120 --> 02:54:56.800
That can be applied to relationship

02:54:56.800 --> 02:54:59.120
There's some amount of exchange we can have

02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:01.760
There's some amount of the time we can spend together

02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:03.760
Where you can wear it out

02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:07.920
Jason Rye were diligent about not wearing each other out

02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:12.000
And I think that is absolutely key to the longevity of the relationship

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.240
Combined with that level of trust

02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:15.760
And then just combining

02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:18.000
With the level that we really like to work itself

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:19.920
We don't just like the brainstorming

02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:22.640
This says where we just come up with good ideas

02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:24.400
Now we like to do the ideas

02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:27.200
And we like to be part of that process directly ourselves

02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:28.000
I like to program

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:29.360
We like to do design

02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:32.400
We can go off and do our little things for long stretches of time

02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:33.760
In case you come together and go like

02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:35.360
Hey, let's launch a great product

02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:37.200
This might sound like

02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:38.800
I'm asking you to do therapy

02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:41.920
But I find myself

02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:45.120
Just sometimes want or long for a meeting

02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:48.240
Because I'm lonely

02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:51.680
Like because remote work is just sitting by yourself

02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:53.440
I don't know

02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:54.720
You can get really lonely

02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:56.480
For long stretches of time

02:55:56.560 --> 02:55:58.240
Let me give you a tip

02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:01.120
Get a wife

02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:02.160
That's good

02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:03.040
Damn it

02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:04.560
Get a couple of kits

02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:04.960
No

02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:07.280
My family really is the great antidote

02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:08.400
Too loneliness

02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:11.520
And I mean that as sincerely as I can possibly say it

02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:14.000
I certainly had exactly that feeling

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:14.960
You described

02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:16.880
Early in my career when I was working remotely

02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:18.400
And I was just like

02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:20.800
Me living in an apartment

02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:22.560
A total stereotype

02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:24.800
Where for the longest time when I first moved to Chicago

02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:27.120
All I had on the floor was a mattress

02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:28.560
And then I bought this big TV

02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:29.680
And I didn't even mount it

02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:31.680
And then I had a stack of DVDs

02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:33.040
And I was basically

02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:34.960
I was working a lot of time

02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:37.680
And then I would just go home and I'd do that

02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:39.680
And it wasn't great

02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:40.880
It really wasn't

02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:43.440
Like I do think that humans need humans

02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:45.360
And if you can't get them at work

02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:47.440
And I actually sort of kind of don't want them at work

02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:49.280
At least I don't want them for 40 hours a week

02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:50.880
That's not what I prefer

02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:51.760
You need something else

02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:53.360
You need other relationships in your life

02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:54.960
And there's no greater

02:56:54.960 --> 02:56:56.160
Depth of relationship

02:56:56.160 --> 02:56:57.440
If you can find someone

02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:00.080
That you actually just want to spend a lot of time with

02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:00.800
That's key to it

02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:02.320
And I think it's key for both generations

02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:03.760
And I think that

02:57:03.760 --> 02:57:05.040
We've had families

02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:06.240
For quite a long time

02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:08.960
And it grounds you to in a way

02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:12.240
Where the sprint of a startup

02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:14.320
Can get traded in

02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:17.440
For the marathon of an enduring company

02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:19.440
And you get settled in a way

02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:20.800
We talk briefly about

02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:22.080
Sometimes I get fired up

02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:23.120
A lot of times

02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:26.320
Maybe even most of the times I get fired up about topics

02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:28.400
But I don't get fired up in the same way

02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:29.360
Now

02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:31.280
As I used to when I was 24

02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:31.920
I'm still like

02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:33.760
Extremely passionate about ideas

02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:35.120
And trying to find the right things

02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:35.840
But

02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:37.040
Having a family

02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:39.040
Meeting my wife

02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:40.240
Building a life

02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:42.640
Around that

02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:43.680
Has just

02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:44.960
Mellowed everything out

02:57:44.960 --> 02:57:47.440
In a completely cliche way

02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:49.120
But

02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:49.760
It

02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:51.040
I think it's actually key

02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:53.440
I think if we could get more

02:57:53.440 --> 02:57:55.200
Even younger people

02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:57.040
Not to wait until they were in the late

02:57:57.040 --> 02:57:59.120
Got them 30s or early 40s

02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:01.600
To hitch up with someone

02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:02.400
We'd be better off

02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:04.080
And we'd have more stable

02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:05.920
Business relationships as well

02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:07.040
Because

02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:08.480
Folks would get that

02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:10.160
Nurturing human

02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:11.040
Relations somewhere else

02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:12.720
Now when I say all of that

02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:15.280
I also accept that there are plenty of great businesses

02:58:15.280 --> 02:58:16.800
That's been built over the years

02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:17.920
That have not been built remote

02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:19.760
That have been built by

02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:20.800
A gang of hooligans

02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:22.640
Sitting in an office for

02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:23.680
In men's hours of time

02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:24.960
I mean both John Carmack

02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:26.800
And Tim Sweeney talked about that

02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:28.400
In the 90s with their careers

02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:29.840
That that was just basically

02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:31.040
Worked sleep

02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:32.800
Hangout with the guys at the office

02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:33.520
Right

02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:35.200
A totally fair

02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:36.560
That never appealed to me

02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:37.840
Both Jason and I

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:39.440
Saw eye to eye on the idea

02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:41.120
That 40 hours a week

02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:42.160
Dedicated to work

02:58:42.160 --> 02:58:43.520
Was enough

02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:45.120
That if we were going to go to distance

02:58:45.120 --> 02:58:46.320
For not just

02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:47.680
The five to seven years

02:58:47.680 --> 02:58:51.200
It takes to build a VC case up to an exit

02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:53.040
But for potentially 10 years

02:58:53.040 --> 02:58:55.040
20 years or further

02:58:55.040 --> 02:58:56.560
We needed to become

02:58:56.560 --> 02:58:57.760
Whole humans

02:58:57.760 --> 02:58:59.760
Because the only that

02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:01.040
Whole humanness

02:59:01.040 --> 02:59:02.320
Was going to go to distance

02:59:02.320 --> 02:59:04.320
Which included building up

02:59:04.320 --> 02:59:05.920
Friendships outside of work

02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:07.920
Having hobbies

02:59:08.720 --> 02:59:09.920
Finding

02:59:09.920 --> 02:59:10.960
A mate

02:59:10.960 --> 02:59:12.800
And having a family

02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:13.600
And

02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:15.600
That

02:59:15.600 --> 02:59:17.600
Entire

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:19.360
Existence

02:59:19.360 --> 02:59:20.800
Legs of the stool

02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:23.200
That work is not the only thing in life

02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:25.280
Is completely

02:59:25.280 --> 02:59:28.960
Related to the fact that we've been around for 25 years

02:59:28.960 --> 02:59:30.320
There's way too much

02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:31.840
Especially in America

02:59:31.840 --> 02:59:33.600
Of false trade-offs

02:59:33.600 --> 02:59:35.440
Or you want to build a successful business

02:59:35.440 --> 02:59:37.200
Well you can either have

02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:38.560
Money, enjoyment

02:59:38.560 --> 02:59:40.720
Family or health pick one

02:59:40.720 --> 02:59:41.520
What

02:59:41.520 --> 02:59:42.800
Why do we have to give up

02:59:42.800 --> 02:59:43.600
All of this

02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:44.640
Now

02:59:44.800 --> 02:59:45.840
I'm not saying

02:59:45.840 --> 02:59:47.360
And there are moments

02:59:47.360 --> 02:59:49.200
Prayers in life where you can sprint

02:59:49.200 --> 02:59:50.240
But I am saying

02:59:50.240 --> 02:59:52.800
If that sprint turns into a decade

02:59:52.800 --> 02:59:54.320
You're going to pay for it

02:59:54.320 --> 02:59:55.920
And you're going to pay for it in ways

02:59:55.920 --> 02:59:58.080
I've seen time and again

02:59:58.080 --> 03:00:00.080
Seemed like a very bad trade

03:00:00.080 --> 03:00:01.200
That even if it works

03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:03.200
And by the way most of the time it does not

03:00:03.200 --> 03:00:05.040
Most of the time startups go bust

03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:07.440
Most of the time people spend five, seven years

03:00:07.440 --> 03:00:09.280
Or something that does not pan out

03:00:09.280 --> 03:00:11.280
And they don't get the payout

03:00:11.280 --> 03:00:12.880
And then they just sit with regret

03:00:12.880 --> 03:00:16.560
Of like what the fuck happened to my 20s

03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:17.440
Early on it

03:00:17.440 --> 03:00:19.760
Jason and I basically made the pact

03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:22.800
That working together was not going to lead to that kind of regret

03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:25.440
That we were going to allow ourselves and each other

03:00:25.440 --> 03:00:29.200
To build a whole life outside of work

03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:31.760
And

03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:33.600
The fact that that worked

03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:36.080
Is something I feel

03:00:36.080 --> 03:00:37.920
Is almost like forbidden knowledge

03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:40.080
Certainly in technology circles in the US

03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:42.480
It's something that we've tried with championed for 20 years

03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:45.520
And we still get slacked for just two days ago

03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:48.480
I had another Twitter beef with someone saying like

03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:49.840
Oh well, okay, maybe it worked

03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:51.440
But you didn't turn into Atlassian

03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:52.320
So you're failure

03:00:52.320 --> 03:00:54.320
You Basecamp isn't Jira

03:00:54.320 --> 03:00:56.320
So why are you even bothering

03:00:56.320 --> 03:00:58.320
And it's such a

03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:01.360
Fascinating winner takes all mentality

03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:04.400
That unless you dominate everyone else

03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:06.640
In all the ways you've lost

03:01:06.640 --> 03:01:08.720
When so much of life

03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:11.360
Is far more open

03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:13.040
To multiple winners

03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:14.880
Where we can end up with the business

03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:17.360
That have made hundreds of millions of dollars over the years

03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:19.520
And we've kept much of that

03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:21.520
To do whatever we want

03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:24.160
And that that's enough

03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:25.360
That's good, that's great

03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:27.200
That's actually

03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:30.160
Something worth aspiring to

03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:32.080
Certainly it should be a path

03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:34.320
For someone to consider choosing

03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:36.560
Rather than the VC

03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:39.200
Unicorn of bust mentality that dominates everything

03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:41.200
I'd love to ask you about this exchange

03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:42.880
So you can explain to me the whole saga

03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:45.440
But just to link on that a little bit

03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:49.520
Is I think there's a notion that's success

03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:51.200
For tech founder

03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:52.720
Is like

03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:54.320
Work for a few years

03:01:54.320 --> 03:01:55.760
All out

03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:57.920
And then

03:01:57.920 --> 03:01:58.640
Exit

03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:01.760
Sort of sell your company for hundreds of millions of dollars

03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:03.120
That's success

03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:05.120
When it seems in reality

03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:07.920
When you look at who the

03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:10.480
People like you like really smart

03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:12.000
Creative humans

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:13.360
Who they actually are

03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:16.160
And what happiness entails

03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:18.640
It actually entails working your whole life

03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:19.600
A little bit

03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:20.320
She's like

03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:22.240
Because you actually love the programming

03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:23.280
You love the building

03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:25.360
You love the designer

03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:27.600
And you don't want to exit

03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:29.040
And that's something you've talked about

03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:29.920
Really

03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:31.280
Really eloquently about

03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:33.280
So like you actually want to create a life

03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:34.800
Where you're always

03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:36.240
Doing the building

03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:39.760
And doing it in a way that's not completely taken over your life

03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:41.680
Mojito Island is a mirage

03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:42.800
It always was

03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:45.200
There is no retirement for ambitious people

03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:47.120
There is no just sitting back on the beach

03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:49.600
And sipping a mojito for what

03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:50.720
For two weeks

03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:52.560
Before you go damn crazy

03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:54.480
And want to get back into the action

03:02:54.480 --> 03:02:56.320
That's exactly what happens

03:02:56.320 --> 03:02:58.160
To most people who have the capacity

03:02:58.160 --> 03:02:59.920
To build those kinds of exits

03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:01.600
I've never seen

03:03:01.600 --> 03:03:02.640
I shouldn't say never

03:03:02.640 --> 03:03:05.680
I've almost never seen anyone be able to pull that off

03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:07.440
Yet so many think

03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:08.720
That that's why they're doing it

03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:10.720
That's why they're sacrificing everything

03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:13.040
Because once I get to the finish line

03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:13.680
I'm golden

03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:14.400
I've won

03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:15.200
I can retire

03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:16.000
I can sit back

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:17.280
I can just relax

03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:18.640
And you find out

03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:22.160
That that kind of relaxation is actually hell

03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:22.800
Yeah

03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:24.960
It's hell for creative people

03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:26.720
To squander

03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:30.960
Their god-given creative juices and capacities

03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:32.000
And

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.480
I was really lucky to read the book

03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:36.480
Flow by Mihai

03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:38.080
Chik Sen Mihai

03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:38.640
Early on

03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:39.440
Nice

03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:40.640
The pronunciations

03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:41.920
You know what? I had to practice that

03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:43.600
With AI over the last few days

03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:45.120
Because I knew I was going to cite him

03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:46.720
And I butchered his name

03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:47.440
Several times

03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:49.840
So AI taught me how to pronounce that

03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:51.840
At least somewhat correctly

03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:53.200
But his

03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:54.800
Main

03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:56.160
Work over his career

03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:58.480
Was essentially the concept of flow

03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:00.320
That came out

03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:02.720
Of a search for

03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:04.400
Understanding happiness

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:05.520
Why are some people happy?

03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:06.880
When are they happy?

03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:09.040
And what he learned was quite illuminating

03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:10.720
He learned that people aren't happy

03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:12.080
When they sit on Muhido Island

03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:13.840
They're not happy when they're free of all

03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:15.600
Obligations and responsibilities

03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:16.160
No

03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:17.440
They're happy

03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:18.960
In these moments

03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:21.280
Where they're reaching and stretching

03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:22.720
Their capacities

03:04:22.720 --> 03:04:25.600
Just beyond what they can currently do

03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:26.880
In those moments of flow

03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:29.120
They can forget time and space

03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:31.280
They can sit in front of the keyboard

03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:32.720
Program a hard problem

03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:34.560
Think 20 minutes of past

03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:36.400
And suddenly it's been three hours

03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:38.160
They look back upon those moments

03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:40.160
With the greatest amount of joy

03:04:40.160 --> 03:04:42.320
And that is what peak happiness is

03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:44.400
If you take away the pursuit

03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:46.480
Of those kinds of problems

03:04:46.480 --> 03:04:49.440
If you eliminate all the problems from your plate

03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:51.760
You're going to get depressed

03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:53.600
You're not going to have a good time

03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:55.120
Now there are people who can do that

03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:56.240
But they're not the same kind of people

03:04:56.240 --> 03:04:57.920
Who build these kinds of companies

03:04:57.920 --> 03:05:00.880
So you have to accept the kind of individual you are

03:05:00.880 --> 03:05:03.280
If you are in this path

03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:04.960
Don't bullshit yourself

03:05:04.960 --> 03:05:06.480
Don't bullshit yourself into thinking

03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:08.080
I'm just going to sacrifice everything

03:05:08.080 --> 03:05:11.440
My health, my family, my hobbies, my friends

03:05:11.440 --> 03:05:13.520
But in 10 years I'm going to make it all up

03:05:13.520 --> 03:05:15.040
Because in 10 years I can do it

03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:16.320
It never works out like that

03:05:16.320 --> 03:05:18.560
It doesn't even work out on both ends of it

03:05:18.560 --> 03:05:20.000
It does not work out if you're successful

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:20.880
And you sell your company

03:05:20.880 --> 03:05:22.880
Because you'll get bored out of your mind

03:05:22.880 --> 03:05:24.320
Up two weeks on retirement

03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:27.200
It doesn't work out if the company is a failure

03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:29.120
And you regret the last 10 years

03:05:29.120 --> 03:05:30.240
Spent for nothing

03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:32.320
It doesn't work out if it all works

03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:33.440
And you stay in the business

03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:35.280
Because it never gets any easier

03:05:35.280 --> 03:05:37.200
So you're going to fail on all metrics

03:05:37.200 --> 03:05:38.800
If you just go

03:05:38.800 --> 03:05:40.480
There's only work on nothing else

03:05:40.480 --> 03:05:42.960
And I didn't want that

03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:45.040
I wanted the happiness of flow

03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:48.960
I understood that insight was true

03:05:48.960 --> 03:05:50.160
But I wanted to do it in a way

03:05:50.160 --> 03:05:53.360
Where I could sustain the journey for 40 or 50 years

03:05:53.360 --> 03:05:55.760
And there's another interesting caveat

03:05:55.760 --> 03:05:57.920
That I've heard you say is that

03:05:57.920 --> 03:05:59.920
If you do X and you sell your company

03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:00.880
And you want to stay in

03:06:00.880 --> 03:06:02.960
And you want to do another company

03:06:02.960 --> 03:06:06.000
That's going to usually not be as fulfilling

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:06.480
Yes

03:06:06.480 --> 03:06:08.240
Because really your first baby

03:06:08.240 --> 03:06:09.120
Like

03:06:09.120 --> 03:06:11.280
You can't do it again

03:06:11.280 --> 03:06:12.960
Or most people can't do it again

03:06:12.960 --> 03:06:13.760
A

03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:16.240
Because their second idea is not going to be as good as the first one

03:06:16.240 --> 03:06:17.520
It is so rare

03:06:17.520 --> 03:06:19.120
To capture lightning in the bottle

03:06:19.120 --> 03:06:21.120
Like we have for example with Basecamp

03:06:21.120 --> 03:06:22.400
I know this from experience

03:06:22.400 --> 03:06:24.320
Because I've been trying to build a lot of other businesses since

03:06:24.320 --> 03:06:25.920
And some of them have been moderate successes

03:06:25.920 --> 03:06:27.120
Even good successes

03:06:27.120 --> 03:06:29.040
None of them have been Basecamp

03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:31.520
It's really difficult to do that twice

03:06:31.520 --> 03:06:34.080
But founders or arrogant pricks

03:06:34.080 --> 03:06:34.880
Including myself

03:06:34.880 --> 03:06:36.240
And we like to think that

03:06:36.240 --> 03:06:38.080
Do you know what we succeeded in large part

03:06:38.080 --> 03:06:39.280
Because we're just awesome

03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:41.280
Which is so much better than everyone else

03:06:41.280 --> 03:06:42.880
And in some ways that's true

03:06:42.880 --> 03:06:43.920
Some of the time

03:06:43.920 --> 03:06:46.160
But you can also be really good at something

03:06:46.160 --> 03:06:48.160
That matters for a hot moment

03:06:48.160 --> 03:06:50.000
That that door is open

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:50.800
The door closes

03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:52.080
Now you're still good at the thing

03:06:52.080 --> 03:06:53.600
But it doesn't matter no one cares

03:06:54.640 --> 03:06:55.600
There's that part of it

03:06:55.600 --> 03:06:57.040
And then there's the part of it that

03:06:57.440 --> 03:07:01.120
Going back to experience things for the first time

03:07:01.120 --> 03:07:02.880
Only happens the first time

03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:04.160
You can't do it again

03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:07.120
I don't know if I have it in me

03:07:07.120 --> 03:07:09.280
To go through the bullshit of the early days again

03:07:09.280 --> 03:07:10.960
And I say bullshit in the sense

03:07:10.960 --> 03:07:12.160
Of the most endearing sense

03:07:12.160 --> 03:07:13.520
It's all great to do it

03:07:13.520 --> 03:07:14.560
I know too much

03:07:14.560 --> 03:07:16.720
This is one of the reasons why

03:07:16.720 --> 03:07:17.760
Whenever I'm asked the questions

03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:19.440
If you could tell your younger self

03:07:19.440 --> 03:07:21.680
Something that would really

03:07:21.680 --> 03:07:23.120
What would you say to your younger self

03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:24.720
I would fucking not say a thing

03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:26.720
I would not rob my younger self

03:07:26.720 --> 03:07:28.640
Of all the life experiences

03:07:28.640 --> 03:07:30.080
That have been blessed with

03:07:30.080 --> 03:07:32.080
Due to the ignorance of how the world works

03:07:32.880 --> 03:07:35.440
Building up the wisdom about how the world works

03:07:35.440 --> 03:07:37.680
Is a joy

03:07:38.320 --> 03:07:39.840
And you got to build it one break out of time

03:07:39.840 --> 03:07:41.840
If you just handed all the results

03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:42.560
It's like

03:07:42.560 --> 03:07:43.680
Oh should we watch your movie?

03:07:43.680 --> 03:07:44.880
Here's how it ends

03:07:44.880 --> 03:07:45.680
I don't want to follow

03:07:45.680 --> 03:07:46.720
I'm watching the movie now

03:07:46.720 --> 03:07:48.320
You spoiled it

03:07:48.320 --> 03:07:49.920
I don't want you to spoil

03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:51.280
My business experience

03:07:51.280 --> 03:07:53.600
I don't want to spoil any of my ignorance

03:07:53.600 --> 03:07:54.960
The greatest blessing

03:07:54.960 --> 03:07:56.800
Half the time when you're starting something new is

03:07:56.800 --> 03:07:58.240
A, you don't know how hard it's going to be

03:07:58.960 --> 03:08:00.880
B, you don't know what you don't know

03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:04.000
Like the adventure is to pay off

03:08:04.560 --> 03:08:06.640
The responsibility is to pay off

03:08:06.640 --> 03:08:07.840
This is something Jordan Peterson

03:08:07.840 --> 03:08:10.240
It's really taught me to articulate

03:08:10.240 --> 03:08:13.440
This notion that responsibility is actually key to meaning

03:08:16.560 --> 03:08:17.520
Man's search for meaning

03:08:17.520 --> 03:08:19.680
Victor Frankl talks about this as well

03:08:19.680 --> 03:08:22.480
That we can endure any hardship

03:08:22.480 --> 03:08:23.760
If there's a reason why

03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:26.000
Now he talked about it in truly

03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:28.320
Life altering

03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:29.840
Concentration camp ways

03:08:29.840 --> 03:08:33.120
But you can also apply at a smaller scale with less criticality

03:08:33.840 --> 03:08:35.520
Of even just your daily life

03:08:35.520 --> 03:08:39.120
That all that hardship in building the original business

03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:41.920
That is responsibility you take upon yourself

03:08:42.640 --> 03:08:44.640
The appeal, the reason you take that on you

03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:46.800
Isn't part because you don't know fully what it entails

03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:47.760
If you had known up front

03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:48.720
If I had known up front

03:08:48.720 --> 03:08:50.160
How hard it would be

03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:50.880
How much

03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:53.680
Frustration there'd be along the way

03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:56.640
If you just told me that in a narrative before I got started

03:08:56.640 --> 03:08:57.280
I would have been like

03:08:57.280 --> 03:08:58.080
Eh

03:08:58.080 --> 03:08:59.440
Maybe I should just go get a job

03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:02.160
I mean you just said so many smart things there

03:09:02.160 --> 03:09:03.120
Just to pick one

03:09:04.560 --> 03:09:05.920
It's funny that sometimes

03:09:06.960 --> 03:09:08.400
The advice givers

03:09:08.400 --> 03:09:10.240
The wisdom givers

03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:13.120
Are have gone through all the bullshit

03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:16.960
And so there is a degree to which you want to make the mistake

03:09:16.960 --> 03:09:19.920
So I think I think I would still give the advice of

03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:22.800
You want to have a stretch of your life

03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:24.560
Where you work too hard

03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:27.280
Including it a thing that fails

03:09:27.920 --> 03:09:29.760
I don't think you can learn the lessons

03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:31.120
Why that's a bad idea

03:09:31.120 --> 03:09:32.240
In any other way

03:09:32.240 --> 03:09:33.440
Except by doing it

03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:35.200
There is a degree

03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:36.720
But of course you don't

03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:38.240
I think you should stretch

03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:40.000
Should you have to stretch for a decade

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:40.640
I'm not so sure

03:09:40.640 --> 03:09:41.760
Yeah the decade thing is

03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:43.200
20s is a special topic

03:09:43.200 --> 03:09:44.800
It's a lot to trade

03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:46.400
You don't get your 20s back

03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:47.280
You don't get your 30s back

03:09:47.280 --> 03:09:48.560
You don't get your 40s back

03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:49.840
Really

03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:51.360
I would have regretted

03:09:51.360 --> 03:09:52.160
Personally

03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:54.800
If I hadn't done the other things I did in my 20s

03:09:54.800 --> 03:09:56.240
If I hadn't had the fun I had

03:09:56.240 --> 03:09:57.600
If I hadn't had the friends I had

03:09:57.600 --> 03:09:59.680
If I hadn't build up the hobbies that I did

03:09:59.680 --> 03:10:01.120
If I hadn't started

03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:03.520
Driving race cars at an early enough age

03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:05.040
To actually get really good at it

03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:07.200
If I had just gone all in on business

03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:10.160
Because I would have gotten the same out in the end

03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:12.880
This is something Derek Sivers really taught me

03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:14.880
Is he has this great essay

03:10:14.880 --> 03:10:16.320
About how

03:10:16.320 --> 03:10:18.000
When he went for a bike ride

03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:20.320
He could go really hard all out

03:10:20.320 --> 03:10:22.640
And he could do the ride I think in

03:10:22.640 --> 03:10:24.400
Whatever 19 minutes

03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:25.840
Why he could enjoy the ride

03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:27.360
Go 5% slower

03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:29.200
Do the ride in 21 minutes

03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:32.640
And realize there's only two minutes apart

03:10:32.640 --> 03:10:34.480
Either I go all in all the time

03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:35.360
There's nothing else

03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:37.680
I'm completely exhausted at the end

03:10:37.680 --> 03:10:40.000
And or I travel the same distance

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.320
And I arrive maybe two minutes later

03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:44.160
But I got to enjoy the scenery

03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:46.320
Listen to the birds smell the flowers

03:10:47.040 --> 03:10:50.240
That journey is also valuable

03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:53.280
Now I say that while accepting

03:10:53.280 --> 03:10:54.560
And celebrating

03:10:54.560 --> 03:10:56.480
That if you want to be the best

03:10:56.480 --> 03:10:58.480
At one thing in the world

03:10:58.480 --> 03:11:00.160
No you have to sacrifice everything

03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:03.280
You have to be obsessed with just that thing

03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:04.480
There is no instant

03:11:04.480 --> 03:11:06.320
Of someone who's the best in the world

03:11:06.320 --> 03:11:07.040
At something

03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:08.720
Who's not completely obsessed

03:11:08.720 --> 03:11:10.640
I didn't need the best at anything

03:11:10.640 --> 03:11:11.920
This was a

03:11:11.920 --> 03:11:14.400
A rare blessing of humility

03:11:14.400 --> 03:11:15.280
I had early on

03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:16.400
It's like you know what

03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:17.680
I am not that smart

03:11:17.680 --> 03:11:18.560
I'm not that good

03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:19.840
I'm not that talented

03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:21.360
I can do interesting things

03:11:21.360 --> 03:11:23.520
By combining different aspects

03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:24.960
And elements that I know

03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:27.040
But I'm not going to be the best at anything

03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:28.880
And that released me

03:11:28.880 --> 03:11:30.080
From this

03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:31.360
Singular obsession

03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:32.080
We're just going

03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:34.000
I'm going to be the best programmer in the world

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:34.880
And I know I'm not

03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:36.400
I fucking failed at it

03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:39.680
Twice before I even got how conditionals work

03:11:39.680 --> 03:11:40.880
I'm not smart enough

03:11:40.880 --> 03:11:41.840
To be the best at anything

03:11:41.840 --> 03:11:43.280
I'm not dedicated enough

03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:44.320
To do that

03:11:44.320 --> 03:11:45.520
That's a bit of a

03:11:45.520 --> 03:11:46.160
Blessing

03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:47.120
And I think

03:11:47.120 --> 03:11:48.320
As a society

03:11:48.320 --> 03:11:49.600
We have to straddle

03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:51.840
Both celebrating peak excellence

03:11:51.840 --> 03:11:53.440
Which we do all the time

03:11:53.440 --> 03:11:55.760
And celebrating the peak intensity

03:11:56.320 --> 03:11:56.880
Of mission

03:11:56.880 --> 03:11:58.240
It takes to become that

03:11:58.240 --> 03:11:59.520
And then also going like

03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:00.720
You know what

03:12:00.720 --> 03:12:02.480
We don't all need to be

03:12:02.480 --> 03:12:03.280
Michael Jordan

03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:04.560
Is there going to be one of those

03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:05.760
But we should say that there's

03:12:05.760 --> 03:12:06.880
Certain pursuits

03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:10.880
Where a singular obsession is required

03:12:10.880 --> 03:12:12.320
Basketball is one of them

03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:14.320
By the way, probably racing

03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:15.680
If you want to be the best

03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:17.040
At that point in the world

03:12:17.040 --> 03:12:18.080
If you want to be Senna

03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:18.800
You got to be

03:12:18.800 --> 03:12:19.920
Amaniac

03:12:19.920 --> 03:12:21.520
But I would argue that

03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:23.120
There's most disciplines

03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:24.080
Like programming

03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:25.680
Allows

03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:26.880
If you want to be quote-unquote

03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:27.360
The best

03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:28.240
Whatever that means

03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:31.520
I think that's judged at the end of your life

03:12:31.520 --> 03:12:33.600
And usually if you look at that path

03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:35.440
It's going to be a non-linear one

03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:38.160
You're not going to look like the life of an Olympic athlete

03:12:38.160 --> 03:12:39.600
Who's singular focus

03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:40.320
You're going to

03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:41.760
There's going to be some

03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:43.680
Acid there in the 20s

03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:45.120
Or there's going to be

03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:47.920
A deep several detours

03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:50.560
Which the true greats

03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:51.760
There's going to be detours

03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:53.520
And sometimes they're not going to be

03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:55.760
Steve Jobs' acid type of situation

03:12:55.760 --> 03:12:57.360
There'll be just different

03:12:57.360 --> 03:12:58.640
Companies you worked for

03:12:58.640 --> 03:12:59.600
Different careers

03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:00.080
Different

03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:03.440
Sort of

03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:05.440
Efforts you allocated

03:13:05.440 --> 03:13:06.640
Your life to

03:13:06.640 --> 03:13:07.840
But it's going to be non-linear

03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:09.440
It's not going to be a singular focus

03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:11.200
The way I think about this sometimes

03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:14.720
I want a good bargain on learning

03:13:14.720 --> 03:13:15.760
I can become

03:13:16.720 --> 03:13:18.400
In the top 5%

03:13:18.400 --> 03:13:20.720
Of whatever I defined as good at something

03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:23.680
Much much easier

03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:24.880
Perhaps it's 20 times easier

03:13:24.880 --> 03:13:26.640
100 times easier to get into the top

03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:27.120
5%

03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:30.000
That it is to get into the top 0.1%

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.080
That's almost impossibly hard to get into that

03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:33.840
But if I'm content

03:13:33.840 --> 03:13:35.360
Just being in the top 5%

03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:36.720
I can be in the top 5%

03:13:36.720 --> 03:13:38.560
On like five things at once

03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:40.880
I can get really good at writing

03:13:40.960 --> 03:13:43.600
I can get decent at driving a race car

03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:45.920
I can become pretty good at programming

03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:46.960
I can run a company

03:13:46.960 --> 03:13:48.240
I can have a family

03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:50.720
I can do a lot of things at the same time

03:13:50.720 --> 03:13:52.480
That gives me sort of that variety

03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:54.960
That almost that was

03:13:54.960 --> 03:13:55.840
Idealized

03:13:55.840 --> 03:13:57.120
Karl Marx has this idea

03:13:57.120 --> 03:13:58.880
I'm going to fish in the morning

03:13:58.880 --> 03:14:00.880
And hammer in the evening

03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:02.720
And paint on the weekends

03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:03.120
Right?

03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:05.200
That there's a sense for me at least

03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:07.920
Where his diagnosis of alienation was true

03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:09.520
That just that tunnel vision

03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:10.560
There's just this one thing

03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:11.920
I'm just going to focus on that

03:14:11.920 --> 03:14:13.600
It gives me a sense of alienation

03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:14.800
I can't stomach

03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:16.560
When I'm really deep on programming

03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:18.400
And sometimes I go deep for weeks

03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:21.200
Maybe even in a few cases months

03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:23.520
I have to come up for air

03:14:23.520 --> 03:14:25.120
And I have to go do something else

03:14:25.120 --> 03:14:25.520
All right

03:14:25.520 --> 03:14:26.000
All right

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:27.520
That was programming for this year

03:14:27.520 --> 03:14:28.960
I've done my part

03:14:28.960 --> 03:14:30.000
I'm going to go off writing

03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:31.440
Or annoy people on the internet

03:14:31.440 --> 03:14:32.400
Or drive some race cars

03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:33.760
To do something else

03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:36.240
And then I can do the programming thing

03:14:36.240 --> 03:14:38.080
With full intensity again next year

03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:40.320
Speaking of annoying people on the internet

03:14:40.320 --> 03:14:41.840
You got to explain to me this drama

03:14:41.840 --> 03:14:44.000
Okay, so what is this guy that said

03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:45.520
Imagine losing to Jira

03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:46.880
But boasting

03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:49.520
They have a couple million dollars per year

03:14:49.520 --> 03:14:52.000
So this had to do with this

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:55.040
Almost now a meme decision to leave the cloud

03:14:55.040 --> 03:14:55.760
DHH

03:14:56.560 --> 03:14:58.160
Left the cloud

03:14:58.160 --> 03:14:59.920
I think that's literally a meme

03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:03.520
But it's also a fascinating decision

03:15:03.520 --> 03:15:05.680
Can you talk to the full saga of

03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:07.680
DHH leaves the cloud

03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:08.160
Yes

03:15:08.160 --> 03:15:09.200
A leaving AWS

03:15:10.640 --> 03:15:11.840
Saving money

03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:13.680
And I guess the case this person is making

03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:14.320
No

03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:15.920
Is that we wasted our time

03:15:15.920 --> 03:15:16.960
Optimizing in business

03:15:16.960 --> 03:15:18.480
That could have been 100 times bigger

03:15:18.480 --> 03:15:20.240
If we'd just gone for the moon

03:15:20.240 --> 03:15:22.480
And for the moon includes

03:15:22.480 --> 03:15:23.440
Venture capital

03:15:23.440 --> 03:15:24.160
But also AG

03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:24.880
Some of the things

03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:26.640
In conclusion, not caring about cost

03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:28.640
But also because AGIs

03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:29.440
Around the corner

03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:31.280
You should have been investing into AI

03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:31.680
Right

03:15:31.680 --> 03:15:32.400
Is this part of that?

03:15:32.400 --> 03:15:33.040
Sort of

03:15:33.040 --> 03:15:33.600
Tank ginger

03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:35.040
And I think it's a bit of a muddy argument

03:15:35.040 --> 03:15:36.480
But if we just take it at its

03:15:37.680 --> 03:15:39.200
Peak ideal

03:15:39.200 --> 03:15:42.080
Which I actually think is a reasonable point

03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:43.840
Is that you can get my

03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:46.880
Optically focused on counting pennies

03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:49.360
When you should be focused on getting pounds

03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:50.000
Right

03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:55.120
That I've optimized our spend on infrastructure

03:15:55.120 --> 03:15:56.400
By getting out of the cloud

03:15:56.400 --> 03:15:57.440
And that took some time

03:15:57.440 --> 03:15:58.960
And I could have taken that time

03:15:58.960 --> 03:16:01.440
And spend it on making more features

03:16:01.440 --> 03:16:03.680
I would have attracted more customers

03:16:03.680 --> 03:16:05.360
Or spend even more time with AI

03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:06.160
Or done other things

03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:07.760
Opportunity cost is real

03:16:07.760 --> 03:16:08.960
I'm not denying that

03:16:09.440 --> 03:16:11.520
I'm pushing back on the idea

03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:13.600
That for a company of our size

03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:17.120
Saving $2 million a year

03:16:17.120 --> 03:16:19.360
On our infrastructure bill

03:16:19.360 --> 03:16:22.560
Which is about somewhere between half to two thirds

03:16:23.360 --> 03:16:24.880
Goes directly to the bottom line

03:16:24.880 --> 03:16:27.440
Which means it's returned to Jason Raya's owners

03:16:27.440 --> 03:16:29.840
And our employees

03:16:29.840 --> 03:16:32.320
Part of our profit sharing plan

03:16:32.320 --> 03:16:33.680
It's totally worth doing

03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:36.960
This idea that costs don't matter

03:16:36.960 --> 03:16:38.800
Is a very Silicon Valley

03:16:38.880 --> 03:16:41.120
Way of thinking that I can understand

03:16:41.120 --> 03:16:43.520
At the scale of something maybe

03:16:43.520 --> 03:16:45.040
But I also actually think it's

03:16:46.960 --> 03:16:49.600
It's aesthetically unpleasing

03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:52.000
I find an inefficient business

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:54.640
As I find an inefficient program

03:16:54.640 --> 03:16:56.000
Full of line noise

03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:59.120
To just be a splinter in my brain

03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:01.440
I hate looking at an expense report

03:17:01.440 --> 03:17:04.640
And just seeing disproportionate waste

03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:06.640
And when I was looking at our spend

03:17:06.640 --> 03:17:08.080
At 37 signals

03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:09.920
A while back a few years back

03:17:09.920 --> 03:17:13.680
I saw bills that did not pass my smell test

03:17:13.680 --> 03:17:15.920
I remembered how much we used to spend

03:17:15.920 --> 03:17:18.080
An infrastructure before the cloud

03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:19.280
And I saw numbers

03:17:19.280 --> 03:17:22.320
I could not recognize in proportion to what we needed

03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:24.480
The fact that computers had gotten so much faster

03:17:24.480 --> 03:17:26.720
Of a time shouldn't things be getting cheaper

03:17:26.720 --> 03:17:28.880
Why are we spending more and more money

03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:30.400
Surveying more customers

03:17:30.400 --> 03:17:33.040
Yes, but with much faster computers

03:17:33.040 --> 03:17:36.800
More's law should be lowering the cost

03:17:36.800 --> 03:17:38.000
And the opposite is happening

03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:39.360
Why is that happening?

03:17:39.360 --> 03:17:43.120
And that started a journey of unwinding

03:17:43.120 --> 03:17:47.200
Why the cloud isn't as great as the deal

03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:48.480
As people like to think that

03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:51.040
Yeah, can we look at the specifics

03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:52.800
Just for people who don't know the story

03:17:52.800 --> 03:17:54.320
And then generalize

03:17:55.840 --> 03:17:58.400
To what it means about the role of the cloud

03:17:58.400 --> 03:17:59.440
And in tech business

03:17:59.440 --> 03:18:01.040
So the specifics is

03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:02.960
You were using AWS S3

03:18:03.680 --> 03:18:05.600
We were using AWS for everything

03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:08.720
Hey.com launches an entirely cloud app

03:18:08.720 --> 03:18:10.560
It was completely on AWS

03:18:10.560 --> 03:18:13.120
For compute, for databases, for all of it

03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:14.800
We were using all the systems

03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:17.280
As they are best prescribed that we should

03:18:17.280 --> 03:18:19.600
Our total cloud bill for

03:18:20.400 --> 03:18:23.760
Basecamp, our total spend with AWS

03:18:23.760 --> 03:18:25.520
Which I think 3.2 million

03:18:25.520 --> 03:18:27.520
Or 3.4 million at its peak

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:29.600
That's kind of a lot of money

03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:30.880
3.4 million

03:18:30.880 --> 03:18:33.680
I mean we have a ton of users and customers

03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:37.200
But still, that just struck me as unreasonable

03:18:37.200 --> 03:18:39.440
And the reason why I was unaware and reasonable was

03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:42.240
Because I had the pitch for the cloud

03:18:42.240 --> 03:18:43.280
Ringing in my ears

03:18:43.280 --> 03:18:45.520
Hey, this is going to be faster

03:18:45.520 --> 03:18:46.960
This is going to be easier

03:18:46.960 --> 03:18:48.800
This is going to be cheaper

03:18:48.800 --> 03:18:50.480
Why are you trying to produce your own power?

03:18:51.200 --> 03:18:52.480
Like do you have your own power plant?

03:18:52.480 --> 03:18:53.760
Why would you not leave

03:18:54.480 --> 03:18:56.720
The computers to the hyperscalus

03:18:56.720 --> 03:18:58.480
They're much better at it anyway

03:18:58.480 --> 03:19:00.480
I actually thought there was a compelling pitch

03:19:00.480 --> 03:19:02.880
I bought in on that pitch for several years

03:19:02.880 --> 03:19:04.240
And thought, do you know what?

03:19:04.240 --> 03:19:06.720
I'm done ever owning a server again

03:19:06.720 --> 03:19:09.040
We're just going to render our capacity

03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:12.400
And Amazon is going to be able to offer us services

03:19:12.400 --> 03:19:15.360
Much cheaper than we could buy them themselves

03:19:15.360 --> 03:19:17.280
Because they're going to have these economies of scale

03:19:17.280 --> 03:19:19.040
And I was thinking

03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:21.280
Jeff's word, they're ringing

03:19:21.280 --> 03:19:24.000
My competitor's margin is my opportunity

03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:25.600
That was something he used to drive

03:19:25.600 --> 03:19:26.960
Amazon.com with

03:19:26.960 --> 03:19:29.120
That if he could just make 2%

03:19:29.120 --> 03:19:30.720
When the other guy was trying to make 4%

03:19:30.720 --> 03:19:31.920
He would end up with all the money

03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:34.560
And on volume he would still win

03:19:34.560 --> 03:19:36.480
So I thought that was the operating

03:19:36.480 --> 03:19:37.760
Ethos for AWS

03:19:37.760 --> 03:19:39.120
It turns out that's not true at all

03:19:39.120 --> 03:19:40.320
AWS by the way

03:19:40.320 --> 03:19:42.320
Operates is almost 40% margin

03:19:43.360 --> 03:19:45.360
So just in that there's a clue

03:19:46.160 --> 03:19:49.760
That competitors are not able to do the competitive thing

03:19:49.760 --> 03:19:51.520
We like about capitalism

03:19:51.520 --> 03:19:53.520
Which is to lower costs and so forth

03:19:54.240 --> 03:19:55.760
So the cloud pitch

03:19:56.560 --> 03:19:58.000
In my optics are fun

03:19:58.000 --> 03:19:59.520
It's a fundamentally false

03:19:59.520 --> 03:20:02.080
It did not get easier first of all

03:20:02.080 --> 03:20:04.320
I don't know if you've used AWS recently

03:20:04.320 --> 03:20:06.080
It is hella complicated

03:20:06.080 --> 03:20:07.520
If you think Linux is hard

03:20:07.520 --> 03:20:09.920
You've never tried to set up iam rules

03:20:09.920 --> 03:20:11.920
Or access parameters or whatever

03:20:11.920 --> 03:20:13.760
AWS was always difficult

03:20:13.760 --> 03:20:14.560
It was always clever

03:20:14.560 --> 03:20:16.080
I think it's gotten even more difficult

03:20:16.080 --> 03:20:17.280
But yes

03:20:17.280 --> 03:20:18.960
Now some of that is it's difficult

03:20:18.960 --> 03:20:20.160
Because it's very capable

03:20:20.160 --> 03:20:22.240
And you have a bunch of capacity on tap

03:20:22.240 --> 03:20:24.000
And there are reasons

03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:25.120
I don't think they're good enough

03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:27.360
To justify how complicated the whole

03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:29.360
Gingham Gingham has become

03:20:29.360 --> 03:20:32.400
But what's certainly true is that it's no longer easier

03:20:32.400 --> 03:20:34.960
It's not easier to use AWS

03:20:34.960 --> 03:20:37.040
Than it is to run your own machines

03:20:37.040 --> 03:20:39.040
Which we learned when we pulled out the cloud

03:20:39.040 --> 03:20:41.200
And didn't hire a single extra person

03:20:41.200 --> 03:20:42.960
Even though we operate all our own hardware

03:20:42.960 --> 03:20:45.360
The team stayed exactly the same

03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:46.800
So you have this three way pitch

03:20:46.800 --> 03:20:47.440
Right

03:20:47.440 --> 03:20:49.520
It's going to be easier

03:20:49.520 --> 03:20:51.200
It's going to be cheaper

03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:52.640
Certainly wasn't cheaper

03:20:52.640 --> 03:20:54.640
We've just proved that by cutting our

03:20:54.640 --> 03:20:57.520
Spend on infrastructure by half to two thirds

03:20:57.520 --> 03:20:58.720
And it's going to be faster

03:20:58.720 --> 03:20:59.920
The last bit was true

03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:05.200
But way too many people overestimated the value of that speed

03:21:05.200 --> 03:21:08.800
If you need a thousand computers online

03:21:08.800 --> 03:21:09.920
In the next 15 minutes

03:21:09.920 --> 03:21:11.040
Nothing beats the cloud

03:21:11.040 --> 03:21:13.040
How would you even procure that

03:21:13.040 --> 03:21:15.440
If we just need another 20 servers

03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:17.200
It's going to take a week or two

03:21:17.200 --> 03:21:19.280
To get boxes shipped on pallets

03:21:19.280 --> 03:21:20.480
Delivered to a data center

03:21:20.480 --> 03:21:22.000
On unwrapped and racked

03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:22.880
And all that stuff

03:21:22.880 --> 03:21:23.520
Right

03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:25.040
But how often do we need to do that

03:21:25.680 --> 03:21:27.040
And how often do we need to do that

03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:28.800
If buying those services

03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:29.840
Way way cheaper

03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:31.680
So we get vastly more compute

03:21:31.680 --> 03:21:32.800
For the same amount of money

03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:34.640
Could we just buy more servers

03:21:34.640 --> 03:21:36.240
And not even care about the fact

03:21:36.240 --> 03:21:38.160
That we're not hyper optimized

03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:39.760
On the compute utility

03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:41.200
That we don't have to use things

03:21:41.200 --> 03:21:42.800
Like automatic scaling

03:21:42.800 --> 03:21:43.920
To figure things out

03:21:43.920 --> 03:21:45.200
Because we have to reduce cost

03:21:45.200 --> 03:21:46.400
Yes we can

03:21:46.400 --> 03:21:47.440
So

03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:48.800
We went through this journey

03:21:48.800 --> 03:21:50.240
Over

03:21:50.320 --> 03:21:53.440
A realization in early 2023

03:21:54.080 --> 03:21:56.720
When I had finally had enough

03:21:56.720 --> 03:21:57.600
With our bills

03:21:57.600 --> 03:21:58.640
I wanted to get rid of them

03:21:58.640 --> 03:21:59.680
I wanted to spend less money

03:21:59.680 --> 03:22:01.680
I wanted to keep more of the money ourselves

03:22:01.680 --> 03:22:04.160
And in just over six months

03:22:04.160 --> 03:22:06.160
We moved seven major applications

03:22:06.160 --> 03:22:07.360
Out of the cloud

03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:08.640
In terms of compute

03:22:08.640 --> 03:22:10.400
Caching databases that works

03:22:10.400 --> 03:22:11.600
Onto our own servers

03:22:11.600 --> 03:22:14.880
A glorious, beautiful new fleet

03:22:14.880 --> 03:22:16.880
Bought from the king of servers

03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:18.080
Michael Dell

03:22:18.080 --> 03:22:19.520
Who

03:22:19.520 --> 03:22:21.680
Really, by the way, is another icon of my

03:22:21.680 --> 03:22:24.160
I saw he just celebrated 41 years in business

03:22:24.160 --> 03:22:25.680
41 years

03:22:25.680 --> 03:22:28.480
This man has been selling awesome servers

03:22:28.480 --> 03:22:30.240
That we've been using for our entire existence

03:22:30.240 --> 03:22:32.240
But anyway, these pallets arrive

03:22:32.560 --> 03:22:34.240
In a couple of weeks

03:22:34.240 --> 03:22:34.960
And we rack them up

03:22:34.960 --> 03:22:35.920
And get everything going

03:22:35.920 --> 03:22:37.920
And we were out

03:22:37.920 --> 03:22:38.960
At least with the compute part

03:22:38.960 --> 03:22:40.160
We then had a long

03:22:41.680 --> 03:22:43.760
Multi-year commitment to his three

03:22:43.760 --> 03:22:44.800
Because the only way to get

03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:47.200
Decent pricing in the cloud, by the way

03:22:47.200 --> 03:22:50.400
Is not to buy on a day-to-day basis

03:22:50.400 --> 03:22:51.840
Not to rent on a day-to-day basis

03:22:51.840 --> 03:22:55.600
But to bind yourself up to multi-year contracts

03:22:55.600 --> 03:22:57.440
With computers often a year

03:22:57.440 --> 03:22:58.320
That was in our case

03:22:58.320 --> 03:23:00.880
And with storages with four years

03:23:00.880 --> 03:23:03.040
We signed a four-year contract

03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:06.720
To store our petabytes of customer files in the cloud

03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:09.760
To be able to get something just halfway decent affordable

03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:12.000
So all of these projects

03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:13.680
Came together to the sense that

03:23:13.680 --> 03:23:16.160
We're now saving literally millions of dollars

03:23:16.160 --> 03:23:19.040
Projected about 10 million over five years

03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:19.760
It's always hard

03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:21.600
How do you do the accounting exactly

03:23:21.600 --> 03:23:23.760
And TOC, this, that, and the other thing

03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:25.600
But it's millions of dollars

03:23:25.600 --> 03:23:27.200
But it's not just that

03:23:27.200 --> 03:23:29.120
It's also the fact that

03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:30.560
Getting out of the cloud

03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:35.040
Mean meant returning to more of an original idea of the internet

03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:38.000
That the internet was not designed

03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:40.320
Such that three computers should run everything

03:23:40.320 --> 03:23:41.840
It was a distributed network

03:23:41.840 --> 03:23:43.840
Such that the individual nodes could disappear

03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:45.840
And the whole thing would still carry on

03:23:45.920 --> 03:23:47.840
Dark at the sign this such that

03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:50.080
The Russians could take out Washington

03:23:50.080 --> 03:23:52.080
And they could still fight back from New York

03:23:52.080 --> 03:23:54.560
That the entire communication infrastructure wouldn't

03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:57.200
Disappear because there was no hub and spoke

03:23:57.200 --> 03:23:58.320
It was a network

03:23:58.320 --> 03:23:59.840
I always found that

03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:01.840
An immensely beautiful vision

03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:04.480
That you could have this glorious internet

03:24:04.480 --> 03:24:07.120
And no single node was in control of everything

03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:10.640
And we've returned to much more of a single

03:24:10.640 --> 03:24:12.400
Node controlling everything

03:24:12.400 --> 03:24:14.400
Idea with these hyperscalers

03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:15.920
When US East won

03:24:15.920 --> 03:24:18.240
The main and original region

03:24:18.240 --> 03:24:20.240
For AWS goes offline

03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:22.640
Which just happened more than a few times over the years

03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:25.120
Seemingly a third of the internet is offline

03:24:25.120 --> 03:24:28.720
Like that in itself is just an insult to DARPA's design

03:24:28.720 --> 03:24:32.960
It does detract from the fact that what AWS built was marvelous

03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:36.320
I think the cloud has moved so many things

03:24:36.320 --> 03:24:40.640
So far forward especially around virtualization, automation, setup

03:24:40.640 --> 03:24:42.480
It's all those

03:24:42.480 --> 03:24:45.520
Giant leaps forward for system administration

03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:49.040
That's allowing us now to be able to run things on-prem

03:24:49.040 --> 03:24:51.760
In a way that smells and feels

03:24:51.760 --> 03:24:53.200
Much like the cloud

03:24:53.200 --> 03:24:55.120
Just that have to cost or less

03:24:55.120 --> 03:24:57.360
And with the autonomy and the

03:24:57.360 --> 03:24:59.600
Satisfaction of owning hardware

03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:01.680
I don't know what the last time you looked at

03:25:01.680 --> 03:25:03.520
Like an actual server and took it apart

03:25:03.520 --> 03:25:04.400
And looked inside of

03:25:04.400 --> 03:25:06.320
These things are gorgeous

03:25:06.320 --> 03:25:08.880
I mean, I posted a couple of pictures of our

03:25:08.880 --> 03:25:10.160
Racks out in the data center

03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:11.600
And people always go crazy for them

03:25:11.600 --> 03:25:13.680
Because we've gotten so abstracted

03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:15.920
From what the underlying metal looks like

03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:18.800
In this cloud age that most people have no idea

03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:22.960
They have no idea how powerful a modern CPU is

03:25:22.960 --> 03:25:24.800
They have no idea

03:25:24.800 --> 03:25:28.160
How much RAM you can fit into a one-year rack

03:25:29.200 --> 03:25:32.640
Progress in computing has been really exciting

03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:34.960
Especially I'd say in the last four to five years

03:25:34.960 --> 03:25:37.440
After TSMC with Apple's help

03:25:37.440 --> 03:25:38.640
Really pushed the envelope

03:25:38.640 --> 03:25:41.360
I mean, we kind of sat still there for a while

03:25:41.360 --> 03:25:44.000
While Intel was spinning their wheels going nowhere

03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:46.880
And then TSMC with Apple propelling them

03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:48.160
Really moved things forward

03:25:48.160 --> 03:25:50.160
And now servers are exciting again

03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:52.800
Like you're getting jumps year-to-year

03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:54.320
And the 15-20%

03:25:54.320 --> 03:25:56.880
Rather than the single digit we were stuck with for a while

03:25:56.880 --> 03:25:58.880
And that all means that

03:25:58.880 --> 03:26:01.680
Owning your own hardware is a more feasible proposition

03:26:01.680 --> 03:26:02.720
Than it's ever been

03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:05.840
That you need fewer machines to run ever more

03:26:05.840 --> 03:26:07.440
And that more people should do it

03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:12.000
Because as much as I love Jeff and Amazon

03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:14.320
Like he doesn't need another

03:26:14.320 --> 03:26:16.880
Whatever 40% margin on all the tech stuff

03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:19.680
That I buy to run our business

03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:22.880
And this is just something I've been focused on

03:26:22.880 --> 03:26:26.480
Both because of the ideology around

03:26:26.480 --> 03:26:28.640
Honoring DARPA's original design

03:26:28.640 --> 03:26:31.600
The practicality of running our own hardware

03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:35.760
Seeing how fast we can push things with the latest machines

03:26:35.760 --> 03:26:37.840
And then saving the money

03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:41.840
And that has all been so enjoyable to do

03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:43.840
But also so counterintuitive for a lot of people

03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:46.560
Because it seemed I think for a lot of people in the industry

03:26:46.560 --> 03:26:47.920
That like we'd all decided

03:26:47.920 --> 03:26:49.920
That we were done buying computers

03:26:49.920 --> 03:26:52.560
That that was something we would just delegate to AWS

03:26:52.560 --> 03:26:55.440
And Azure and Google Cloud

03:26:55.440 --> 03:26:57.200
That we didn't have to own these things anymore

03:26:57.200 --> 03:26:59.280
So I think there's a little bit of whiplash

03:26:59.280 --> 03:27:00.800
For some people that

03:27:00.800 --> 03:27:02.080
Oh, I thought we agreed

03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:02.960
We were done with that

03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:04.400
And then along come us

03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:06.000
And say, yeah, do you know what?

03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:07.280
Maybe you should have a computer

03:27:07.280 --> 03:27:09.680
Is there some pain points to running your own servers?

03:27:09.680 --> 03:27:10.560
Oh, plenty

03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:13.280
There's pain points to operating computers of all kind

03:27:13.280 --> 03:27:16.800
Have you tried just like using a personal computer these days?

03:27:16.800 --> 03:27:19.040
Half the time when my kids or my wife

03:27:19.040 --> 03:27:20.240
Has my problem I go like

03:27:20.240 --> 03:27:22.000
Have you tried turning it just off and on again

03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:24.640
Computers are inherently painful to humans

03:27:25.520 --> 03:27:27.040
Owning your own computer though

03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:28.880
Kind of makes some of that pain worth it

03:27:28.880 --> 03:27:32.400
There's a responsibility that comes with actually owning the hardware

03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:34.480
To me, Adelaide,

03:27:34.480 --> 03:27:38.160
It's make the burden of operating that hardware seem slightly more enjoyable

03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:41.440
Now, there are things you have to learn

03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:42.720
Certainly at our scale too

03:27:42.720 --> 03:27:45.520
I mean, we're not just buying a single computer and plugging into an ethernet

03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:47.040
We have to have racks and racks of them

03:27:47.040 --> 03:27:48.560
And you've got to set it up with network cabling

03:27:48.560 --> 03:27:51.520
And there's some specialized expertise in that

03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:52.640
But it's not like that

03:27:52.640 --> 03:27:56.160
Expertise is like building nuclear rockets

03:27:56.160 --> 03:27:58.480
It's not like it's not widely distributed

03:27:58.480 --> 03:28:01.600
Literally the entire internet was built on people knowing

03:28:01.600 --> 03:28:03.520
How to plug in a computer to the internet

03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:04.000
Right?

03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:06.640
Oh, ethernet cable goes here, power cable goes here

03:28:06.640 --> 03:28:08.000
Let's boot up Linux

03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:10.640
That's how everyone put anything online until

03:28:11.440 --> 03:28:14.400
10, 12 years ago when the cloud sort of took over

03:28:14.400 --> 03:28:16.880
So the expertise is there and can be rediscovered

03:28:16.880 --> 03:28:19.680
You too can learn how to operate a Linux computer

03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:22.240
Yeah, and it's you know

03:28:22.240 --> 03:28:25.040
When you get a bunch of them there's a bunch of flashing LEDs

03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:26.480
And it's just so exciting

03:28:26.480 --> 03:28:27.280
Call me

03:28:27.280 --> 03:28:28.160
Amazing

03:28:28.160 --> 03:28:29.360
Computers are really fun

03:28:29.440 --> 03:28:31.760
This is actually something I've gotten into even deeper

03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:33.520
After we moved out of the cloud

03:28:33.520 --> 03:28:35.120
Now my next kind of

03:28:36.320 --> 03:28:38.080
tingle is that

03:28:38.080 --> 03:28:39.440
If you can move out of the cloud

03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:41.040
Can you also move out of the data center?

03:28:42.160 --> 03:28:46.080
Personal servers have gotten really

03:28:46.080 --> 03:28:48.400
scarierly quick and efficient

03:28:48.400 --> 03:28:51.280
And personal internet connections

03:28:51.280 --> 03:28:54.400
rival what we connected data centers with

03:28:54.400 --> 03:28:57.040
Just a decade or two ago

03:28:57.040 --> 03:29:00.720
So there's a whole community around this concept of home

03:29:00.720 --> 03:29:01.520
Lapping

03:29:01.520 --> 03:29:03.920
Which is essentially installing server hardware

03:29:03.920 --> 03:29:05.360
In your own apartment

03:29:05.360 --> 03:29:06.960
Connecting it to the internet

03:29:06.960 --> 03:29:10.000
And exposing that directly to the internet

03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:13.600
That hearts back to those glorious days of the 90s

03:29:13.600 --> 03:29:15.600
When people building for the internet

03:29:15.600 --> 03:29:17.920
Would host the actual website

03:29:17.920 --> 03:29:20.240
On their actual computer in the closet

03:29:20.240 --> 03:29:22.160
And I'm pretty fired up about that

03:29:22.160 --> 03:29:23.280
I'm doing a bunch of experiments

03:29:23.280 --> 03:29:25.040
I've ordered a bunch of home servers

03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:26.240
My own apartment

03:29:26.240 --> 03:29:29.440
I marvel at the fact that I can get a five gigabit

03:29:29.440 --> 03:29:30.640
Fiber connection now

03:29:30.640 --> 03:29:32.480
I think do you know what five gigabit

03:29:32.480 --> 03:29:34.160
That could have taken base camp to

03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:38.160
Multiple millions of MRR

03:29:38.160 --> 03:29:40.400
In the way that back then

03:29:40.400 --> 03:29:42.720
I ran the whole business on a single box

03:29:42.720 --> 03:29:44.800
With 2004 technology

03:29:44.800 --> 03:29:47.840
And I probably 100 mega bit cable

03:29:47.840 --> 03:29:50.560
Like the capacity we have access to

03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:53.520
Both in terms of compute and connectivity

03:29:54.160 --> 03:29:57.760
Is something that people haven't readjusted to

03:29:57.760 --> 03:29:59.280
And this happened sometimes in technology

03:29:59.280 --> 03:30:01.200
Where progress sneaks up on you

03:30:01.200 --> 03:30:02.880
This happened with SSDs

03:30:02.880 --> 03:30:04.160
I love that by the way

03:30:04.160 --> 03:30:06.080
We designed so much of our technology

03:30:06.080 --> 03:30:07.360
And storage approach

03:30:07.360 --> 03:30:08.720
And database designed

03:30:08.720 --> 03:30:11.360
Around spinning metal desks

03:30:11.360 --> 03:30:15.280
That had certain seek rate properties

03:30:15.280 --> 03:30:18.800
And then we went to NVMe and SSDs

03:30:18.800 --> 03:30:22.000
And it took quite a while for people to realize

03:30:22.720 --> 03:30:23.840
The systems have to be built

03:30:23.840 --> 03:30:25.280
Fultimately different now

03:30:25.280 --> 03:30:27.680
That the difference between memory

03:30:27.680 --> 03:30:28.880
And disc

03:30:28.880 --> 03:30:31.600
Was now far smaller when you weren't spinning

03:30:31.600 --> 03:30:32.960
These metal plates around

03:30:32.960 --> 03:30:34.720
With a little head that had to read off them

03:30:34.720 --> 03:30:35.920
You were essentially just

03:30:35.920 --> 03:30:37.840
Dealing with another type of memory

03:30:37.840 --> 03:30:39.440
I think we're a little bit in that same phase

03:30:39.440 --> 03:30:40.560
When it comes to

03:30:40.560 --> 03:30:42.960
The capacity of new businesses to be launched

03:30:42.960 --> 03:30:45.280
Literally out of your damn bedroom

03:30:45.280 --> 03:30:46.720
So you can get pretty far

03:30:46.720 --> 03:30:48.400
With a large user base

03:30:48.400 --> 03:30:50.000
With home labbing

03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:50.880
Absolutely

03:30:50.880 --> 03:30:51.600
That's exciting

03:30:51.600 --> 03:30:53.120
That's like the old school

03:30:53.120 --> 03:30:54.400
That's really exciting

03:30:54.400 --> 03:30:57.520
It's bringing back the startup and the garage

03:30:57.520 --> 03:31:00.560
In the literal physical sense of the word

03:31:00.560 --> 03:31:01.760
Now some of that is

03:31:02.480 --> 03:31:03.520
Do we need to?

03:31:03.520 --> 03:31:05.120
You can get relatively cheap

03:31:05.120 --> 03:31:06.240
Plowed capacity

03:31:06.240 --> 03:31:07.360
If you don't need very much

03:31:07.360 --> 03:31:08.560
Oh yes we need to

03:31:08.560 --> 03:31:10.160
I mean the feeling

03:31:10.160 --> 03:31:11.680
Of doing that by yourself

03:31:11.680 --> 03:31:13.200
Of seeing LED lights

03:31:14.880 --> 03:31:15.920
In your own home

03:31:15.920 --> 03:31:17.280
I mean there's nothing like that

03:31:17.280 --> 03:31:18.400
There's just an aesthetic to it

03:31:18.400 --> 03:31:20.240
That I am completely in love with

03:31:20.240 --> 03:31:21.440
And I want to try to push on

03:31:21.920 --> 03:31:22.960
It's not going to be the same thing

03:31:22.960 --> 03:31:23.840
As getting out of the cloud

03:31:23.840 --> 03:31:24.320
I'm not sure

03:31:24.320 --> 03:31:25.520
Our exit out of the cloud

03:31:25.520 --> 03:31:27.120
Was not the exit out of the data center

03:31:27.120 --> 03:31:28.960
We basically just bought hardware

03:31:28.960 --> 03:31:31.760
Shipped it to a professionally managed data center

03:31:31.760 --> 03:31:32.800
That

03:31:32.800 --> 03:31:34.160
We didn't even actually touch

03:31:34.160 --> 03:31:35.200
This is the other misconception

03:31:35.200 --> 03:31:36.560
People have about moving out of the cloud

03:31:36.560 --> 03:31:37.600
That we have a bunch of people

03:31:37.600 --> 03:31:39.360
Who are constantly driving to a data center

03:31:39.360 --> 03:31:40.800
Somewhere to rack

03:31:40.800 --> 03:31:43.280
New boxes and change dead RAM

03:31:43.280 --> 03:31:45.840
That's not how things happen in the modern world at all

03:31:45.840 --> 03:31:48.400
We have a company called

03:31:48.400 --> 03:31:50.400
Summit previously deft

03:31:50.400 --> 03:31:52.320
That is what we call white gloves

03:31:52.320 --> 03:31:53.840
They just they work in the data center

03:31:53.840 --> 03:31:55.200
When we need something like

03:31:55.200 --> 03:31:56.160
Hey deft

03:31:56.160 --> 03:31:58.560
Can you go down and swap the debt

03:31:58.560 --> 03:32:00.880
SSD and box number six

03:32:00.880 --> 03:32:01.680
They do it

03:32:01.680 --> 03:32:04.080
And what we see is a kin to what

03:32:04.080 --> 03:32:05.680
Someone working with the cloud would see

03:32:05.680 --> 03:32:07.680
You see IP addresses coming online

03:32:07.680 --> 03:32:09.280
You see drives coming online

03:32:09.280 --> 03:32:10.640
It's not that different

03:32:10.640 --> 03:32:13.040
But it is a whole heck of a lot cheaper

03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:15.040
When you are operating at our scale

03:32:15.040 --> 03:32:16.240
And of course it is

03:32:16.240 --> 03:32:18.000
Of course it's cheaper to own things

03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:20.960
If you need those things for years

03:32:20.960 --> 03:32:22.400
Rather than it is to rent it

03:32:22.400 --> 03:32:23.760
In no other domain

03:32:23.760 --> 03:32:25.360
Would we confuse those two things

03:32:25.360 --> 03:32:26.800
That it's cheaper to own

03:32:26.800 --> 03:32:28.880
For the long duration than it is to rent

03:32:28.880 --> 03:32:30.800
There is some gray area like

03:32:30.800 --> 03:32:32.480
I've gotten a chance to interact

03:32:32.480 --> 03:32:34.080
With the XAI team a bunch

03:32:34.080 --> 03:32:35.280
I'll probably going back out there

03:32:35.280 --> 03:32:37.280
And Memphis to do a big podcast

03:32:37.280 --> 03:32:39.280
Associate with the GROC release

03:32:39.280 --> 03:32:40.720
And those folks

03:32:40.720 --> 03:32:43.360
In order to achieve the speed

03:32:43.360 --> 03:32:45.840
Of building up the cluster

03:32:45.840 --> 03:32:47.840
And to solve some of the novel aspects

03:32:47.840 --> 03:32:49.040
They have to do with the GPU

03:32:49.040 --> 03:32:50.480
With the training

03:32:50.480 --> 03:32:52.320
They have to be a little bit more hands-on

03:32:52.320 --> 03:32:54.080
So less white glove

03:32:54.080 --> 03:32:55.280
Oh and I love that right

03:32:55.280 --> 03:32:56.960
They're dealing with a frontier problem

03:32:56.960 --> 03:32:57.920
And they're dealing with

03:32:57.920 --> 03:32:59.600
Not by renting a bunch of GPUs

03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:02.640
At a huge markup from their main competitor

03:33:02.640 --> 03:33:03.840
They're going like no screw that

03:33:03.840 --> 03:33:06.000
We're going to put 100,000 GPUs

03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:07.520
In our own tents

03:33:07.520 --> 03:33:09.600
Right and build it in absolute record time

03:33:09.600 --> 03:33:10.800
So I think if anything

03:33:10.800 --> 03:33:12.560
This is testament to the idea

03:33:12.560 --> 03:33:14.000
That owning hardware

03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:15.120
Give you an advantage

03:33:15.120 --> 03:33:16.240
Both at the small scale

03:33:16.240 --> 03:33:17.280
At the medium scale

03:33:17.280 --> 03:33:19.840
And at the pioneer levels of computing

03:33:19.840 --> 03:33:20.640
By the way

03:33:20.640 --> 03:33:21.600
Speaking of teams

03:33:21.600 --> 03:33:24.560
Those are XAI, Tesla, or

03:33:24.560 --> 03:33:26.240
Large companies

03:33:27.040 --> 03:33:28.560
But all those folks

03:33:30.080 --> 03:33:31.120
I don't know where it is about

03:33:31.120 --> 03:33:32.880
You said Jeff is really good at

03:33:33.920 --> 03:33:35.200
Finding good people

03:33:36.400 --> 03:33:38.800
At seeing strength in people

03:33:38.800 --> 03:33:40.720
Like Elon is also extremely

03:33:40.720 --> 03:33:42.000
I don't know what that is

03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:43.920
Actually I've never actually seen

03:33:43.920 --> 03:33:45.040
Maybe you could speak to that

03:33:45.680 --> 03:33:48.480
He's good at finding greatness

03:33:48.480 --> 03:33:50.880
I don't think he's finding as much as he's attracting

03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:53.520
He's attracting the talent

03:33:53.520 --> 03:33:55.520
Because of the audaciousness

03:33:55.520 --> 03:33:57.440
Of his goals and his mission

03:33:57.440 --> 03:33:59.840
The clarity by which he states it

03:33:59.840 --> 03:34:02.080
He doesn't have to go scourier

03:34:02.080 --> 03:34:03.440
To find the best people

03:34:03.440 --> 03:34:04.640
The best people come to him

03:34:04.640 --> 03:34:06.400
Because he is

03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:07.600
Talking about Elon here

03:34:07.600 --> 03:34:09.760
One of the singular most

03:34:09.760 --> 03:34:11.040
Invigorating figures

03:34:11.040 --> 03:34:13.360
In both the same order of the universe here

03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:14.320
Haters and lovers

03:34:14.880 --> 03:34:16.320
Like he's having such an impact

03:34:16.320 --> 03:34:17.360
That's such a scale

03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:19.280
That of course he's got to have literally

03:34:19.280 --> 03:34:20.880
Millions of people think he's the

03:34:22.320 --> 03:34:23.920
Worst person in the world

03:34:23.920 --> 03:34:25.440
And he's also going to have millions of people

03:34:25.440 --> 03:34:27.200
Thinking he's the greatest gift to humanity

03:34:27.920 --> 03:34:28.800
Depending on the day

03:34:28.800 --> 03:34:29.760
I'm somewhere in between

03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:31.920
But I'm more on the greatest gift to humanity

03:34:31.920 --> 03:34:32.640
End of the scale

03:34:32.640 --> 03:34:34.400
And I'm on the other end of the scale

03:34:34.400 --> 03:34:35.520
And I think that really

03:34:36.320 --> 03:34:38.800
Inspires people in a way

03:34:38.800 --> 03:34:40.000
That we've almost forgotten

03:34:40.720 --> 03:34:41.920
That

03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:43.600
That level of audacity

03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:44.560
Is so rare

03:34:45.360 --> 03:34:46.400
That when we see it

03:34:46.400 --> 03:34:48.160
We don't fully know how to analyze it

03:34:48.160 --> 03:34:50.080
We think of Elon as finding Greg Town

03:34:50.080 --> 03:34:51.760
And I'm sure he's also good at that

03:34:51.760 --> 03:34:53.680
But I also think that this

03:34:53.680 --> 03:34:54.640
Beacon

03:34:54.640 --> 03:34:55.840
Of the mission

03:34:55.840 --> 03:34:57.520
We're going to fucking Mars

03:34:58.320 --> 03:35:00.480
We're going to transform

03:35:00.480 --> 03:35:03.200
Transportation into using electricity

03:35:03.200 --> 03:35:05.120
We're going to cover the earth

03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:06.320
In internet

03:35:06.320 --> 03:35:08.000
Is so grand

03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:09.840
That there are days where I wake up

03:35:09.840 --> 03:35:12.160
And go like what the fuck am I doing with these to-do lists

03:35:12.720 --> 03:35:13.840
Like Jesus

03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:14.880
Should I

03:35:14.880 --> 03:35:16.640
Go sign up for something like that

03:35:16.640 --> 03:35:16.800
Yeah

03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:18.320
That sounds invigorating

03:35:18.320 --> 03:35:20.720
In a sense I can only imagine like a

03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:21.760
Viking back in

03:35:22.640 --> 03:35:24.160
1050 going like

03:35:24.160 --> 03:35:25.600
Should we go to Normandy

03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:27.440
You may die along the way

03:35:27.440 --> 03:35:28.480
But oh boy

03:35:28.480 --> 03:35:30.800
That that sound like a journey and an adventure

03:35:30.800 --> 03:35:31.600
There's a few components

03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:32.560
There's one definitely

03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:34.560
This bigger than life mission

03:35:34.560 --> 03:35:37.120
And really believing it

03:35:37.760 --> 03:35:38.240
You know

03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:39.920
Every other sentence is about Mars

03:35:39.920 --> 03:35:41.040
Like really believing it

03:35:41.040 --> 03:35:42.640
It doesn't really matter what

03:35:42.640 --> 03:35:43.760
Like anybody else

03:35:43.760 --> 03:35:45.440
The criticism and anything

03:35:45.440 --> 03:35:46.640
There's a very

03:35:46.640 --> 03:35:47.680
Singular

03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:49.120
Focused big mission

03:35:49.120 --> 03:35:51.600
But I think it also has to do a bunch of the

03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:53.120
Other components

03:35:53.120 --> 03:35:54.000
Like

03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:55.760
Being able to hire well

03:35:55.760 --> 03:35:56.960
Once the people

03:35:56.960 --> 03:35:58.240
Once the beacon attracts

03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:02.080
And I just seen people that don't necessarily

03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:04.720
On paper have a resume with the track record

03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:06.320
I've

03:36:06.320 --> 03:36:07.280
I've seen really

03:36:07.280 --> 03:36:10.160
Who now turned out to be like legendary people

03:36:10.800 --> 03:36:13.600
He basically like tosses them in the ball of leadership

03:36:14.240 --> 03:36:15.520
See something in them

03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:16.480
And says like

03:36:16.480 --> 03:36:18.640
You go and gives them the ownership

03:36:18.640 --> 03:36:19.520
And they run with it

03:36:19.520 --> 03:36:21.120
And that happens at every scale

03:36:21.120 --> 03:36:23.760
That there's the real meritocracy

03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:24.960
And like there's something

03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:28.560
There's just like

03:36:28.560 --> 03:36:30.640
You can see the flourishing of human intellect

03:36:30.640 --> 03:36:31.680
In these meetings

03:36:31.680 --> 03:36:33.440
In these group getting together

03:36:33.440 --> 03:36:34.640
Where they're like

03:36:34.640 --> 03:36:36.480
The energy is palpable

03:36:36.480 --> 03:36:37.280
It's

03:36:37.280 --> 03:36:39.040
It's like exciting for me to just

03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:41.280
Be around that

03:36:41.280 --> 03:36:42.080
Because I don't

03:36:42.080 --> 03:36:43.840
There's not many companies I've seen that in

03:36:43.840 --> 03:36:47.200
Because when a company becomes successful and larger

03:36:47.200 --> 03:36:49.920
It somehow suffocates that energy

03:36:49.920 --> 03:36:52.160
That I guess you see in startups

03:36:53.360 --> 03:36:55.040
At the early stages

03:36:55.040 --> 03:36:57.520
But like it's cool to see it

03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:00.480
At a large company that's actually able to achieve scale

03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:01.680
You know

03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:04.000
I think part of the secret there

03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:07.040
Is that Elon actually knows things

03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:09.280
And when you know things

03:37:09.280 --> 03:37:12.160
You can evaluate the quality of work products

03:37:12.160 --> 03:37:14.400
And when you can evaluate the quality of work products

03:37:14.400 --> 03:37:17.360
You can very quickly tell who's full of shit

03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:19.280
And who will actually take you to Mars

03:37:19.280 --> 03:37:21.120
And you can fire the people who's full of shit

03:37:21.120 --> 03:37:23.040
And you can bet on the people who get us to Mars

03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:29.840
That capacity to directly evaluate the competency of individuals

03:37:30.800 --> 03:37:32.080
Is actually a little bit rare

03:37:32.720 --> 03:37:36.080
It's not widely distributed amongst managers

03:37:36.160 --> 03:37:37.200
Hiring managers

03:37:37.920 --> 03:37:41.040
It's not something you can easily delegate

03:37:41.040 --> 03:37:42.400
To people who are not

03:37:43.680 --> 03:37:45.600
Very skilled at the work itself

03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:48.400
And Elon obviously knows a lot about a lot

03:37:48.400 --> 03:37:49.280
And he can smell

03:37:49.920 --> 03:37:51.680
Who knows stuff for real

03:37:51.680 --> 03:37:52.400
And

03:37:52.400 --> 03:37:54.800
Is this at our tiny scale

03:37:54.800 --> 03:37:57.760
Something I've tried to do in the same order

03:37:57.760 --> 03:37:59.760
Where when we hire programmers for example

03:38:00.960 --> 03:38:03.440
It's going to be interesting now with AI as a new challenge

03:38:03.440 --> 03:38:04.720
But up until this point

03:38:05.440 --> 03:38:08.400
The main pivot point for getting hired

03:38:08.400 --> 03:38:09.440
Was not your resume

03:38:09.440 --> 03:38:11.600
Was not the schooling you've had

03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:12.640
Was not your grades

03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:13.840
Was not your pedigree

03:38:14.400 --> 03:38:17.600
It was how well you did on two things

03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:19.280
A, your cover letter

03:38:19.280 --> 03:38:21.520
Because I can only work with people remotely

03:38:21.520 --> 03:38:22.720
If they're good writers

03:38:22.720 --> 03:38:24.960
So if you can't pen a proper cover letter

03:38:24.960 --> 03:38:26.960
And can't bother to put it in the effort

03:38:26.960 --> 03:38:29.120
To write it specifically for us

03:38:29.120 --> 03:38:29.520
You're out

03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:30.560
2

03:38:31.520 --> 03:38:33.760
You have to be able to program really well

03:38:33.760 --> 03:38:35.920
To degree that I can look at your code and go like

03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:37.440
Yeah, I want to work with that person

03:38:37.440 --> 03:38:38.960
Not only I want to work with that person

03:38:38.960 --> 03:38:40.800
I want to work on that person's code

03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:42.640
When I have to see it again in five years

03:38:42.640 --> 03:38:44.240
To fix some damn bug

03:38:44.240 --> 03:38:46.080
So we're going to give you a programming test

03:38:46.800 --> 03:38:49.600
That simulates the way we work for real

03:38:49.600 --> 03:38:50.880
And we're going to see how you do

03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:53.040
And I've been surprised time and again

03:38:53.040 --> 03:38:54.800
Where I thought for sure

03:38:54.800 --> 03:38:56.720
This candidate is a shooant

03:38:56.720 --> 03:38:57.920
They sound just right

03:38:57.920 --> 03:38:59.520
The CV is just right

03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:01.040
And then you see the code

03:39:01.040 --> 03:39:01.760
Getting churned in

03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:03.280
I'm like no way

03:39:03.280 --> 03:39:05.280
No way are we hiring this person

03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:07.440
And the other way has been true

03:39:07.440 --> 03:39:08.160
As well

03:39:08.160 --> 03:39:08.880
I've got a like

03:39:08.880 --> 03:39:10.160
I don't know about this guy

03:39:10.400 --> 03:39:11.200
Or this

03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:12.400
This woman

03:39:12.400 --> 03:39:13.680
Yeah, I don't know

03:39:13.680 --> 03:39:14.880
And then they turn in their code stuff

03:39:14.880 --> 03:39:15.920
And I like holy shit

03:39:15.920 --> 03:39:17.520
Can that person be on my team

03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:18.640
Tomorrow

03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:20.080
Preferably

03:39:20.080 --> 03:39:22.080
The capacity to evaluate work product

03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:23.920
Is a superpower when it comes to hiring

03:39:23.920 --> 03:39:25.040
There's the step

03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:26.720
That's the Elon dude really well

03:39:26.720 --> 03:39:28.480
Which is be able to show up and say

03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:31.040
This can be done simpler

03:39:31.040 --> 03:39:31.600
Yes

03:39:31.680 --> 03:39:33.200
But he knows what he's talking about

03:39:33.200 --> 03:39:35.600
And then the engineer

03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:37.760
Because Elon knows enough

03:39:38.640 --> 03:39:39.760
The engineer

03:39:39.760 --> 03:39:40.720
First reaction

03:39:40.720 --> 03:39:41.840
You can kind of tell

03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:43.360
Like it's almost like

03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:44.560
Rolling your eyes

03:39:44.560 --> 03:39:46.320
If your parent tells you something

03:39:46.320 --> 03:39:46.880
Yes

03:39:46.880 --> 03:39:48.000
This is not

03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:48.720
No, we've

03:39:48.720 --> 03:39:50.640
I've been working on this for a month

03:39:50.640 --> 03:39:51.360
You don't know

03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:54.000
But then when you have that conversation a little more

03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:54.720
You realize

03:39:54.720 --> 03:39:55.920
No, it can be

03:39:55.920 --> 03:39:56.880
Done simpler

03:39:56.880 --> 03:39:58.000
Find the way

03:39:58.000 --> 03:39:59.440
So there's a good

03:39:59.440 --> 03:40:01.440
When two engineers are talking

03:40:01.440 --> 03:40:03.680
One might not have perfect information

03:40:03.680 --> 03:40:05.200
But if

03:40:05.200 --> 03:40:08.480
If the senior engineer has like good instinct

03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:11.600
That's like been battle earned

03:40:12.400 --> 03:40:14.320
Then you can say simplify

03:40:14.320 --> 03:40:17.600
And it actually will result in simplification

03:40:17.600 --> 03:40:20.640
And I think this is the hallmark of the true greats

03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:23.200
That they not only have the insight into

03:40:23.200 --> 03:40:24.960
What's required to do the work

03:40:24.960 --> 03:40:28.480
But they also have the transcenten

03:40:28.480 --> 03:40:30.640
Vision to go beyond what

03:40:31.520 --> 03:40:32.560
The engineer would do

03:40:32.560 --> 03:40:33.600
The programmer would do

03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:36.800
I think if we are looking at these rareties

03:40:36.800 --> 03:40:40.560
Obviously the myth of Steve Jobs

03:40:40.560 --> 03:40:41.360
Was also this

03:40:41.360 --> 03:40:43.840
Even though perhaps he was less technical

03:40:43.840 --> 03:40:45.920
Than Elon is in many ways

03:40:45.920 --> 03:40:48.000
He had the same capacity to show up

03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:49.840
To a product team

03:40:49.840 --> 03:40:53.200
And really challenge them to look harder for the simplification

03:40:53.200 --> 03:40:54.880
Or for making things greater

03:40:56.000 --> 03:40:57.440
In a way that would

03:40:57.440 --> 03:40:58.960
Garner disbelief

03:40:58.960 --> 03:41:00.160
From the people who were supposed to do it

03:41:00.160 --> 03:41:01.360
Like this guy is full of shit

03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:02.240
Like this is crazy

03:41:02.240 --> 03:41:03.680
We can never

03:41:03.680 --> 03:41:05.440
And then two months later it is

03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:06.640
So

03:41:06.640 --> 03:41:07.760
There is something of this

03:41:07.760 --> 03:41:09.280
Where you need

03:41:09.280 --> 03:41:10.400
You need the vision

03:41:10.400 --> 03:41:12.720
You need it anchored by the reality

03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:14.960
Of knowing enough about what's possible

03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:16.160
Knowing enough about physics

03:41:16.160 --> 03:41:18.160
Knowing enough about software

03:41:18.160 --> 03:41:19.200
That you're not just

03:41:19.200 --> 03:41:20.000
Building bullshit

03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:21.120
There are plenty of people who can

03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:22.640
Tell a group of engineers

03:41:22.640 --> 03:41:24.080
No, just do it faster

03:41:24.080 --> 03:41:25.440
Like that's not a skill

03:41:25.440 --> 03:41:27.760
It's got to be anchored in something real

03:41:27.760 --> 03:41:29.360
But it's also going to be anchored

03:41:29.360 --> 03:41:30.640
In

03:41:31.600 --> 03:41:32.960
It's a tired word

03:41:32.960 --> 03:41:35.360
But a passion for the outcome

03:41:35.360 --> 03:41:37.920
To a degree where you get personally insulted

03:41:37.920 --> 03:41:39.760
If a bad job is done

03:41:39.760 --> 03:41:43.120
This is what I've been writing about lately with Apple

03:41:43.120 --> 03:41:44.720
They've lost that asshole

03:41:44.720 --> 03:41:46.800
Who would show up and tell engineers

03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:47.840
That

03:41:47.840 --> 03:41:50.480
What they did was not good enough

03:41:50.480 --> 03:41:52.480
In ways that would actually perhaps

03:41:52.480 --> 03:41:55.360
Make them feel a little small in the moment

03:41:55.360 --> 03:41:56.640
But would spark that

03:41:58.320 --> 03:41:59.280
Zest

03:41:59.280 --> 03:42:00.160
To really fix it

03:42:00.160 --> 03:42:03.280
Now they have a logistics person

03:42:03.280 --> 03:42:06.160
Who's very good at sourcing components

03:42:06.160 --> 03:42:08.960
And lining up production gant charts

03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:12.160
But you're not getting that magic

03:42:12.160 --> 03:42:15.200
Now what's interesting with that whole scenario was

03:42:15.200 --> 03:42:17.440
I actually thought how well Tim cooked

03:42:17.440 --> 03:42:19.520
Ran things and has run things

03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:20.640
At Apple for so long

03:42:20.640 --> 03:42:22.160
That maybe we were wrong

03:42:22.160 --> 03:42:24.640
Maybe we were wrong about the criticality

03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:26.560
Of Steve Jobs

03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:27.520
To the whole mission

03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:29.680
Maybe you could get away with not having it

03:42:29.680 --> 03:42:31.280
I think the bill was just

03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:33.680
Going to come later and now it has

03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:36.320
Apple is failing in all these ways

03:42:36.320 --> 03:42:40.400
That someone who would blow up Steve's ghost

03:42:40.400 --> 03:42:42.960
And really exult him would say like see

03:42:42.960 --> 03:42:44.160
This is what's happening now

03:42:44.160 --> 03:42:46.320
So the other thing here too of course

03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:48.080
Is it's impossible to divorce

03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:50.560
Like your perception of what's

03:42:50.560 --> 03:42:52.240
A critical component of the system

03:42:52.240 --> 03:42:55.680
And the messy reality of a million different moving parts

03:42:55.760 --> 03:42:56.880
In the reality of life

03:42:56.880 --> 03:42:59.920
And you should be skeptical about your own analysis

03:42:59.920 --> 03:43:01.760
Your own thesis at all time

03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:02.800
Since you mentioned Apple

03:43:02.800 --> 03:43:04.400
Have to ask

03:43:04.400 --> 03:43:07.920
Somebody in the internet submitted the question

03:43:10.320 --> 03:43:12.240
Does DHA still hate Apple

03:43:12.240 --> 03:43:14.240
I believe the question is

03:43:14.640 --> 03:43:16.160
So there was a time

03:43:17.200 --> 03:43:20.000
When base camp went to war

03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:22.000
With Apple over the 30%

03:43:22.880 --> 03:43:24.880
What can you tell the saga of that battle

03:43:25.680 --> 03:43:26.400
Yes

03:43:26.400 --> 03:43:27.440
But first I'll tell you

03:43:27.440 --> 03:43:28.800
I fell in love with Apple

03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:30.640
Which was all the way back in

03:43:30.640 --> 03:43:32.320
Also early 2000s

03:43:33.360 --> 03:43:34.240
When

03:43:34.240 --> 03:43:36.880
Microsoft was dominating the industry

03:43:37.680 --> 03:43:40.080
In a way we now see

03:43:40.080 --> 03:43:42.880
Apple and Google dominate mobile phones

03:43:42.880 --> 03:43:44.320
Microsoft was just everything

03:43:44.320 --> 03:43:45.760
When it came to personal computers

03:43:45.760 --> 03:43:48.640
And I really did not like the Microsoft of the 90s

03:43:48.640 --> 03:43:50.800
The Microsoft of the 90s was the

03:43:50.800 --> 03:43:52.320
Cut off the air supply

03:43:52.320 --> 03:43:55.040
To net scape kind of characters

03:43:55.040 --> 03:43:57.600
Was the Bill Gates sitting defiant

03:43:57.600 --> 03:44:02.480
In an interview with the DOJ asking about what the definition of what is

03:44:03.280 --> 03:44:04.480
And just

03:44:04.480 --> 03:44:06.000
Overall unpleasant

03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:08.640
I think you can have respect for what was achieved

03:44:08.640 --> 03:44:10.000
But I certainly didn't like it

03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:11.280
And as we've talked about

03:44:11.280 --> 03:44:14.080
I came begrudgingly to the PC

03:44:14.080 --> 03:44:15.600
After Commodore fell apart

03:44:15.600 --> 03:44:17.680
And I couldn't continue to use the Amiga

03:44:17.680 --> 03:44:20.160
So I already had a bit of a bone to pick with

03:44:20.960 --> 03:44:23.680
PCs just over the fact that I love my Amiga so much

03:44:23.680 --> 03:44:25.440
But then in the early 2000s

03:44:25.440 --> 03:44:28.240
Apple emerged as a credible alternative

03:44:28.240 --> 03:44:31.680
Because they bet the new generation of Macs

03:44:31.680 --> 03:44:32.720
Ununix underpinnings

03:44:33.760 --> 03:44:37.280
And that allowed me to escape from Microsoft

03:44:37.280 --> 03:44:40.960
And suddenly I became one of the biggest boosters of Apple

03:44:40.960 --> 03:44:46.080
I was in my graduating class at the Copenhagen Business School

03:44:46.080 --> 03:44:48.960
I started with the first white iBook

03:44:49.840 --> 03:44:50.880
First person using Mac

03:44:50.880 --> 03:44:52.880
And by the time we were done in graduating

03:44:52.960 --> 03:44:55.360
I had basically converted half the class

03:44:55.360 --> 03:44:57.040
To using Apple computers

03:44:57.040 --> 03:44:59.120
Because I would evangelize them so hard

03:44:59.120 --> 03:45:00.400
And demonstrate them

03:45:00.400 --> 03:45:03.760
And do all the things that a superfan would do

03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:06.320
And I continued that work over many years

03:45:07.120 --> 03:45:08.480
Jason or I actually

03:45:08.480 --> 03:45:10.560
And I think 2004, 2005

03:45:10.560 --> 03:45:12.480
Did an ad for Apple

03:45:12.480 --> 03:45:14.240
That they posted on the developer side

03:45:14.240 --> 03:45:15.520
Where we were all about our Apple

03:45:15.520 --> 03:45:17.280
So integral to everything that we do

03:45:17.280 --> 03:45:18.320
And we look up to them

03:45:18.320 --> 03:45:20.560
And we are inspired by them

03:45:20.560 --> 03:45:22.320
And that love relationship

03:45:22.400 --> 03:45:25.360
Actually continued for a very long time

03:45:25.360 --> 03:45:29.680
I basically just became a Mac person for 20 years

03:45:29.680 --> 03:45:32.720
I didn't even care about looking at PCs

03:45:32.720 --> 03:45:34.560
It seemed irrelevant to me

03:45:34.560 --> 03:45:35.840
Whatever Microsoft was doing

03:45:35.840 --> 03:45:37.120
Which felt like such a relief

03:45:37.120 --> 03:45:39.120
Because in the 90s

03:45:39.120 --> 03:45:40.480
I felt like I couldn't escape

03:45:40.480 --> 03:45:42.320
Microsoft and suddenly I had found my escape

03:45:42.320 --> 03:45:43.520
And now I was with Apple

03:45:43.520 --> 03:45:44.320
And it was glorious

03:45:44.320 --> 03:45:46.160
And they shared so many of my sensibilities

03:45:46.160 --> 03:45:46.960
And my aesthetics

03:45:46.960 --> 03:45:48.480
And they kept pushing the envelope

03:45:48.480 --> 03:45:50.400
And there was so much to be proud of

03:45:50.400 --> 03:45:51.680
So much to look up to

03:45:53.280 --> 03:45:56.480
And then that sort of started to change with the iPhone

03:45:56.480 --> 03:46:00.080
Which is weird because the iPhone is what made modern Apple

03:46:00.080 --> 03:46:02.080
It's what I lined up

03:46:02.080 --> 03:46:04.080
In 2007 together with Jason

03:46:04.080 --> 03:46:05.840
For five hours

03:46:05.840 --> 03:46:07.360
To stand in the line

03:46:07.360 --> 03:46:10.000
To buy a first generation product

03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:12.400
Where Apple staff would clap at you

03:46:12.400 --> 03:46:13.920
When you walked out the store

03:46:13.920 --> 03:46:14.960
I don't know if you remember that

03:46:14.960 --> 03:46:17.200
It was a whole ceremony

03:46:17.200 --> 03:46:18.880
And it was part of that

03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:20.240
Myth and mystique

03:46:21.120 --> 03:46:23.120
All of Apple

03:46:23.840 --> 03:46:25.600
I wasn't in the market for other computers

03:46:25.600 --> 03:46:27.280
I wasn't in the market for other computer ideas

03:46:27.280 --> 03:46:30.400
I thought perhaps I'd be with the Mac until the end of days

03:46:31.280 --> 03:46:33.840
But as Apple discovered

03:46:33.840 --> 03:46:35.200
The gold mine

03:46:35.200 --> 03:46:37.840
It is to operate a toll booth

03:46:37.840 --> 03:46:39.520
Where you don't have to innovate

03:46:39.520 --> 03:46:41.680
Where you don't actually even have to make anything

03:46:41.680 --> 03:46:44.400
Where you can just take 30% of other people's business

03:46:45.120 --> 03:46:46.640
There was a rot

03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:48.720
That's crept in

03:46:48.720 --> 03:46:50.400
To the foundation of Apple

03:46:50.400 --> 03:46:52.080
And that started all the way back

03:46:52.080 --> 03:46:54.800
From the initial launch of the App Store

03:46:54.800 --> 03:46:57.120
But I don't think we saw at the time

03:46:57.120 --> 03:46:58.160
I didn't see at the time

03:46:58.160 --> 03:46:59.840
Just how critical

03:46:59.840 --> 03:47:02.880
The mobile phone would become to computing in general

03:47:02.880 --> 03:47:04.400
I thought when the iPhone came out

03:47:04.400 --> 03:47:06.080
That like, oh, it's like a mobile phone

03:47:06.080 --> 03:47:08.560
I've had a mobile phone since the early 90s

03:47:08.560 --> 03:47:09.760
Well, it wasn't a mobile phone

03:47:09.760 --> 03:47:11.200
It was a mobile computer

03:47:11.200 --> 03:47:13.040
And even more than that

03:47:13.040 --> 03:47:14.560
It was the most important computer

03:47:14.560 --> 03:47:16.160
Or it would become the most important computer

03:47:16.160 --> 03:47:18.320
For most people around the world

03:47:18.400 --> 03:47:21.040
Which meant that if you like to make software

03:47:21.040 --> 03:47:22.240
And wanted to sell it to people

03:47:22.240 --> 03:47:24.320
You had to go through that computer

03:47:24.320 --> 03:47:26.240
And if going through that computer meant

03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:28.800
Going through Apple's toll booth

03:47:29.680 --> 03:47:32.240
And not just having to ask them permission

03:47:32.240 --> 03:47:35.920
Which in and of itself was just an dignity

03:47:35.920 --> 03:47:37.200
When you're used to the internet

03:47:37.200 --> 03:47:40.000
Where you don't have to ask anyone permission about anything

03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:42.080
You buy the main and you launch your business

03:47:42.080 --> 03:47:44.000
And the customers show up

03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:45.040
Boom, you're success

03:47:45.040 --> 03:47:45.840
And if they don't

03:47:45.840 --> 03:47:47.040
Well, you're failure

03:47:47.120 --> 03:47:49.840
Now suddenly before you could even launch

03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:52.320
You'd have to ask Apple for permission

03:47:52.320 --> 03:47:53.920
That always sat wrong with me

03:47:53.920 --> 03:47:56.320
But it wasn't until we launched

03:47:56.320 --> 03:47:59.760
Hey in 2001

03:47:59.760 --> 03:48:02.880
That I saw the full extent of the rot

03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:04.880
That has snug into Apple's Apple

03:48:04.880 --> 03:48:06.080
For people who don't know

03:48:06.080 --> 03:48:07.120
And we'll talk about it

03:48:07.120 --> 03:48:10.320
Hey, is this amazing email

03:48:10.320 --> 03:48:14.480
Sort of attempt to solve the email problem

03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:14.960
Yes

03:48:14.960 --> 03:48:16.880
I like to pitch it as

03:48:16.880 --> 03:48:18.320
What Gmail would have been

03:48:18.320 --> 03:48:20.080
With 20 years of lessons

03:48:20.080 --> 03:48:22.800
Applied in a way where they could actually ship

03:48:22.800 --> 03:48:26.080
Gmail was incredible when you launched in 2004

03:48:26.080 --> 03:48:28.000
And it still is a great product

03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:31.920
But it's also trapped in its initial success

03:48:31.920 --> 03:48:34.320
You can't redesign Gmail today

03:48:34.320 --> 03:48:35.760
It's just that's way too many users

03:48:35.760 --> 03:48:38.720
So if you want fresh thinking on email

03:48:38.720 --> 03:48:40.880
I wanted fresh thinking on email

03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:42.560
I needed to build my own email system

03:48:42.560 --> 03:48:44.080
And not just my own email client

03:48:44.080 --> 03:48:45.840
That's what a lot of people have done over the years

03:48:45.840 --> 03:48:47.440
They build a client for Gmail

03:48:47.440 --> 03:48:49.920
But you're severely constrained

03:48:49.920 --> 03:48:52.320
If you don't control the email server as well

03:48:52.320 --> 03:48:54.640
If you really want to move the ball forward with email

03:48:54.640 --> 03:48:56.880
You have to control both the server and the client

03:48:56.880 --> 03:49:00.320
And that was the adacious mission we set out to do with hey

03:49:00.320 --> 03:49:02.160
And that was what's funny

03:49:02.960 --> 03:49:05.760
I thought our main obstacle here would be Gmail

03:49:05.760 --> 03:49:08.720
It's the 800 pound gorilla into email space

03:49:08.720 --> 03:49:09.360
Something like

03:49:10.240 --> 03:49:14.000
70% of all email in the US is sent through Gmail

03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:16.880
I think their world rates are probably in that neighborhood as well

03:49:16.880 --> 03:49:19.520
They're just absolutely huge

03:49:20.400 --> 03:49:22.960
And trying to attack an enormous

03:49:24.560 --> 03:49:27.600
Established competitor like that

03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:31.520
Who's so actually still loved by plenty of people

03:49:31.520 --> 03:49:34.640
And it's free seems like a suicide mission

03:49:34.640 --> 03:49:36.400
And it was only a mission we signed up for

03:49:36.400 --> 03:49:38.720
Because we had grown ambitious enough

03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:40.480
After making base camp for 20 years

03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:42.160
That we thought we could tackle that problem

03:49:42.160 --> 03:49:43.200
So I thought hey

03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:45.440
This is dumb

03:49:45.440 --> 03:49:48.240
I would not advise anyone to go ahead

03:49:48.240 --> 03:49:49.840
To head with Gmail

03:49:49.840 --> 03:49:51.440
That seems like a suicide mission

03:49:51.440 --> 03:49:52.480
We're going to try anyway

03:49:52.480 --> 03:49:53.200
Because you know what

03:49:53.200 --> 03:49:54.000
If we fail

03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:55.040
It's going to be fine

03:49:55.040 --> 03:49:56.800
We're just going to build a better email experience

03:49:56.800 --> 03:49:58.080
For me and Jason

03:49:58.080 --> 03:49:59.120
And the people at the company

03:49:59.120 --> 03:49:59.920
And our cat

03:49:59.920 --> 03:50:01.120
And that'll be okay

03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:02.320
Because we're going to fort to do so

03:50:02.960 --> 03:50:05.760
But when we got ready to launch

03:50:05.760 --> 03:50:08.080
After spending two years building this product

03:50:08.080 --> 03:50:09.840
Millions of dollars in investment to it

03:50:10.560 --> 03:50:12.560
We obviously needed mobile apps

03:50:12.560 --> 03:50:14.000
You're not going to be a serious

03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:15.280
Contender with email

03:50:15.280 --> 03:50:16.640
If you're not on a mobile phone

03:50:16.640 --> 03:50:18.480
And you need to be there with a native client

03:50:18.480 --> 03:50:20.320
So we had built a great native client

03:50:20.320 --> 03:50:21.920
For both iOS and free Android

03:50:22.480 --> 03:50:24.000
And as we were getting ready to launch

03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:26.080
We submitted both of them to the app stores

03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:28.160
Got both of them approved on

03:50:28.160 --> 03:50:29.840
I think Friday afternoon

03:50:29.840 --> 03:50:31.840
For the iOS app

03:50:31.840 --> 03:50:34.640
And we then went live on Monday

03:50:34.640 --> 03:50:36.320
And we were so excited

03:50:36.320 --> 03:50:37.280
Hey world

03:50:37.280 --> 03:50:39.200
We've been working on this new thing

03:50:39.200 --> 03:50:41.440
I'd love for you to check it out

03:50:41.440 --> 03:50:42.240
And of course

03:50:42.240 --> 03:50:42.880
That's with anything

03:50:42.880 --> 03:50:43.840
When you launch a new product

03:50:43.840 --> 03:50:44.800
There's some bugs

03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:46.480
So we quickly found a few

03:50:46.480 --> 03:50:47.520
In the iOS client

03:50:47.520 --> 03:50:49.680
And submitted a new build to Apple

03:50:49.680 --> 03:50:50.800
Hey here's our bug fixes

03:50:50.800 --> 03:50:51.600
Can you please update

03:50:52.320 --> 03:50:54.960
And that's when all the help broke loose

03:50:56.320 --> 03:50:58.160
Not only where they not going to prove

03:50:58.160 --> 03:50:58.880
Our update

03:50:59.760 --> 03:51:01.200
They said oh wait a minute

03:51:01.200 --> 03:51:03.280
We gave your permission to be in the app store

03:51:03.280 --> 03:51:04.720
But I'm sorry that was a mistake

03:51:05.440 --> 03:51:08.320
We see that you're not using our in that payment system

03:51:08.960 --> 03:51:11.360
Which means that we don't get

03:51:11.360 --> 03:51:12.880
30% of your business

03:51:12.880 --> 03:51:14.560
You will have to rectify that

03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:16.000
Or you can't be in the app store

03:51:16.880 --> 03:51:18.240
And first I thought like

03:51:18.240 --> 03:51:19.760
Well it got approved already

03:51:19.760 --> 03:51:21.200
We're running on the same model

03:51:21.200 --> 03:51:22.640
We've run Basecamp on

03:51:22.640 --> 03:51:24.960
In the app store for a decade

03:51:24.960 --> 03:51:26.960
If you're not signing up through the app

03:51:26.960 --> 03:51:28.720
And we're signing up our own customers

03:51:28.720 --> 03:51:29.760
On our own website

03:51:29.760 --> 03:51:30.960
And they're just going to the app store

03:51:30.960 --> 03:51:32.960
To download their companion app

03:51:32.960 --> 03:51:34.000
We're going to be fine

03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:35.360
That was the truth

03:51:35.360 --> 03:51:35.840
Right?

03:51:35.840 --> 03:51:38.080
That was why I never got so fired up about the app store

03:51:38.080 --> 03:51:40.320
Even as Apple started tightening the screws

03:51:40.320 --> 03:51:42.080
Was like my business was okay

03:51:42.080 --> 03:51:44.400
Now suddenly my business wasn't okay

03:51:44.400 --> 03:51:46.960
Apple was willing to destroy

03:51:46.960 --> 03:51:47.840
Hey

03:51:47.840 --> 03:51:50.960
If we did not agree to give them 30%

03:51:50.960 --> 03:51:54.320
Of all the signups that came through the iOS app

03:51:54.320 --> 03:51:56.640
And it wasn't just about the 30%

03:51:56.640 --> 03:51:58.640
It was also about splitting

03:51:58.640 --> 03:52:02.560
And not longer having a direct relationship with our customers

03:52:02.560 --> 03:52:04.880
When you sell an app in the app store

03:52:04.880 --> 03:52:06.880
You're not selling an app to a customer

03:52:06.880 --> 03:52:09.920
You're selling an app to inventory at Apple

03:52:09.920 --> 03:52:12.880
And then Apple sells an app to that customer

03:52:12.880 --> 03:52:16.400
That customer has a purchasing relationship with Apple

03:52:16.400 --> 03:52:19.280
So if you want to give discounts or refunds

03:52:19.280 --> 03:52:21.360
Or whatever it's complete hell

03:52:21.360 --> 03:52:24.960
If you want to easily support multi-platform

03:52:24.960 --> 03:52:25.920
That's complete hell

03:52:25.920 --> 03:52:28.080
If someone signs up for a hey on their iPhone

03:52:28.080 --> 03:52:29.920
And they want to switch to Android

03:52:29.920 --> 03:52:31.840
But that billing relationship

03:52:31.840 --> 03:52:32.960
It's tied to Apple

03:52:32.960 --> 03:52:34.160
It's complete hell

03:52:34.160 --> 03:52:35.600
For a million reasons

03:52:35.680 --> 03:52:38.160
I did not want to hand my business over to Apple

03:52:38.160 --> 03:52:41.280
I did not want to hand 30% of our revenue over to Apple

03:52:41.280 --> 03:52:46.240
So we decided to do something that seemingly Apple had never heard before

03:52:46.240 --> 03:52:48.000
We said no

03:52:48.000 --> 03:52:51.360
We're not going to add the in-app payment

03:52:51.360 --> 03:52:54.000
I don't care if you're threatening us

03:52:54.000 --> 03:52:56.000
This is not fair, this is not reasonable

03:52:58.560 --> 03:52:59.200
Police approve

03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:01.040
And of course they didn't

03:53:01.040 --> 03:53:02.480
And it escalated

03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:04.160
And after a couple of days

03:53:04.160 --> 03:53:05.600
We realized, you know what?

03:53:05.600 --> 03:53:06.800
This isn't a mistake

03:53:06.800 --> 03:53:08.640
This isn't going away

03:53:08.640 --> 03:53:10.080
We're going to be dead

03:53:10.080 --> 03:53:11.360
If they go through with this

03:53:11.360 --> 03:53:12.880
If we're not going to yield

03:53:12.880 --> 03:53:14.880
And give them the 30%

03:53:15.920 --> 03:53:17.440
They're going to kick us off

03:53:17.440 --> 03:53:17.920
Unless

03:53:19.040 --> 03:53:21.280
We make such a racket

03:53:21.280 --> 03:53:22.320
Such noise

03:53:23.120 --> 03:53:24.880
That they will regret it

03:53:24.880 --> 03:53:26.400
And that's exactly what then happened

03:53:26.400 --> 03:53:28.480
We were blessed by the fact that we launched

03:53:28.480 --> 03:53:32.240
Hey one week before the WWDC

03:53:32.320 --> 03:53:34.080
Their worldwide developer conference

03:53:34.080 --> 03:53:35.920
Where Apple loves to get up on stage

03:53:35.920 --> 03:53:38.640
And harp on how much they do for developers

03:53:38.640 --> 03:53:39.840
How much they love them

03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:42.000
And why you should build for their new devices

03:53:42.000 --> 03:53:44.080
And so on and so forth

03:53:44.080 --> 03:53:46.480
And then we also just happen to have a platform on the internet

03:53:46.480 --> 03:53:48.480
Which is very convenient

03:53:48.480 --> 03:53:50.000
When you need to go to war

03:53:50.000 --> 03:53:52.080
With a $3 trillion company

03:53:52.080 --> 03:53:54.400
So I started kicking and screaming

03:53:54.400 --> 03:53:55.120
Oh boy

03:53:55.120 --> 03:53:56.160
And essentially

03:53:56.160 --> 03:53:57.760
Turning it up to

03:53:57.760 --> 03:53:59.920
11 in terms of the fight

03:53:59.920 --> 03:54:01.840
And going public

03:54:01.840 --> 03:54:03.200
With our

03:54:03.200 --> 03:54:05.360
Denial to be in the app store

03:54:05.360 --> 03:54:08.880
And that turned into a prolonged two week battle with Apple

03:54:08.880 --> 03:54:11.680
That is essentially ended in the best possible outcome

03:54:11.680 --> 03:54:12.960
We could have gotten

03:54:12.960 --> 03:54:14.640
As David fighting Goliath

03:54:14.640 --> 03:54:16.880
Which was a bit of a truce

03:54:16.880 --> 03:54:19.360
We wouldn't hand 30% over to Apple

03:54:19.360 --> 03:54:21.520
They wouldn't kick us out of the app store

03:54:21.520 --> 03:54:23.520
But we had to build some bullshit

03:54:24.640 --> 03:54:25.520
Dummy account

03:54:25.520 --> 03:54:27.360
Since the app did something

03:54:27.360 --> 03:54:28.480
When you downloaded it

03:54:28.480 --> 03:54:32.000
That was a rule that Phil Schiller seemingly made up on the fly

03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:33.840
When pressed for the fifth time

03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:35.520
By the media about why

03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:36.720
We couldn't be in the app store

03:54:36.720 --> 03:54:39.040
When a million other companion apps could

03:54:39.040 --> 03:54:43.600
But we just happened to be able to create so much pain and noise for Apple

03:54:43.600 --> 03:54:46.640
That it was easier for them to just let us be

03:54:46.640 --> 03:54:48.240
Than to keep on fighting

03:54:48.240 --> 03:54:52.080
What do you think about Tim Sweeney's victory

03:54:52.080 --> 03:54:53.920
With that bake over Apple

03:54:53.920 --> 03:54:56.480
I think it is incredible

03:54:56.480 --> 03:55:00.000
And the entire developer ecosystem

03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:01.760
Not just on iOS

03:55:01.760 --> 03:55:03.760
But on Android as well

03:55:03.760 --> 03:55:05.040
Oh epic

03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:06.800
Tim Sweeney and Mark Rain

03:55:06.800 --> 03:55:09.440
An enormous debt of gratitude

03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:12.400
For taking on the only battle

03:55:12.400 --> 03:55:15.440
That has ever inflicted a series wound

03:55:15.440 --> 03:55:16.640
On Apple

03:55:16.640 --> 03:55:18.160
In this entire sorted

03:55:18.160 --> 03:55:20.480
Campaign of monopoly enforcement

03:55:20.480 --> 03:55:22.640
And that is Epic's fight versus them

03:55:23.600 --> 03:55:29.440
Tim recently revealed that it has cost well over a hundred million dollars

03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:32.800
In legal fees to carry on this battle against Apple

03:55:32.800 --> 03:55:35.760
We for a hot moment considered suing Apple

03:55:35.760 --> 03:55:37.360
When they were threatened to kick us out

03:55:37.360 --> 03:55:40.800
We shopped the case around with a few law firms

03:55:40.800 --> 03:55:42.800
And perhaps of course

03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:44.480
They would tell us you have a good case

03:55:44.480 --> 03:55:46.480
We need their turn to sell a product here

03:55:46.480 --> 03:55:47.680
But they would also tell us

03:55:47.680 --> 03:55:50.240
It's going to cost a minimum of ten million dollars

03:55:50.240 --> 03:55:53.360
And it's going to take five to seven years

03:55:53.360 --> 03:55:54.400
Through all the appeals

03:55:54.400 --> 03:55:58.080
Now we now learn the actual price tag was ten times higher

03:55:58.080 --> 03:56:00.320
Right? Epic spent over a hundred million

03:56:00.320 --> 03:56:01.840
It would have destroyed us

03:56:01.840 --> 03:56:05.120
To take on Apple in the legal realm

03:56:05.120 --> 03:56:06.880
Only a company like Epic could do it

03:56:06.880 --> 03:56:10.720
And only a company run by founders

03:56:10.720 --> 03:56:11.920
Like Tim

03:56:11.920 --> 03:56:17.200
Like Mark could risk the business in the way that they did

03:56:17.200 --> 03:56:20.720
The audacity they had to provoke the fight in the first place

03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:22.560
Which I thought was just incredible

03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:25.040
And to stick with it for the long term

03:56:25.040 --> 03:56:27.520
No board would have signed off

03:56:27.520 --> 03:56:30.480
On this lawsuit to a professional CEO

03:56:30.480 --> 03:56:32.240
No freaking way

03:56:32.240 --> 03:56:35.520
So the fact that they've been able to beat Apple

03:56:35.520 --> 03:56:38.400
In also the most hilarious way possible

03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:39.920
I think it's just incredible

03:56:39.920 --> 03:56:43.680
Because remember their first victory in the case

03:56:43.680 --> 03:56:45.360
Was actually not much of a victory

03:56:45.360 --> 03:56:49.040
There were about eleven counts in the trial

03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:52.240
Apple basically won ten of them

03:56:52.240 --> 03:56:54.640
And the judge awarded

03:56:54.640 --> 03:56:57.040
Epic this one little win

03:56:57.040 --> 03:57:01.120
That Apple couldn't tell them not to link out to the internet

03:57:01.120 --> 03:57:03.840
To be able to do the payment processing

03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:05.600
So they won this one little thing

03:57:05.600 --> 03:57:09.520
And Apple instead of just taking the ten out of eleven wins

03:57:09.520 --> 03:57:10.960
And going fine

03:57:10.960 --> 03:57:12.400
You can have your little links

03:57:12.400 --> 03:57:14.320
But all these other rules stay in place

03:57:14.320 --> 03:57:19.040
Decided to essentially commit criminal contempt of court

03:57:19.040 --> 03:57:22.400
As they've now been referred to for prosecution

03:57:22.400 --> 03:57:26.400
And anger at the judge is such a degree

03:57:26.400 --> 03:57:30.080
That the rule of law in the US now is

03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:32.240
That you can launch an app in the app store

03:57:32.240 --> 03:57:34.000
And you don't have to use in-app payment

03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:36.880
But you can have a direct billing relationship with a customer

03:57:36.880 --> 03:57:38.960
If you just link out to the open internet

03:57:38.960 --> 03:57:40.400
When you take the credit card

03:57:40.400 --> 03:57:42.400
And then hop back into the app

03:57:42.480 --> 03:57:44.880
And we owe all of that to Tim and Mark

03:57:44.880 --> 03:57:46.800
We owe all of that to Epic

03:57:46.800 --> 03:57:49.200
We're going to launch new apps any minute now

03:57:49.200 --> 03:57:52.560
I hope actually next week to take advantage of this

03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:55.040
That revamp the hay apps is that

03:57:55.040 --> 03:57:58.240
People who download the hay app off the Apple app store

03:57:58.240 --> 03:58:00.240
Can sign up in the app

03:58:00.240 --> 03:58:03.440
And can then use the web to put in the credit card

03:58:03.440 --> 03:58:05.120
So we don't have to pay 30% of this

03:58:05.120 --> 03:58:06.800
We have a direct billing relationship

03:58:06.800 --> 03:58:09.040
And such that they can take that

03:58:09.040 --> 03:58:11.520
Subscription to Android to PCs

03:58:11.520 --> 03:58:13.360
Whatever without any hassle

03:58:13.360 --> 03:58:15.840
And we have Tim and Mark to thank for it

03:58:15.840 --> 03:58:18.000
Yeah, Tim, like you said founders

03:58:18.720 --> 03:58:20.560
But also specific kind of founders

03:58:20.560 --> 03:58:23.200
Because I think maybe you can educate me on this

03:58:23.200 --> 03:58:27.360
But Tim is somebody who maintains

03:58:27.360 --> 03:58:31.040
To this day sort of the unreasonableness of principles

03:58:32.160 --> 03:58:33.040
That's what I love

03:58:33.040 --> 03:58:35.360
I think sometimes maybe even with founders

03:58:35.360 --> 03:58:36.480
You can get worn down

03:58:36.480 --> 03:58:38.000
It's a large company

03:58:38.000 --> 03:58:40.480
There's a lot of smart quote-unquote people around you

03:58:41.280 --> 03:58:43.760
Lawyers and just whispering your ear over time

03:58:43.760 --> 03:58:45.680
And you're like, what just be a reason we'll be in it

03:58:45.680 --> 03:58:46.960
You know, this is a different thing

03:58:48.320 --> 03:58:50.320
To be the sort of maintain

03:58:50.320 --> 03:58:52.000
I mean, Steve Jobs did this

03:58:52.000 --> 03:58:54.000
The maintain

03:58:54.000 --> 03:58:56.320
Still are the asshole

03:58:56.320 --> 03:58:56.800
Yes

03:58:56.800 --> 03:58:57.600
Who says no

03:58:58.400 --> 03:58:59.520
Yes, whole company

03:58:59.520 --> 03:59:02.320
I'll sink this whole fucking company over this

03:59:02.320 --> 03:59:05.760
That's the exact language basically I used

03:59:05.760 --> 03:59:07.440
In our original campaign

03:59:07.440 --> 03:59:09.680
I will burn this business down

03:59:09.760 --> 03:59:12.000
Before I hand over 30% of it to Apple

03:59:12.880 --> 03:59:14.640
And that sort of indignation

03:59:14.640 --> 03:59:16.640
That actual rage

03:59:16.640 --> 03:59:19.040
Is something I try to be a little careful about tapping into

03:59:19.040 --> 03:59:22.240
Because it is a little bit of a volatile compound

03:59:22.240 --> 03:59:24.080
Because I mean, I have a bunch of employees

03:59:24.080 --> 03:59:25.840
We have a bunch of customers

03:59:25.840 --> 03:59:27.200
It would be pretty sad

03:59:27.200 --> 03:59:29.920
If the journey of 37 singles after 25 years

03:59:29.920 --> 03:59:30.800
Would come to an end

03:59:30.800 --> 03:59:33.280
Because Apple would burn us down

03:59:33.280 --> 03:59:35.680
Or I would burn the business down over this fight with Apple

03:59:36.320 --> 03:59:39.040
But I think you also need that level of conviction

03:59:39.040 --> 03:59:41.040
To be able to even drive day-to-day decisions

03:59:41.760 --> 03:59:43.520
One of the other Apple examples

03:59:43.520 --> 03:59:45.440
I know I'm racking on Apple a little bit here

03:59:45.440 --> 03:59:47.120
And I don't actually hate them

03:59:47.120 --> 03:59:48.240
I really don't

03:59:48.240 --> 03:59:50.800
I am tremendously disappointed

03:59:50.800 --> 03:59:53.120
At the squandered relationship

03:59:53.120 --> 03:59:55.920
That did not need to be sold

03:59:55.920 --> 03:59:58.000
Away for so little

03:59:58.000 --> 03:59:59.440
Now I understand

03:59:59.440 --> 04:00:02.160
That the App Store toll booth is actually pretty big business

04:00:02.160 --> 04:00:03.760
It's multiple billions

04:00:03.760 --> 04:00:06.080
But Apple is a trillion dollar company

04:00:06.080 --> 04:00:08.080
And I think in the lens of history

04:00:08.080 --> 04:00:10.640
This is going to come off as a tremendous mistake

04:00:10.640 --> 04:00:13.280
And I think it's already coming off as a tremendous mistake

04:00:13.280 --> 04:00:15.440
The flop that was Division Pro

04:00:15.440 --> 04:00:19.520
Was partly because Apple had pissed off every other developer

04:00:20.160 --> 04:00:23.840
No one was eager to come build the kind of experiences

04:00:23.840 --> 04:00:25.600
For their new hardware

04:00:25.600 --> 04:00:27.840
That would perhaps have made it a success

04:00:27.840 --> 04:00:29.920
So when you're on top

04:00:29.920 --> 04:00:31.280
And you have all the cards

04:00:31.280 --> 04:00:33.120
You can dilute yourself into thinking

04:00:33.120 --> 04:00:35.520
That you can dictate all terms at all times

04:00:35.520 --> 04:00:37.920
And there are no long-term consequences

04:00:38.000 --> 04:00:39.680
Apple is learning finally

04:00:39.680 --> 04:00:41.840
The fact that there are long-term consequences

04:00:41.840 --> 04:00:45.040
And the developers actually are important to Apple's business

04:00:45.040 --> 04:00:47.440
And the relationship is not entirely one-sided

04:00:47.440 --> 04:00:49.600
We don't owe our existence

04:00:49.600 --> 04:00:51.280
To Apple and Apple alone

04:00:51.280 --> 04:00:53.520
We build our own customer bases

04:00:53.520 --> 04:00:56.160
Apple has been beneficial to the industry

04:00:56.160 --> 04:00:57.920
I'm glad the iPhone exists

04:00:58.720 --> 04:00:59.440
Da da da da

04:00:59.440 --> 04:01:01.600
It's not that it doesn't go both ways

04:01:01.600 --> 04:01:03.520
But Apple wants it only one way

04:01:03.520 --> 04:01:04.800
And I think

04:01:05.600 --> 04:01:06.720
That is a mistake

04:01:06.720 --> 04:01:09.680
And it's a mistake that was avoidable

04:01:09.680 --> 04:01:12.800
And A, that's disappointing

04:01:12.800 --> 04:01:13.600
Certainly disappointing

04:01:13.600 --> 04:01:16.560
For me, I literally spent 20 years evangelizing this shit

04:01:16.560 --> 04:01:16.960
Right?

04:01:16.960 --> 04:01:20.880
I've spent so much money buying Apple hardware

04:01:21.920 --> 04:01:23.600
Extusing a bunch of things

04:01:23.600 --> 04:01:25.040
They've done over the years

04:01:25.040 --> 04:01:25.600
And then

04:01:26.800 --> 04:01:27.280
For what?

04:01:28.720 --> 04:01:32.240
For the fact that you wanted 30% of something that I created

04:01:32.240 --> 04:01:34.240
In the most unreasonable way possible

04:01:34.960 --> 04:01:36.640
Couldn't we have found a better way to do this

04:01:36.800 --> 04:01:39.760
I think they're getting to get forced to do it better way

04:01:39.760 --> 04:01:42.480
But did you also have to go through the indignity

04:01:42.480 --> 04:01:45.040
Of having a criminal contempt charge

04:01:45.040 --> 04:01:47.920
Against you getting referred to prosecution

04:01:47.920 --> 04:01:50.080
It just seems so beneath Apple

04:01:50.080 --> 04:01:51.840
But it also seems so in line

04:01:51.840 --> 04:01:54.320
With what happens to huge companies

04:01:54.320 --> 04:01:55.520
Who are run by

04:01:55.520 --> 04:01:57.280
Quote-unquote professional managers

04:01:58.000 --> 04:01:59.600
Rather than founders

04:01:59.600 --> 04:02:01.200
And unreasonable people

04:02:01.200 --> 04:02:03.200
Well, we should probably also say

04:02:03.200 --> 04:02:05.200
That the thing you love about Apple

04:02:05.280 --> 04:02:08.480
The great spirit of Apple, I think, still persists

04:02:09.040 --> 04:02:10.560
And there's a case we made

04:02:10.560 --> 04:02:11.760
That this 30% of things

04:02:11.760 --> 04:02:13.920
A slice, a particular slice of a company

04:02:13.920 --> 04:02:16.080
Not a defining aspect of the company

04:02:16.800 --> 04:02:18.960
And that Apple is still on top

04:02:18.960 --> 04:02:21.120
In the hardware that it makes

04:02:21.120 --> 04:02:22.480
And a lot of things that it makes

04:02:23.280 --> 04:02:23.760
And

04:02:24.800 --> 04:02:26.080
You know, this is

04:02:26.080 --> 04:02:27.280
That could be just a hiccup

04:02:28.000 --> 04:02:30.320
In a long story of a great company

04:02:30.320 --> 04:02:31.680
That

04:02:31.680 --> 04:02:33.760
Does a lot of awesome stuff for humanity

04:02:33.760 --> 04:02:36.240
So like Apple is a truly special company

04:02:36.240 --> 04:02:37.280
We mentioned Amazon

04:02:37.920 --> 04:02:39.920
There's no company like Apple

04:02:39.920 --> 04:02:40.880
I agree

04:02:40.880 --> 04:02:43.440
This is why the disappointment is old

04:02:43.440 --> 04:02:46.400
Yeah, because we had such high

04:02:46.400 --> 04:02:48.720
aspirations and expectations

04:02:48.720 --> 04:02:49.440
To Apple

04:02:49.440 --> 04:02:50.720
That they were the shining

04:02:51.520 --> 04:02:52.800
City on the hill

04:02:52.800 --> 04:02:54.880
And they were guiding the industry

04:02:54.880 --> 04:02:57.200
In a million positive ways

04:02:57.200 --> 04:02:58.000
I think

04:02:58.000 --> 04:02:59.280
As we talked about earlier

04:02:59.280 --> 04:03:00.880
Hardware is exciting again

04:03:00.880 --> 04:03:02.080
In large part

04:03:02.080 --> 04:03:03.440
Because Apple

04:03:03.440 --> 04:03:05.280
bought P.A. Semi

04:03:05.280 --> 04:03:07.520
And pursued a

04:03:07.520 --> 04:03:09.360
Against all odds

04:03:09.360 --> 04:03:11.200
Mission to get arm

04:03:11.920 --> 04:03:13.280
Up to the level it is today

04:03:13.280 --> 04:03:15.280
And we have these incredible M chips now

04:03:15.280 --> 04:03:15.920
Because of it

04:03:16.800 --> 04:03:18.320
And

04:03:18.320 --> 04:03:19.840
The design sensibilities

04:03:19.840 --> 04:03:22.000
That Apple bring to the table

04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:23.600
Are unparalleled

04:03:23.600 --> 04:03:25.840
No one has taste

04:03:25.840 --> 04:03:27.360
Certainly at the hardware level

04:03:27.360 --> 04:03:28.320
Like Apple does

04:03:28.320 --> 04:03:29.600
Even at the software level

04:03:29.600 --> 04:03:30.320
I'd say

04:03:30.320 --> 04:03:32.480
There's a lot of taste left in Apple

04:03:32.480 --> 04:03:34.400
But there's also some real sour taste now

04:03:34.400 --> 04:03:36.000
So they have to wash that off

04:03:36.000 --> 04:03:37.040
First, I think

04:03:37.040 --> 04:03:38.480
Before they find that we're back

04:03:38.480 --> 04:03:40.080
But Apple's been in

04:03:40.080 --> 04:03:41.680
In a morat as before

04:03:41.680 --> 04:03:42.800
I mean

04:03:42.800 --> 04:03:44.320
Wasnyak and Steve Jobs

04:03:44.320 --> 04:03:45.520
Started this thing in the garage

04:03:45.520 --> 04:03:48.000
Has great success with the Apple too

04:03:48.000 --> 04:03:51.440
He hands the company over to a sugar drink salesman

04:03:51.440 --> 04:03:54.080
Who tanks the company into the 90s

04:03:54.080 --> 04:03:55.440
He doesn't learn the lesson

04:03:56.160 --> 04:03:59.440
Spends the next 20 years building up this amazing company

04:03:59.440 --> 04:04:01.040
Then hands the company over again

04:04:01.920 --> 04:04:04.080
To a logistics person

04:04:04.080 --> 04:04:04.960
Who

04:04:04.960 --> 04:04:07.200
Presumably had more redeeming qualities

04:04:07.200 --> 04:04:08.480
Than

04:04:08.480 --> 04:04:10.000
The first guy who put in charge

04:04:10.000 --> 04:04:11.600
But still ends up

04:04:11.600 --> 04:04:13.600
Leading the company astray

04:04:13.600 --> 04:04:14.880
Now

04:04:14.880 --> 04:04:16.240
This is the norm

04:04:16.240 --> 04:04:17.360
The norm is

04:04:17.360 --> 04:04:19.200
The great companies don't last forever

04:04:20.240 --> 04:04:21.680
In the long arc of history

04:04:21.680 --> 04:04:23.840
Almost no company lasts forever

04:04:23.840 --> 04:04:25.360
There are very few companies

04:04:25.360 --> 04:04:28.160
Around that was here 100 years ago

04:04:28.160 --> 04:04:29.920
Even fewer 200 years ago

04:04:29.920 --> 04:04:32.240
And virtually nothing that are a thousand years old

04:04:32.240 --> 04:04:34.800
Outside of a handful of Japanese swordsmakers

04:04:34.800 --> 04:04:36.240
Something like that right

04:04:36.240 --> 04:04:39.360
So you can get the looted into thinking

04:04:39.360 --> 04:04:40.560
That something is forever

04:04:40.560 --> 04:04:41.680
When you're in the moment

04:04:41.680 --> 04:04:43.120
And they seem so large

04:04:43.120 --> 04:04:44.640
Apple could absolutely stumble

04:04:44.640 --> 04:04:47.520
And I think they have more reason

04:04:47.520 --> 04:04:49.040
To stumble now than ever

04:04:49.040 --> 04:04:51.600
They're behind on AI terribly behind

04:04:52.240 --> 04:04:54.240
Their software quality

04:04:54.240 --> 04:04:56.400
Is faltering in a bunch of ways

04:04:56.400 --> 04:04:59.200
The competition is catching up on the hardware game

04:04:59.200 --> 04:05:02.880
In part because TSMC is not an Apple subsidiary

04:05:02.880 --> 04:05:05.360
But a foundry that services AMD

04:05:05.360 --> 04:05:06.480
And Nvidia

04:05:06.480 --> 04:05:07.600
And others

04:05:07.600 --> 04:05:10.480
Were now able to use the same kind of advanced processes

04:05:10.480 --> 04:05:11.680
This is something I learned

04:05:11.680 --> 04:05:14.240
After not looking at PC hardware for the longest time

04:05:14.240 --> 04:05:16.160
That holy smokes

04:05:16.160 --> 04:05:17.680
AMD actually makes CPUs

04:05:17.680 --> 04:05:18.720
That are just as fast

04:05:18.720 --> 04:05:20.240
If not faster than Apple's

04:05:20.240 --> 04:05:21.680
They're not quite as efficient yet

04:05:21.680 --> 04:05:22.800
Because ARM

04:05:22.800 --> 04:05:25.840
Has some fundamental efficiencies over x86

04:05:25.840 --> 04:05:26.960
But they're still pretty good

04:05:26.960 --> 04:05:30.000
So Apple should have reason to worry

04:05:30.000 --> 04:05:33.600
Apple shareholders should have reason to be concerned

04:05:34.320 --> 04:05:36.400
Not just about all these stumbles

04:05:36.400 --> 04:05:40.000
But also by the fact that Apple is run by old people

04:05:40.800 --> 04:05:45.440
Apple's board has an average age of I think 75

04:05:45.440 --> 04:05:48.240
Their entire executive team is above 60

04:05:48.240 --> 04:05:49.840
Now

04:05:49.840 --> 04:05:52.400
That sounds horribly agist

04:05:52.400 --> 04:05:54.640
And in some ways it a little bit is

04:05:54.720 --> 04:05:57.040
In the same way I'm agist against myself

04:05:57.040 --> 04:05:58.800
Like I'm 45 now

04:05:58.800 --> 04:06:02.160
And I sort of kind of have to force myself

04:06:02.160 --> 04:06:03.760
To really get into AI

04:06:04.560 --> 04:06:06.320
Because it is such a paradigm shift

04:06:06.320 --> 04:06:08.720
And a lot of people when they reach a certain age

04:06:08.720 --> 04:06:10.880
Or just happy to stay with what they know

04:06:10.880 --> 04:06:12.560
They don't want to go back to being a beginner

04:06:12.560 --> 04:06:13.840
They don't want to go back to

04:06:13.840 --> 04:06:15.200
Having to relearn everything

04:06:16.160 --> 04:06:16.880
And I think like

04:06:16.880 --> 04:06:19.280
This is a little hard for me at 45

04:06:19.280 --> 04:06:20.960
How the hell do you do that at 75

04:06:20.960 --> 04:06:22.480
Mm-hmm

04:06:22.480 --> 04:06:24.480
I have to come back to you mentioned it earlier

04:06:25.600 --> 04:06:27.120
Your parent

04:06:27.120 --> 04:06:29.040
Can you speak to the impact

04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:30.800
That becoming a father

04:06:30.800 --> 04:06:32.400
Has had in your life

04:06:32.400 --> 04:06:34.640
I think what's funny about fatherhood is that

04:06:34.640 --> 04:06:37.280
For me I wasn't even sure it's something I wanted

04:06:38.560 --> 04:06:41.440
It took meeting the right woman

04:06:42.160 --> 04:06:43.920
And letting her

04:06:43.920 --> 04:06:45.360
Convince me

04:06:45.360 --> 04:06:47.840
That this was the right idea

04:06:47.840 --> 04:06:50.160
Before we even got started

04:06:50.240 --> 04:06:51.600
I didn't have

04:06:51.600 --> 04:06:55.040
Starting my own family on the list of priorities

04:06:55.040 --> 04:06:57.520
In my late 20s or even early 30s

04:06:58.960 --> 04:07:03.680
It was really the impetus of meeting my wife Jamie

04:07:03.680 --> 04:07:05.360
And her telling me

04:07:05.360 --> 04:07:07.200
This is what I want

04:07:07.200 --> 04:07:08.960
I want to have a family

04:07:08.960 --> 04:07:10.080
I want to get married

04:07:10.080 --> 04:07:11.440
I want to have kids

04:07:11.440 --> 04:07:13.200
I want to have three

04:07:13.200 --> 04:07:15.040
And me going

04:07:16.400 --> 04:07:19.040
For a second like whoa whoa whoa

04:07:19.120 --> 04:07:21.120
And then

04:07:21.120 --> 04:07:23.920
All right let's do it

04:07:23.920 --> 04:07:26.160
And I think

04:07:26.160 --> 04:07:28.160
That's the kind of happy accident

04:07:28.160 --> 04:07:31.280
Where some parts of my life have been very driven

04:07:31.280 --> 04:07:33.280
Where I knew exactly what I wanted

04:07:33.280 --> 04:07:34.640
And how to push forward to it

04:07:34.640 --> 04:07:36.240
And what the payoff was going to be

04:07:37.760 --> 04:07:40.240
But when it comes to having a family

04:07:41.040 --> 04:07:44.720
That always felt like a very fuzzy abstract idea

04:07:44.720 --> 04:07:47.520
The chirps someday

04:07:47.520 --> 04:07:48.960
Maybe

04:07:48.960 --> 04:07:50.480
And then it became very concrete

04:07:50.480 --> 04:07:53.600
Because I met a woman who knew what she wanted

04:07:55.200 --> 04:07:58.080
And looking back on it now

04:07:59.280 --> 04:08:00.800
It almost seems

04:08:02.080 --> 04:08:05.520
Crazy like there's just fork in the road of reality

04:08:05.520 --> 04:08:07.360
Where if that hadn't happened

04:08:07.360 --> 04:08:09.040
And I had been sitting here now

04:08:09.920 --> 04:08:11.280
Not being a father

04:08:11.280 --> 04:08:12.560
Not having a family

04:08:13.680 --> 04:08:16.160
The level of regret

04:08:16.160 --> 04:08:17.600
Knowing what I know now

04:08:17.600 --> 04:08:20.160
About the joys of having that family

04:08:21.280 --> 04:08:22.880
Would have been

04:08:22.880 --> 04:08:24.640
existential

04:08:24.640 --> 04:08:26.400
Would have been

04:08:27.440 --> 04:08:28.880
I don't know if they would have been devastating

04:08:28.880 --> 04:08:32.080
I think men have a little bit of a longer window

04:08:32.080 --> 04:08:33.920
To pursue these things

04:08:33.920 --> 04:08:35.120
Than women do

04:08:35.120 --> 04:08:37.440
There are just certain biological facts

04:08:38.400 --> 04:08:39.920
But

04:08:40.080 --> 04:08:42.720
Ending up with the family I have now

04:08:42.720 --> 04:08:44.400
Ending up with my three boys

04:08:44.480 --> 04:08:46.400
Have been

04:08:46.720 --> 04:08:49.200
Just a transformative experience in the sense that

04:08:49.200 --> 04:08:52.400
Here's something that turned out to be the most important thing

04:08:53.520 --> 04:08:55.280
And it was an open secret

04:08:55.280 --> 04:08:56.480
Not even an open secret

04:08:56.480 --> 04:08:58.240
It was an open truth

04:08:58.240 --> 04:08:59.440
Through all of history

04:08:59.440 --> 04:09:01.520
You listen to anyone who's ever had children

04:09:01.520 --> 04:09:04.720
They will all say my children are the most important to me

04:09:04.720 --> 04:09:07.280
Yet somehow that wisdom couldn't sink in

04:09:07.280 --> 04:09:09.520
Until you were in the situation yourself

04:09:09.520 --> 04:09:12.000
I find those truths fascinating

04:09:12.000 --> 04:09:15.200
When you can't actually relay them with words

04:09:16.160 --> 04:09:17.920
I can tell you hey

04:09:17.920 --> 04:09:19.120
Lex

04:09:19.120 --> 04:09:19.920
What are you doing?

04:09:19.920 --> 04:09:20.720
Get a wife

04:09:20.720 --> 04:09:22.560
Make some kids

04:09:22.560 --> 04:09:23.840
Get a move on it

04:09:23.840 --> 04:09:24.960
And these are just words

04:09:24.960 --> 04:09:25.760
They're not

04:09:25.760 --> 04:09:29.200
Communicating the gravity of what it actually feels to go through the experience

04:09:29.200 --> 04:09:31.360
And you can't really learn it

04:09:31.360 --> 04:09:32.800
Without going through it

04:09:32.800 --> 04:09:34.160
Now of course you can be influenced

04:09:34.160 --> 04:09:36.560
Then whatever we can all help contribute

04:09:36.560 --> 04:09:38.800
And little sparks and little seeds

04:09:38.800 --> 04:09:40.480
Can grow in your your mind about it

04:09:40.480 --> 04:09:41.680
But still has to happen

04:09:42.800 --> 04:09:44.000
And

04:09:44.960 --> 04:09:47.280
Now that I am in this situation

04:09:47.280 --> 04:09:50.960
And just the sheer joy on a daily basis

04:09:50.960 --> 04:09:56.000
Where you think your level of life satisfaction is on a scale of one to ten

04:09:56.000 --> 04:09:57.280
Yeah

04:09:57.280 --> 04:10:00.160
And then the satisfaction of seeing your children

04:10:00.160 --> 04:10:01.600
Understand something

04:10:01.600 --> 04:10:03.760
Accomplish something

04:10:03.760 --> 04:10:04.960
Learn something

04:10:04.960 --> 04:10:05.680
Do something

04:10:05.680 --> 04:10:07.040
Just be

04:10:07.040 --> 04:10:08.560
Just goes like oh my god

04:10:08.560 --> 04:10:10.400
The scale doesn't go from one to ten

04:10:10.400 --> 04:10:12.480
It goes from one to a hundred

04:10:12.480 --> 04:10:14.960
And I've been playing down here in the one to ten range

04:10:15.760 --> 04:10:19.360
All this time and there's a one to a hundred

04:10:20.800 --> 04:10:22.960
That has been humbling

04:10:22.960 --> 04:10:24.960
In a way that

04:10:25.680 --> 04:10:27.440
Is impactful in and of itself

04:10:27.440 --> 04:10:29.520
This whole idea that I thought I had a

04:10:30.320 --> 04:10:33.200
Fair understanding of like the boundaries of life

04:10:34.000 --> 04:10:35.040
In my early 30s

04:10:35.040 --> 04:10:36.000
Like what is this about?

04:10:36.000 --> 04:10:39.120
I mean I've been on this earth long enough now here to know something

04:10:39.120 --> 04:10:40.720
And you were saying I don't know

04:10:40.720 --> 04:10:41.840
I did not know

04:10:41.840 --> 04:10:45.360
I did not know that the scale was much much

04:10:45.360 --> 04:10:46.160
Brother

04:10:46.160 --> 04:10:47.920
And I've often talked about

04:10:49.520 --> 04:10:51.120
The joys of having kids

04:10:51.120 --> 04:10:53.840
And just seeing your own DNA

04:10:53.840 --> 04:10:55.360
Which

04:10:55.600 --> 04:10:58.960
Is remarkable to me because literally that's been the pursuit of

04:10:58.960 --> 04:11:00.720
Human since the dawn of time

04:11:00.720 --> 04:11:02.640
I am here today because

04:11:02.640 --> 04:11:05.440
Whenever 30,000 years ago some Neanderthal

04:11:06.320 --> 04:11:08.960
Had the same realization that I should procreate

04:11:08.960 --> 04:11:11.200
And I should continue my bloodline

04:11:11.840 --> 04:11:14.400
And that all amounts to me sitting here

04:11:14.400 --> 04:11:16.400
Here now but

04:11:16.640 --> 04:11:18.800
It didn't become a practical reality

04:11:18.800 --> 04:11:21.600
To me before meeting the right woman

04:11:21.600 --> 04:11:22.960
And I think that that's

04:11:22.960 --> 04:11:24.320
Sometimes

04:11:24.320 --> 04:11:26.400
Not part of the conversation enough

04:11:26.400 --> 04:11:28.800
That there's something broken at the moment

04:11:28.800 --> 04:11:29.600
About how

04:11:30.400 --> 04:11:32.480
People pair up in the Western world

04:11:33.120 --> 04:11:35.040
And it's at the source of why

04:11:35.040 --> 04:11:36.640
We're not having enough children

04:11:36.640 --> 04:11:38.320
Because there's not enough couples

04:11:38.320 --> 04:11:39.840
There's not enough marriage

04:11:39.840 --> 04:11:41.360
There's not a lot of these

04:11:41.360 --> 04:11:43.840
There's not enough of all these traditional values

04:11:43.840 --> 04:11:46.800
That even 50, 60, 70 years ago

04:11:47.520 --> 04:11:49.200
Was just taking for granted

04:11:49.200 --> 04:11:52.160
We're in this grand experiment

04:11:52.160 --> 04:11:55.760
Of what happens if we just remove a bunch of institutions

04:11:55.760 --> 04:11:58.640
What happens if we no longer value marriage

04:11:58.640 --> 04:12:02.320
As something to aspire to

04:12:02.320 --> 04:12:04.320
What happened if parenthood

04:12:04.320 --> 04:12:06.960
Is now seen in some camps

04:12:06.960 --> 04:12:08.960
It's almost something like

04:12:08.960 --> 04:12:11.840
Weird or against your own self-expression

04:12:11.840 --> 04:12:13.520
It's a grand experiment that

04:12:15.600 --> 04:12:17.440
I'm kind of curious how it turns out

04:12:17.440 --> 04:12:19.280
I'd prefer to watch it as a movie

04:12:19.280 --> 04:12:20.320
Like the children of men

04:12:20.320 --> 04:12:21.440
Of like that was a good show

04:12:21.440 --> 04:12:23.600
I kind of wish that was reality

04:12:23.600 --> 04:12:25.600
But we're seeing that reality play out

04:12:25.680 --> 04:12:29.520
While I'm sitting here in a very traditional

04:12:30.320 --> 04:12:32.480
Two-parent loving household

04:12:32.480 --> 04:12:34.160
With three children and going

04:12:35.280 --> 04:12:36.480
Um

04:12:36.480 --> 04:12:38.080
This is now at the top

04:12:38.080 --> 04:12:39.840
I've done a lot of things in my life

04:12:39.840 --> 04:12:41.280
I've

04:12:41.280 --> 04:12:42.080
Built software

04:12:42.080 --> 04:12:42.880
Built companies

04:12:42.880 --> 04:12:43.760
I've raised cars

04:12:43.760 --> 04:12:44.960
I've done all sorts of things

04:12:45.760 --> 04:12:47.440
And I would trade all of it

04:12:47.440 --> 04:12:48.800
In a heartbeat

04:12:48.800 --> 04:12:50.160
For my kids

04:12:50.160 --> 04:12:53.040
That's just a really fascinating human experience

04:12:53.040 --> 04:12:55.280
That the depth of that bond

04:12:56.080 --> 04:12:57.520
Is something

04:12:57.520 --> 04:12:59.520
You can't appreciate before you have it

04:13:00.240 --> 04:13:01.280
But

04:13:01.280 --> 04:13:03.440
I also think there is a role to play

04:13:04.320 --> 04:13:05.760
To talk it up

04:13:05.760 --> 04:13:07.760
Because we're being bombarded

04:13:07.760 --> 04:13:10.160
Concently with reasons

04:13:10.160 --> 04:13:11.120
Why not to

04:13:11.120 --> 04:13:13.120
Oh, it's too expensive

04:13:13.120 --> 04:13:14.240
Um

04:13:14.240 --> 04:13:17.120
Well, you could get divorced and then you might lose half

04:13:17.120 --> 04:13:19.120
There's all these

04:13:19.120 --> 04:13:19.600
Voices

04:13:19.600 --> 04:13:22.400
Concentry articulating the case against marriage

04:13:22.400 --> 04:13:24.720
The case against having children

04:13:26.400 --> 04:13:30.240
That those of us who chosen to do the traditional thing

04:13:30.960 --> 04:13:32.720
To get marriage and to have children

04:13:32.720 --> 04:13:34.240
Have an obligation

04:13:34.240 --> 04:13:36.240
To kind of talk it up a little bit

04:13:36.240 --> 04:13:38.800
Which would have seen ridiculous again

04:13:38.800 --> 04:13:40.560
50 years ago that you have to talk up

04:13:40.560 --> 04:13:42.400
Something so fundamental of that

04:13:42.400 --> 04:13:44.400
But I have become

04:13:45.920 --> 04:13:47.600
Kind of obligated in that sense

04:13:47.600 --> 04:13:48.640
To do just that

04:13:48.640 --> 04:13:49.440
To talk it up

04:13:49.440 --> 04:13:50.240
To say

04:13:50.240 --> 04:13:51.280
Do you know what

04:13:51.280 --> 04:13:53.600
You can look at everything that I've done

04:13:53.600 --> 04:13:55.520
And if you like some of those parts

04:13:55.520 --> 04:13:58.400
Realize that to me in the situation

04:14:00.720 --> 04:14:02.560
The kids, the family, the wife

04:14:02.560 --> 04:14:03.760
Is more important than all of it

04:14:03.760 --> 04:14:05.120
And it sounds like a cliche

04:14:05.120 --> 04:14:07.280
Because you've heard it a thousand times before

04:14:07.280 --> 04:14:08.880
And by becoming a cliche

04:14:09.440 --> 04:14:11.200
Maybe you start believing it's not true

04:14:11.200 --> 04:14:12.800
That it's just something people say

04:14:14.080 --> 04:14:16.080
But it is reality

04:14:16.080 --> 04:14:17.680
I know almost no parents

04:14:17.680 --> 04:14:20.000
That I have personal relationships with

04:14:20.000 --> 04:14:21.520
That don't consider their children

04:14:21.520 --> 04:14:23.520
To be the most important thing in their life

04:14:23.520 --> 04:14:25.360
So there's a lot of interesting things you say

04:14:25.360 --> 04:14:26.960
So one, it does seem to be

04:14:27.840 --> 04:14:28.640
I know a lot of

04:14:30.240 --> 04:14:31.760
Parents

04:14:31.760 --> 04:14:33.040
Perhaps more interestingly

04:14:33.040 --> 04:14:35.440
I know a lot of super successful people

04:14:35.440 --> 04:14:36.240
Who are parents

04:14:37.200 --> 04:14:37.680
Who

04:14:40.000 --> 04:14:41.760
Really love their kids

04:14:41.760 --> 04:14:43.840
And who say that the kids

04:14:43.840 --> 04:14:45.520
Even helped them to be more successful

04:14:46.320 --> 04:14:48.080
Now the interesting thing

04:14:48.080 --> 04:14:49.520
Speaking to what you're saying is

04:14:49.520 --> 04:14:51.760
It does seem for us humans

04:14:52.400 --> 04:14:54.880
It's easy to articulate the negatives

04:14:56.160 --> 04:14:58.160
Because they're sort of concrete, pragmatic

04:14:58.160 --> 04:14:59.280
You know, it costs more

04:14:59.280 --> 04:15:00.320
It takes some time

04:15:00.960 --> 04:15:02.080
You know, they can be

04:15:02.080 --> 04:15:03.600
You know, crying all over the place

04:15:03.600 --> 04:15:04.240
They're

04:15:04.240 --> 04:15:06.640
You know, tiny narcissists running around

04:15:06.640 --> 04:15:07.040
Whatever

04:15:07.040 --> 04:15:07.680
Which is all true

04:15:07.680 --> 04:15:08.240
But yeah

04:15:08.240 --> 04:15:09.040
Puping everywhere

04:15:09.040 --> 04:15:09.600
That kind of stuff

04:15:11.280 --> 04:15:12.480
But to articulate

04:15:13.280 --> 04:15:14.880
The thing you were speaking to

04:15:15.840 --> 04:15:17.040
There's this little creature

04:15:17.040 --> 04:15:18.400
That you love more than anything

04:15:18.400 --> 04:15:19.600
You've ever loved in your life

04:15:20.400 --> 04:15:22.000
It's hard to convert that into words

04:15:22.000 --> 04:15:23.200
You have to really experience it

04:15:23.200 --> 04:15:25.200
But I believe it

04:15:26.160 --> 04:15:27.760
And I want to experience it that

04:15:27.760 --> 04:15:28.720
But I believe it

04:15:28.720 --> 04:15:30.880
Because just from a scientific method

04:15:30.880 --> 04:15:32.080
Have seen a lot of

04:15:32.800 --> 04:15:34.240
People who are not honestly

04:15:34.240 --> 04:15:35.600
Not very capable of love

04:15:36.880 --> 04:15:39.040
Fall completely in love with their kids

04:15:39.040 --> 04:15:39.520
Yes

04:15:39.520 --> 04:15:40.880
Like, you know, very sort of

04:15:41.680 --> 04:15:43.200
Let's just call it what it is

04:15:43.200 --> 04:15:44.960
Engineers that are very like

04:15:45.280 --> 04:15:46.320
Loop up

04:15:46.320 --> 04:15:48.640
Yes, they just fall in love

04:15:48.640 --> 04:15:49.680
And it's like, all right

04:15:50.800 --> 04:15:52.480
People who just like you said

04:15:52.480 --> 04:15:53.520
They don't really want

04:15:54.160 --> 04:15:55.600
They don't really care

04:15:55.600 --> 04:15:57.120
Or don't really think about having kids

04:15:57.120 --> 04:15:58.080
That kind of stuff

04:15:58.080 --> 04:16:00.000
Once they do it changes everything

04:16:00.000 --> 04:16:01.280
So, you know

04:16:01.280 --> 04:16:02.880
But it's hard to convert into words

04:16:03.520 --> 04:16:05.840
One of the reasons I think it's also difficult is

04:16:07.280 --> 04:16:08.560
I mean, I like kids

04:16:08.560 --> 04:16:10.240
Not that actively dislike them

04:16:11.280 --> 04:16:13.760
But when I was around other people's kids

04:16:13.840 --> 04:16:16.000
I didn't have a emotional reaction

04:16:16.000 --> 04:16:17.280
Some women have, right?

04:16:17.280 --> 04:16:17.920
They see a baby

04:16:17.920 --> 04:16:18.880
And they go, oh

04:16:18.880 --> 04:16:21.520
I never had any emotion of that

04:16:21.520 --> 04:16:22.400
I mean, I could appreciate

04:16:22.400 --> 04:16:24.000
I'm glad for you that you have children

04:16:24.000 --> 04:16:25.600
It did not provoke anything in me

04:16:27.040 --> 04:16:28.480
The emotions that are provoked in me

04:16:28.480 --> 04:16:29.680
When I look at my own children

04:16:30.880 --> 04:16:32.320
This doesn't exist in the same universe

04:16:32.320 --> 04:16:33.200
So you don't have something

04:16:33.200 --> 04:16:34.560
You don't have a complete parallel

04:16:34.560 --> 04:16:35.680
Or at least a lot of men

04:16:35.680 --> 04:16:36.960
Or at least me

04:16:36.960 --> 04:16:39.440
I didn't have sort of a framework to put it into

04:16:39.440 --> 04:16:41.600
What would it be like to have my own child

04:16:41.600 --> 04:16:42.800
And then you experience

04:16:42.800 --> 04:16:44.000
And you just, it's like the

04:16:45.600 --> 04:16:47.440
And it happens so quickly too

04:16:47.440 --> 04:16:49.120
This is what I found fascinating

04:16:49.120 --> 04:16:50.480
It happens before

04:16:50.480 --> 04:16:52.960
That little human is even able

04:16:52.960 --> 04:16:55.680
To return any words to you

04:16:55.680 --> 04:16:59.120
That the love you develop to an infant

04:17:00.000 --> 04:17:00.880
It happens quite quickly

04:17:00.880 --> 04:17:02.080
Not necessarily

04:17:02.560 --> 04:17:03.280
Immediately

04:17:03.280 --> 04:17:03.840
I don't know

04:17:03.840 --> 04:17:05.760
Different people have different experiences

04:17:05.760 --> 04:17:08.240
But it took me a little bit

04:17:08.240 --> 04:17:09.680
But then once it hit

04:17:09.680 --> 04:17:10.880
It just hit like

04:17:10.880 --> 04:17:11.680
Cake of a horse

04:17:12.640 --> 04:17:16.800
And I love that it's also just such a universal experience

04:17:17.520 --> 04:17:20.480
That you can be the most successful person in the world

04:17:20.480 --> 04:17:21.920
You can be the poorest person in the world

04:17:21.920 --> 04:17:23.600
You can be somewhere in the middle

04:17:23.600 --> 04:17:26.400
And we share this experience

04:17:26.400 --> 04:17:27.600
That being a parent

04:17:28.480 --> 04:17:29.920
For most of them

04:17:29.920 --> 04:17:31.920
Turns out to be the most important thing in their life

04:17:32.880 --> 04:17:34.400
But it is really nice

04:17:35.200 --> 04:17:37.920
To do that kind of experience with the right partner

04:17:37.920 --> 04:17:40.080
But I think because I'm such an empath

04:17:40.160 --> 04:17:43.120
The cost of having the wrong partner is high for me

04:17:43.600 --> 04:17:45.360
But then I also like realized

04:17:45.360 --> 04:17:46.000
Man

04:17:46.720 --> 04:17:48.160
I have a friend of mine who's divorced

04:17:48.720 --> 04:17:49.760
Happily

04:17:49.760 --> 04:17:51.600
And he still loves the shit out of his kids

04:17:51.600 --> 04:17:52.400
And it's still beautiful

04:17:52.400 --> 04:17:53.040
It's a mess

04:17:53.040 --> 04:17:55.920
But there's all of that love is still there

04:17:56.480 --> 04:17:57.120
And it's

04:17:57.120 --> 04:17:58.400
You know, you just have to make it work

04:17:59.200 --> 04:18:00.480
It's just that I don't know

04:18:00.480 --> 04:18:02.560
That kind of like divorce would destroy me

04:18:02.560 --> 04:18:05.200
You should listen to the School of Life

04:18:05.200 --> 04:18:05.920
Yes, this great

04:18:06.640 --> 04:18:08.800
Bit on YouTube

04:18:08.880 --> 04:18:10.240
You will marry the wrong person

04:18:10.960 --> 04:18:12.320
If you accept upfront

04:18:12.320 --> 04:18:14.080
That you will marry the wrong person

04:18:14.080 --> 04:18:17.200
That every potential person you can marry

04:18:17.200 --> 04:18:19.440
Is going to be the wrong person on some dimension

04:18:19.440 --> 04:18:20.640
They're going to annoy you

04:18:20.640 --> 04:18:21.440
They're going to be

04:18:22.160 --> 04:18:24.800
Not what you hoped in certain dimensions

04:18:24.800 --> 04:18:26.240
The romantic ideal

04:18:26.240 --> 04:18:28.160
That everything is just perfect all the time

04:18:28.880 --> 04:18:30.640
Is not very conducive

04:18:30.640 --> 04:18:32.400
To the reality of hitching up and getting

04:18:33.280 --> 04:18:34.000
Making babies

04:18:34.960 --> 04:18:37.920
Because I think as you just accounted

04:18:38.000 --> 04:18:39.520
Even when it turns to shit

04:18:41.120 --> 04:18:42.160
I find that

04:18:42.960 --> 04:18:44.720
Most of the people I personally know

04:18:44.720 --> 04:18:46.880
Where things have fallen apart and have turned to shit

04:18:48.000 --> 04:18:50.640
Never in a million years would they go like I regret it

04:18:51.280 --> 04:18:53.280
I would rather my children did not exist

04:18:53.280 --> 04:18:56.240
Because a relationship turned sour

04:18:57.200 --> 04:18:58.880
I mean, I think you should try very hard

04:18:58.880 --> 04:19:00.400
And I think this is also one of those things

04:19:00.400 --> 04:19:02.000
Where we didn't fully understand

04:19:02.960 --> 04:19:04.400
Those fences

04:19:04.400 --> 04:19:05.600
And when we pulled them up

04:19:05.600 --> 04:19:09.680
And celebrated how easy it is to get divorced for example

04:19:09.680 --> 04:19:12.000
That that wasn't going to have some negative consequences

04:19:12.000 --> 04:19:13.600
I'm not saying you shouldn't have divorces

04:19:13.600 --> 04:19:14.880
I'm not saying return to

04:19:16.080 --> 04:19:16.880
At times past

04:19:16.880 --> 04:19:17.920
I'm saying though

04:19:17.920 --> 04:19:19.680
That civilization

04:19:19.680 --> 04:19:23.200
Over thousands of years developed certain technologies

04:19:23.200 --> 04:19:24.640
For ensuring the

04:19:25.360 --> 04:19:27.280
Continuation of

04:19:27.280 --> 04:19:29.520
Its own institutions and its own life

04:19:29.520 --> 04:19:31.440
That perhaps we didn't fully appreciate

04:19:31.440 --> 04:19:32.480
I mean, again

04:19:32.480 --> 04:19:34.720
This is something Jordan Peterson and others

04:19:34.720 --> 04:19:36.960
Are far more articulate to speak about

04:19:36.960 --> 04:19:38.480
And that I've learned a lot

04:19:38.480 --> 04:19:41.040
To just analyze my own situation

04:19:41.040 --> 04:19:43.760
Why is it that this incredible burden it is

04:19:43.760 --> 04:19:46.800
To be responsible for someone else's life

04:19:46.800 --> 04:19:48.320
That you brought into this world

04:19:49.040 --> 04:19:52.640
Is also the most rewarding part of existence

04:19:52.640 --> 04:19:53.760
That's just curious

04:19:54.560 --> 04:19:57.600
Before I heard Peterson articulate

04:19:57.600 --> 04:20:00.880
The value of taking on the greatest burden

04:20:00.880 --> 04:20:02.080
You know how to carry

04:20:02.640 --> 04:20:05.520
I always thought about burdens as a negative things

04:20:05.520 --> 04:20:08.080
Why would I want the burden of a child

04:20:08.080 --> 04:20:09.520
I might screw it up

04:20:09.520 --> 04:20:11.360
I might be a bad parent

04:20:11.360 --> 04:20:12.720
They might have bad out

04:20:12.720 --> 04:20:14.480
All this stuff right

04:20:14.480 --> 04:20:15.920
All the reasons why you shouldn't

04:20:16.480 --> 04:20:20.240
And so few voices are articulating why you should

04:20:21.040 --> 04:20:23.440
Yeah, but I should also add on top of that

04:20:23.440 --> 04:20:24.400
The thing you mentioned

04:20:24.400 --> 04:20:26.160
Currently perhaps in the West

04:20:26.160 --> 04:20:27.360
The matchmaking process

04:20:28.240 --> 04:20:28.960
It is broken

04:20:28.960 --> 04:20:30.800
It's broken and technology made it worse

04:20:30.800 --> 04:20:31.680
It's fascinating

04:20:31.680 --> 04:20:32.640
This whole thing

04:20:32.640 --> 04:20:35.120
That that hasn't been solved

04:20:35.120 --> 04:20:37.200
So hiring great teams

04:20:37.200 --> 04:20:39.280
That's probably been solved the best

04:20:40.560 --> 04:20:41.840
Out of matchmaking

04:20:41.840 --> 04:20:44.000
Finding great people to hire

04:20:45.280 --> 04:20:47.200
Second finding great friends

04:20:47.200 --> 04:20:48.160
That's like

04:20:48.160 --> 04:20:49.600
That's also hasn't been solved

04:20:49.600 --> 04:20:50.640
And it's breaking down

04:20:50.640 --> 04:20:51.760
It's breaking down

04:20:51.760 --> 04:20:54.240
And third is matchmaking for like relationships

04:20:54.240 --> 04:20:55.760
That's like the worst

04:20:55.760 --> 04:20:57.840
And in fact technology made it even worse

04:20:57.840 --> 04:20:58.320
Yes

04:20:58.320 --> 04:20:59.280
It's fascinating

04:20:59.280 --> 04:20:59.920
It is

04:20:59.920 --> 04:21:01.360
It's a great example again

04:21:01.360 --> 04:21:02.880
Of how all the greatest

04:21:03.680 --> 04:21:04.800
Intentions

04:21:04.800 --> 04:21:06.560
Still let us straight to hell

04:21:06.560 --> 04:21:07.920
I really enjoyed

04:21:07.920 --> 04:21:10.160
Luis Perry's analysis of

04:21:11.120 --> 04:21:12.320
The sexual revolution

04:21:12.320 --> 04:21:14.240
Not being an unqualified good

04:21:14.240 --> 04:21:15.840
Which was something I hadn't

04:21:15.840 --> 04:21:16.880
Thought about at all

04:21:16.880 --> 04:21:18.560
Before she articulated it

04:21:18.560 --> 04:21:20.000
That of course

04:21:20.880 --> 04:21:22.160
Women should be able to

04:21:22.960 --> 04:21:23.680
Have freedom

04:21:23.680 --> 04:21:24.880
Until termination

04:21:24.880 --> 04:21:25.680
And abortions

04:21:25.680 --> 04:21:26.720
And all of these things

04:21:26.720 --> 04:21:30.160
And Luis Perry is not arguing against it either

04:21:30.160 --> 04:21:30.800
Of course

04:21:30.800 --> 04:21:32.400
But there are

04:21:32.400 --> 04:21:34.080
Second order effects

04:21:34.080 --> 04:21:35.680
That we don't appreciate at the time

04:21:35.680 --> 04:21:38.880
And we may not have ready made solutions for

04:21:38.880 --> 04:21:40.080
That's just interesting

04:21:40.080 --> 04:21:41.760
You make life better

04:21:41.760 --> 04:21:43.520
In a million different ways

04:21:43.520 --> 04:21:45.760
And somehow we end up more miserable

04:21:45.760 --> 04:21:46.800
Why is that?

04:21:46.800 --> 04:21:48.720
Why is it that

04:21:48.720 --> 04:21:50.000
Humans

04:21:50.000 --> 04:21:51.840
Find meaning

04:21:51.840 --> 04:21:53.680
In hardship

04:21:53.680 --> 04:21:55.360
And I think

04:21:55.360 --> 04:21:56.560
Some of that

04:21:56.560 --> 04:21:58.240
Is that

04:21:58.240 --> 04:22:00.080
It's a difficult question to

04:22:00.080 --> 04:22:01.440
Answer through

04:22:01.440 --> 04:22:02.880
Science

04:22:02.880 --> 04:22:05.920
And again, Peter's in the ticket late as well

04:22:05.920 --> 04:22:08.400
This idea that you have to find some of it through art

04:22:08.400 --> 04:22:10.560
Some of it through authors

04:22:10.560 --> 04:22:12.160
Some of it through

04:22:12.160 --> 04:22:13.840
Different

04:22:13.840 --> 04:22:16.000
I was just about to say modes of knowing

04:22:16.000 --> 04:22:17.120
Before I

04:22:17.120 --> 04:22:20.000
Stop myself because that sounds like Wu Bullshit

04:22:20.000 --> 04:22:22.240
But there are different ways to

04:22:24.480 --> 04:22:26.000
Acquire

04:22:26.000 --> 04:22:27.760
Those deep lessons

04:22:27.760 --> 04:22:29.120
That

04:22:29.120 --> 04:22:30.400
Sort of a

04:22:30.400 --> 04:22:31.120
Paper

04:22:31.120 --> 04:22:32.960
It's not going to tell you

04:22:32.960 --> 04:22:35.200
I mean, this is really

04:22:35.200 --> 04:22:36.560
The point

04:22:36.560 --> 04:22:39.360
Uh, also applies to religion for example

04:22:39.360 --> 04:22:42.240
If you remove from society the softer religion

04:22:42.240 --> 04:22:45.040
Yes, you better have a good replacement

04:22:45.040 --> 04:22:47.680
And we've had a bunch of bad replacements

04:22:47.680 --> 04:22:50.720
Especially over the last few decades

04:22:50.720 --> 04:22:52.800
Religion is one of those things I've struggled with a lot

04:22:52.800 --> 04:22:55.200
Because I'm not religious

04:22:55.280 --> 04:22:57.360
But I sort of wish I was

04:22:57.360 --> 04:22:59.840
I can now

04:22:59.840 --> 04:23:03.600
Fully appreciate the enormous value

04:23:03.600 --> 04:23:06.640
Having an operating system like that

04:23:06.640 --> 04:23:08.800
Brings not just at the individual level

04:23:08.800 --> 04:23:11.520
But rather at a societal level

04:23:11.520 --> 04:23:13.600
And it's not clear at all what the answer is

04:23:13.600 --> 04:23:16.000
I think we've tried a lot of dead ends

04:23:16.000 --> 04:23:17.520
When it came to replacements

04:23:17.520 --> 04:23:19.600
And people have been filling that void

04:23:19.600 --> 04:23:21.520
In a million different ways that seem

04:23:21.520 --> 04:23:23.600
Worse than all the religions

04:23:23.600 --> 04:23:25.200
Despite their faults

04:23:25.200 --> 04:23:26.880
In a myriad of ways

04:23:26.880 --> 04:23:28.800
Have been able to deliver

04:23:28.800 --> 04:23:30.640
Yeah, religion is like

04:23:30.640 --> 04:23:32.640
The cobalt code

04:23:32.640 --> 04:23:34.560
It's just yes

04:23:34.560 --> 04:23:35.760
It's these institutions

04:23:35.760 --> 04:23:37.280
Where we don't fully understand the rules

04:23:37.280 --> 04:23:38.160
And why they're there

04:23:38.160 --> 04:23:40.080
And what's going to happen if we remove them

04:23:40.080 --> 04:23:41.520
Some of them

04:23:41.520 --> 04:23:42.560
Seems obvious to me

04:23:42.560 --> 04:23:44.000
Or just bullshit

04:23:44.000 --> 04:23:45.520
Of the time

04:23:45.520 --> 04:23:46.480
Oh, you should need

04:23:46.480 --> 04:23:47.680
Whatever, shellfish

04:23:47.680 --> 04:23:49.280
Because in that region of the world

04:23:49.280 --> 04:23:50.480
There was something something something

04:23:50.480 --> 04:23:51.520
Okay fine

04:23:51.520 --> 04:23:53.440
But there's a bunch of other things

04:23:53.440 --> 04:23:54.960
That are pivotal

04:23:54.960 --> 04:23:57.360
To keeping society functioning for the long term

04:23:57.360 --> 04:24:00.000
And we don't fully understand which is which

04:24:00.000 --> 04:24:01.120
What's the bullshit

04:24:01.120 --> 04:24:04.000
And what's the load bearing pillars of society

04:24:04.000 --> 04:24:05.280
Can you speak to

04:24:05.280 --> 04:24:08.320
The hit on productivity that kids

04:24:08.320 --> 04:24:09.120
Have

04:24:09.120 --> 04:24:11.440
Did the increase your productivity decrease it

04:24:11.440 --> 04:24:13.440
Or is that even the wrong question to ask

04:24:13.440 --> 04:24:16.000
I think it's one of the reasons why ambitious people

04:24:16.000 --> 04:24:17.520
Are often afraid

04:24:17.520 --> 04:24:18.400
Of having children

04:24:18.400 --> 04:24:20.480
Because they think I have so much more to do

04:24:20.480 --> 04:24:22.240
And I barely have enough time now

04:24:22.320 --> 04:24:24.640
How would I possibly be able to

04:24:24.640 --> 04:24:27.040
Accomplish the things I want to accomplish

04:24:27.040 --> 04:24:29.840
If I add another human into the mix

04:24:29.840 --> 04:24:30.720
Now

04:24:30.720 --> 04:24:31.840
A

04:24:32.800 --> 04:24:35.120
We've always worked 40 hours a week

04:24:35.120 --> 04:24:37.680
Not 80 or 100 or 120

04:24:37.680 --> 04:24:39.280
I think that's very beneficial

04:24:39.280 --> 04:24:40.320
B

04:24:41.040 --> 04:24:42.320
Kids

04:24:42.320 --> 04:24:44.240
Don't exist in this vacuum of just

04:24:44.240 --> 04:24:46.000
Them alone being entered into your life

04:24:46.000 --> 04:24:47.920
Hopefully there's a partner

04:24:47.920 --> 04:24:49.840
And in my life

04:24:49.840 --> 04:24:52.240
I'm married to a wonderful woman

04:24:52.240 --> 04:24:55.920
Who decided to stop working her corporate job

04:24:55.920 --> 04:24:57.920
When we got together

04:24:57.920 --> 04:25:00.640
And have been able to carry a huge part of that

04:25:01.600 --> 04:25:02.640
Responsibility

04:25:02.640 --> 04:25:04.160
I was just about to say burden

04:25:04.160 --> 04:25:06.160
And I think that's exactly how it often gets

04:25:06.960 --> 04:25:08.960
Presented especially

04:25:08.960 --> 04:25:10.720
From a feminist perspective

04:25:10.720 --> 04:25:13.200
That carrying for your own children

04:25:13.200 --> 04:25:15.200
Is some sort of unpaid labor

04:25:16.080 --> 04:25:17.680
That has to

04:25:17.680 --> 04:25:20.960
Be compensated for in some specific way

04:25:20.960 --> 04:25:23.600
Beyond the compensation of what

04:25:23.600 --> 04:25:25.440
Bringing life into this world

04:25:25.440 --> 04:25:26.800
Racing

04:25:26.800 --> 04:25:28.320
Wonderful humans

04:25:28.320 --> 04:25:29.760
There's something screwy

04:25:29.760 --> 04:25:31.680
About that analysis

04:25:31.680 --> 04:25:33.680
That I actually think the

04:25:33.680 --> 04:25:35.600
Modern trad movement

04:25:35.600 --> 04:25:37.040
Is

04:25:37.040 --> 04:25:38.240
A reply against

04:25:38.240 --> 04:25:39.520
Whether they have all the answers

04:25:39.520 --> 04:25:40.960
I'm certainly not sure of either

04:25:40.960 --> 04:25:42.880
But there's something that's just

04:25:42.880 --> 04:25:44.720
Not right in the analysis

04:25:44.720 --> 04:25:46.880
That children are burden

04:25:46.880 --> 04:25:49.760
And that if

04:25:49.760 --> 04:25:51.760
Woman chooses to

04:25:51.760 --> 04:25:53.200
Stay at home with the kids

04:25:53.200 --> 04:25:55.280
That that some sort of failure mode

04:25:55.280 --> 04:25:57.440
Of feminist ambition

04:25:57.440 --> 04:26:00.080
I think that's actually a complete dead end

04:26:00.080 --> 04:26:00.960
Now

04:26:00.960 --> 04:26:02.000
Depends on different people

04:26:02.000 --> 04:26:03.040
Different circumstances

04:26:03.040 --> 04:26:04.960
I can just speak to

04:26:04.960 --> 04:26:05.840
My life

04:26:05.840 --> 04:26:07.520
Being married to a wonderful woman

04:26:07.520 --> 04:26:10.080
Who have decided to

04:26:10.080 --> 04:26:12.480
Be at home with the kids

04:26:12.480 --> 04:26:14.640
At least that their early age

04:26:14.640 --> 04:26:15.680
And

04:26:15.680 --> 04:26:17.680
Taking on a lot of those responsibilities

04:26:17.680 --> 04:26:18.880
Now it doesn't mean there isn't

04:26:18.880 --> 04:26:21.200
Plenty of ways that I

04:26:21.200 --> 04:26:23.920
Have to be part of that and have to chip in

04:26:23.920 --> 04:26:25.600
But it's allowed me to continue to work

04:26:25.600 --> 04:26:27.200
The 40 hours a week

04:26:27.200 --> 04:26:29.280
That I've

04:26:29.280 --> 04:26:30.240
Always worked

04:26:30.240 --> 04:26:32.400
But it's made the 40 hours more strict

04:26:33.120 --> 04:26:34.560
I have a

04:26:34.560 --> 04:26:36.560
Schedule where I wake up

04:26:36.560 --> 04:26:38.400
Whatever 630

04:26:38.400 --> 04:26:40.240
And we have to get out of the door

04:26:40.240 --> 04:26:41.440
Little before 8

04:26:41.440 --> 04:26:44.720
I usually have to play at least one or two rounds of fortnight

04:26:44.720 --> 04:26:48.400
With my youngest, sometimes middle child

04:26:48.400 --> 04:26:50.400
Then take the kids to school

04:26:50.400 --> 04:26:54.000
Get in start work at, I don't know, 839

04:26:54.640 --> 04:26:58.640
Then work until 530, sometimes 6 o'clock

04:26:58.640 --> 04:27:00.320
But then it's dinner

04:27:00.320 --> 04:27:01.600
And I have to be there for that

04:27:01.600 --> 04:27:03.120
And then I have to read to the kids

04:27:03.120 --> 04:27:05.360
And by the time that's done

04:27:05.360 --> 04:27:06.800
I don't want to go back to work

04:27:06.800 --> 04:27:10.000
So my work time really is

04:27:10.000 --> 04:27:12.560
9 to 5, 9 to 6

04:27:12.560 --> 04:27:14.400
Depending of whatever is going on

04:27:14.400 --> 04:27:16.480
Sometimes there's some urgencies and you have to tend to them

04:27:16.480 --> 04:27:18.400
But it's made it more structured

04:27:18.400 --> 04:27:20.880
And I found some

04:27:20.880 --> 04:27:23.440
Some benefit in that and I found some productivity in that

04:27:23.440 --> 04:27:26.000
That I can't goof around quite as much

04:27:26.000 --> 04:27:28.880
That the day will end at around

04:27:28.880 --> 04:27:30.160
536

04:27:30.160 --> 04:27:33.040
That's just if I didn't accomplish what I wanted to do today

04:27:33.040 --> 04:27:34.800
If I get to that time, it's done

04:27:34.800 --> 04:27:37.280
I'm over, I have to

04:27:37.280 --> 04:27:38.800
Try again tomorrow

04:27:38.800 --> 04:27:41.440
Whereas before having a family and before having kids

04:27:41.440 --> 04:27:42.800
I could just like

04:27:42.880 --> 04:27:45.760
Not do it and just make it up in the evening

04:27:45.760 --> 04:27:48.080
So in that way it's made me more structured

04:27:48.080 --> 04:27:51.200
But it hasn't really changed my volume of work all that much

04:27:51.200 --> 04:27:53.280
I still work about the same amount of hours

04:27:53.280 --> 04:27:54.960
And that's by the way enough

04:27:54.960 --> 04:27:58.560
This is one of the key points we make in

04:27:58.560 --> 04:28:00.080
It doesn't have to be crazy at work

04:28:00.080 --> 04:28:01.280
The latest book we wrote

04:28:01.280 --> 04:28:03.200
Is that there's enough time

04:28:03.200 --> 04:28:05.680
40 hours a week is actually a ton

04:28:05.680 --> 04:28:07.440
If you don't piss it away

04:28:07.440 --> 04:28:08.880
Most people do piss it away

04:28:08.880 --> 04:28:10.080
They piss it away in meetings

04:28:10.080 --> 04:28:11.600
They piss it away on

04:28:11.680 --> 04:28:13.600
Just stuff that doesn't matter

04:28:13.600 --> 04:28:16.480
When even three hours

04:28:16.480 --> 04:28:20.240
Four hours of concentrated uninterrupted time

04:28:20.240 --> 04:28:24.400
Every day would move the goals they truly care about

04:28:24.400 --> 04:28:26.320
Way down the field

04:28:26.320 --> 04:28:28.960
I think kids do make you more productive in that way

04:28:28.960 --> 04:28:30.800
For people who need it especially

04:28:30.800 --> 04:28:32.240
People like me

04:28:32.240 --> 04:28:33.600
They create their urgency

04:28:33.600 --> 04:28:35.600
Like if you have to be done by five

04:28:37.440 --> 04:28:39.520
It's maybe counterintuitive notion

04:28:40.480 --> 04:28:42.240
For people like me who like to work

04:28:43.520 --> 04:28:45.840
You can really fill the day

04:28:45.840 --> 04:28:47.040
Yes

04:28:47.040 --> 04:28:48.480
With love

04:28:48.480 --> 04:28:49.360
Yes

04:28:49.360 --> 04:28:50.240
Of work

04:28:50.240 --> 04:28:52.880
And if you have to be done by five

04:28:53.680 --> 04:28:56.160
You're going to have to do the deep work

04:28:56.160 --> 04:28:57.680
And get it done

04:28:57.680 --> 04:28:59.680
Like really focus singular work

04:28:59.680 --> 04:29:00.400
Yes

04:29:00.400 --> 04:29:02.720
And then you're just going to cut off all the questions

04:29:02.720 --> 04:29:03.680
It keeps you honest

04:29:03.680 --> 04:29:04.960
Because

04:29:04.960 --> 04:29:06.720
You can squander one day

04:29:06.720 --> 04:29:07.760
You can squander two days

04:29:07.760 --> 04:29:09.360
But if I squander a whole week

04:29:10.320 --> 04:29:11.840
I feel terrible

04:29:12.720 --> 04:29:14.240
Now that's just some drive

04:29:14.240 --> 04:29:14.960
I have in me

04:29:14.960 --> 04:29:16.800
Where I feel content

04:29:16.800 --> 04:29:17.600
And full of meaning

04:29:17.600 --> 04:29:19.920
If I actually do stuff that matters

04:29:19.920 --> 04:29:21.520
If I can look back upon the week

04:29:21.520 --> 04:29:22.160
And go like that

04:29:22.160 --> 04:29:23.440
That was a nice week

04:29:23.440 --> 04:29:23.840
Really

04:29:23.840 --> 04:29:24.480
We move forward

04:29:24.480 --> 04:29:25.280
Maybe we didn't get done

04:29:25.280 --> 04:29:26.080
But we move forward

04:29:26.080 --> 04:29:27.040
And everything got better

04:29:28.320 --> 04:29:29.760
And I think kids really help

04:29:29.760 --> 04:29:31.680
Just time box things in that way

04:29:32.640 --> 04:29:34.000
And a lot of people need that

04:29:34.000 --> 04:29:36.320
Because I find just so much of the

04:29:38.720 --> 04:29:42.320
Celebration of overwork to be so tiresome

04:29:42.960 --> 04:29:46.480
Oh I work 60 hours or 80 hours, 100 hours a week

04:29:46.480 --> 04:29:47.600
And just like

04:29:47.600 --> 04:29:48.560
First of all, no you don't

04:29:49.280 --> 04:29:50.240
No you don't

04:29:50.240 --> 04:29:53.840
Like those 80 hours are full of all sorts of fluff

04:29:53.840 --> 04:29:55.360
That you label work

04:29:55.360 --> 04:29:56.960
But that I would laugh at

04:29:56.960 --> 04:29:58.240
And that most people laugh at

04:29:58.240 --> 04:29:59.360
That you would laugh at

04:29:59.360 --> 04:30:00.800
If you actually did the analysis

04:30:00.800 --> 04:30:02.240
Of where is that time going

04:30:03.200 --> 04:30:04.640
Most of the important stuff

04:30:04.640 --> 04:30:05.920
That have to be done

04:30:06.000 --> 04:30:09.040
Is done in these uninterrupted chunks of two hours here

04:30:09.040 --> 04:30:09.840
Four hours there

04:30:09.840 --> 04:30:10.720
Five hours there

04:30:10.720 --> 04:30:13.440
The hard part is making sure you get them in the whole piece

04:30:15.120 --> 04:30:16.640
So don't give me

04:30:16.640 --> 04:30:17.280
Don't give me that

04:30:17.280 --> 04:30:18.160
There's time enough

04:30:18.160 --> 04:30:18.720
And also

04:30:19.680 --> 04:30:20.560
What's so important

04:30:21.440 --> 04:30:23.680
That it ranks above

04:30:23.680 --> 04:30:25.120
Continuing you lineage

04:30:26.080 --> 04:30:28.080
I think there's just some

04:30:28.080 --> 04:30:29.520
Ancient

04:30:29.520 --> 04:30:30.480
Honor

04:30:30.480 --> 04:30:32.160
In the fact that again

04:30:32.160 --> 04:30:34.640
This DNA that's sitting on this chair

04:30:34.640 --> 04:30:38.000
Traveled 30,000 years to get here

04:30:38.000 --> 04:30:39.520
And you're going to squander all that away

04:30:39.520 --> 04:30:41.600
Just so you can send a few more emails

04:30:41.600 --> 04:30:43.280
There is something that's also hard to convert

04:30:43.280 --> 04:30:44.400
Into words of

04:30:45.200 --> 04:30:46.000
Just

04:30:46.000 --> 04:30:48.400
The kind of fun you can have just playing

04:30:48.400 --> 04:30:49.440
With your kids

04:30:49.440 --> 04:30:50.960
I don't know what that

04:30:50.960 --> 04:30:51.760
On the surface

04:30:51.760 --> 04:30:52.320
It's like

04:30:52.320 --> 04:30:53.440
I can have that kind of fun

04:30:53.440 --> 04:30:54.800
Just playing video games by myself

04:30:54.800 --> 04:30:55.520
But no

04:30:55.520 --> 04:30:56.320
It's like

04:30:56.320 --> 04:30:57.920
There's some magical about it right

04:30:57.920 --> 04:30:59.840
I have a thousand hours

04:30:59.840 --> 04:31:01.840
Logged in fortnight

04:31:01.840 --> 04:31:03.040
Since

04:31:03.040 --> 04:31:04.240
19 I think

04:31:05.440 --> 04:31:07.440
All of it with my kids

04:31:07.440 --> 04:31:09.040
I'd never be playing fortnight

04:31:09.040 --> 04:31:10.400
Well I don't know if I'd never would be

04:31:10.400 --> 04:31:12.480
I wouldn't be playing a thousand hours of fortnight

04:31:12.480 --> 04:31:13.680
If it wasn't for my kids

04:31:13.680 --> 04:31:15.680
The enjoyment for me is to

04:31:15.680 --> 04:31:17.920
Do something with them

04:31:17.920 --> 04:31:19.120
That I also happen to enjoy

04:31:19.120 --> 04:31:20.320
I really love fortnight

04:31:20.320 --> 04:31:21.120
It's a

04:31:21.120 --> 04:31:22.480
Phenomenal game

04:31:22.480 --> 04:31:24.480
I don't have to force myself to play that with them

04:31:24.480 --> 04:31:25.280
I often ask

04:31:25.280 --> 04:31:26.480
Like hey

04:31:26.480 --> 04:31:28.480
Do you want to play fortnight

04:31:28.480 --> 04:31:29.360
But still

04:31:29.360 --> 04:31:30.160
It's an activity

04:31:30.160 --> 04:31:31.360
That I get to share with them

04:31:31.360 --> 04:31:32.960
It's a passion that I get to share with them

04:31:32.960 --> 04:31:36.480
I've started doing go-carting with my oldest

04:31:36.480 --> 04:31:37.280
I've been driving

04:31:37.280 --> 04:31:38.320
Race cars for a long time

04:31:38.320 --> 04:31:39.600
And now they're getting into go-carting

04:31:39.600 --> 04:31:40.800
And just

04:31:40.800 --> 04:31:42.000
Being at the go-cart track

04:31:42.000 --> 04:31:43.120
Seeing them going around

04:31:43.120 --> 04:31:44.240
Seeing them get faster

04:31:44.240 --> 04:31:45.920
Seeing them learn that skill

04:31:47.200 --> 04:31:48.000
You just go

04:31:48.000 --> 04:31:49.440
Look at like

04:31:49.440 --> 04:31:51.600
What else would I be doing with my life

04:31:51.600 --> 04:31:52.640
At

04:31:52.640 --> 04:31:54.160
My age 45

04:31:54.160 --> 04:31:55.280
I'm standing here

04:31:55.280 --> 04:31:57.200
Truly enjoying

04:31:57.200 --> 04:31:58.480
Life I brought into this world

04:31:58.480 --> 04:31:59.360
What else is it

04:31:59.360 --> 04:32:00.400
It was so important

04:32:00.400 --> 04:32:01.280
At this stage

04:32:01.360 --> 04:32:03.520
That I would otherwise be spending my time on

04:32:04.320 --> 04:32:05.840
All right, like you mentioned

04:32:05.840 --> 04:32:07.440
You like to race cars

04:32:07.440 --> 04:32:10.080
And you do it at a world-class competitive level

04:32:10.080 --> 04:32:11.680
This is incredible

04:32:11.680 --> 04:32:13.440
So how'd you get into it

04:32:13.440 --> 04:32:15.280
What attracts you to racing

04:32:15.280 --> 04:32:16.400
What do you love about it

04:32:17.280 --> 04:32:18.560
The funny thing about

04:32:18.560 --> 04:32:19.440
Getting into racing

04:32:19.440 --> 04:32:21.200
Is I did not get my driver's license

04:32:21.200 --> 04:32:22.320
Until I was 25

04:32:23.120 --> 04:32:24.880
I grew up in Copenhagen, Denmark

04:32:26.000 --> 04:32:27.040
Where

04:32:27.040 --> 04:32:27.760
The

04:32:27.760 --> 04:32:28.960
Tax

04:32:28.960 --> 04:32:30.320
On cars

04:32:30.320 --> 04:32:32.560
Is basically over 200 percent

04:32:32.560 --> 04:32:34.480
So you pay for

04:32:34.480 --> 04:32:36.160
Three cars and you get one

04:32:36.160 --> 04:32:38.080
And I didn't even have to money for one car

04:32:38.080 --> 04:32:39.440
Let alone three

04:32:39.440 --> 04:32:41.200
So I could not afford a car growing up

04:32:41.200 --> 04:32:43.280
We did not have a car growing up

04:32:43.280 --> 04:32:45.120
But Copenhagen is a

04:32:45.120 --> 04:32:46.800
Nice city to be able to get around

04:32:46.800 --> 04:32:48.560
On a bike or with a bus

04:32:48.560 --> 04:32:51.200
Or as I did for a long period of time on rollerblades

04:32:53.040 --> 04:32:55.040
But

04:32:55.040 --> 04:32:56.880
When I was 25

04:32:56.880 --> 04:32:59.040
I realized I wanted to spend more time with you

04:32:59.040 --> 04:33:01.040
As I wasn't sure yet that I was going to move there

04:33:01.040 --> 04:33:02.640
That turned out later to be true

04:33:02.640 --> 04:33:04.880
But I knew that if I wanted to spend time in the U.S

04:33:04.880 --> 04:33:06.240
I needed to have a driver's license

04:33:06.240 --> 04:33:08.480
I was not going to get around very

04:33:08.480 --> 04:33:10.480
Well, if I didn't know how to drive a car

04:33:10.480 --> 04:33:12.640
So I got a driver's license at 25

04:33:12.640 --> 04:33:14.960
Then ended up moving to the U.S. later that year

04:33:15.760 --> 04:33:17.600
And I'd always been into

04:33:18.320 --> 04:33:20.320
Video games, racing video games

04:33:21.440 --> 04:33:23.440
Metropolitan Street Racer

04:33:23.440 --> 04:33:24.800
Under Dreamcast

04:33:24.800 --> 04:33:28.320
Was one of those games that really sucked me into

04:33:28.320 --> 04:33:29.920
It was the precursor to

04:33:30.800 --> 04:33:32.080
Project Gautam

04:33:32.080 --> 04:33:34.320
Which was the precursor to

04:33:34.320 --> 04:33:36.800
Essentially Forza Horizon I think

04:33:36.800 --> 04:33:39.120
Oh, okay. I think that's what the lineage goes

04:33:39.120 --> 04:33:40.640
It's just a great game

04:33:40.640 --> 04:33:42.640
I actually just fired it up on an emulator

04:33:43.440 --> 04:33:44.160
A few weeks ago

04:33:44.160 --> 04:33:45.680
And it's sort of kind of holds up

04:33:45.680 --> 04:33:48.880
Because it has enough real car dynamics

04:33:48.880 --> 04:33:51.280
That it smells a little bit like driving a real car

04:33:51.280 --> 04:33:54.160
It's not just like an arcade racer like Segarelli

04:33:54.160 --> 04:33:54.880
Or something like that

04:33:54.880 --> 04:33:56.720
But I'd always been into that

04:33:56.800 --> 04:33:58.640
Then I got my driver's license at 25

04:33:59.440 --> 04:34:00.720
And moved to the U.S.

04:34:00.720 --> 04:34:02.400
And then two years later

04:34:02.400 --> 04:34:04.240
A friend that I'd met in Chicago

04:34:04.240 --> 04:34:05.440
Took me to

04:34:05.440 --> 04:34:07.440
The Chicago Audubon Country Club

04:34:07.440 --> 04:34:09.120
Which is this great track

04:34:09.120 --> 04:34:10.640
About 45 minutes from Chicago

04:34:11.280 --> 04:34:12.880
And I sat in a race car

04:34:12.880 --> 04:34:14.560
And I drove a race car for the first time

04:34:15.440 --> 04:34:16.240
And I had

04:34:17.280 --> 04:34:19.120
The same kind of

04:34:19.120 --> 04:34:20.960
Sudo-religious experience

04:34:20.960 --> 04:34:23.520
I did as when I started working on Ruby

04:34:24.400 --> 04:34:26.720
Where I did

04:34:26.720 --> 04:34:28.720
Maybe 20 laps

04:34:28.720 --> 04:34:29.600
In this

04:34:29.600 --> 04:34:31.040
Basically a master race car

04:34:31.040 --> 04:34:33.200
From I think like the 90s or something

04:34:33.200 --> 04:34:34.880
I get pretty cheap race car

04:34:34.880 --> 04:34:35.920
But a real race car

04:34:35.920 --> 04:34:37.600
Single-seater

04:34:37.600 --> 04:34:38.960
Manual gearbox

04:34:38.960 --> 04:34:40.720
But it's both slick wheels

04:34:40.720 --> 04:34:41.920
All the stuff

04:34:41.920 --> 04:34:43.840
And after having had that experience

04:34:44.720 --> 04:34:45.440
First of all

04:34:45.440 --> 04:34:47.360
It was just the most amazing thing ever

04:34:47.360 --> 04:34:50.880
Like the physical sensation of driving a race car

04:34:50.880 --> 04:34:52.480
Is really unique

04:34:52.480 --> 04:34:55.280
And I think if you're driving a car fast

04:34:55.280 --> 04:34:58.080
You have maybe a 2% taste of it

04:34:59.440 --> 04:35:01.200
The exposure to the elements

04:35:01.200 --> 04:35:02.640
That you get in the single-seater race car

04:35:02.640 --> 04:35:03.440
Especially one like that

04:35:03.440 --> 04:35:05.760
Where your head is actually out in the elements

04:35:05.760 --> 04:35:08.240
You can see the individual wheels

04:35:08.240 --> 04:35:10.320
And your sensation of speed

04:35:10.320 --> 04:35:11.920
Is just so much higher

04:35:11.920 --> 04:35:13.360
Is at a completely different level

04:35:13.360 --> 04:35:14.480
So can you actually speak to that

04:35:14.480 --> 04:35:15.840
So even at that

04:35:15.840 --> 04:35:17.120
Even at that Mazda

04:35:18.000 --> 04:35:19.680
So you can feel

04:35:19.680 --> 04:35:21.440
Can you feel like the track

04:35:21.440 --> 04:35:22.320
reverberating

04:35:22.320 --> 04:35:23.840
You feel the grip

04:35:23.840 --> 04:35:25.760
Not only can you see the bumps

04:35:25.760 --> 04:35:27.920
Because you're literally looking straight at the wheels

04:35:27.920 --> 04:35:29.680
You can feel all the bumps

04:35:29.680 --> 04:35:31.600
Because you're running a slick tire

04:35:31.600 --> 04:35:33.040
It's a really stiff setup

04:35:33.040 --> 04:35:35.440
It's nothing like taking a fast street car

04:35:35.440 --> 04:35:36.240
Out on a racetrack

04:35:36.240 --> 04:35:37.600
And try to drive a little bit around

04:35:37.600 --> 04:35:39.680
So can you feel like the slipping

04:35:39.680 --> 04:35:40.880
If the traction

04:35:40.880 --> 04:35:43.760
That's a huge part of the satisfaction

04:35:43.760 --> 04:35:44.800
Of driving a race car

04:35:44.800 --> 04:35:46.960
It's driving in at the edge of adhesion

04:35:46.960 --> 04:35:48.000
As we call it

04:35:48.000 --> 04:35:49.520
Where

04:35:49.520 --> 04:35:50.880
The car is actually sliding a little

04:35:51.040 --> 04:35:52.880
But a couple of percent slip angle

04:35:52.880 --> 04:35:54.480
Is the fastest way to drive a race car

04:35:54.480 --> 04:35:55.520
You don't want to slide too much

04:35:55.520 --> 04:35:57.120
That looks great, lots of smoke

04:35:57.120 --> 04:35:58.480
But it's not fast

04:35:58.480 --> 04:36:00.480
How you want to drive it

04:36:00.480 --> 04:36:02.480
Is just at the limit of adhesion

04:36:02.480 --> 04:36:04.080
Where you're rotating the car

04:36:04.080 --> 04:36:06.720
As much as your tires can manage

04:36:06.720 --> 04:36:08.720
And then slightly more than that

04:36:09.280 --> 04:36:12.800
And playing at keeping it just at that level

04:36:12.800 --> 04:36:14.960
Because when you're at the level of

04:36:14.960 --> 04:36:16.640
Or at the limit of adhesion

04:36:16.640 --> 04:36:18.480
You're essentially just a tiny movement

04:36:18.480 --> 04:36:20.480
Away from spinning out

04:36:20.880 --> 04:36:21.760
It doesn't take much

04:36:21.760 --> 04:36:23.120
Then the car starts rotating

04:36:23.120 --> 04:36:24.640
Once it starts rotating

04:36:24.640 --> 04:36:25.760
You lose grip

04:36:25.760 --> 04:36:26.880
And you're going for the wall

04:36:28.000 --> 04:36:30.000
That balance

04:36:30.000 --> 04:36:32.160
Of danger and skill

04:36:32.160 --> 04:36:34.080
Is what's so intoxicating

04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:37.280
And it's so much better than racing video games too

04:36:37.280 --> 04:36:39.200
Because the criticality

04:36:39.200 --> 04:36:40.880
Is taking up two nodges

04:36:40.880 --> 04:36:43.360
I often think about people really like gambling

04:36:43.360 --> 04:36:44.080
Where I think like

04:36:44.080 --> 04:36:45.360
Aren't you just playing poker

04:36:46.400 --> 04:36:47.200
And like no

04:36:47.200 --> 04:36:48.560
The point is not poker

04:36:48.560 --> 04:36:49.680
Poker is maybe part of it

04:36:49.680 --> 04:36:51.760
But the point is that I could lose my house

04:36:51.760 --> 04:36:53.760
Right? Like that's the addiction

04:36:53.760 --> 04:36:54.880
That some people get

04:36:54.880 --> 04:36:55.840
To gambling

04:36:55.840 --> 04:36:57.840
That there's something real on the line

04:36:58.480 --> 04:36:59.440
When you're in a race car

04:36:59.440 --> 04:37:01.040
There's something very real on the line

04:37:01.360 --> 04:37:02.880
If you get it wrong

04:37:03.760 --> 04:37:04.720
At the very least

04:37:05.520 --> 04:37:06.480
You're going to spin out

04:37:06.480 --> 04:37:07.680
And properly hit a wall

04:37:07.680 --> 04:37:09.040
And it's going to be expensive

04:37:09.040 --> 04:37:10.240
At the very worst

04:37:10.960 --> 04:37:12.560
You're not getting out alive

04:37:12.560 --> 04:37:15.360
And even if modern race cars have gotten

04:37:15.360 --> 04:37:16.400
Way safer

04:37:16.400 --> 04:37:17.360
Than they used to be

04:37:17.360 --> 04:37:18.880
There is that element of danger

04:37:18.960 --> 04:37:19.840
That's real

04:37:19.840 --> 04:37:20.960
That there are people

04:37:20.960 --> 04:37:22.720
Who still get seriously hurt

04:37:22.720 --> 04:37:23.920
Or even killed

04:37:23.920 --> 04:37:24.880
In a race car

04:37:24.880 --> 04:37:26.000
It's

04:37:26.000 --> 04:37:28.400
Mercifully rare compared to what it used to be

04:37:28.400 --> 04:37:29.200
When those

04:37:29.200 --> 04:37:31.200
Maniacs in the 60s

04:37:31.200 --> 04:37:32.320
Would do Formula One

04:37:32.320 --> 04:37:33.280
And whatever

04:37:33.280 --> 04:37:34.560
13% of the grid

04:37:34.560 --> 04:37:36.000
Wouldn't make it to the end of the year

04:37:36.000 --> 04:37:36.720
Because they just

04:37:36.720 --> 04:37:37.760
Die in a

04:37:37.760 --> 04:37:38.720
fiery

04:37:38.720 --> 04:37:39.680
Flaming

04:37:39.680 --> 04:37:40.720
Fireball

04:37:40.720 --> 04:37:42.480
But there's still some of it there

04:37:42.480 --> 04:37:43.440
And I think that

04:37:45.680 --> 04:37:47.200
Since that there's something on the line

04:37:47.200 --> 04:37:48.320
Really contributes to it

04:37:48.320 --> 04:37:49.120
But it's more than that

04:37:49.120 --> 04:37:50.640
There's just just a physical sensation

04:37:50.640 --> 04:37:52.400
There's activation of all your forces

04:37:52.400 --> 04:37:53.200
There's the flow

04:37:54.640 --> 04:37:55.120
And I think

04:37:55.840 --> 04:37:56.960
That really

04:37:56.960 --> 04:37:58.880
Cement's like why I got addicted

04:37:58.880 --> 04:37:59.600
Because I always

04:38:00.480 --> 04:38:02.560
I love that flow I got out of programming

04:38:02.560 --> 04:38:04.160
But getting flow out of programming

04:38:04.160 --> 04:38:06.000
Is a very inconsistent process

04:38:06.000 --> 04:38:07.360
I can't just sit down

04:38:07.360 --> 04:38:08.640
In front of a keyboard and go like

04:38:08.640 --> 04:38:08.960
All right

04:38:10.240 --> 04:38:11.760
Let's get the flow going

04:38:11.760 --> 04:38:13.200
It doesn't happen like that

04:38:13.200 --> 04:38:14.640
The problem has to be just right

04:38:14.640 --> 04:38:15.680
It has to meet my skills

04:38:15.680 --> 04:38:17.040
And just the right moment

04:38:17.040 --> 04:38:18.160
It's a bit of a lottery

04:38:18.800 --> 04:38:20.800
In a race car it's not a lottery at all

04:38:20.800 --> 04:38:22.240
You sit down in that car

04:38:22.240 --> 04:38:23.120
You turn the ignition

04:38:23.120 --> 04:38:24.160
You go out and track

04:38:25.120 --> 04:38:27.440
And I get flow virtually guaranteed

04:38:28.720 --> 04:38:29.920
Because you need

04:38:29.920 --> 04:38:30.720
Or I need

04:38:30.720 --> 04:38:33.200
At least 100% of my brain processing power

04:38:33.200 --> 04:38:34.000
To be able to go

04:38:34.000 --> 04:38:34.880
At the speed I go

04:38:34.880 --> 04:38:35.680
Without

04:38:35.680 --> 04:38:36.720
Crashing

04:38:36.720 --> 04:38:37.760
So

04:38:37.760 --> 04:38:40.080
There's no time to think about

04:38:40.080 --> 04:38:41.200
The internet

04:38:41.200 --> 04:38:42.880
Or the meeting next week

04:38:42.880 --> 04:38:43.840
Or product launch

04:38:43.840 --> 04:38:44.400
It just

04:38:44.400 --> 04:38:45.200
It's

04:38:45.200 --> 04:38:46.400
Completely zen

04:38:46.480 --> 04:38:47.680
In actually

04:38:47.680 --> 04:38:48.960
The literal sense of the word

04:38:48.960 --> 04:38:49.680
I think of

04:38:49.680 --> 04:38:51.200
Someone who's really good at meditation

04:38:51.200 --> 04:38:53.440
That's probably kind of state they get into

04:38:53.440 --> 04:38:53.920
Where

04:38:53.920 --> 04:38:55.760
It's just clear you're in the now

04:38:55.760 --> 04:38:57.440
There's nothing but you

04:38:57.440 --> 04:38:58.800
And the next corner

04:38:58.800 --> 04:39:00.240
That's a really addictive

04:39:00.960 --> 04:39:01.920
Experience

04:39:01.920 --> 04:39:03.120
So after about that

04:39:03.120 --> 04:39:04.240
I couldn't get enough

04:39:04.240 --> 04:39:04.720
I just

04:39:04.720 --> 04:39:05.840
I kept going to the track

04:39:05.840 --> 04:39:06.720
Ever opportunity I got

04:39:06.720 --> 04:39:07.760
Every single weekend

04:39:07.760 --> 04:39:08.880
For about four years

04:39:08.880 --> 04:39:09.760
I would go to the track

04:39:10.480 --> 04:39:11.520
And by the end of that time

04:39:11.520 --> 04:39:13.520
I'd finally worked up enough skill

04:39:14.320 --> 04:39:16.320
And enough success with the company

04:39:16.400 --> 04:39:17.600
That I could afford to go

04:39:17.600 --> 04:39:18.640
Quote a quote real racing

04:39:19.920 --> 04:39:20.880
So I started doing that

04:39:20.880 --> 04:39:22.240
I started driving these porches

04:39:22.240 --> 04:39:23.520
And then as soon as I got into that

04:39:23.520 --> 04:39:24.480
As soon as I got into

04:39:24.480 --> 04:39:26.000
Quote a quote real competition

04:39:26.000 --> 04:39:26.480
I was like

04:39:26.480 --> 04:39:27.600
I wonder how far you can take this

04:39:28.880 --> 04:39:29.680
And

04:39:29.680 --> 04:39:31.040
It didn't take that long

04:39:31.040 --> 04:39:31.760
Before I decided

04:39:31.760 --> 04:39:32.960
Do you know what

04:39:32.960 --> 04:39:34.320
I could take this all the way

04:39:34.320 --> 04:39:36.160
My great hero in racing

04:39:36.160 --> 04:39:37.760
Is Tom Christensen

04:39:37.760 --> 04:39:38.400
Fellow Dane

04:39:39.040 --> 04:39:40.080
The

04:39:40.080 --> 04:39:41.040
Mr. Lamar

04:39:41.040 --> 04:39:41.840
As they call it

04:39:41.840 --> 04:39:43.280
The greatest endurance race in the world

04:39:43.280 --> 04:39:44.480
The 24 hours of Lamar

04:39:44.480 --> 04:39:45.120
Has been one

04:39:45.200 --> 04:39:46.400
More times

04:39:46.400 --> 04:39:47.360
Than any other

04:39:47.360 --> 04:39:48.560
By Tom Christensen

04:39:48.560 --> 04:39:49.600
He won the race

04:39:49.600 --> 04:39:50.800
Nine times

04:39:51.760 --> 04:39:53.600
So Tom

04:39:53.600 --> 04:39:54.480
Just

04:39:54.480 --> 04:39:56.160
Really turned me on to Lamar

04:39:56.160 --> 04:39:57.680
I've been watching Lamar

04:39:57.680 --> 04:39:58.480
Since

04:39:58.480 --> 04:39:59.280
I think the 80s

04:39:59.280 --> 04:40:00.480
I have my earliest memories

04:40:00.480 --> 04:40:01.680
Of watching that on tv

04:40:01.680 --> 04:40:03.280
The race has been going since

04:40:03.280 --> 04:40:04.320
I think uh

04:40:04.320 --> 04:40:05.120
20s

04:40:05.120 --> 04:40:05.840
But in the 80s

04:40:05.840 --> 04:40:06.800
I got kind of into it

04:40:06.800 --> 04:40:08.160
And then in the

04:40:08.160 --> 04:40:09.200
Like 90s

04:40:09.200 --> 04:40:10.000
Early 2000s

04:40:10.000 --> 04:40:11.360
When Tom started winning

04:40:11.360 --> 04:40:12.240
I like

04:40:12.240 --> 04:40:13.680
Pretty much every other day

04:40:13.680 --> 04:40:15.040
Started watching the

04:40:15.040 --> 04:40:16.240
Race almost religiously

04:40:16.240 --> 04:40:16.720
So I thought

04:40:16.720 --> 04:40:17.120
Do you know what

04:40:17.120 --> 04:40:18.240
I want to get to Lamar

04:40:18.240 --> 04:40:20.240
And this is the magic thing about racing

04:40:20.240 --> 04:40:21.200
That

04:40:21.200 --> 04:40:22.720
If I get into basketball

04:40:22.720 --> 04:40:24.320
Like I can't set a realistic

04:40:24.320 --> 04:40:26.720
Expectation that I'm going to play in the NBA

04:40:26.720 --> 04:40:28.080
That I'm going to go to the finals

04:40:28.080 --> 04:40:29.280
Or I get into tennis

04:40:29.280 --> 04:40:30.640
And I'm going to play at Wimble then

04:40:30.640 --> 04:40:31.920
That just doesn't happen

04:40:31.920 --> 04:40:33.280
But racing is special in this way

04:40:33.280 --> 04:40:34.560
Because it requires

04:40:34.560 --> 04:40:35.520
A fair amount of money

04:40:35.520 --> 04:40:36.560
To keep these cars running

04:40:36.560 --> 04:40:37.520
It's really expensive

04:40:37.520 --> 04:40:39.360
It's like having a small startup

04:40:39.360 --> 04:40:41.360
You need to fly a bunch of people around the world

04:40:41.360 --> 04:40:43.200
And buy expensive equipment and so forth

04:40:43.200 --> 04:40:44.560
So you need a bunch of capital

04:40:44.560 --> 04:40:45.520
And I had some

04:40:45.520 --> 04:40:46.960
Through the success of the company

04:40:46.960 --> 04:40:48.000
So I could do it

04:40:48.000 --> 04:40:48.800
Which

04:40:48.800 --> 04:40:50.560
meant that I could get to Lamar

04:40:50.560 --> 04:40:52.000
So I set that as my goal

04:40:52.000 --> 04:40:52.880
I want to get to Lamar

04:40:53.840 --> 04:40:56.000
And I started racing

04:40:56.000 --> 04:40:58.480
In real competition 2009

04:40:58.480 --> 04:41:00.480
And three years later in 2012

04:41:00.480 --> 04:41:01.680
I was at the grid of Lamar

04:41:01.680 --> 04:41:02.640
For the first time

04:41:02.640 --> 04:41:03.680
We should say

04:41:03.680 --> 04:41:04.400
So Lamar

04:41:04.400 --> 04:41:05.920
24 hour race

04:41:05.920 --> 04:41:06.720
Endurance

04:41:07.920 --> 04:41:09.200
I mean this is insane

04:41:09.840 --> 04:41:10.800
There are three drivers

04:41:10.800 --> 04:41:11.200
Mind you

04:41:11.200 --> 04:41:12.400
So it's not like one

04:41:12.400 --> 04:41:14.320
Guy just driving for 20 hours

04:41:14.320 --> 04:41:15.120
24 hours straight

04:41:15.120 --> 04:41:17.600
But still it's a pretty tough race

04:41:17.600 --> 04:41:18.880
Both physically and mentally

04:41:18.880 --> 04:41:20.240
Especially mentally

04:41:20.240 --> 04:41:20.960
When you've been up

04:41:21.680 --> 04:41:24.560
For 24 plus hours

04:41:24.560 --> 04:41:26.240
You're not quite a sharp

04:41:26.720 --> 04:41:28.000
When you first wake up

04:41:28.000 --> 04:41:29.440
And this is funny about Lamar too

04:41:29.440 --> 04:41:31.520
It starts at around four o'clock in the afternoon

04:41:31.520 --> 04:41:33.200
So you've already been up for half a day

04:41:33.200 --> 04:41:34.320
By the time the race starts

04:41:34.320 --> 04:41:36.000
And then there's 24 hours to go

04:41:36.000 --> 04:41:37.280
Before you're done

04:41:37.280 --> 04:41:38.640
And you'll be in the car

04:41:38.640 --> 04:41:40.240
For anywhere from

04:41:40.320 --> 04:41:41.680
Usually an hour and a half

04:41:41.680 --> 04:41:43.680
To a maximum of four hours

04:41:43.680 --> 04:41:44.720
The regulations say

04:41:44.720 --> 04:41:46.720
Four out of six is the max you can do

04:41:46.720 --> 04:41:48.640
I've spent perhaps two and a half hours

04:41:48.640 --> 04:41:50.160
In a single stint at Lamar

04:41:50.800 --> 04:41:51.760
It's pretty taxing

04:41:51.760 --> 04:41:52.480
You're going

04:41:53.360 --> 04:41:54.240
200 miles an hour

04:41:54.960 --> 04:41:56.160
Into some of these turns

04:41:56.720 --> 04:41:58.240
And there's another

04:41:58.240 --> 04:41:59.680
60 cars on track

04:42:00.240 --> 04:42:03.040
Whenever I'm in my normal category

04:42:03.040 --> 04:42:04.880
Which is the LNP-2 category

04:42:04.880 --> 04:42:06.080
I have GT cars

04:42:06.080 --> 04:42:08.240
Which are more like a Ferrari and a Porsche

04:42:08.880 --> 04:42:09.920
That I have to overtake

04:42:09.920 --> 04:42:11.200
And then I have these hypercars

04:42:11.200 --> 04:42:13.680
Which is the top class that are overtaking me

04:42:13.680 --> 04:42:14.880
So you got a lot going on

04:42:15.760 --> 04:42:16.960
And you got to stay sharp

04:42:16.960 --> 04:42:18.800
For two and a half hours straight to do that

04:42:18.800 --> 04:42:20.720
That is just a guaranteed way to get

04:42:21.280 --> 04:42:22.560
Incredible flow

04:42:22.560 --> 04:42:24.320
For long long stretches of time

04:42:24.320 --> 04:42:26.320
That's why you get addicted to it

04:42:26.320 --> 04:42:27.520
That's why I got addicted

04:42:27.520 --> 04:42:28.800
You got to talk me through this video

04:42:28.800 --> 04:42:31.440
This video of you in these LNP-2s

04:42:31.440 --> 04:42:32.880
This is such a cool

04:42:32.880 --> 04:42:34.160
This is so cool

04:42:34.160 --> 04:42:35.440
And this was probably

04:42:35.440 --> 04:42:37.440
My favorite battle of my career

04:42:37.440 --> 04:42:38.400
Shut

04:42:38.480 --> 04:42:40.160
And Hanboa Hanson has beat

04:42:40.160 --> 04:42:41.440
Host and Fart

04:42:41.440 --> 04:42:42.960
Yeah, so this is me

04:42:42.960 --> 04:42:45.120
Driving against Nico Miller

04:42:45.120 --> 04:42:47.280
At the Shanghai International Circuit

04:42:47.280 --> 04:42:48.240
You're on the outside

04:42:48.240 --> 04:42:50.000
I'm on the outside in the

04:42:50.000 --> 04:42:51.520
Cool white

04:42:51.520 --> 04:42:53.440
And we go a whole track around

04:42:53.440 --> 04:42:54.560
With basically a piece of paper

04:42:54.560 --> 04:42:56.080
Between a seat down this back straight

04:42:56.080 --> 04:42:57.200
I get so close to him

04:42:57.200 --> 04:42:59.200
Because I want to force him over on the other side of the track

04:42:59.920 --> 04:43:01.760
Such that he can't just box me in

04:43:02.560 --> 04:43:04.240
And we've been fighting already at this point

04:43:04.240 --> 04:43:06.080
For basically 40 minutes straight

04:43:06.160 --> 04:43:08.800
I've been managing to keep this professional driver

04:43:08.800 --> 04:43:10.160
Behind me for 40 minutes

04:43:10.160 --> 04:43:11.760
And he finally passes me

04:43:11.760 --> 04:43:14.000
But we just keep the battle on for the whole time

04:43:14.000 --> 04:43:16.640
And it really just shows both these kinds of cars

04:43:16.640 --> 04:43:18.320
The Lamont Prototype

04:43:18.320 --> 04:43:19.520
We don't actually have a touch

04:43:20.080 --> 04:43:21.440
We get within about an inch

04:43:22.320 --> 04:43:26.240
And keep going around the Shanghai Circuit too

04:43:26.240 --> 04:43:27.600
How did you get so good

04:43:29.040 --> 04:43:29.680
Like what

04:43:29.680 --> 04:43:31.600
I mean that's a fascinating story

04:43:31.600 --> 04:43:32.080
Right

04:43:32.080 --> 04:43:34.240
That you are able to get so good

04:43:34.240 --> 04:43:36.400
I'm pretty good for the kind of driver I am

04:43:36.400 --> 04:43:38.000
Which is called the Gentleman Driver

04:43:38.000 --> 04:43:39.840
Which means I'm not a professional driver

04:43:39.840 --> 04:43:43.200
And like many good Gentleman drivers

04:43:43.200 --> 04:43:45.520
When we're at our really best

04:43:45.520 --> 04:43:46.800
We can be quite competitive

04:43:46.800 --> 04:43:48.000
With even professional drivers

04:43:48.000 --> 04:43:49.200
Who have been doing this their whole life

04:43:50.000 --> 04:43:51.120
The difference between us

04:43:51.120 --> 04:43:51.920
And the professionals

04:43:51.920 --> 04:43:53.520
Is the professionals could do it every time

04:43:53.520 --> 04:43:54.800
Or more or less every time

04:43:54.800 --> 04:43:56.720
So I can't be this good all the time

04:43:56.720 --> 04:43:58.080
When everything is just right

04:43:58.080 --> 04:43:59.520
I can be competitive with

04:44:00.160 --> 04:44:01.680
Professional drivers

04:44:01.680 --> 04:44:03.680
But that's not how you win championships

04:44:03.680 --> 04:44:05.680
That's not how you get paid by factories to drive

04:44:05.680 --> 04:44:07.680
You got to be good every time you go out

04:44:07.680 --> 04:44:09.280
So that's a huge difference

04:44:09.280 --> 04:44:10.640
But some of it was also just

04:44:10.640 --> 04:44:11.840
I really put my mind to it

04:44:12.640 --> 04:44:14.960
By the time I realized race cars

04:44:14.960 --> 04:44:17.680
Is what I want to do as my serious hobby

04:44:17.680 --> 04:44:20.000
I put in thousands of hours

04:44:20.960 --> 04:44:21.920
Have you crashed?

04:44:21.920 --> 04:44:23.200
What's the worst crash?

04:44:23.200 --> 04:44:24.400
I've had a lot of crashes

04:44:24.400 --> 04:44:26.480
But thankfully, Nuggan would

04:44:26.480 --> 04:44:28.080
I haven't had any crashes

04:44:28.080 --> 04:44:30.000
Where I've gotten really seriously heard

04:44:30.000 --> 04:44:31.600
Have you like wrecked the car?

04:44:31.600 --> 04:44:32.240
Oh yes

04:44:32.240 --> 04:44:32.880
Oh yes

04:44:32.960 --> 04:44:34.240
I've wrecked many a car

04:44:34.240 --> 04:44:35.440
So what does that feel like

04:44:35.440 --> 04:44:36.640
Just you wreck a car

04:44:36.640 --> 04:44:37.520
Like how do you get

04:44:37.520 --> 04:44:39.360
It feels like total shit

04:44:39.360 --> 04:44:40.960
If you're in a real race

04:44:40.960 --> 04:44:42.400
And other people depend on you

04:44:42.400 --> 04:44:44.080
It's not even so much the car

04:44:44.080 --> 04:44:44.720
Although it's also

04:44:44.720 --> 04:44:45.280
Sometimes that

04:44:45.280 --> 04:44:46.720
These cars are expensive to repair

04:44:46.720 --> 04:44:47.360
And that sucks

04:44:47.360 --> 04:44:48.000
And it feels

04:44:48.720 --> 04:44:49.600
So wasteful

04:44:49.600 --> 04:44:49.920
In a way

04:44:49.920 --> 04:44:50.800
When you crash

04:44:50.800 --> 04:44:51.600
Some of these cars

04:44:52.400 --> 04:44:53.120
But

04:44:53.120 --> 04:44:55.120
The sense that you're letting a team down

04:44:55.120 --> 04:44:55.600
Endurance

04:44:56.320 --> 04:44:57.680
Racing is the team sport

04:44:57.680 --> 04:44:59.120
Not only do you have your mechanics

04:44:59.120 --> 04:45:00.480
You usually have co-drivers

04:45:00.480 --> 04:45:01.440
So when I crash

04:45:01.440 --> 04:45:02.480
I just feel like

04:45:02.560 --> 04:45:03.760
Damn it

04:45:03.760 --> 04:45:05.280
I could have avoided this

04:45:05.280 --> 04:45:06.880
Yeah, but also

04:45:06.880 --> 04:45:08.240
You could have died

04:45:08.240 --> 04:45:09.520
Do you know what's funny

04:45:09.520 --> 04:45:10.880
I never think about that

04:45:10.880 --> 04:45:12.320
I don't think you can

04:45:12.320 --> 04:45:14.320
Because I think the moment you start thinking about

04:45:15.120 --> 04:45:16.480
Being able to die

04:45:16.480 --> 04:45:17.360
You can't do it

04:45:17.360 --> 04:45:18.320
You can't go fast

04:45:18.320 --> 04:45:19.280
Well, I'm sure

04:45:20.240 --> 04:45:21.600
Not to go all

04:45:21.600 --> 04:45:23.600
Car all young and

04:45:23.600 --> 04:45:24.320
Freud here

04:45:25.120 --> 04:45:27.200
But I'm sure that's always

04:45:27.200 --> 04:45:28.800
Present in the back of your mind

04:45:28.800 --> 04:45:29.280
Somewhere

04:45:29.280 --> 04:45:31.360
You're not just bringing it to the surface

04:45:31.440 --> 04:45:32.960
It is in the sense that

04:45:32.960 --> 04:45:34.240
It's part of the appeal

04:45:34.800 --> 04:45:36.000
It's part of

04:45:36.000 --> 04:45:37.840
The sense that there's something on the line

04:45:37.840 --> 04:45:39.200
That this isn't just virtual

04:45:39.200 --> 04:45:40.560
I can't just hit reset

04:45:40.560 --> 04:45:41.280
Restart

04:45:41.280 --> 04:45:41.840
Reboot

04:45:42.480 --> 04:45:43.840
If I crash this car

04:45:45.040 --> 04:45:46.000
We're going to be out

04:45:46.000 --> 04:45:47.440
Or we're going to be this advantage

04:45:47.440 --> 04:45:48.640
Or it's going to get destroyed

04:45:48.640 --> 04:45:49.600
Or I might get hurt

04:45:49.600 --> 04:45:50.240
I've gotten

04:45:51.280 --> 04:45:52.800
Lightly hurt a few times

04:45:53.440 --> 04:45:55.840
I actually had the year we won

04:45:55.840 --> 04:45:57.440
Twenty-Fares of Le Mans in our class

04:45:58.080 --> 04:46:00.320
I'd been training in this formula

04:46:01.120 --> 04:46:02.240
3.5

04:46:03.040 --> 04:46:03.440
Car

04:46:03.440 --> 04:46:04.880
It's a really fast car

04:46:04.880 --> 04:46:07.120
It's a really nice exercise to do

04:46:07.120 --> 04:46:08.000
But it's also

04:46:08.000 --> 04:46:09.040
It doesn't have power steering

04:46:09.840 --> 04:46:10.800
So some of these race cars

04:46:10.800 --> 04:46:11.680
Especially the open seats

04:46:11.680 --> 04:46:12.800
Or so they don't have power steering

04:46:12.800 --> 04:46:14.960
Which means that the steering wheel

04:46:14.960 --> 04:46:17.280
Is basically directly connected

04:46:17.280 --> 04:46:18.320
To the front wheels

04:46:19.120 --> 04:46:20.960
So if you crash one of those cars

04:46:20.960 --> 04:46:22.960
And the front wheels suddenly turn

04:46:23.520 --> 04:46:24.640
You're really going to hurt your hands

04:46:24.640 --> 04:46:26.320
If you don't get your hands off the wheel

04:46:26.320 --> 04:46:27.920
I hadn't raised enough of those cars

04:46:27.920 --> 04:46:29.200
To know that I had to get

04:46:29.200 --> 04:46:30.080
Or to have to instinct

04:46:30.080 --> 04:46:31.440
To have developed instinct

04:46:31.440 --> 04:46:33.040
That I had to get my hands off the wheel

04:46:33.040 --> 04:46:34.080
So I didn't

04:46:34.080 --> 04:46:35.520
And I really hurt my hand

04:46:35.520 --> 04:46:38.400
And this was just I think a month before

04:46:38.400 --> 04:46:39.360
The twenty-fares of Le Mans

04:46:39.360 --> 04:46:40.240
So I thought, oh man

04:46:40.240 --> 04:46:41.440
I'm going to have to miss it this year

04:46:41.440 --> 04:46:42.480
I had like a

04:46:42.480 --> 04:46:43.120
Not a cast

04:46:43.120 --> 04:46:44.560
It was just seriously sprained

04:46:44.560 --> 04:46:45.840
And then somehow

04:46:45.840 --> 04:46:46.880
Miraculously

04:46:46.880 --> 04:46:48.720
Like a week before the event

04:46:48.720 --> 04:46:49.680
I was like, oh yeah

04:46:49.680 --> 04:46:50.480
Actually it's okay now

04:46:50.480 --> 04:46:51.440
So got to do it

04:46:51.440 --> 04:46:52.960
And that would have been

04:46:52.960 --> 04:46:53.920
Grave regret

04:46:53.920 --> 04:46:56.000
If I would have seen my team

04:46:56.000 --> 04:46:57.360
Go to on to win the race

04:46:57.360 --> 04:46:59.360
And I would have to sit on the sidelines

04:46:59.360 --> 04:47:01.200
But I really have been quite fortunate

04:47:01.200 --> 04:47:02.400
In the sense that

04:47:02.400 --> 04:47:05.360
Most of my crashes have just been expensive

04:47:05.360 --> 04:47:07.760
Or sporting inconvenient

04:47:07.760 --> 04:47:09.520
They've never been

04:47:09.520 --> 04:47:11.040
Something where I got seriously hurt

04:47:11.040 --> 04:47:12.320
But I've seen plenty of people

04:47:12.320 --> 04:47:13.040
Who have

04:47:13.040 --> 04:47:13.680
In fact

04:47:13.680 --> 04:47:15.120
My co-driver this year

04:47:15.120 --> 04:47:16.400
And for several years

04:47:16.400 --> 04:47:17.840
Petro Fidipaldi

04:47:18.480 --> 04:47:20.800
Drove a race car at Spa

04:47:21.280 --> 04:47:24.000
Spa is one of the great race tracks

04:47:24.000 --> 04:47:24.560
Of all time

04:47:24.560 --> 04:47:27.440
And has this iconic corner called Arouche

04:47:27.440 --> 04:47:29.920
Which is probably the most famous corner in all of motorsports

04:47:29.920 --> 04:47:31.520
That has a great compression

04:47:31.520 --> 04:47:32.160
Before you

04:47:32.960 --> 04:47:33.920
Climb uphill

04:47:33.920 --> 04:47:35.760
It's a extremely fast

04:47:35.760 --> 04:47:37.280
Very difficult corner

04:47:37.280 --> 04:47:39.600
And just as he does the compression

04:47:39.600 --> 04:47:41.200
His car basically sets out

04:47:41.200 --> 04:47:42.560
And he loses his power steering

04:47:42.560 --> 04:47:44.080
And he drives straight into the wall

04:47:44.080 --> 04:47:45.440
And breaks both his legs

04:47:45.440 --> 04:47:46.960
And basically

04:47:46.960 --> 04:47:47.840
Face the prospect

04:47:47.840 --> 04:47:49.440
That maybe his career was over

04:47:49.440 --> 04:47:50.160
I've had other

04:47:50.960 --> 04:47:51.920
teammates

04:47:51.920 --> 04:47:52.960
And people I know

04:47:52.960 --> 04:47:54.080
Have serious injuries

04:47:54.080 --> 04:47:55.600
That's really hurt them

04:47:56.800 --> 04:47:58.320
And yet what's funny as you say

04:47:59.040 --> 04:48:00.400
You think that would sink in

04:48:01.440 --> 04:48:04.080
The year before

04:48:04.080 --> 04:48:04.640
We won

04:48:05.680 --> 04:48:06.960
In 2014

04:48:06.960 --> 04:48:08.560
That same car

04:48:08.560 --> 04:48:09.840
Had a Danish driver in it

04:48:09.840 --> 04:48:10.560
At Le Mans

04:48:10.560 --> 04:48:11.840
At the race I was driving

04:48:11.840 --> 04:48:12.400
Who died

04:48:13.440 --> 04:48:16.640
He lost control of the car

04:48:16.640 --> 04:48:17.120
When

04:48:17.760 --> 04:48:19.760
There was a bit of rain on the track

04:48:19.840 --> 04:48:20.960
And the track was

04:48:20.960 --> 04:48:22.880
Unfortunately designed in such a poor way

04:48:22.880 --> 04:48:24.000
That there was a

04:48:24.000 --> 04:48:25.120
Very big tree

04:48:25.120 --> 04:48:26.480
Right behind the railing

04:48:27.360 --> 04:48:28.960
And he

04:48:28.960 --> 04:48:30.160
Hit that tree

04:48:30.160 --> 04:48:31.600
At full speed

04:48:31.600 --> 04:48:32.880
Pulled

04:48:32.880 --> 04:48:33.840
90 g's

04:48:33.840 --> 04:48:35.440
And was dead on the spot

04:48:36.000 --> 04:48:37.600
Which was just such an

04:48:37.600 --> 04:48:38.960
Extremely

04:48:38.960 --> 04:48:40.080
Awful

04:48:40.080 --> 04:48:41.040
Experience to go through

04:48:41.760 --> 04:48:42.880
I finished second

04:48:42.880 --> 04:48:43.680
That year

04:48:43.680 --> 04:48:46.080
Which should have been caused for a bunch of celebration

04:48:46.880 --> 04:48:47.920
But it was just

04:48:47.920 --> 04:48:49.680
Tainted by the fact that

04:48:50.640 --> 04:48:52.640
Not only did a driver die

04:48:52.640 --> 04:48:53.360
A fellow

04:48:53.360 --> 04:48:54.240
Dane

04:48:54.240 --> 04:48:55.120
died

04:48:55.120 --> 04:48:56.880
A guy I knew died

04:48:58.320 --> 04:48:58.800
That was

04:48:59.840 --> 04:49:00.640
That was pretty tough

04:49:01.600 --> 04:49:03.040
So that

04:49:03.040 --> 04:49:05.280
Throw that into the pile of the

04:49:05.280 --> 04:49:06.720
The things have to be considered

04:49:06.720 --> 04:49:07.680
Is the weather conditions

04:49:07.680 --> 04:49:08.960
A commission of the track

04:49:08.960 --> 04:49:10.320
The

04:49:10.320 --> 04:49:11.840
Weather is dry or wet

04:49:12.320 --> 04:49:13.920
It's a huge part of it

04:49:13.920 --> 04:49:15.520
Even just last year at Le Mans

04:49:16.640 --> 04:49:17.680
It was raining

04:49:17.680 --> 04:49:18.400
And I was out

04:49:19.360 --> 04:49:20.320
And

04:49:20.320 --> 04:49:24.800
I hadn't made a serious mistake at the 24th of Le Mans

04:49:24.800 --> 04:49:25.600
Since I

04:49:26.480 --> 04:49:28.720
Did the first race in 2012

04:49:28.720 --> 04:49:29.360
Where I put it

04:49:30.240 --> 04:49:31.680
In the sand trap

04:49:31.680 --> 04:49:33.200
With like four hours to go

04:49:33.200 --> 04:49:35.040
And we lost a couple of laps getting pulled out

04:49:35.040 --> 04:49:37.280
But it didn't actually change anything for our

04:49:37.280 --> 04:49:38.720
Result because

04:49:38.720 --> 04:49:40.720
That was just how the field was spread out

04:49:40.720 --> 04:49:42.400
I'd made minor mistakes over the years

04:49:42.400 --> 04:49:43.760
But nothing that really set us out

04:49:43.760 --> 04:49:46.160
And that the race last year

04:49:46.160 --> 04:49:47.040
When it was raining

04:49:48.000 --> 04:49:50.480
I first clobbered a Ford Mustang

04:49:51.200 --> 04:49:53.520
When I made an overambitious pass

04:49:53.520 --> 04:49:55.520
On a damp part of the track

04:49:55.520 --> 04:49:56.800
And couldn't stop in time

04:49:57.440 --> 04:49:58.960
And then

04:49:58.960 --> 04:50:00.400
Felt absolutely awful

04:50:00.400 --> 04:50:03.120
As I sat in the gravel pit for two laps

04:50:03.120 --> 04:50:04.880
And knew that our race was over

04:50:04.880 --> 04:50:07.200
A race where we were highly competitive

04:50:07.200 --> 04:50:09.200
You're not blessed with a competitive car

04:50:09.200 --> 04:50:11.520
A competitive team and competitive setup every year

04:50:11.520 --> 04:50:13.280
I know how rare that is

04:50:13.280 --> 04:50:16.240
So to know that we had had a chance that year

04:50:16.240 --> 04:50:18.000
And I sort of squandered it

04:50:18.000 --> 04:50:19.200
Felt really bad

04:50:19.200 --> 04:50:21.840
But that got compounded

04:50:21.840 --> 04:50:22.960
I got back on track

04:50:23.760 --> 04:50:25.360
Barely made it another stint

04:50:25.360 --> 04:50:26.480
And then put it in the gravel

04:50:26.480 --> 04:50:27.840
Trapped again when it started raining

04:50:27.840 --> 04:50:28.960
On the entrance into Porsche

04:50:28.960 --> 04:50:30.080
So

04:50:30.080 --> 04:50:31.840
This is part of why racing is so

04:50:31.840 --> 04:50:32.560
Addicting too

04:50:32.560 --> 04:50:35.200
Because the highs are very very high

04:50:35.200 --> 04:50:36.320
When you win a race

04:50:36.320 --> 04:50:38.320
Like the twenty-farris of Le Mans

04:50:38.320 --> 04:50:39.840
It feels just incredible

04:50:39.840 --> 04:50:40.800
There's so much emotion

04:50:40.800 --> 04:50:42.240
But if you fuck it up

04:50:42.240 --> 04:50:44.640
The lows are very very low

04:50:44.640 --> 04:50:47.600
What are the things you're paying attention to when you're driving

04:50:47.600 --> 04:50:50.960
What's what what is the what are the parameters

04:50:50.960 --> 04:50:52.560
What are you loading in

04:50:52.560 --> 04:50:54.160
Are you

04:50:54.160 --> 04:50:55.600
Feeling

04:50:55.600 --> 04:50:57.200
The grip

04:50:57.200 --> 04:50:59.040
Are you basically increasing the speed

04:50:59.040 --> 04:51:01.680
And seeing what like a constant feedback system

04:51:01.680 --> 04:51:04.080
Effect that has on the grip

04:51:04.080 --> 04:51:05.600
You're trying to

04:51:05.600 --> 04:51:08.800
Manage that and try to find that optimal slip angle

04:51:08.800 --> 04:51:11.040
Are you looking around using your eyes

04:51:12.080 --> 04:51:13.520
Are you smelling things

04:51:13.520 --> 04:51:15.520
Are you listening is feeling the wind

04:51:15.520 --> 04:51:16.720
Are you

04:51:16.720 --> 04:51:19.040
Are you all looking at the field too

04:51:20.000 --> 04:51:22.720
Like how did you not hit that guy at all

04:51:22.720 --> 04:51:24.400
You get close with the niches

04:51:24.400 --> 04:51:26.080
Right so you have to pay attention to that too

04:51:26.080 --> 04:51:28.480
It's really interesting about that specific battle

04:51:28.480 --> 04:51:30.960
Where we're literally a few inches apart

04:51:31.840 --> 04:51:33.520
I can't fully explain it

04:51:33.520 --> 04:51:36.880
But humans can develop an incredible sense of space

04:51:37.520 --> 04:51:41.040
Where I can't see the edge of the back of my car

04:51:41.040 --> 04:51:42.880
But I can know exactly where it is

04:51:42.960 --> 04:51:45.680
I can have a mental model in my head

04:51:45.680 --> 04:51:48.640
That gives me the exact dimensions of this car

04:51:48.640 --> 04:51:51.840
So that I can run within a few inches of a competitive car

04:51:51.840 --> 04:51:53.840
Or within a few inches of the wall

04:51:53.840 --> 04:51:55.680
And not hit either

04:51:55.680 --> 04:51:56.880
When things go well

04:51:56.880 --> 04:51:59.040
The car is about two meters wide

04:51:59.040 --> 04:52:00.800
And it's quite long

04:52:00.800 --> 04:52:02.000
Five meters

04:52:02.000 --> 04:52:03.040
And you can't see everything

04:52:03.040 --> 04:52:04.720
The mirrors are actually kind of shit

04:52:04.720 --> 04:52:06.560
There's no rear view mirror in these cars

04:52:06.560 --> 04:52:07.440
You can't see out the back

04:52:07.440 --> 04:52:10.320
You can only see through your two side mirrors

04:52:10.400 --> 04:52:13.280
But you form this intuitive mental model

04:52:13.280 --> 04:52:14.400
When you get good enough at this

04:52:14.400 --> 04:52:17.680
But what I actually pay attention to most

04:52:17.680 --> 04:52:19.840
Is I run a program

04:52:19.840 --> 04:52:21.760
What I try to do when I go to a racetrack

04:52:21.760 --> 04:52:24.960
Is I try to load up the best program I know how

04:52:24.960 --> 04:52:26.800
For every single corner

04:52:26.800 --> 04:52:28.400
What's my break point

04:52:28.400 --> 04:52:30.240
What's my acceleration point

04:52:30.240 --> 04:52:33.760
What's my break trailing curve

04:52:33.760 --> 04:52:36.000
And I try to pick up that program in part

04:52:36.000 --> 04:52:37.440
Just by finding it myself

04:52:37.440 --> 04:52:38.640
And how fast I can go

04:52:38.640 --> 04:52:40.080
But even more so than that

04:52:40.080 --> 04:52:42.640
By copying my professional competitors

04:52:42.640 --> 04:52:43.920
Or not competitors

04:52:43.920 --> 04:52:44.960
Code drivers

04:52:44.960 --> 04:52:47.680
So I usually always race with a pro

04:52:47.680 --> 04:52:51.680
And modern race cars produce an absolute enormous amount of data

04:52:51.680 --> 04:52:54.720
And you can analyze all that data after each outing

04:52:54.720 --> 04:52:56.800
You can see an exact trace

04:52:56.800 --> 04:52:59.200
Of how much you pushed the brake pedal

04:52:59.200 --> 04:53:01.760
How much you did in terms of steering inputs

04:53:01.760 --> 04:53:03.120
When you got on the gas

04:53:03.120 --> 04:53:05.760
You can see every millisecond

04:53:05.760 --> 04:53:08.640
You're losing is evident in those charts

04:53:08.640 --> 04:53:11.040
So what I try to do is I try to look at the chart

04:53:11.040 --> 04:53:13.200
And then I try to load that in

04:53:13.200 --> 04:53:14.640
And like that's what I got to do

04:53:14.640 --> 04:53:16.720
Oh in this corner 17

04:53:16.720 --> 04:53:18.640
I actually I have to be

04:53:18.640 --> 04:53:21.040
10 bar lighter on the brake

04:53:21.040 --> 04:53:22.400
So I try to load that program in

04:53:22.400 --> 04:53:23.600
And then I try to repeat it

04:53:23.600 --> 04:53:25.280
Now then there are all the things that changes

04:53:26.080 --> 04:53:28.400
Your tires change quite a lot

04:53:28.400 --> 04:53:31.120
These tires are made to only last

04:53:31.120 --> 04:53:32.720
40 minutes in many cases

04:53:32.720 --> 04:53:34.960
Sometimes at Le Mans we can go longer

04:53:35.040 --> 04:53:37.520
But at some race tracks they last a little of 40 minutes

04:53:37.520 --> 04:53:39.520
Before they really fall off

04:53:39.520 --> 04:53:40.480
So you got to manage that

04:53:40.480 --> 04:53:42.560
That the grip is constantly changing

04:53:42.560 --> 04:53:45.680
So your program have to suddenly fit those changing circumstances

04:53:45.680 --> 04:53:47.200
And then in endurance racing

04:53:47.200 --> 04:53:49.040
You're constantly interacting with other cars

04:53:49.040 --> 04:53:50.880
Because you're passing slower classes

04:53:50.880 --> 04:53:52.320
Or you're getting passed by a faster class

04:53:52.320 --> 04:53:54.800
So that's part of the equation

04:53:54.800 --> 04:53:59.040
And then you're trying to dance the car around the limit of adhesion

04:53:59.040 --> 04:54:01.200
So you got all those factors playing at the same time

04:54:01.200 --> 04:54:03.120
But above all else for me

04:54:03.120 --> 04:54:06.400
Is to try to become a robot

04:54:06.400 --> 04:54:08.640
Like how can I repeat this set of steps

04:54:09.440 --> 04:54:12.400
Exactly as I'm supposed to

04:54:12.960 --> 04:54:14.720
For two and a half hours straight without making

04:54:15.760 --> 04:54:17.680
100 milliseconds worth of mistakes

04:54:17.680 --> 04:54:20.480
Yeah low latency algorithm

04:54:20.480 --> 04:54:22.240
That's really a huge part of it actually

04:54:22.240 --> 04:54:26.080
Your latency is enormously important

04:54:26.080 --> 04:54:28.160
In terms of being able to catch

04:54:28.160 --> 04:54:29.760
When the car starts slipping

04:54:29.760 --> 04:54:32.560
You get this sensation in your body

04:54:32.560 --> 04:54:34.880
That the G-forces are a little off

04:54:34.880 --> 04:54:36.080
The slip angle is a little off

04:54:36.080 --> 04:54:37.280
And then you have to counter steer

04:54:38.160 --> 04:54:40.160
And obviously the best race car drivers

04:54:40.160 --> 04:54:42.240
Just feel like an intuition

04:54:42.240 --> 04:54:43.200
I have some intuition

04:54:43.200 --> 04:54:44.000
I don't have all of it

04:54:44.000 --> 04:54:46.800
So I do occasionally spend my car

04:54:46.800 --> 04:54:47.840
But that's the challenge

04:54:48.720 --> 04:54:51.040
From everything you've studied and understand

04:54:51.040 --> 04:54:54.000
What does it take to achieve mastery in racing

04:54:54.000 --> 04:54:57.600
Like what does it take to become the best race car driver in the world

04:54:58.640 --> 04:54:59.760
Obsession is part of it

04:54:59.760 --> 04:55:02.800
When I read and hear about Senna

04:55:03.360 --> 04:55:04.800
And the other greats

04:55:04.800 --> 04:55:07.840
They were just singularly focused

04:55:07.840 --> 04:55:11.200
Max bestapin is the current champion of the world

04:55:11.200 --> 04:55:12.640
And he is the same kind

04:55:13.120 --> 04:55:16.080
Max has been fascinating to watch

04:55:16.080 --> 04:55:17.840
I mean he's a phenomenal race car driver

04:55:17.840 --> 04:55:20.480
But he also literally does nothing else

04:55:20.480 --> 04:55:21.840
When he's not at the racetrack

04:55:21.840 --> 04:55:23.280
He's driving sim racing

04:55:23.840 --> 04:55:26.320
Like he's literally in video games

04:55:26.320 --> 04:55:27.360
Doing more racing

04:55:27.360 --> 04:55:28.720
When he's not doing all the racing

04:55:28.720 --> 04:55:29.760
He's already doing

04:55:29.760 --> 04:55:31.920
Is there a specific skill that

04:55:31.920 --> 04:55:34.720
Have that like stands out to you as supernatural

04:55:34.720 --> 04:55:36.400
Through all that obsession

04:55:36.400 --> 04:55:38.000
Like what

04:55:38.000 --> 04:55:39.200
Is it a bunch of factors

04:55:39.200 --> 04:55:40.960
Or are they actually able to

04:55:40.960 --> 04:55:42.480
Like you said develop a sense

04:55:42.480 --> 04:55:45.440
Is it they're able to get to the very edge of the slip

04:55:45.440 --> 04:55:47.040
They're able to develop

04:55:47.040 --> 04:55:50.640
Very fine tune sensibilities for when the car is sliding

04:55:50.640 --> 04:55:52.960
They can feel just these tiny moments

04:55:52.960 --> 04:55:54.880
Or movements in the chassis

04:55:54.880 --> 04:55:57.360
That transports up usually through their ass

04:55:57.440 --> 04:55:59.920
That's why you call this like a a button meter

04:55:59.920 --> 04:56:03.680
That goes up and you feel like the car is loose

04:56:03.680 --> 04:56:06.400
Or you feel like you're just about to lock up

04:56:07.280 --> 04:56:09.840
You can really hone that tuning

04:56:09.840 --> 04:56:13.040
Then the other thing is you have to have really good reaction time

04:56:13.040 --> 04:56:16.320
And when you look at great Formula One drivers

04:56:16.320 --> 04:56:19.360
They can generally have a reaction time

04:56:19.360 --> 04:56:20.880
Just under 200 milliseconds

04:56:20.880 --> 04:56:22.640
Which is awesome

04:56:22.640 --> 04:56:24.560
And even 10 milliseconds

04:56:24.560 --> 04:56:25.920
Difference makes a huge difference

04:56:25.920 --> 04:56:28.320
You'll see it when the Formula One grit for example

04:56:28.320 --> 04:56:29.440
They do a standing start

04:56:29.440 --> 04:56:32.080
And you see the five red lights come on

04:56:32.080 --> 04:56:34.160
And when the last light goes out

04:56:34.160 --> 04:56:37.120
They're supposed to release the clutch and get going

04:56:37.120 --> 04:56:38.320
And they can time this

04:56:38.320 --> 04:56:40.720
So you can see exactly who has the reaction time

04:56:40.720 --> 04:56:44.400
And even being off by 20 milliseconds

04:56:44.400 --> 04:56:46.880
Can make the difference of whether you're in front or behind

04:56:46.880 --> 04:56:47.840
At the first corner

04:56:47.840 --> 04:56:50.880
How much of winning is also just this

04:56:50.880 --> 04:56:53.120
Strategy of jocling for position

04:56:53.120 --> 04:56:53.920
There's some of that

04:56:53.920 --> 04:56:55.760
And some of it is also just nerve

04:56:55.760 --> 04:56:57.120
Who wants it more

04:56:57.120 --> 04:57:00.640
That's exactly when that sense of danger comes in

04:57:00.640 --> 04:57:04.160
There's a great quote from Fernando Alonso

04:57:04.160 --> 04:57:07.200
When he was driving at Sasuka

04:57:07.200 --> 04:57:09.440
Against Shumaka I think

04:57:09.440 --> 04:57:12.800
They're coming up to this incredibly fast corner

04:57:12.800 --> 04:57:14.480
It's very dangerous

04:57:14.480 --> 04:57:17.520
And Alonso basically accounts

04:57:17.520 --> 04:57:18.800
I was going to make the pass

04:57:18.800 --> 04:57:20.800
Because I knew he had a wife and kid

04:57:20.800 --> 04:57:22.160
Said homey

04:57:22.160 --> 04:57:23.120
That's so gay

04:57:23.120 --> 04:57:24.080
Just absolutely

04:57:24.080 --> 04:57:28.240
I knew he valued life more than I did

04:57:28.240 --> 04:57:30.240
So there's a bit of poker

04:57:30.240 --> 04:57:31.520
Sometimes in that

04:57:31.520 --> 04:57:33.360
Who's going to yield

04:57:33.360 --> 04:57:36.480
There's a bit of chicken race in that regard

04:57:36.480 --> 04:57:37.760
And sometimes it doesn't work

04:57:37.760 --> 04:57:39.520
No one yields and you both crash

04:57:39.520 --> 04:57:41.600
But very often one person will blink first

04:57:41.600 --> 04:57:43.920
Can the pass be both on the inside and the outside

04:57:43.920 --> 04:57:44.400
Or is he...

04:57:44.400 --> 04:57:45.920
You can pass wherever you want

04:57:45.920 --> 04:57:47.040
As long as you have

04:57:47.040 --> 04:57:50.880
Just a slight part of the car on the racetrack

04:57:50.880 --> 04:57:54.000
And then you just improvise and take risks

04:57:54.000 --> 04:57:55.840
What a sport

04:57:55.840 --> 04:57:58.080
And then Sam of course is like

04:57:58.080 --> 04:58:00.400
The legendary risk taker

04:58:00.400 --> 04:58:01.440
Yes

04:58:01.440 --> 04:58:03.280
And even before him

04:58:03.280 --> 04:58:04.080
By the time...

04:58:04.080 --> 04:58:05.360
I mean he died

04:58:05.360 --> 04:58:06.640
In the 90s

04:58:06.640 --> 04:58:08.320
But by the time we got to the 90s

04:58:08.320 --> 04:58:10.720
Racing was already a lot safer than it was

04:58:10.720 --> 04:58:13.200
When Nikolau raised in the 60s

04:58:14.880 --> 04:58:17.280
That level of danger is no longer there

04:58:17.280 --> 04:58:18.880
There's still just a remnant of it

04:58:18.880 --> 04:58:20.160
And it is still dangerous

04:58:20.160 --> 04:58:21.360
But nothing like that

04:58:21.360 --> 04:58:23.120
And it's a little hard to compare

04:58:23.120 --> 04:58:26.320
Through the ages like who's the greatest driver of all time

04:58:26.320 --> 04:58:29.040
I think there's a fair argument that Senna is

04:58:29.040 --> 04:58:30.240
But we don't have the data

04:58:30.240 --> 04:58:31.520
We don't know who he was up against

04:58:31.520 --> 04:58:32.560
Like how would he fare

04:58:32.560 --> 04:58:34.880
We pitted him against Max Verstappen today

04:58:34.880 --> 04:58:36.800
I do think sometimes that

04:58:36.800 --> 04:58:39.920
You can have a bit of nostalgia for the all-time greats

04:58:39.920 --> 04:58:41.840
But the world moves forward

04:58:41.840 --> 04:58:43.440
And new records are being set all the time

04:58:43.440 --> 04:58:46.080
And the professionalism keeps improving

04:58:46.080 --> 04:58:48.000
Sometimes to the detriment of the sport

04:58:48.000 --> 04:58:50.080
I think there's a lot of professional drivers

04:58:50.080 --> 04:58:52.400
Who are not only just very good at driving

04:58:52.400 --> 04:58:54.800
But are very good at being corporate spokesperson

04:58:54.800 --> 04:58:56.160
And it used to be quite different

04:58:56.160 --> 04:58:58.560
There used to be more characters in racing

04:58:58.560 --> 04:59:00.240
That had a bit more personality

04:59:00.240 --> 04:59:01.760
That they were allowed to shine

04:59:01.760 --> 04:59:04.480
Because there weren't a billion sponsorships on the line

04:59:04.480 --> 04:59:06.000
That they were afraid to lose

04:59:06.000 --> 04:59:06.880
Ridiculous question

04:59:06.880 --> 04:59:08.080
What's the greatest car I've ever made

04:59:08.080 --> 04:59:10.560
Or maybe what's the funnest one to drive

04:59:11.520 --> 04:59:14.480
The greatest car for me of all time is the Pagani Sonda

04:59:15.200 --> 04:59:16.400
Okay, I'm looking this up

04:59:16.400 --> 04:59:17.680
Pagani Sonda

04:59:17.680 --> 04:59:19.360
So the Pagani Sonda

04:59:19.440 --> 04:59:23.040
Was made by this wonderful Argentinian

04:59:23.040 --> 04:59:24.960
Called Horacio Pagani

04:59:24.960 --> 04:59:26.480
Like that's a beautiful car

04:59:26.480 --> 04:59:26.800
Well

04:59:26.800 --> 04:59:28.000
It's a gorgeous car

04:59:28.000 --> 04:59:28.800
You can look up mine

04:59:28.800 --> 04:59:30.480
It's the Pagani Sonda HH

04:59:31.360 --> 04:59:32.400
Yep

04:59:32.400 --> 04:59:33.200
So

04:59:34.160 --> 04:59:36.160
That's um

04:59:36.160 --> 04:59:39.280
A car I had made in 2010

04:59:39.920 --> 04:59:44.640
After we visited the factory in Marna

04:59:44.640 --> 04:59:47.040
And by sheer accident ended up with

04:59:48.000 --> 04:59:49.040
This car

04:59:49.440 --> 04:59:51.920
But it became my favorite car in the world basically

04:59:51.920 --> 04:59:54.720
When I watched an episode of Top Gear

04:59:54.720 --> 04:59:57.200
I think in 2005

04:59:58.080 --> 05:00:01.440
Where one of the presenters was driving the Pagani Sonda F

05:00:01.440 --> 05:00:02.640
Around and I just thought

05:00:02.640 --> 05:00:04.960
That's the most beautiful car in the world

05:00:04.960 --> 05:00:08.480
It is the most incredibly sounding car in the world

05:00:09.760 --> 05:00:10.960
If I one day

05:00:11.760 --> 05:00:12.960
Have the option

05:00:12.960 --> 05:00:13.920
This is what I want

05:00:14.560 --> 05:00:15.760
And then I have the option

05:00:15.840 --> 05:00:16.720
In 2010

05:00:16.720 --> 05:00:17.760
I've had the car ever since

05:00:17.760 --> 05:00:19.120
I'm never ever going to sell it

05:00:20.000 --> 05:00:24.160
It's truly a masterpiece that stood this test of time

05:00:24.160 --> 05:00:26.480
There's some great cars from history

05:00:26.480 --> 05:00:28.800
That are recognized as being great in their time

05:00:28.800 --> 05:00:30.240
This car is still great

05:00:30.240 --> 05:00:31.760
Have you taken it on the racetrack?

05:00:31.760 --> 05:00:32.240
I have

05:00:32.240 --> 05:00:33.440
It's terrible at that

05:00:33.440 --> 05:00:35.280
But I want to say it's terrible at that

05:00:35.280 --> 05:00:36.880
That's not what it's designed for

05:00:36.880 --> 05:00:39.360
It's designed for the road

05:00:39.360 --> 05:00:41.040
And that's why it's great

05:00:41.040 --> 05:00:42.480
There are a lot of fast cars

05:00:42.480 --> 05:00:44.800
That are straddling

05:00:44.800 --> 05:00:46.160
They're race car for the road

05:00:46.160 --> 05:00:48.240
You don't actually want a race car for the world

05:00:48.240 --> 05:00:50.000
A race car for the world is the pain in the ass

05:00:50.000 --> 05:00:51.040
It's way too stiff

05:00:51.040 --> 05:00:51.920
It's way too loud

05:00:51.920 --> 05:00:52.880
It's way too uncomfortable

05:00:52.880 --> 05:00:54.960
You can't actually take it on a road trip

05:00:54.960 --> 05:00:56.640
So this actually feels good driving

05:00:56.640 --> 05:00:57.440
Oh totally

05:00:57.440 --> 05:00:57.920
Totally

05:00:57.920 --> 05:01:00.160
And you of course always go to speed limit

05:01:00.160 --> 05:01:00.640
Always

05:01:01.440 --> 05:01:03.680
This is why I love having this car in Spain

05:01:03.680 --> 05:01:05.760
Because they're a little more relaxed

05:01:05.760 --> 05:01:06.880
Not entirely relaxed

05:01:06.880 --> 05:01:09.280
But more relaxed than they are in a lot of places

05:01:09.280 --> 05:01:10.240
In Denmark

05:01:10.240 --> 05:01:11.520
I kid you not

05:01:11.600 --> 05:01:13.280
If you are on the highway

05:01:13.280 --> 05:01:15.520
And you go more than twice the speed limit

05:01:15.520 --> 05:01:17.680
They confiscate your car and keep it

05:01:18.240 --> 05:01:19.200
You're not getting it back

05:01:19.200 --> 05:01:21.520
They don't even care if it's your car or not

05:01:21.520 --> 05:01:23.120
Like if you were boring my car

05:01:23.120 --> 05:01:24.240
And you went twice the speed limit

05:01:24.240 --> 05:01:24.800
It's gone

05:01:25.840 --> 05:01:27.600
So they don't do that in Spain

05:01:27.600 --> 05:01:28.560
I mean they

05:01:28.560 --> 05:01:31.200
In most places except for the German Autobahn

05:01:31.200 --> 05:01:32.320
They get pissy

05:01:32.320 --> 05:01:33.520
If you go twice the speed limit

05:01:33.520 --> 05:01:35.280
For all sorts of fair reasons

05:01:35.280 --> 05:01:37.680
They're not advocating that you should be going

05:01:37.680 --> 05:01:38.400
Much more than that

05:01:38.400 --> 05:01:39.920
But there are certain special roads

05:01:39.920 --> 05:01:41.040
Where you can't open things up

05:01:41.600 --> 05:01:42.960
No one's in harm's way

05:01:42.960 --> 05:01:45.040
And that's an incredible sensation

05:01:45.040 --> 05:01:46.800
And I do think that some of those speed limits

05:01:46.800 --> 05:01:47.760
Actually are kind of silly

05:01:47.760 --> 05:01:50.000
And I'm not just saying that in a vacuum

05:01:50.000 --> 05:01:51.040
In Germany

05:01:51.040 --> 05:01:53.200
They have the glorious Autobahn

05:01:53.200 --> 05:01:54.320
And on the Autobahn

05:01:54.320 --> 05:01:55.680
There is no speed limit

05:01:55.680 --> 05:01:56.800
In a bunch of segments

05:01:57.920 --> 05:01:59.040
And they're so committed

05:01:59.040 --> 05:02:01.440
To their speed limitless Autobahn

05:02:01.440 --> 05:02:03.040
Which is by the way very weird

05:02:03.040 --> 05:02:03.600
Of Germans

05:02:03.600 --> 05:02:05.040
They usually love rules

05:02:05.040 --> 05:02:06.960
They usually very precise about

05:02:06.960 --> 05:02:09.280
And then they have this glorious thing called the Autobahn

05:02:09.280 --> 05:02:10.560
There was a great case

05:02:10.640 --> 05:02:11.920
A couple of years ago

05:02:11.920 --> 05:02:14.400
Where a guy took out a Bugatti

05:02:14.400 --> 05:02:15.120
Shiran

05:02:15.120 --> 05:02:17.200
When 400 kilometers an hour

05:02:17.200 --> 05:02:18.080
On the Autobahn

05:02:18.080 --> 05:02:18.960
And he filled it

05:02:18.960 --> 05:02:20.000
And put it on YouTube

05:02:20.000 --> 05:02:21.920
And a case was brought against him

05:02:21.920 --> 05:02:24.080
Because even though they don't have a speed limit

05:02:24.080 --> 05:02:24.960
They do have rules

05:02:24.960 --> 05:02:26.800
And you can't drive recklessly

05:02:26.800 --> 05:02:27.680
And he won the case

05:02:27.680 --> 05:02:28.800
He wasn't driving recklessly

05:02:28.800 --> 05:02:30.560
He was just going very

05:02:30.560 --> 05:02:31.280
Very fast

05:02:31.920 --> 05:02:33.680
I've done the Autobahn a couple of times

05:02:34.480 --> 05:02:37.600
My wife and I went on a road trip in Europe in 2009

05:02:38.400 --> 05:02:40.960
And I got the Lamborghini Guiada

05:02:40.960 --> 05:02:43.200
We were driving up to 200 miles an hour

05:02:43.200 --> 05:02:45.840
And I'd driven 200 miles an hour

05:02:45.840 --> 05:02:47.200
Or close to it on a racetrack

05:02:47.200 --> 05:02:48.720
Before that feels like one thing

05:02:48.720 --> 05:02:49.840
Driving on a public road

05:02:49.840 --> 05:02:52.720
200 miles an hour feels really really fast

05:02:52.720 --> 05:02:53.680
Scary

05:02:53.680 --> 05:02:55.520
Actually a little scary yes

05:02:55.520 --> 05:02:57.680
Because you constantly think like

05:02:57.680 --> 05:02:58.800
On a racetrack

05:02:58.800 --> 05:02:59.840
You know the road

05:02:59.840 --> 05:03:00.480
You know the surface

05:03:00.480 --> 05:03:01.440
You can walk the track

05:03:01.440 --> 05:03:02.160
And most of the time

05:03:02.160 --> 05:03:03.360
You can know if there's a dip

05:03:03.360 --> 05:03:04.160
On a public road

05:03:04.160 --> 05:03:06.000
You can't know if there's suddenly a pothole

05:03:06.640 --> 05:03:08.240
Soon believe there's not going to be a pothole

05:03:08.240 --> 05:03:09.440
On the German Autobahn

05:03:09.440 --> 05:03:10.960
But it does feel a little scary

05:03:11.760 --> 05:03:13.360
But also exhilarating

05:03:13.360 --> 05:03:14.560
Speed is just

05:03:14.560 --> 05:03:16.400
Intrinsically really fun

05:03:16.960 --> 05:03:19.200
I don't know anyone I've taken out in a fast car

05:03:19.840 --> 05:03:21.360
Well actually I do know a few people

05:03:21.360 --> 05:03:23.040
Most people that take out in a fast car

05:03:23.040 --> 05:03:23.600
They grin

05:03:24.400 --> 05:03:26.880
Just it's a human reaction to grin

05:03:26.880 --> 05:03:28.480
When you go really fast

05:03:28.480 --> 05:03:30.240
Do you know what the fastest you've ever gone

05:03:30.800 --> 05:03:31.840
That's probably at Le Mans

05:03:31.840 --> 05:03:33.840
I think when the LNP2s

05:03:33.840 --> 05:03:35.120
Were at their maximum power

05:03:35.120 --> 05:03:36.560
And had 600 horsepower

05:03:36.560 --> 05:03:37.680
And really sticky tires

05:03:37.680 --> 05:03:40.320
We were going 340 kilometers now

05:03:40.320 --> 05:03:41.120
Which is just over

05:03:41.920 --> 05:03:42.880
200 miles an hour

05:03:42.880 --> 05:03:44.080
A bit over 200 miles an hour

05:03:44.640 --> 05:03:45.440
That's

05:03:45.440 --> 05:03:46.880
That does feel fast

05:03:46.880 --> 05:03:48.560
And it's really interesting with speed

05:03:48.560 --> 05:03:50.080
Is that the difference between

05:03:50.080 --> 05:03:52.720
Going let's say 150 and 160

05:03:53.520 --> 05:03:55.360
Doesn't feel that much

05:03:55.360 --> 05:03:57.040
Actually those 10

05:03:57.040 --> 05:03:57.680
Mild and hour

05:03:57.680 --> 05:03:59.600
But the difference between going 190

05:03:59.600 --> 05:04:01.040
And 200 feels

05:04:01.040 --> 05:04:02.800
Crazy faster

05:04:02.880 --> 05:04:04.800
Which as a percentage change is actually

05:04:04.800 --> 05:04:06.000
Last than going from

05:04:06.000 --> 05:04:08.000
150 to 160

05:04:08.000 --> 05:04:09.440
But there's some sense of

05:04:09.440 --> 05:04:10.800
Exponentiality

05:04:10.800 --> 05:04:12.480
Once you get up to those limits

05:04:13.760 --> 05:04:15.760
Where it's just on a complete different level

05:04:15.760 --> 05:04:17.840
Yeah because to me like 110

05:04:18.560 --> 05:04:20.080
120 feels fast

05:04:20.800 --> 05:04:22.240
200

05:04:22.240 --> 05:04:22.880
That's

05:04:22.880 --> 05:04:24.240
That's crazy

05:04:24.240 --> 05:04:25.200
It really is crazy

05:04:26.240 --> 05:04:27.360
I got to ask you about the

05:04:29.200 --> 05:04:32.160
The details of your programming setup

05:04:32.160 --> 05:04:33.120
The IDE

05:04:33.120 --> 05:04:34.400
All that kind of stuff

05:04:34.400 --> 05:04:36.160
Let's paint the picture of the perfect

05:04:37.760 --> 05:04:38.800
Programming setup

05:04:38.800 --> 05:04:39.840
Do you have a

05:04:39.840 --> 05:04:41.440
Programming setup that you enjoy

05:04:41.440 --> 05:04:42.800
Or are you very flexible

05:04:42.800 --> 05:04:44.000
Like how many monitors

05:04:44.880 --> 05:04:46.320
What kind of keyboard

05:04:46.320 --> 05:04:47.360
What kind of chair

05:04:48.160 --> 05:04:49.680
What kind of

05:04:49.680 --> 05:04:50.880
Desk

05:04:50.880 --> 05:04:53.360
It's funny because if you'd ask me

05:04:53.360 --> 05:04:55.280
Let's see a year and a half ago

05:04:55.280 --> 05:04:57.040
I would have given you the same answer

05:04:57.040 --> 05:04:59.840
As I would given anyone for basically 20 years

05:05:00.800 --> 05:05:02.800
I want to Mac

05:05:02.800 --> 05:05:04.320
I like the

05:05:04.320 --> 05:05:06.320
Magic keyboard

05:05:06.320 --> 05:05:08.320
I like the

05:05:08.320 --> 05:05:09.520
Single monitor

05:05:09.520 --> 05:05:10.560
Apple makes an

05:05:10.560 --> 05:05:12.800
Awesome 6K 32 inch

05:05:12.800 --> 05:05:15.840
XDR screen that I've still haven't found anyone who beaten

05:05:15.840 --> 05:05:16.720
That I still use

05:05:16.720 --> 05:05:18.400
Even though I switched away from

05:05:18.400 --> 05:05:19.200
Apple computers

05:05:19.200 --> 05:05:21.120
I still use their monitor because it's just

05:05:21.120 --> 05:05:22.000
Fantastic

05:05:22.000 --> 05:05:24.720
But I've always been a single screen kind of guy

05:05:24.720 --> 05:05:25.920
I do like a big screen

05:05:25.920 --> 05:05:27.520
But I don't want multiple screens

05:05:27.520 --> 05:05:30.000
I've never found that that really works with my

05:05:30.720 --> 05:05:31.840
Perception

05:05:31.840 --> 05:05:34.080
I want to be able to just focus on a single thing

05:05:34.080 --> 05:05:35.840
I don't want all of it all over the place

05:05:35.840 --> 05:05:38.400
And I've always used multiple virtual desktops

05:05:38.400 --> 05:05:40.640
And be able to switch back and forth between those things

05:05:41.200 --> 05:05:43.200
But the setup I have today

05:05:43.200 --> 05:05:44.400
Is

05:05:44.400 --> 05:05:45.360
Linux

05:05:45.360 --> 05:05:47.360
I switched to a little over a year ago

05:05:47.360 --> 05:05:50.160
After I finally got fed up with Apple enough

05:05:50.160 --> 05:05:52.080
That I couldn't do that anymore

05:05:52.720 --> 05:05:54.560
And then I use

05:05:54.560 --> 05:05:58.000
This low profile mechanical keyboard

05:05:58.000 --> 05:05:59.920
Called the low free

05:05:59.920 --> 05:06:01.120
Flow

05:06:01.120 --> 05:06:02.720
84

05:06:02.720 --> 05:06:07.120
Which is just the most glorious sounding keyboard

05:06:07.120 --> 05:06:08.000
I've ever heard

05:06:08.000 --> 05:06:11.360
I know there are a lot of connoisseurs of mechanical keyboards

05:06:11.360 --> 05:06:12.800
They'll probably contest me on this

05:06:12.800 --> 05:06:15.840
This is too talky or too clicky or too clacky or

05:06:15.840 --> 05:06:17.840
Whatever but for me

05:06:17.840 --> 05:06:20.400
The low free flow

05:06:20.400 --> 05:06:22.160
84 is just

05:06:22.160 --> 05:06:23.280
At the light

05:06:23.280 --> 05:06:24.960
That I did not even know existed

05:06:24.960 --> 05:06:26.160
Which is so funny because

05:06:26.160 --> 05:06:27.760
I mean I've been programming for a long time

05:06:27.760 --> 05:06:30.240
Mechanical keyboards have been a thing

05:06:30.240 --> 05:06:31.040
For a long time

05:06:31.040 --> 05:06:32.560
And to keep what when you look at it like this

05:06:32.560 --> 05:06:33.440
It just kind of

05:06:33.440 --> 05:06:34.640
It looks plain

05:06:34.640 --> 05:06:36.240
It doesn't look extravagant

05:06:36.240 --> 05:06:37.200
But

05:06:37.200 --> 05:06:40.080
The tactile sensation you get out of

05:06:40.080 --> 05:06:40.880
Pushing those keys

05:06:40.880 --> 05:06:41.520
The

05:06:41.520 --> 05:06:42.640
The talky sound

05:06:42.640 --> 05:06:45.360
That you hear when the keys hit the board

05:06:45.360 --> 05:06:46.560
It's just sublime

05:06:46.560 --> 05:06:48.720
And I'm kicking myself

05:06:48.720 --> 05:06:50.560
That I was in this

05:06:50.560 --> 05:06:51.440
Mac

05:06:51.440 --> 05:06:52.000
Bubble

05:06:52.000 --> 05:06:53.200
For so long

05:06:53.440 --> 05:06:55.360
That I wasn't even in the market

05:06:55.360 --> 05:06:56.720
To find this

05:06:56.720 --> 05:06:57.280
I didn't

05:06:57.280 --> 05:06:59.200
I knew mechanical keyboards existed

05:06:59.200 --> 05:07:00.400
But to be blunt

05:07:00.400 --> 05:07:02.240
I thought it was a bit of a nerd thing

05:07:02.240 --> 05:07:03.440
That only

05:07:03.440 --> 05:07:05.440
Real nerds that were much more nerdy than me

05:07:05.440 --> 05:07:07.440
Whatever care about

05:07:07.600 --> 05:07:09.120
And then I got out of the Apple bubble

05:07:09.120 --> 05:07:10.800
And suddenly I had to find everything again

05:07:10.800 --> 05:07:11.920
I had to find a new mouse

05:07:11.920 --> 05:07:13.040
I had to find a new keyboard

05:07:13.040 --> 05:07:14.240
I had to find everything

05:07:14.240 --> 05:07:15.200
And I thought like all right

05:07:15.200 --> 05:07:16.960
Let me give mechanical keyboards a try

05:07:16.960 --> 05:07:19.040
And I gave quite a few of them a try

05:07:19.040 --> 05:07:21.360
The keycron is one of the big brands

05:07:21.360 --> 05:07:23.040
And that I didn't like that at all

05:07:23.040 --> 05:07:24.800
I tried a bunch of other keyboards

05:07:24.800 --> 05:07:26.560
And then I finally found this keyboard

05:07:26.560 --> 05:07:28.400
And I just went like

05:07:28.400 --> 05:07:29.760
Angels of singing

05:07:29.760 --> 05:07:31.200
Where have you been my whole life

05:07:31.200 --> 05:07:32.480
We spent as programmers

05:07:32.480 --> 05:07:33.600
So much of our time

05:07:33.600 --> 05:07:34.880
Interacting with those keys

05:07:34.880 --> 05:07:36.240
It really kind of matters

05:07:36.240 --> 05:07:37.680
In a way I didn't fully appreciate

05:07:37.680 --> 05:07:38.720
I used to

05:07:38.720 --> 05:07:39.680
Defend

05:07:39.680 --> 05:07:40.880
At the Apple

05:07:40.880 --> 05:07:41.680
Magic keyboard

05:07:41.680 --> 05:07:42.480
Like it's great

05:07:42.480 --> 05:07:43.360
It's actually a great keyboard

05:07:43.360 --> 05:07:44.480
And I think from what it is

05:07:44.480 --> 05:07:45.520
This ultra low

05:07:45.520 --> 05:07:47.120
Profile ultra low travel

05:07:47.120 --> 05:07:49.280
It's actually a really nice keyboard

05:07:49.280 --> 05:07:50.400
But once you tried

05:07:50.400 --> 05:07:51.600
A longer travel

05:07:51.600 --> 05:07:52.480
Mechanical keyboard

05:07:52.640 --> 05:07:54.320
There's no going back

05:07:54.320 --> 05:07:55.840
You do have to remember

05:07:55.840 --> 05:07:56.800
In many ways

05:07:56.800 --> 05:07:58.000
Both on the software side

05:07:58.000 --> 05:07:58.800
And the hardware side

05:07:58.800 --> 05:08:01.360
That you do spend a lot of hours

05:08:01.360 --> 05:08:01.760
Yes

05:08:01.760 --> 05:08:02.560
Behind the computer

05:08:02.560 --> 05:08:03.120
It's worth

05:08:03.120 --> 05:08:04.320
It's worth investing in

05:08:04.320 --> 05:08:06.000
And also worth exploring

05:08:06.000 --> 05:08:07.200
Until you find the thing

05:08:07.200 --> 05:08:08.720
Where the angels start singing

05:08:08.720 --> 05:08:09.200
Whatever

05:08:09.200 --> 05:08:10.000
That's exactly right

05:08:10.000 --> 05:08:12.720
And I actually do regret that a little bit

05:08:12.720 --> 05:08:14.480
Especially with this damn keyboard

05:08:14.480 --> 05:08:15.600
I think I could have been listening

05:08:15.600 --> 05:08:17.040
To these beautiful

05:08:17.040 --> 05:08:18.000
Falky keys

05:08:18.000 --> 05:08:19.040
For years and years

05:08:19.920 --> 05:08:21.680
But sometimes

05:08:21.680 --> 05:08:23.600
You have to get really pissed off

05:08:23.600 --> 05:08:24.880
Because you open your eyes

05:08:24.880 --> 05:08:26.400
And see that something else exists

05:08:26.400 --> 05:08:28.160
I feel the same way about Linux

05:08:28.160 --> 05:08:30.000
So I've been using Linux

05:08:30.000 --> 05:08:31.200
On the server

05:08:31.200 --> 05:08:32.800
Since

05:08:32.800 --> 05:08:33.680
Late 90s

05:08:33.680 --> 05:08:35.600
Probably if we ran servers on Linux

05:08:35.600 --> 05:08:36.240
Back then

05:08:36.240 --> 05:08:39.600
I never seriously considered it as a desktop option

05:08:39.600 --> 05:08:41.440
I never ran Linux before

05:08:41.440 --> 05:08:42.720
Directly myself

05:08:42.720 --> 05:08:43.600
I always thought

05:08:43.600 --> 05:08:44.560
Do you know what

05:08:44.560 --> 05:08:45.040
I just

05:08:45.040 --> 05:08:46.080
I want to focus on programming

05:08:46.080 --> 05:08:48.160
I don't have time for all these configuration files

05:08:48.160 --> 05:08:49.360
And all this setup bullshit

05:08:49.360 --> 05:08:50.160
And what not

05:08:50.160 --> 05:08:51.840
And Apple is close enough

05:08:51.840 --> 05:08:52.720
It's built on Unix

05:08:52.720 --> 05:08:53.920
Undependence

05:08:53.920 --> 05:08:55.680
Why do I need to bother with Linux

05:08:56.400 --> 05:08:58.320
And again it was one of those things

05:08:58.320 --> 05:08:59.120
I needed to

05:09:00.160 --> 05:09:01.920
Try new things

05:09:01.920 --> 05:09:03.600
And try something else to

05:09:05.200 --> 05:09:08.320
Realize that there is other things other than Apple

05:09:08.320 --> 05:09:09.760
And again it's not because I hate Apple

05:09:09.760 --> 05:09:11.360
I think they still make good computers

05:09:11.360 --> 05:09:13.360
I think a lot of the software

05:09:13.360 --> 05:09:15.200
Is still also pretty okay

05:09:15.200 --> 05:09:16.480
But I have come to realize

05:09:16.880 --> 05:09:18.000
As a web developer

05:09:18.000 --> 05:09:19.600
Linux is just better

05:09:19.600 --> 05:09:19.840
Yeah

05:09:19.840 --> 05:09:20.800
Linux is just better

05:09:20.800 --> 05:09:22.080
It's closer to

05:09:22.080 --> 05:09:23.280
What I deploy on

05:09:23.280 --> 05:09:25.600
The tooling is actually phenomenal

05:09:25.600 --> 05:09:27.760
And if you spend a bit of time setting it up

05:09:28.800 --> 05:09:29.840
You can record

05:09:30.560 --> 05:09:32.480
A reproducible environment

05:09:32.480 --> 05:09:33.280
That I've now done

05:09:33.280 --> 05:09:34.720
With this Omacube

05:09:34.720 --> 05:09:35.360
Concept

05:09:35.360 --> 05:09:37.040
Or a project that I've done

05:09:37.040 --> 05:09:39.040
That I can set up a new Linux machine

05:09:39.040 --> 05:09:40.640
In less than 30 minutes

05:09:40.640 --> 05:09:41.680
And it's perfect

05:09:41.680 --> 05:09:42.640
It's not pretty good

05:09:42.640 --> 05:09:44.400
It's not like I still need to spend two hours on

05:09:44.400 --> 05:09:45.200
It's perfect

05:09:45.200 --> 05:09:47.520
Because you can code all aspects of

05:09:47.520 --> 05:09:48.800
The development environment

05:09:48.800 --> 05:09:50.160
Into this

05:09:50.160 --> 05:09:51.440
And I didn't know

05:09:51.440 --> 05:09:52.960
I didn't even know

05:09:52.960 --> 05:09:53.840
To be fair

05:09:53.840 --> 05:09:56.320
That Linux could look as good as it can

05:09:56.320 --> 05:09:58.400
If you look at a stock of Ubuntu

05:09:58.400 --> 05:10:00.160
Or Fedora boot

05:10:00.160 --> 05:10:00.800
I mean

05:10:00.800 --> 05:10:01.840
Not that it's ugly

05:10:01.840 --> 05:10:04.560
But I'd pick the Mac in the day of the week

05:10:04.560 --> 05:10:05.520
You look at a

05:10:05.520 --> 05:10:06.560
You look at Omacube

05:10:06.560 --> 05:10:07.520
I mean I'm biased here

05:10:07.520 --> 05:10:09.360
Of course because I built it with my own sensibilities

05:10:09.360 --> 05:10:10.480
But I look at that and go like

05:10:10.480 --> 05:10:11.600
This is

05:10:11.600 --> 05:10:12.080
Better

05:10:12.080 --> 05:10:13.360
This is beautiful

05:10:13.440 --> 05:10:15.600
And then you look at some of those true Linux

05:10:15.600 --> 05:10:17.360
Ricing setups

05:10:17.360 --> 05:10:19.200
Where people go nuts with everything

05:10:19.200 --> 05:10:20.480
And you go

05:10:20.480 --> 05:10:21.120
Oh yeah

05:10:21.120 --> 05:10:23.840
I remember when computers used to be fun in this way

05:10:23.840 --> 05:10:25.680
When there was this individuality

05:10:25.680 --> 05:10:26.480
And this setup

05:10:26.480 --> 05:10:28.800
And it wasn't just all bland

05:10:28.800 --> 05:10:30.800
The sameness

05:10:30.800 --> 05:10:31.920
And I think that's the flip side

05:10:31.920 --> 05:10:33.440
Sometimes of something like Apple

05:10:33.440 --> 05:10:34.960
Where they have really strong opinions

05:10:34.960 --> 05:10:36.400
And they have really good opinions

05:10:36.400 --> 05:10:37.440
And they have very good taste

05:10:37.440 --> 05:10:38.640
And it looks very nice

05:10:38.640 --> 05:10:40.240
And it also looks totally the same

05:10:40.240 --> 05:10:42.160
And Linux has far more variety

05:10:42.160 --> 05:10:44.320
And far more texture and flavor

05:10:44.320 --> 05:10:45.840
Sometimes also annoyances

05:10:45.840 --> 05:10:47.360
And bugs and whatever

05:10:47.360 --> 05:10:49.280
But I run Linux now

05:10:49.280 --> 05:10:50.640
It's a Ubuntu base

05:10:50.640 --> 05:10:52.880
With the Omacube stuff on top

05:10:52.880 --> 05:10:54.400
The low-freak keyboard

05:10:54.400 --> 05:10:55.680
I use a

05:10:55.680 --> 05:10:56.640
Latchetek

05:10:56.640 --> 05:10:58.320
What's it called

05:10:58.320 --> 05:10:59.600
The MS3 mouse

05:11:00.480 --> 05:11:02.320
Which I love how it feels in my hand

05:11:02.320 --> 05:11:03.520
I don't love how it looks

05:11:03.520 --> 05:11:04.320
I actually

05:11:04.320 --> 05:11:05.600
Was a

05:11:05.600 --> 05:11:06.720
Magic mouse

05:11:06.720 --> 05:11:07.280
Stan

05:11:07.280 --> 05:11:08.080
For the longest time

05:11:08.080 --> 05:11:09.200
I thought it was genius

05:11:09.200 --> 05:11:11.520
That Apple integrated the trackpad

05:11:11.520 --> 05:11:12.400
Into a mouse

05:11:12.400 --> 05:11:13.680
And I used that

05:11:13.680 --> 05:11:15.120
And I always thought it was

05:11:15.120 --> 05:11:16.880
Ridiculous that people would slag it

05:11:16.880 --> 05:11:18.240
Just because you had to charge it

05:11:18.240 --> 05:11:19.440
By flipping it over

05:11:19.440 --> 05:11:21.760
Because the battery would last for three months

05:11:21.760 --> 05:11:23.520
And then you charge it for half an hour

05:11:23.520 --> 05:11:24.080
I felt like

05:11:24.080 --> 05:11:25.760
That was a perfect

05:11:25.760 --> 05:11:27.520
Compatibility with my sensibilities

05:11:27.520 --> 05:11:29.120
I don't mind giving up a little

05:11:29.120 --> 05:11:29.920
Inconvenience

05:11:29.920 --> 05:11:30.880
If something is beautiful

05:11:30.880 --> 05:11:32.160
And that magic mouse is beautiful

05:11:32.160 --> 05:11:32.800
But

05:11:32.800 --> 05:11:33.840
Wasn't going to work on Linux

05:11:33.840 --> 05:11:34.880
So I found something else

05:11:34.880 --> 05:11:36.560
The MS3 is nice

05:11:36.560 --> 05:11:37.680
But it sometimes do wish

05:11:37.680 --> 05:11:39.440
Like the magic mouse

05:11:39.440 --> 05:11:40.480
Is pretty good

05:11:40.560 --> 05:11:42.080
Yeah, Linux is really great

05:11:42.080 --> 05:11:43.280
For customizing everything

05:11:43.280 --> 05:11:44.320
For tiling

05:11:44.320 --> 05:11:45.040
For macos

05:11:45.040 --> 05:11:45.680
For all of that

05:11:45.680 --> 05:11:47.520
I also do the same in Windows

05:11:47.520 --> 05:11:49.120
With auto-hockey

05:11:49.120 --> 05:11:50.640
Or just customize the whole thing

05:11:50.640 --> 05:11:52.480
To your preferences

05:11:52.480 --> 05:11:53.680
If you're a developer

05:11:53.680 --> 05:11:54.480
You should learn

05:11:54.480 --> 05:11:56.480
How to control your environment with the keyboard

05:11:58.000 --> 05:11:58.640
It's just

05:11:58.640 --> 05:11:59.440
It's faster

05:11:59.440 --> 05:12:00.640
It's more fluid

05:12:00.640 --> 05:12:01.520
I think

05:12:01.520 --> 05:12:02.640
One of those silly things

05:12:02.640 --> 05:12:04.160
I've come to truly appreciate

05:12:04.160 --> 05:12:04.960
About my

05:12:04.960 --> 05:12:06.000
Omicoup setup

05:12:06.000 --> 05:12:07.120
Is that I can

05:12:07.120 --> 05:12:07.920
In

05:12:07.920 --> 05:12:10.000
Whatever time it takes to refresh the screen

05:12:10.000 --> 05:12:11.440
Probably five milliseconds

05:12:11.440 --> 05:12:13.680
Switch from one virtual desktop to another

05:12:14.640 --> 05:12:15.600
Even

05:12:15.600 --> 05:12:16.800
On Windows

05:12:16.800 --> 05:12:18.240
Can't get that smooth

05:12:18.240 --> 05:12:19.040
Get close

05:12:19.040 --> 05:12:20.400
Can't get that smooth

05:12:20.400 --> 05:12:22.160
On macOS

05:12:22.160 --> 05:12:23.360
For whatever reason

05:12:23.360 --> 05:12:25.520
Apple insists on having this

05:12:25.520 --> 05:12:27.440
Infuriating animation

05:12:27.440 --> 05:12:29.280
When you switch between virtual desktops

05:12:29.280 --> 05:12:31.280
Which makes it system you don't want to

05:12:31.280 --> 05:12:33.360
You don't want to run full screen apps

05:12:33.360 --> 05:12:34.560
Because it's too cumbersome

05:12:34.560 --> 05:12:36.400
To switch between the virtual desktops

05:12:36.400 --> 05:12:37.280
The kind of

05:12:37.280 --> 05:12:39.040
Immediately that you can get

05:12:39.040 --> 05:12:40.480
From

05:12:40.480 --> 05:12:41.520
A wonderful Linux setup

05:12:41.520 --> 05:12:43.040
In that regard it's just next level

05:12:43.040 --> 05:12:45.200
Yeah and it seems like a subtle thing

05:12:45.200 --> 05:12:45.840
But you know

05:12:45.840 --> 05:12:46.640
A difference of

05:12:46.640 --> 05:12:47.360
Millie seconds

05:12:47.360 --> 05:12:48.080
And latency

05:12:48.080 --> 05:12:49.440
Between switching

05:12:49.440 --> 05:12:51.680
The virtual desktops for example

05:12:51.680 --> 05:12:53.200
I don't know it changes

05:12:53.200 --> 05:12:54.720
It changes how you use the computer

05:12:54.720 --> 05:12:55.520
It really does

05:12:55.520 --> 05:12:56.800
Similar thing with VR right

05:12:56.800 --> 05:12:58.480
There if there's some kind of latency

05:12:58.480 --> 05:12:59.280
Or

05:12:59.280 --> 05:13:01.760
Like it just completely takes you out of it

05:13:01.760 --> 05:13:02.240
And it's funny

05:13:02.240 --> 05:13:03.440
I actually had to watch

05:13:03.440 --> 05:13:04.960
I think it was the

05:13:04.960 --> 05:13:06.320
Primogen on YouTube

05:13:06.320 --> 05:13:08.880
When he was showing off his setup

05:13:08.880 --> 05:13:11.920
And I was seeing how quickly he was switching between those virtual desktops

05:13:11.920 --> 05:13:14.000
And I'd always been using virtual desktops

05:13:14.000 --> 05:13:15.600
But I didn't like switching too much

05:13:15.600 --> 05:13:16.880
Because just of that latency

05:13:16.880 --> 05:13:17.360
And it's like

05:13:17.360 --> 05:13:18.960
Oh you can do that on Linux

05:13:18.960 --> 05:13:20.560
Oh that's pretty cool

05:13:20.560 --> 05:13:21.440
So I run that

05:13:21.440 --> 05:13:24.160
And then my editor of choice now is

05:13:24.160 --> 05:13:24.720
NeoVem

05:13:24.720 --> 05:13:25.280
Oh good

05:13:25.280 --> 05:13:27.680
All right well we're out of time

05:13:27.680 --> 05:13:29.680
All right you did for many many years

05:13:29.680 --> 05:13:31.200
You used what does it text me

05:13:31.200 --> 05:13:32.000
Yes

05:13:32.000 --> 05:13:32.960
Text mate

05:13:32.960 --> 05:13:33.760
That was actually

05:13:33.760 --> 05:13:35.600
That was the main block of moving away from Apple

05:13:36.480 --> 05:13:37.600
Everything else I thought

05:13:37.600 --> 05:13:39.040
You know what I can swing it

05:13:39.040 --> 05:13:40.880
But text mate was

05:13:41.680 --> 05:13:44.080
And is a wonderful editor

05:13:44.080 --> 05:13:46.720
One I helped birth into this world

05:13:47.440 --> 05:13:50.080
The programmer Alan Ugo

05:13:50.080 --> 05:13:51.360
Is a good friend of mine

05:13:51.360 --> 05:13:52.720
All the way back from those

05:13:52.720 --> 05:13:53.520
The party days

05:13:53.520 --> 05:13:55.520
When we were lugging our computers around

05:13:55.520 --> 05:13:57.200
And he was a big Mac guy

05:13:57.200 --> 05:13:58.000
And in

05:13:58.000 --> 05:14:00.560
In 2005 he was writing this editor

05:14:02.080 --> 05:14:03.360
And I helped him

05:14:03.360 --> 05:14:04.480
With the project management

05:14:04.480 --> 05:14:06.160
Of kind of keeping him on track

05:14:06.160 --> 05:14:07.760
He was only focused on getting something released

05:14:07.760 --> 05:14:09.600
Because I really wanted it for myself

05:14:10.240 --> 05:14:12.800
And I thought this was the last editor

05:14:12.800 --> 05:14:14.480
I thought I was never going to switch

05:14:14.480 --> 05:14:15.680
Forgive me for not knowing

05:14:15.680 --> 05:14:17.200
But how

05:14:17.200 --> 05:14:18.800
Featureful is this editor?

05:14:19.680 --> 05:14:20.560
It's quite featureful

05:14:20.560 --> 05:14:21.440
But it's

05:14:23.920 --> 05:14:26.480
A gooey driven editor in some regards

05:14:26.480 --> 05:14:28.240
It was really early on

05:14:28.240 --> 05:14:31.440
With ways of recording macros

05:14:31.440 --> 05:14:32.240
And having

05:14:33.280 --> 05:14:35.280
Sort of sophisticated syntax highlighting

05:14:35.360 --> 05:14:36.400
And it did a bunch of first

05:14:36.400 --> 05:14:40.000
And it was just a really pleasant editing experience

05:14:40.000 --> 05:14:41.280
I think these days

05:14:41.280 --> 05:14:43.680
A lot of people would just use VS code

05:14:43.680 --> 05:14:45.840
VS codes exist in the same universe

05:14:45.840 --> 05:14:47.840
As text mate in some ways

05:14:47.840 --> 05:14:49.520
And actually I think it's compatible

05:14:49.520 --> 05:14:51.680
With the original text mate bundles

05:14:51.680 --> 05:14:53.200
The original text mate format

05:14:53.200 --> 05:14:55.760
So it really trailed a path there

05:14:55.760 --> 05:14:57.280
But it also just

05:14:57.280 --> 05:14:58.480
Didn't evolve

05:14:58.480 --> 05:15:00.720
Now a lot of people saw a huge problem with that

05:15:00.720 --> 05:15:02.400
They were like oh it needs to have more features

05:15:02.400 --> 05:15:03.360
And you have all these things

05:15:03.360 --> 05:15:05.520
I was like I'm happy with this text editor

05:15:05.520 --> 05:15:06.880
That hasn't changed that all

05:15:06.880 --> 05:15:08.960
Basically when Alan stopped working on it

05:15:08.960 --> 05:15:10.480
For a decade or more

05:15:10.480 --> 05:15:11.920
I don't need anything else

05:15:12.480 --> 05:15:14.080
Because as our original discussion went

05:15:14.080 --> 05:15:15.760
I don't want an ID

05:15:15.760 --> 05:15:19.440
I don't want the editor to write code for me

05:15:19.440 --> 05:15:20.960
I want a text editor

05:15:20.960 --> 05:15:23.280
I want to interact with characters

05:15:23.280 --> 05:15:24.080
Directly

05:15:24.960 --> 05:15:28.080
And NeoVim allows me to do that

05:15:28.080 --> 05:15:30.160
In some ways that are even better than text mate

05:15:30.160 --> 05:15:31.200
And I love text mate

05:15:31.280 --> 05:15:34.160
But BI as you know

05:15:34.160 --> 05:15:35.920
Once you learn the commands

05:15:35.920 --> 05:15:36.800
And it sounds

05:15:36.800 --> 05:15:39.040
I sometimes feel like BI fans overplay

05:15:39.040 --> 05:15:40.400
How difficult it is to learn

05:15:40.400 --> 05:15:43.200
Because it makes them perhaps seem kind of

05:15:43.200 --> 05:15:45.600
More awesome that they were able to do it

05:15:45.600 --> 05:15:47.120
It's not that difficult

05:15:47.120 --> 05:15:49.360
And it doesn't take that long in my opinion

05:15:49.360 --> 05:15:51.360
To learn just enough combo moves

05:15:52.400 --> 05:15:54.720
To get that high of holy shit

05:15:54.720 --> 05:15:56.320
I could not do this in any other edit

05:15:56.320 --> 05:15:57.280
How long did it take you

05:15:57.280 --> 05:15:58.480
And by the way I don't know

05:15:58.480 --> 05:15:59.840
I'm still a haven yet

05:15:59.840 --> 05:16:01.280
Or I know intellectually

05:16:01.280 --> 05:16:02.720
But just like with kids I haven't

05:16:04.560 --> 05:16:06.240
I haven't gone in

05:16:06.240 --> 05:16:08.000
All the way and I haven't used them

05:16:08.000 --> 05:16:10.080
You have a treat in mind

05:16:10.080 --> 05:16:12.000
Well I switched in about

05:16:12.640 --> 05:16:14.480
I had three days when I switched here

05:16:14.480 --> 05:16:15.200
About a year ago

05:16:15.200 --> 05:16:16.880
I had three days of cursing

05:16:16.880 --> 05:16:19.040
Where I thought it was absolutely terrible

05:16:19.040 --> 05:16:20.400
And it was never going to happen

05:16:20.400 --> 05:16:22.320
And I had three days of annoyance

05:16:22.320 --> 05:16:23.680
And already the next week

05:16:23.680 --> 05:16:24.720
I was like this is sweet

05:16:24.720 --> 05:16:25.760
I'm not going anywhere

05:16:25.760 --> 05:16:26.560
Oh well

05:16:26.560 --> 05:16:28.160
But I also had a bit of a head start

05:16:28.480 --> 05:16:30.960
About 20 years ago in the early 2000s

05:16:30.960 --> 05:16:33.120
I tried them for like a summer

05:16:34.240 --> 05:16:36.000
And it didn't stick

05:16:36.000 --> 05:16:38.160
I didn't for whatever reason love it at the time

05:16:38.160 --> 05:16:39.840
But NeoVim is really good

05:16:39.840 --> 05:16:41.440
The key to NeoVim

05:16:41.440 --> 05:16:43.040
Is to realize that you don't have to build

05:16:43.040 --> 05:16:44.400
The whole damn editor yourself

05:16:44.400 --> 05:16:45.680
So a lot of NeoVim stands

05:16:45.680 --> 05:16:47.360
They're like here's how to write the

05:16:47.360 --> 05:16:48.960
Config from scratch

05:16:48.960 --> 05:16:50.640
Over 17 episodes

05:16:50.640 --> 05:16:52.160
That's going to take you three weeks

05:16:52.160 --> 05:16:54.240
I don't care that much

05:16:54.240 --> 05:16:55.360
I love a great editor

05:16:55.360 --> 05:16:57.120
I love to tailor it a little bit

05:16:57.120 --> 05:16:58.000
But not that much

05:16:58.240 --> 05:16:59.600
So you have to pair

05:16:59.600 --> 05:17:00.400
NeoVim

05:17:00.400 --> 05:17:02.400
With this thing called LazyVim

05:17:03.120 --> 05:17:04.640
LazyVim.org

05:17:04.640 --> 05:17:06.400
Is a distribution

05:17:06.400 --> 05:17:07.440
For NeoVim

05:17:07.440 --> 05:17:08.880
That takes all the drudgery

05:17:08.880 --> 05:17:11.280
Out of getting an amazing editor

05:17:11.280 --> 05:17:12.720
Experience right out of the box

05:17:14.080 --> 05:17:15.040
Ridiculous question

05:17:15.040 --> 05:17:16.880
We talked about a bunch of programming languages

05:17:17.840 --> 05:17:19.520
You told us how much you love JavaScript

05:17:19.520 --> 05:17:21.600
It's your second favorite programming language

05:17:23.600 --> 05:17:25.520
With TypeScript be the third

05:17:25.520 --> 05:17:26.160
Then

05:17:26.160 --> 05:17:26.800
TypeScript

05:17:26.880 --> 05:17:28.960
Wouldn't even be in this universe

05:17:28.960 --> 05:17:32.240
I hate TypeScript as much as I like JavaScript

05:17:32.240 --> 05:17:33.360
So what

05:17:33.360 --> 05:17:34.640
You hate

05:17:34.640 --> 05:17:37.600
Oh man, I'm not smart enough to understand the math of that

05:17:37.600 --> 05:17:38.640
Okay

05:17:38.640 --> 05:17:40.880
Before I ask about other programming languages

05:17:40.880 --> 05:17:42.080
What's

05:17:42.080 --> 05:17:43.840
If you can encapsulate

05:17:43.840 --> 05:17:46.240
Your hatred of TypeScript

05:17:46.240 --> 05:17:48.480
Into something that could be human interpretable

05:17:48.480 --> 05:17:50.160
What would be the reasoning

05:17:50.160 --> 05:17:51.680
The JavaScript

05:17:51.680 --> 05:17:53.360
Smiles a lot like Ruby

05:17:53.360 --> 05:17:54.720
When it comes to

05:17:54.800 --> 05:17:57.040
Some aspects of its meta programming

05:17:57.040 --> 05:17:59.120
And TypeScript just complicates that

05:17:59.120 --> 05:18:01.280
To an infuriating degree

05:18:01.280 --> 05:18:03.520
When you're trying to write that kind of code

05:18:03.520 --> 05:18:06.480
And even when you're trying to write the normal kind of code

05:18:06.480 --> 05:18:09.040
None of the benefits that accrue to people who like it

05:18:09.040 --> 05:18:10.560
Like auto completion

05:18:10.560 --> 05:18:11.840
Is something I care about

05:18:11.840 --> 05:18:13.680
I don't care about auto completion

05:18:13.680 --> 05:18:15.120
Because I'm not using an IDE

05:18:15.120 --> 05:18:16.480
Now I understand

05:18:16.480 --> 05:18:18.480
That that is part of what separates it

05:18:18.480 --> 05:18:20.000
And why

05:18:20.000 --> 05:18:21.120
I don't see the benefits

05:18:21.120 --> 05:18:22.400
I only see the costs

05:18:22.400 --> 05:18:23.680
I see the extra typing

05:18:23.680 --> 05:18:25.200
I see the

05:18:25.200 --> 05:18:27.840
Type gymnastics that you sometimes have to do

05:18:27.840 --> 05:18:29.840
And were a bunch of people give up

05:18:29.840 --> 05:18:31.040
And just do any

05:18:31.040 --> 05:18:31.840
Instead, right?

05:18:31.840 --> 05:18:33.920
Like that they don't actually use the type system

05:18:33.920 --> 05:18:35.680
Because it's just too frustrating to use

05:18:35.680 --> 05:18:36.800
So

05:18:36.800 --> 05:18:39.440
I've ever only felt the frustration of TypeScript

05:18:39.440 --> 05:18:42.240
And the obfuscation of TypeScript

05:18:42.240 --> 05:18:43.840
In the code

05:18:43.840 --> 05:18:45.120
That

05:18:45.120 --> 05:18:46.240
Gave me no payoff

05:18:46.240 --> 05:18:48.480
Again, I understand that there is a payoff

05:18:48.480 --> 05:18:50.000
I don't want the payoff

05:18:50.000 --> 05:18:51.680
So for my situation

05:18:51.680 --> 05:18:53.360
I'm not willing to make the trade

05:18:53.360 --> 05:18:55.360
And I'm not willing to take

05:18:55.360 --> 05:18:57.680
A language that's underneath

05:18:57.680 --> 05:18:59.520
Is as dynamic

05:18:59.520 --> 05:19:01.680
Of a language as rubious

05:19:01.680 --> 05:19:03.120
And then turn it into this

05:19:03.120 --> 05:19:04.880
Pretend static type language

05:19:04.880 --> 05:19:06.640
I find that just

05:19:06.640 --> 05:19:07.840
Intellectually insulting

05:19:07.840 --> 05:19:08.880
Do you think it will

05:19:08.880 --> 05:19:10.400
And do you think it should die

05:19:10.400 --> 05:19:11.680
TypeScript

05:19:11.680 --> 05:19:14.240
I don't want to take something away from people who enjoy it

05:19:14.240 --> 05:19:15.760
So if you like TypeScript

05:19:15.760 --> 05:19:16.960
All the most part of you

05:19:16.960 --> 05:19:18.160
If you're using TypeScript

05:19:18.160 --> 05:19:22.080
Because you think that's what a professional program is supposed to do

05:19:22.080 --> 05:19:23.120
Here's my permission

05:19:23.120 --> 05:19:24.400
You don't have to use TypeScript

05:19:24.400 --> 05:19:27.600
There's something deeply enjoyable about

05:19:28.720 --> 05:19:29.680
A brilliant program

05:19:29.680 --> 05:19:30.560
Or such as yourself

05:19:31.280 --> 05:19:32.960
DHH talking shit

05:19:32.960 --> 05:19:35.440
It's just like one of my favorite things in life

05:19:36.560 --> 05:19:38.880
What are the top three programming languages

05:19:38.880 --> 05:19:39.840
Everyone should learn

05:19:39.840 --> 05:19:41.440
If you're talking about beginner

05:19:41.440 --> 05:19:43.680
I would 100% start with Ruby

05:19:43.680 --> 05:19:46.080
It is magic for beginners

05:19:46.080 --> 05:19:48.320
In terms of just understanding the core concepts

05:19:48.320 --> 05:19:50.480
Of conditionals and loops

05:19:50.480 --> 05:19:50.880
And whatever

05:19:50.880 --> 05:19:52.640
Because it makes it so easy

05:19:52.640 --> 05:19:54.240
Even if you're just making a

05:19:54.240 --> 05:19:55.200
Shell program that's

05:19:55.200 --> 05:19:56.960
Outputing to the terminal

05:19:57.680 --> 05:19:59.520
Getting hello world running

05:19:59.520 --> 05:20:01.280
In Ruby is basically

05:20:01.280 --> 05:20:02.080
Puts

05:20:02.080 --> 05:20:03.280
P-U-T-S

05:20:03.280 --> 05:20:03.680
Space

05:20:04.560 --> 05:20:05.520
Start quotes

05:20:05.520 --> 05:20:07.520
Hello world and quotes you've done

05:20:07.520 --> 05:20:09.280
Right, there's no fluff

05:20:09.280 --> 05:20:10.720
There's nothing to wrap it into

05:20:10.720 --> 05:20:12.240
There are other languages that does that

05:20:12.240 --> 05:20:13.120
Especially in the

05:20:13.120 --> 05:20:14.640
Pearl or Python would be

05:20:15.440 --> 05:20:16.240
Rather similar

05:20:16.240 --> 05:20:17.600
But go would not

05:20:17.600 --> 05:20:18.480
Java would not

05:20:18.480 --> 05:20:19.840
There's a lot of other languages

05:20:19.840 --> 05:20:21.600
That have a lot more ceremony

05:20:21.600 --> 05:20:23.600
And boilerplate Ruby has none of it

05:20:23.600 --> 05:20:25.120
So it's a wonderful

05:20:25.120 --> 05:20:26.000
Starting language

05:20:26.000 --> 05:20:27.840
There's a book called

05:20:27.840 --> 05:20:29.040
Learned to program

05:20:29.040 --> 05:20:30.080
By

05:20:30.080 --> 05:20:30.800
Pine

05:20:30.800 --> 05:20:31.760
That uses Ruby

05:20:31.760 --> 05:20:34.000
Essentially to just teach basic programming

05:20:34.000 --> 05:20:35.120
Principles

05:20:35.120 --> 05:20:36.320
That I've seen heavily

05:20:36.320 --> 05:20:36.880
Recommended

05:20:36.880 --> 05:20:38.000
So that's a great language

05:20:38.000 --> 05:20:39.600
How quickly would you go to Rails

05:20:39.600 --> 05:20:40.640
It depends on what you want to do

05:20:40.640 --> 05:20:42.240
If you want to build web applications

05:20:42.240 --> 05:20:43.280
Go to Rails right away

05:20:43.280 --> 05:20:44.960
Learn Ruby along with Rails

05:20:44.960 --> 05:20:45.680
Because

05:20:45.680 --> 05:20:47.760
I think what really helps

05:20:47.760 --> 05:20:49.520
Power through learning programming

05:20:49.520 --> 05:20:51.920
Is to build programs that you want

05:20:51.920 --> 05:20:54.000
Right, if you're just learning it in the abstract

05:20:54.000 --> 05:20:56.480
It's difficult to motivate yourself to actually do it

05:20:56.480 --> 05:20:57.360
While some people

05:20:57.360 --> 05:20:58.960
Learn languages just for the fun of them

05:20:59.840 --> 05:21:00.800
Most people do not

05:21:00.800 --> 05:21:03.600
Most people learn it because they have a mission

05:21:03.600 --> 05:21:04.960
They want to build a program

05:21:04.960 --> 05:21:06.000
They want to become a programmer

05:21:06.000 --> 05:21:07.680
So you got to use it for something real

05:21:07.680 --> 05:21:10.320
And actually find it's easier to learn programming that way too

05:21:10.320 --> 05:21:12.640
Because it drives your learning process

05:21:12.640 --> 05:21:14.800
You can't just learn the whole thing up front

05:21:14.800 --> 05:21:17.360
You can't just sit down and read the language specification

05:21:17.360 --> 05:21:17.920
Then you're like

05:21:18.800 --> 05:21:20.400
Like Neo

05:21:20.400 --> 05:21:21.520
Now I know Kung Fu

05:21:21.520 --> 05:21:22.560
Now I know Ruby

05:21:22.560 --> 05:21:24.000
It doesn't download that way

05:21:24.000 --> 05:21:25.680
You actually have to type it out

05:21:25.680 --> 05:21:26.560
In anger

05:21:26.560 --> 05:21:27.360
On a real program

05:21:28.240 --> 05:21:29.200
Yeah

05:21:29.200 --> 05:21:29.600
Yeah

05:21:29.600 --> 05:21:30.000
For sure

05:21:30.000 --> 05:21:30.960
So I would start there

05:21:30.960 --> 05:21:31.920
But then number two

05:21:31.920 --> 05:21:33.360
I probably would be JavaScript

05:21:33.360 --> 05:21:35.920
Because JavaScript just is language

05:21:35.920 --> 05:21:37.280
You need to know

05:21:37.280 --> 05:21:38.960
If you want to work with the web

05:21:38.960 --> 05:21:40.320
And the web is the greatest

05:21:40.320 --> 05:21:42.160
Application platform of all time

05:21:42.160 --> 05:21:43.200
If you're making

05:21:43.200 --> 05:21:44.560
Business software

05:21:44.560 --> 05:21:45.840
Collaboration software

05:21:45.840 --> 05:21:46.960
All this kind of stuff

05:21:46.960 --> 05:21:47.920
If you're making video games

05:21:47.920 --> 05:21:48.720
You should probably go off

05:21:48.720 --> 05:21:50.720
Learn C++ or C

05:21:50.720 --> 05:21:51.760
Or something else like that

05:21:51.760 --> 05:21:54.800
But if you're in the realm of web applications

05:21:54.800 --> 05:21:56.160
You got to learn JavaScript

05:21:56.160 --> 05:21:57.360
Regardless of what else you learn

05:21:57.360 --> 05:21:58.400
You got to learn JavaScript

05:21:58.400 --> 05:21:59.680
So if you're learning Ruby

05:22:00.640 --> 05:22:02.560
What does Ruby not have

05:22:02.560 --> 05:22:04.400
In terms of programming concepts

05:22:06.240 --> 05:22:08.240
That you would need other languages for

05:22:08.880 --> 05:22:10.720
I don't know if there's any concepts missing

05:22:10.720 --> 05:22:12.960
But it doesn't have the speed

05:22:12.960 --> 05:22:15.440
Or the low level access

05:22:15.840 --> 05:22:17.120
Memory manipulation

05:22:17.120 --> 05:22:18.640
That you would need to build

05:22:18.640 --> 05:22:20.000
A 3D gaming engine

05:22:20.000 --> 05:22:20.400
For example

05:22:20.400 --> 05:22:22.080
No one's going to build that in Ruby

05:22:22.080 --> 05:22:23.600
You can build

05:22:23.600 --> 05:22:24.480
Quite low level stuff

05:22:24.480 --> 05:22:27.040
When it comes to web technologies

05:22:27.040 --> 05:22:28.240
In Ruby

05:22:28.240 --> 05:22:29.280
But at some point

05:22:29.280 --> 05:22:30.960
You're going to hit the limit

05:22:30.960 --> 05:22:32.320
And you should do something else

05:22:32.320 --> 05:22:33.520
I'm not someone who prescribed

05:22:33.520 --> 05:22:34.880
Just Ruby for everything

05:22:34.880 --> 05:22:37.600
Just once you reach the level of abstraction

05:22:37.600 --> 05:22:39.520
That's involved with web applications

05:22:39.520 --> 05:22:41.760
Ruby is superb

05:22:41.760 --> 05:22:43.600
But if you're writing for example

05:22:43.840 --> 05:22:46.320
HTTP proxy

05:22:46.320 --> 05:22:46.800
Go

05:22:46.800 --> 05:22:47.760
It's great for that

05:22:47.760 --> 05:22:50.160
We've written quite a few HTTP proxies lately

05:22:50.160 --> 05:22:52.320
At the company for various reasons

05:22:52.320 --> 05:22:54.480
Including our cloud exit and so forth

05:22:54.480 --> 05:22:55.600
And Kevin

05:22:55.600 --> 05:22:56.880
One of the programs I'm working with

05:22:56.880 --> 05:22:58.160
He writes all of that and go

05:22:58.160 --> 05:22:59.680
Go just have the primitives

05:22:59.680 --> 05:23:01.200
And it has the pace and the speed

05:23:01.200 --> 05:23:02.640
To do that really well

05:23:03.600 --> 05:23:05.200
I highly recommend it

05:23:05.200 --> 05:23:07.680
If you're writing an HTTP general proxy

05:23:07.680 --> 05:23:08.400
Do it and go

05:23:08.400 --> 05:23:09.440
Great language for that

05:23:09.440 --> 05:23:11.280
Don't write your business logic

05:23:11.280 --> 05:23:12.480
I know people do

05:23:12.480 --> 05:23:14.480
But I don't see the point in that

05:23:14.480 --> 05:23:15.760
So what would you say they're three

05:23:15.760 --> 05:23:16.960
So go Ruby

05:23:16.960 --> 05:23:18.240
Plus Rails

05:23:18.240 --> 05:23:19.280
JavaScript

05:23:19.280 --> 05:23:20.160
Yeah if you're

05:23:20.160 --> 05:23:21.920
Will or interested in working with the web

05:23:21.920 --> 05:23:23.280
I'd probably pick those three

05:23:23.280 --> 05:23:25.120
Go Ruby and JavaScript

05:23:25.120 --> 05:23:26.320
Go Ruby and JavaScript

05:23:26.320 --> 05:23:26.880
Okay

05:23:26.880 --> 05:23:27.920
Functional languages

05:23:27.920 --> 05:23:29.200
Someone's talking about OCaml

05:23:29.200 --> 05:23:30.160
There's always

05:23:30.160 --> 05:23:32.560
They are always going to show up

05:23:32.560 --> 05:23:33.360
They're always

05:23:33.360 --> 05:23:34.800
It must be some kind of

05:23:36.560 --> 05:23:38.000
OCaml industrial complex

05:23:38.000 --> 05:23:38.800
Or something like this

05:23:38.800 --> 05:23:41.040
But they always say mention OCaml

05:23:41.120 --> 05:23:43.120
I love that there are people

05:23:43.120 --> 05:23:46.160
Love functional languages to that degree

05:23:46.160 --> 05:23:47.280
Those people are not me

05:23:47.280 --> 05:23:48.480
I don't care at all

05:23:48.480 --> 05:23:50.640
I care about functional

05:23:50.640 --> 05:23:52.800
Principles when they help me

05:23:52.800 --> 05:23:54.240
In these isolated cases

05:23:54.240 --> 05:23:55.520
Where that's just better than everything else

05:23:55.520 --> 05:23:56.640
But at heart

05:23:56.640 --> 05:23:59.040
I'm an object-oriented guy

05:23:59.040 --> 05:24:00.640
That's just how I think about programs

05:24:00.640 --> 05:24:02.320
That's how I like to think about programs

05:24:02.320 --> 05:24:03.840
That's how I carve up

05:24:03.840 --> 05:24:05.520
A big problem space

05:24:05.520 --> 05:24:06.720
Into a domain language

05:24:07.760 --> 05:24:10.400
Objects are my jam

05:24:10.400 --> 05:24:11.120
Yeah, me too

05:24:11.120 --> 05:24:13.040
So I program a list per bunch

05:24:13.040 --> 05:24:14.800
For like AI applications

05:24:14.800 --> 05:24:16.720
For basic

05:24:16.720 --> 05:24:18.640
So I'll tell OHS engines

05:24:18.640 --> 05:24:19.440
That kind of stuff

05:24:19.440 --> 05:24:21.280
And I just try OCaml

05:24:21.280 --> 05:24:22.640
Just to force myself

05:24:22.640 --> 05:24:25.120
To program just a very basic game of life

05:24:25.120 --> 05:24:26.640
A little simulation

05:24:26.640 --> 05:24:28.960
It's much

05:24:28.960 --> 05:24:30.400
You know, a list

05:24:30.400 --> 05:24:31.920
Is just parentheses everywhere

05:24:31.920 --> 05:24:34.160
It's actually not readable at all

05:24:34.160 --> 05:24:36.720
That's my path with a list

05:24:36.720 --> 05:24:38.560
OCaml is very intuitive

05:24:38.560 --> 05:24:39.360
Very readable

05:24:39.440 --> 05:24:40.400
That's nice

05:24:40.400 --> 05:24:42.880
I really should pick up a language like that at some point

05:24:42.880 --> 05:24:43.920
I've been programming long enough

05:24:43.920 --> 05:24:44.800
That it's a little embarrassing

05:24:44.800 --> 05:24:45.920
That I haven't actually

05:24:45.920 --> 05:24:47.760
Done anything real and anger

05:24:47.760 --> 05:24:50.080
In a fully functionally programming language

05:24:50.080 --> 05:24:52.560
Yeah, but like I have to figure out

05:24:52.560 --> 05:24:54.320
I'm sure there's an answer to this

05:24:54.320 --> 05:24:56.480
What can I do though be useful for me

05:24:57.280 --> 05:24:58.480
Like that I actually want to build

05:24:58.480 --> 05:24:59.440
Yes

05:24:59.440 --> 05:25:00.240
That's my problem

05:25:00.240 --> 05:25:03.040
That a functional language is better suited for

05:25:03.040 --> 05:25:03.520
That's right

05:25:03.520 --> 05:25:05.760
Because I really want to experience the language properly

05:25:05.760 --> 05:25:06.400
That's right

05:25:06.400 --> 05:25:07.280
Yeah, because I'm still

05:25:07.280 --> 05:25:08.960
Yeah, I'm very at this point

05:25:08.960 --> 05:25:10.480
A very object oriented

05:25:10.480 --> 05:25:11.360
Brained

05:25:11.360 --> 05:25:12.320
Yes

05:25:12.320 --> 05:25:13.360
And that's my problem too

05:25:13.360 --> 05:25:14.000
I just

05:25:14.000 --> 05:25:17.520
I don't care as much about these low-level problems

05:25:17.520 --> 05:25:18.480
In computer science

05:25:18.480 --> 05:25:19.520
I care about the high level

05:25:19.520 --> 05:25:21.360
I care about writing software

05:25:21.360 --> 05:25:22.240
I care about the

05:25:24.160 --> 05:25:25.440
abstraction layer

05:25:25.440 --> 05:25:27.360
That really floats well

05:25:27.360 --> 05:25:29.360
With web applications and business logic

05:25:29.360 --> 05:25:29.840
And I just

05:25:29.840 --> 05:25:31.440
I've come to accept that about myself

05:25:31.440 --> 05:25:32.160
Even though

05:25:32.160 --> 05:25:33.040
As we talked about

05:25:33.040 --> 05:25:34.080
When I was a kid

05:25:34.080 --> 05:25:36.320
I really wanted to become a games programmer

05:25:36.320 --> 05:25:37.680
And then I saw what it took

05:25:37.680 --> 05:25:39.760
To write a collision detection engine

05:25:39.760 --> 05:25:41.360
And I go like, yeah, that's not me at all

05:25:41.360 --> 05:25:42.880
I'm never going to be into

05:25:42.880 --> 05:25:44.400
vector matrix

05:25:44.400 --> 05:25:45.440
manipulation

05:25:45.440 --> 05:25:47.040
Or any of that stuff

05:25:47.040 --> 05:25:48.720
It's way too much math

05:25:49.440 --> 05:25:52.320
And I'm more of a writing person

05:25:52.320 --> 05:25:54.320
Than I'm a math person

05:25:54.320 --> 05:25:57.120
I mean, you're just in the way you were speaking today

05:25:57.120 --> 05:25:58.320
You have like a

05:25:58.320 --> 05:26:00.480
poetic literary

05:26:00.480 --> 05:26:01.680
Approached

05:26:01.680 --> 05:26:02.880
Programming

05:26:02.880 --> 05:26:03.760
Yes

05:26:03.760 --> 05:26:05.280
Yeah, that's exactly right

05:26:05.280 --> 05:26:06.400
So I did actually

05:26:06.400 --> 05:26:09.200
A keynote at RailsConf 10 years ago

05:26:10.160 --> 05:26:12.240
Where I call myself a software writer

05:26:12.240 --> 05:26:13.680
I mean, I'm not the first person to say that

05:26:13.680 --> 05:26:16.480
Software writer has been in the vernacular for a long time

05:26:16.480 --> 05:26:18.960
But the modern

05:26:18.960 --> 05:26:21.600
Identity that most programmers adopt

05:26:21.600 --> 05:26:23.120
When they're trying to be serious

05:26:23.120 --> 05:26:24.960
Is software engineer

05:26:24.960 --> 05:26:26.080
And I reject that label

05:26:26.080 --> 05:26:27.520
I'm not an engineer

05:26:27.520 --> 05:26:30.480
Occasionally I dabble in some engineering

05:26:30.480 --> 05:26:32.080
But the vast majority of the time

05:26:32.080 --> 05:26:33.440
I'm a software writer

05:26:33.440 --> 05:26:35.760
I write software

05:26:35.760 --> 05:26:37.280
For human consumption

05:26:37.280 --> 05:26:38.560
And for my own delight

05:26:40.560 --> 05:26:41.760
I can get away with that

05:26:41.760 --> 05:26:44.720
Because I'm working in a high level language like Ruby

05:26:44.720 --> 05:26:46.800
Working on collaboration software

05:26:46.800 --> 05:26:48.800
And to do lists and all the other stuff

05:26:48.800 --> 05:26:50.320
Again, if I was trying to apply

05:26:50.320 --> 05:26:53.600
My talent to writing 3D game engines

05:26:55.280 --> 05:26:57.120
No, that's not the right mindset

05:26:57.120 --> 05:26:58.560
That's not the right identity

05:26:58.560 --> 05:27:01.760
But I find that the software engineering

05:27:01.760 --> 05:27:04.320
Identity flattens thing a little bit

05:27:04.320 --> 05:27:06.240
I'd like to think that we have software writers

05:27:06.240 --> 05:27:07.840
And software mathematicians

05:27:07.840 --> 05:27:08.720
For example

05:27:08.720 --> 05:27:10.640
And then those are actually richer

05:27:10.640 --> 05:27:13.040
Ways of describing the abstraction level

05:27:13.040 --> 05:27:14.320
That you're working at

05:27:14.320 --> 05:27:16.320
Than engineer

05:27:16.320 --> 05:27:18.080
Yeah, and I think

05:27:18.080 --> 05:27:20.560
If AI becomes more and more successful

05:27:21.440 --> 05:27:24.960
I think we'll need software writer skill

05:27:25.760 --> 05:27:26.960
More and more

05:27:26.960 --> 05:27:29.680
Because it feels like that's the realm of which

05:27:30.320 --> 05:27:31.520
Because it's not writer

05:27:32.560 --> 05:27:34.800
You're going to have to do the software

05:27:34.800 --> 05:27:37.600
You're going to have to be a computer person

05:27:37.600 --> 05:27:39.120
But there's a more

05:27:40.080 --> 05:27:40.960
I don't know

05:27:40.960 --> 05:27:42.640
I just don't want to romanticize it

05:27:42.640 --> 05:27:43.600
But it's more poetic

05:27:43.600 --> 05:27:44.640
It's more literary

05:27:44.640 --> 05:27:46.320
It's more feels like writing it

05:27:46.320 --> 05:27:48.000
A good blog post than

05:27:48.000 --> 05:27:50.320
I actually wish that AI

05:27:50.320 --> 05:27:52.560
Had a bit higher standards for writing

05:27:52.560 --> 05:27:55.200
I find the fact that it accepts my

05:27:55.200 --> 05:27:57.200
Slobby incomplete sentences

05:27:57.200 --> 05:27:58.400
A little offensive

05:27:58.480 --> 05:28:01.040
I wish there was like a strict mode for AI

05:28:01.040 --> 05:28:02.560
Where it would snap my fingers

05:28:02.560 --> 05:28:05.520
It was just feeding in keywords

05:28:05.520 --> 05:28:07.360
And like, speak proper

05:28:07.360 --> 05:28:08.400
Do pronunciation

05:28:08.400 --> 05:28:09.520
Do punctuation

05:28:10.800 --> 05:28:12.240
Because I love that

05:28:12.240 --> 05:28:13.920
I love crafting

05:28:14.880 --> 05:28:16.640
At just write sentence

05:28:16.640 --> 05:28:18.720
That hasn't been boiled down

05:28:18.720 --> 05:28:20.240
That it has no meat on it

05:28:20.240 --> 05:28:22.560
Has no character in it

05:28:22.560 --> 05:28:23.840
It's succinct

05:28:23.840 --> 05:28:25.520
It's not overly flowery

05:28:25.520 --> 05:28:26.640
It's just write that

05:28:27.600 --> 05:28:28.880
Writing phase

05:28:28.880 --> 05:28:30.320
To me

05:28:30.320 --> 05:28:31.920
Is just addictive

05:28:31.920 --> 05:28:33.440
And I find that

05:28:33.440 --> 05:28:35.200
When programming is the best

05:28:35.200 --> 05:28:36.400
It's almost equivalent

05:28:36.400 --> 05:28:37.360
Exactly to that

05:28:38.000 --> 05:28:39.280
You also have to solve a problem

05:28:39.280 --> 05:28:40.880
You're not just communicating a solution

05:28:40.880 --> 05:28:42.160
You have to actually figure out

05:28:42.160 --> 05:28:43.040
What are you trying to say

05:28:43.040 --> 05:28:44.160
But

05:28:44.160 --> 05:28:45.280
Even writing has that

05:28:45.280 --> 05:28:46.480
Half the time when I start

05:28:47.120 --> 05:28:48.240
Writing a blog post

05:28:48.240 --> 05:28:50.720
I don't know exactly which arguments I'm going to use

05:28:50.720 --> 05:28:53.120
They develop as part of the writing process

05:28:53.120 --> 05:28:55.200
And that's how writing software

05:28:55.280 --> 05:28:56.400
Happens to you

05:28:56.400 --> 05:28:58.720
Know roughly the kind of problem you're trying to solve

05:28:58.720 --> 05:29:01.440
You know exactly how you're going to solve it

05:29:01.440 --> 05:29:02.880
And actually start typing

05:29:02.880 --> 05:29:04.000
The solution emerges

05:29:04.880 --> 05:29:06.720
Actually as far as I understand

05:29:06.720 --> 05:29:08.400
You're in Jason working on a new book

05:29:09.280 --> 05:29:11.600
It's in the early days of that kind of topic

05:29:11.600 --> 05:29:12.880
I think he said is some

05:29:14.000 --> 05:29:15.920
He tweeted that it's going to be titled

05:29:15.920 --> 05:29:16.960
Something like

05:29:16.960 --> 05:29:18.320
We don't know what we're doing

05:29:18.320 --> 05:29:19.520
Up front or something

05:29:19.520 --> 05:29:20.720
That that kind of topic

05:29:20.720 --> 05:29:22.320
And you figure out along the way

05:29:22.320 --> 05:29:23.360
That's a big part of it

05:29:24.160 --> 05:29:26.400
Trying to give more people the permission

05:29:26.400 --> 05:29:29.120
To trust during instincts in their own gut

05:29:29.120 --> 05:29:30.800
And realizing that

05:29:31.760 --> 05:29:32.560
Developing

05:29:33.440 --> 05:29:35.200
That supercomputer in your stomach

05:29:35.920 --> 05:29:38.080
Is actually the work of a career

05:29:38.080 --> 05:29:40.800
And that you should not discard

05:29:40.800 --> 05:29:42.480
Those feelings in

05:29:43.440 --> 05:29:44.960
Preference to over

05:29:46.640 --> 05:29:48.320
Com- or not even complicated

05:29:48.320 --> 05:29:49.120
To analytics

05:29:49.120 --> 05:29:50.480
To intellectualism

05:29:50.480 --> 05:29:52.560
Very often when we look at the

05:29:52.640 --> 05:29:53.920
Big decisions we've had to make

05:29:54.800 --> 05:29:56.080
They've come from the gut

05:29:56.080 --> 05:29:57.360
Where you cannot fully articulate

05:29:57.360 --> 05:29:59.280
Like why do I think this is the right thing

05:29:59.280 --> 05:30:01.520
Well because I've been in this business for 20 years

05:30:01.520 --> 05:30:02.480
And I've seen a bunch of things

05:30:02.480 --> 05:30:04.240
And I've talked up to a bunch of people

05:30:04.240 --> 05:30:06.960
And that is percolating into this being the right answer

05:30:08.480 --> 05:30:09.520
A lot of people

05:30:09.520 --> 05:30:11.280
Are very skeptical about that in business

05:30:11.280 --> 05:30:12.400
Or unable to trust it

05:30:12.400 --> 05:30:14.240
Because it feels like they can't rationalize

05:30:14.240 --> 05:30:15.280
Why are we doing something

05:30:15.280 --> 05:30:16.560
Well because I feel like it

05:30:16.560 --> 05:30:17.760
Damn it

05:30:17.760 --> 05:30:19.920
That's a great privilege of being

05:30:20.560 --> 05:30:22.160
A bootstrapped independent founder

05:30:22.320 --> 05:30:24.480
Who don't oh their business to someone else

05:30:24.480 --> 05:30:25.760
And doesn't have to produce a return

05:30:25.760 --> 05:30:27.680
Because I feel like a lot of the bullshit

05:30:27.680 --> 05:30:29.680
Really creeps in when you're trying to rationalize

05:30:29.680 --> 05:30:30.880
To other people

05:30:30.880 --> 05:30:32.640
Why you do the things you do

05:30:32.640 --> 05:30:34.640
And why you take the decisions that you do

05:30:34.640 --> 05:30:37.440
If you don't have anyone to answer to

05:30:37.440 --> 05:30:39.520
You are free to follow your gut

05:30:39.520 --> 05:30:40.000
And

05:30:41.200 --> 05:30:41.840
That's

05:30:42.960 --> 05:30:44.960
Hell of enjoyable way to work

05:30:44.960 --> 05:30:46.160
And it's also

05:30:46.160 --> 05:30:48.480
In very often the correct way to work

05:30:48.480 --> 05:30:49.920
Your gut knows a lot

05:30:49.920 --> 05:30:51.040
Like you can't articulate it

05:30:51.040 --> 05:30:52.720
But it's spot on

05:30:52.720 --> 05:30:53.920
More times than not

05:30:53.920 --> 05:30:56.560
Having to make a plan can't be a paralyzing thing

05:30:56.560 --> 05:30:57.840
I've often

05:30:57.840 --> 05:30:59.520
I mean I suppose there's different kinds of brain

05:30:59.520 --> 05:31:00.240
The first of all

05:31:00.240 --> 05:31:02.480
I can't wait to read that book

05:31:02.480 --> 05:31:03.760
If it materializes

05:31:05.760 --> 05:31:08.160
They I often feel like

05:31:08.160 --> 05:31:09.200
In the more

05:31:09.200 --> 05:31:11.200
In the more interesting things I do in my life

05:31:11.200 --> 05:31:13.200
I really don't know what I'm doing up

05:31:13.200 --> 05:31:14.240
Up front

05:31:14.240 --> 05:31:16.640
And I think there's a lot of people around me

05:31:16.640 --> 05:31:18.320
I care for me

05:31:18.320 --> 05:31:20.640
They really want me to know what I'm doing

05:31:20.720 --> 05:31:21.760
They're like what's the plan

05:31:21.760 --> 05:31:24.480
What's the why are you doing this crazy thing

05:31:24.480 --> 05:31:26.960
And I if I if I had to wait until I have a plan

05:31:26.960 --> 05:31:28.240
I'm not going to do it

05:31:28.240 --> 05:31:30.480
Like people they have different brains

05:31:30.480 --> 05:31:31.440
On this kind of stuff

05:31:31.440 --> 05:31:33.600
Some people really are planners

05:31:33.600 --> 05:31:35.120
And it maybe energizes them

05:31:35.760 --> 05:31:38.240
I think most creative pursuits

05:31:38.240 --> 05:31:39.360
Most really interesting

05:31:39.360 --> 05:31:41.040
Most novel pursuits are like

05:31:42.320 --> 05:31:43.840
Kind of have to just take the leap

05:31:43.840 --> 05:31:45.680
And then just figure out as you go

05:31:45.680 --> 05:31:48.240
My favorite essay in rework

05:31:48.240 --> 05:31:49.840
Is the last one

05:31:49.840 --> 05:31:52.480
And it's entitled Inspiration is Perishable

05:31:53.200 --> 05:31:54.880
And I think that captures a lot of it

05:31:54.880 --> 05:31:57.680
That if you take the time

05:31:57.680 --> 05:31:59.120
To do a detailed plan

05:31:59.120 --> 05:32:00.960
You may very well have lost the inspiration

05:32:00.960 --> 05:32:02.160
By the time you're done

05:32:02.160 --> 05:32:03.520
If you follow the inspiration

05:32:03.520 --> 05:32:05.040
In that moment

05:32:05.040 --> 05:32:06.560
And trust your gut

05:32:06.560 --> 05:32:08.400
Trust your own competence

05:32:08.400 --> 05:32:09.600
That you will figure it out

05:32:10.720 --> 05:32:12.000
You're going to get so much more back

05:32:12.000 --> 05:32:13.840
You're going to go on the adventure

05:32:13.840 --> 05:32:14.880
You otherwise wouldn't have

05:32:14.880 --> 05:32:16.480
Whether that's just a business decision

05:32:16.480 --> 05:32:17.760
Or a life decision

05:32:17.760 --> 05:32:20.960
You have to seize that inspiration

05:32:20.960 --> 05:32:23.760
There's a great set of children's books

05:32:23.760 --> 05:32:26.240
Written by this Japanese author

05:32:26.240 --> 05:32:28.640
About chasing an idea

05:32:28.640 --> 05:32:29.920
And trying to get a hold of it

05:32:29.920 --> 05:32:32.080
And it's beautifully illustrated

05:32:32.080 --> 05:32:32.880
As an idea

05:32:32.880 --> 05:32:34.640
Something that's floating around

05:32:34.640 --> 05:32:36.080
As something you have to catch

05:32:36.080 --> 05:32:37.760
And latch onto

05:32:37.760 --> 05:32:38.640
That I really feel

05:32:38.640 --> 05:32:39.840
Catchers this notion that

05:32:39.840 --> 05:32:40.880
Inspiration is perishable

05:32:40.880 --> 05:32:41.920
It'll disappear

05:32:41.920 --> 05:32:44.080
If you just put it back on the shelf

05:32:44.080 --> 05:32:44.560
And say like

05:32:44.560 --> 05:32:46.880
Well, I got to be diligent about this

05:32:46.880 --> 05:32:48.400
I got to line up a plan

05:32:48.400 --> 05:32:49.360
You may run out

05:32:49.360 --> 05:32:50.720
And then there's no

05:32:50.720 --> 05:32:52.000
There's no steam to keep going

05:32:53.760 --> 05:32:55.360
I have to ask about open source

05:32:56.640 --> 05:32:57.440
What does it take

05:32:58.480 --> 05:33:00.720
To run a successful open source project

05:33:00.720 --> 05:33:02.320
You've spoken about

05:33:02.320 --> 05:33:03.520
That it's a misconception

05:33:03.520 --> 05:33:05.760
That open source is democratic

05:33:05.760 --> 05:33:07.840
It's actually meritocratic

05:33:08.880 --> 05:33:11.040
That's a beautiful way to put it

05:33:11.040 --> 05:33:13.440
So there's often is a kind of

05:33:13.440 --> 05:33:15.120
A benevolent dictator at the top

05:33:16.080 --> 05:33:17.440
Often

05:33:17.440 --> 05:33:18.800
So can you just speak to that

05:33:18.800 --> 05:33:21.360
Having run a successful open source

05:33:21.360 --> 05:33:22.640
Projects yourself

05:33:22.640 --> 05:33:25.040
And being a benevolent dictator yourself

05:33:26.000 --> 05:33:27.440
Which is going to be a bit of a

05:33:27.440 --> 05:33:29.600
Bias piece of evidence here

05:33:29.600 --> 05:33:31.040
But

05:33:31.040 --> 05:33:33.040
Why is it just great

05:33:33.040 --> 05:33:34.400
You should definitely have dictators

05:33:34.400 --> 05:33:35.600
And they should control everything

05:33:35.600 --> 05:33:37.600
Especially when the dictators meet

05:33:37.600 --> 05:33:38.400
Now, well

05:33:38.400 --> 05:33:40.640
I think I learned very early on

05:33:40.640 --> 05:33:43.120
That a quick way to burn out

05:33:43.200 --> 05:33:45.200
In open source is to treat it

05:33:45.200 --> 05:33:46.400
As

05:33:46.400 --> 05:33:47.360
A business

05:33:47.360 --> 05:33:49.520
As though your users are customers

05:33:49.520 --> 05:33:51.200
As though they have claims

05:33:51.200 --> 05:33:52.960
Of legitimacy on your time

05:33:52.960 --> 05:33:54.400
And your attention

05:33:54.400 --> 05:33:56.240
And your direction

05:33:56.240 --> 05:33:57.440
Because I faced this

05:33:57.440 --> 05:33:58.960
Almost immediately

05:33:58.960 --> 05:34:00.000
With Ruby and Rails

05:34:00.000 --> 05:34:01.680
As soon as it was released

05:34:01.680 --> 05:34:02.800
There were a million people

05:34:02.800 --> 05:34:04.400
Who had all sorts of opinions

05:34:04.400 --> 05:34:06.400
About where I ought to take it

05:34:06.400 --> 05:34:07.680
And not just opinions

05:34:07.680 --> 05:34:09.200
But actually demands

05:34:09.200 --> 05:34:10.480
Unless you implement

05:34:10.480 --> 05:34:12.160
An oracle database adapt

05:34:12.160 --> 05:34:14.160
This is always going to be a toy

05:34:15.520 --> 05:34:17.200
It was actually more or less that exact

05:34:17.840 --> 05:34:18.640
Demand

05:34:18.640 --> 05:34:20.480
That prompted me to have a slide

05:34:20.480 --> 05:34:22.160
At one of the early

05:34:22.160 --> 05:34:23.520
Rails conferences

05:34:23.520 --> 05:34:24.720
That just said

05:34:24.720 --> 05:34:26.000
Fuck you

05:34:26.000 --> 05:34:27.280
Yeah, I saw that

05:34:27.280 --> 05:34:29.520
I'm not going to do what you tell me to

05:34:29.520 --> 05:34:31.840
I'm here as a bringer of gift

05:34:31.840 --> 05:34:33.680
I am sharing

05:34:33.680 --> 05:34:35.360
Code that I wrote

05:34:35.360 --> 05:34:36.720
On my own time

05:34:36.720 --> 05:34:37.920
On my own volition

05:34:38.720 --> 05:34:40.800
And you don't have to say thank you

05:34:40.880 --> 05:34:42.480
I mean be nice if you did

05:34:42.480 --> 05:34:44.800
You can take the code and do whatever you want with it

05:34:44.800 --> 05:34:46.960
You can contribute back if you want

05:34:46.960 --> 05:34:48.640
But you can't tell me what to do

05:34:48.640 --> 05:34:50.320
Or where to go or how to act

05:34:51.120 --> 05:34:52.880
I'm not a vendor

05:34:52.880 --> 05:34:55.120
This is a fundamental misconception

05:34:55.120 --> 05:34:57.200
That uses of open source occasionally

05:34:57.200 --> 05:35:00.000
Step into it because they're used to buying software

05:35:00.000 --> 05:35:03.200
From companies who really care about

05:35:03.200 --> 05:35:04.640
Their business

05:35:04.640 --> 05:35:06.560
I care about people using my software

05:35:06.560 --> 05:35:08.160
I think it's great

05:35:08.160 --> 05:35:10.000
But we don't have a transactional

05:35:10.000 --> 05:35:11.520
Relationship

05:35:11.520 --> 05:35:13.360
I don't get something back

05:35:13.360 --> 05:35:15.120
When you tell me what to do

05:35:15.120 --> 05:35:16.400
Except grief

05:35:16.400 --> 05:35:17.360
And I don't want it

05:35:17.360 --> 05:35:18.800
So you can keep it

05:35:18.800 --> 05:35:21.760
So my open source philosophy from the start has been

05:35:22.480 --> 05:35:24.080
I got to do this

05:35:24.080 --> 05:35:25.600
Primarily for me

05:35:25.600 --> 05:35:27.440
I love when other people

05:35:27.440 --> 05:35:28.720
Find use in my open source

05:35:28.720 --> 05:35:30.320
It's not my primary motivation

05:35:30.320 --> 05:35:32.320
I'm not primarily doing it for other people

05:35:32.320 --> 05:35:33.760
I'm primarily doing it for me

05:35:33.760 --> 05:35:34.880
And my own objectives

05:35:35.600 --> 05:35:37.440
Because um

05:35:37.440 --> 05:35:38.800
As Adam Smith said

05:35:38.800 --> 05:35:41.520
It's not for the benevolence of the butcher

05:35:41.520 --> 05:35:43.760
That we expect our daily meat

05:35:43.760 --> 05:35:46.000
It's for his self-interest

05:35:46.000 --> 05:35:49.120
And I actually find that to be a beautiful thought

05:35:49.120 --> 05:35:52.240
That our comments increase in value

05:35:52.240 --> 05:35:54.640
When we all pursue our self-interest

05:35:54.640 --> 05:35:56.880
Certainly in the realm of open source

05:35:56.880 --> 05:35:58.800
This is also why I reject this notion

05:35:58.800 --> 05:36:01.280
That open sources in some sort of crisis

05:36:01.280 --> 05:36:03.280
That there's a funding crisis

05:36:03.280 --> 05:36:04.560
That we have to spend more

05:36:04.560 --> 05:36:05.440
No you we don't

05:36:05.440 --> 05:36:07.040
Open source has never been doing better

05:36:07.040 --> 05:36:10.160
Open source has never controlled more domains in software

05:36:10.160 --> 05:36:11.920
Than it has right now

05:36:11.920 --> 05:36:14.080
There is no crisis

05:36:14.080 --> 05:36:16.000
There's a misconception

05:36:16.000 --> 05:36:17.600
From some people making open source

05:36:17.600 --> 05:36:19.680
And from a lot of people using open source

05:36:19.680 --> 05:36:23.360
That open source is primarily like commercial software

05:36:23.360 --> 05:36:24.400
Something you buy

05:36:24.400 --> 05:36:25.440
And something

05:36:25.440 --> 05:36:27.200
Where you can then make demands

05:36:27.200 --> 05:36:28.240
As a customer

05:36:28.240 --> 05:36:29.840
And that the customer is always right

05:36:29.840 --> 05:36:31.360
Customers not always right

05:36:31.360 --> 05:36:32.800
Not even in business

05:36:32.800 --> 05:36:35.280
But certainly not in open source

05:36:35.360 --> 05:36:37.600
In open source the customer as it is

05:36:37.600 --> 05:36:39.840
Is a receiver of gifts

05:36:39.840 --> 05:36:42.320
We are having a gift exchange

05:36:42.320 --> 05:36:44.240
I show up and give you my code

05:36:44.240 --> 05:36:46.080
If you like it you can use it

05:36:46.080 --> 05:36:48.880
And if you have some code that fits in

05:36:48.880 --> 05:36:50.480
With where I'm going with this

05:36:50.480 --> 05:36:52.560
I would love to get those gifts back

05:36:52.560 --> 05:36:54.640
And we can keep trading like that

05:36:54.640 --> 05:36:55.520
I give you more gifts

05:36:55.520 --> 05:36:57.120
You give me some of your gifts

05:36:57.120 --> 05:36:58.720
Together we pull all the gifts

05:36:58.720 --> 05:37:00.640
That's that someone showing a brand new

05:37:00.640 --> 05:37:03.040
Just get a mountain of gifts

05:37:03.040 --> 05:37:04.720
This is the magic thing of open source

05:37:05.680 --> 05:37:08.560
Increases the total some value of what's in the comments

05:37:08.560 --> 05:37:10.400
When we all pursue our own self-interest

05:37:10.400 --> 05:37:13.360
So I'm building things for rails that I need

05:37:13.360 --> 05:37:14.240
And you know what?

05:37:14.240 --> 05:37:15.520
You want me to do that

05:37:15.520 --> 05:37:17.040
You do not want me to build things

05:37:17.040 --> 05:37:18.960
That I don't need on behalf of other people

05:37:18.960 --> 05:37:20.160
Because I'll do a crap job

05:37:20.960 --> 05:37:21.760
I do

05:37:21.760 --> 05:37:23.120
I build much better software

05:37:23.120 --> 05:37:27.040
When I can evaluate the quality of that software

05:37:27.040 --> 05:37:27.840
By my own use

05:37:28.640 --> 05:37:29.520
I have to

05:37:29.520 --> 05:37:30.960
I need this feature

05:37:30.960 --> 05:37:32.640
I'm going to build a good version of that feature

05:37:32.720 --> 05:37:34.640
And I'm going to be just enough just for me

05:37:34.640 --> 05:37:36.160
So I'm not going to blow it

05:37:36.160 --> 05:37:38.480
I'm not trying to attract the customer here

05:37:38.480 --> 05:37:40.560
I'm not trying to see some angle

05:37:40.560 --> 05:37:42.080
I'm just building what I need

05:37:42.880 --> 05:37:46.560
And if you go into open source with that mentality

05:37:46.560 --> 05:37:48.080
That you're building for you

05:37:48.080 --> 05:37:50.080
And everything else is a bonus

05:37:50.400 --> 05:37:51.440
I think

05:37:51.440 --> 05:37:53.680
You have all the ingredients to go to distance

05:37:53.680 --> 05:37:56.160
I think the people who burn out in open source

05:37:56.160 --> 05:37:58.240
Is when they go in thinking

05:37:58.240 --> 05:37:59.760
I'm making all these gifts

05:37:59.760 --> 05:38:01.120
I don't really need them myself

05:38:01.120 --> 05:38:02.560
But I'm like hoping someone else does

05:38:02.560 --> 05:38:04.160
And maybe they'll also give me some money

05:38:04.880 --> 05:38:06.640
That's a losing proposition

05:38:06.640 --> 05:38:08.400
It never basically works

05:38:08.400 --> 05:38:10.160
If you want money for your software

05:38:10.160 --> 05:38:11.360
You should just sell it

05:38:11.360 --> 05:38:13.200
We have a perfectly fine model

05:38:13.200 --> 05:38:14.720
Of commercial software

05:38:14.720 --> 05:38:16.160
That people can make that kind

05:38:16.160 --> 05:38:17.200
And then they can sell it

05:38:17.200 --> 05:38:18.320
But I find a lot of

05:38:20.400 --> 05:38:21.280
Confusion

05:38:21.280 --> 05:38:22.800
Let's just call that politely

05:38:22.800 --> 05:38:24.160
In open source contributors

05:38:24.160 --> 05:38:26.000
Who want to have their cake need to

05:38:26.000 --> 05:38:26.800
They like the

05:38:27.680 --> 05:38:29.040
Mode of working with open source

05:38:29.040 --> 05:38:30.400
They maybe even like the status

05:38:30.400 --> 05:38:31.440
That comes from open source

05:38:31.440 --> 05:38:33.200
But they also would like to earn a living

05:38:33.200 --> 05:38:34.400
For making that open source

05:38:35.200 --> 05:38:36.240
And therefore they

05:38:36.240 --> 05:38:38.160
Occasionally end up with the kind of

05:38:38.880 --> 05:38:39.920
Grievances

05:38:39.920 --> 05:38:41.920
That someone who feels under-appreciated

05:38:41.920 --> 05:38:43.440
Or work will develop

05:38:43.440 --> 05:38:46.880
When others aren't doing enough to recognize their great gifts

05:38:46.880 --> 05:38:48.880
And then they might walk away

05:38:48.880 --> 05:38:50.320
I wish I had one of the

05:38:51.200 --> 05:38:54.080
I wish I had more insight into their mind state

05:38:54.080 --> 05:38:54.960
Of the individual

05:38:55.840 --> 05:38:57.680
People that are running these projects

05:38:57.760 --> 05:38:59.040
Like if they're feeling sad

05:38:59.040 --> 05:39:00.400
Or they need more money

05:39:00.400 --> 05:39:01.120
Or they're

05:39:01.920 --> 05:39:04.160
It's just such a dark box

05:39:04.160 --> 05:39:05.120
It can be

05:39:05.120 --> 05:39:06.880
I mean of course there's some communication

05:39:06.880 --> 05:39:08.400
But I just

05:39:08.400 --> 05:39:09.840
I just sadly see too often

05:39:09.840 --> 05:39:11.440
They just kind of walk away

05:39:11.440 --> 05:39:12.080
Right

05:39:12.080 --> 05:39:13.040
And I think

05:39:13.040 --> 05:39:13.920
That's actually

05:39:13.920 --> 05:39:15.840
So part of the beauty of open source

05:39:15.840 --> 05:39:16.240
This one

05:39:16.240 --> 05:39:19.040
You are not obligated to do this code

05:39:19.040 --> 05:39:19.760
Forever

05:39:19.760 --> 05:39:21.360
You're obligated to do this

05:39:21.360 --> 05:39:22.880
For as long as you want to do it

05:39:22.880 --> 05:39:24.240
That's basically your own obligation

05:39:24.240 --> 05:39:25.040
But there is

05:39:25.040 --> 05:39:25.520
I know

05:39:26.320 --> 05:39:28.320
Okay, so you might criticize this and push back

05:39:28.320 --> 05:39:30.480
You did write a blog post on forever

05:39:30.480 --> 05:39:32.480
Until the end of the internet with $10

05:39:33.520 --> 05:39:35.520
There is a beautiful aspect

05:39:36.240 --> 05:39:37.920
And you found a good balance there

05:39:39.520 --> 05:39:40.240
But I don't know

05:39:40.240 --> 05:39:43.200
You're bringing so much joy to people with this thing you created

05:39:44.240 --> 05:39:45.360
It's not an obligation

05:39:45.360 --> 05:39:46.800
But there's a real beauty

05:39:46.800 --> 05:39:48.880
To taking care of this thing you've created

05:39:48.880 --> 05:39:49.200
There is

05:39:49.200 --> 05:39:50.400
And not forgetting

05:39:50.400 --> 05:39:50.880
I think we

05:39:52.000 --> 05:39:55.200
I think what the open source creator is not seeing enough

05:39:55.280 --> 05:39:56.080
I mean there's like

05:39:58.960 --> 05:40:01.680
How many lives you're making better

05:40:01.680 --> 05:40:03.120
There's certain pieces of software

05:40:03.120 --> 05:40:05.040
That I just quietly use a lot

05:40:05.040 --> 05:40:05.200
Yes

05:40:06.080 --> 05:40:08.560
And like they bring my life joy

05:40:08.560 --> 05:40:10.560
And I wish I could communicate that well

05:40:11.360 --> 05:40:12.560
There's ways to donate

05:40:12.560 --> 05:40:13.760
But it's inefficient

05:40:13.760 --> 05:40:15.440
It's usually hard to donate

05:40:15.920 --> 05:40:16.800
It is

05:40:16.800 --> 05:40:18.880
There's some ways

05:40:18.880 --> 05:40:20.320
For some people that made it easier

05:40:20.320 --> 05:40:21.280
Get up donations

05:40:21.280 --> 05:40:22.080
This one way of doing it

05:40:22.080 --> 05:40:23.280
I donate to a few people

05:40:23.280 --> 05:40:23.920
Even though

05:40:24.000 --> 05:40:25.040
I don't

05:40:25.040 --> 05:40:26.160
Love the paradigm

05:40:26.160 --> 05:40:28.240
I also accept that we can have multiple paradigms

05:40:28.240 --> 05:40:31.040
I can accept that I can do open source from one set of motivations

05:40:31.040 --> 05:40:31.840
And other people can do

05:40:32.560 --> 05:40:34.080
Open source for other motivations

05:40:34.080 --> 05:40:36.400
We don't all have to do it the same way

05:40:36.400 --> 05:40:38.800
But I do want to counter the misconception

05:40:38.800 --> 05:40:41.280
That open source is somehow in its crisis

05:40:41.280 --> 05:40:43.680
Unless we all start paying for open source

05:40:43.680 --> 05:40:45.200
That model already exists

05:40:45.200 --> 05:40:46.320
It's commercial software

05:40:46.320 --> 05:40:47.520
It works very well

05:40:47.520 --> 05:40:50.720
And plenty of great companies have been built off the back of it

05:40:50.720 --> 05:40:52.560
And the expectations are very clear

05:40:52.640 --> 05:40:54.240
I pay you this amount

05:40:54.240 --> 05:40:55.680
And I get this software

05:40:55.680 --> 05:40:57.920
Open source once you start mixing money into it

05:40:57.920 --> 05:40:59.760
Gets real money real fast

05:40:59.760 --> 05:41:01.200
And a lot of it is just

05:41:01.200 --> 05:41:03.600
From those misaligned expectations

05:41:03.600 --> 05:41:05.200
That if you feel like

05:41:05.200 --> 05:41:06.720
You're starving artists

05:41:06.720 --> 05:41:08.240
As an open source developer

05:41:08.240 --> 05:41:09.360
And you are owed

05:41:10.320 --> 05:41:11.520
X amount of money

05:41:11.520 --> 05:41:13.360
Because your software is popular

05:41:14.080 --> 05:41:15.360
You're delusional

05:41:15.360 --> 05:41:17.360
And you need to knock that off

05:41:17.360 --> 05:41:18.720
Just get back on track

05:41:18.720 --> 05:41:21.360
Where you realize that you're putting gifts into the world

05:41:21.840 --> 05:41:24.560
If you get something back in terms of monetary competition

05:41:24.560 --> 05:41:26.160
Okay, that's a bonus

05:41:26.160 --> 05:41:27.760
But if you need that money back

05:41:27.760 --> 05:41:29.360
In terms of monetary competition

05:41:29.360 --> 05:41:30.480
Just charge for software

05:41:30.480 --> 05:41:32.480
Or go work for a software company

05:41:32.480 --> 05:41:33.760
That will employ you to open

05:41:33.760 --> 05:41:34.400
Do open source

05:41:34.400 --> 05:41:35.120
There's tons of that

05:41:35.120 --> 05:41:36.880
That is probably actually

05:41:36.880 --> 05:41:38.000
The primary mode

05:41:38.000 --> 05:41:38.960
That open source software

05:41:38.960 --> 05:41:40.880
Is being developed in the world today

05:41:40.880 --> 05:41:42.080
Commercial companies

05:41:43.120 --> 05:41:43.760
Making open source

05:41:43.760 --> 05:41:44.720
That they need themselves

05:41:44.720 --> 05:41:46.160
And then contributing it back

05:41:46.160 --> 05:41:47.360
So I'm glad you brought

05:41:47.360 --> 05:41:49.200
Sort of like drew some hard lines here

05:41:49.200 --> 05:41:50.400
It's a good moment to bring up

05:41:51.360 --> 05:41:52.960
What I think is

05:41:52.960 --> 05:41:54.160
The

05:41:54.160 --> 05:41:59.040
Maybe one of the greatest open source projects ever

05:41:59.040 --> 05:42:00.800
WordPress

05:42:00.800 --> 05:42:02.800
And

05:42:02.800 --> 05:42:05.280
You spoke up in October

05:42:05.280 --> 05:42:07.280
24

05:42:07.280 --> 05:42:09.760
About some of the stuff that's been going on

05:42:09.760 --> 05:42:11.280
With the WordPress's founder

05:42:11.280 --> 05:42:12.160
Matt Molllewig

05:42:12.160 --> 05:42:13.520
In a blog post

05:42:13.520 --> 05:42:16.480
Open source royalty and mad kings

05:42:16.480 --> 05:42:17.680
It's a really good blog post

05:42:18.640 --> 05:42:19.680
Sort of just the idea of

05:42:19.680 --> 05:42:21.520
Benevolent dictated for life

05:42:21.520 --> 05:42:24.080
This model for open source projects

05:42:24.080 --> 05:42:25.760
And then the basic implication

05:42:25.760 --> 05:42:27.600
Was that

05:42:27.600 --> 05:42:29.680
Matt as the BDFL of WordPress

05:42:29.680 --> 05:42:31.200
Has lost his way a bit

05:42:31.200 --> 05:42:32.480
With his battle

05:42:32.480 --> 05:42:34.080
With WP engine

05:42:35.600 --> 05:42:37.120
So I should also say that

05:42:37.120 --> 05:42:38.560
I really love WordPress

05:42:38.560 --> 05:42:39.520
It brings me joy

05:42:39.520 --> 05:42:41.680
I think it's a really

05:42:41.680 --> 05:42:44.240
It's a beacon of what open source could be

05:42:45.200 --> 05:42:47.920
I think it's made the internet better

05:42:48.880 --> 05:42:51.520
A lot a lot of people to create wonderful websites

05:42:52.400 --> 05:42:53.600
And I also think

05:42:53.600 --> 05:42:54.800
Now you might disagree with this

05:42:54.800 --> 05:42:56.320
But from everything I've seen

05:42:58.160 --> 05:43:00.240
WP engine

05:43:00.240 --> 05:43:01.680
Just gives me bad vibes

05:43:03.520 --> 05:43:05.200
I think they're not a good

05:43:05.200 --> 05:43:06.720
The good guy in this

05:43:06.720 --> 05:43:08.000
I don't like it

05:43:08.000 --> 05:43:09.600
I understand the frustration

05:43:10.480 --> 05:43:11.520
I understand all of it

05:43:11.520 --> 05:43:13.760
But I don't think that excuses the behavior

05:43:14.560 --> 05:43:15.360
There is a bit of

05:43:15.360 --> 05:43:16.640
See this kind of

05:43:16.640 --> 05:43:19.040
Counter just a little bit what you said

05:43:19.040 --> 05:43:20.000
Which is

05:43:20.000 --> 05:43:23.120
When you have an open source project of that size

05:43:23.120 --> 05:43:24.400
There is a bit of it

05:43:24.400 --> 05:43:25.520
Like when you're the king

05:43:27.360 --> 05:43:29.120
That for a project

05:43:30.400 --> 05:43:31.920
Of a kingdom that large

05:43:31.920 --> 05:43:33.520
There's a bit of responsibility

05:43:33.520 --> 05:43:34.880
Anyway, could you speak to your

05:43:36.480 --> 05:43:37.680
Maybe to your empathy

05:43:38.720 --> 05:43:39.760
Of Matt and

05:43:40.640 --> 05:43:42.640
To your criticism

05:43:42.640 --> 05:43:43.280
And what

05:43:44.640 --> 05:43:45.680
And maybe

05:43:46.400 --> 05:43:47.440
Pain to path of

05:43:48.560 --> 05:43:49.440
How

05:43:49.440 --> 05:43:51.760
He and WordPress can be winning again

05:43:52.560 --> 05:43:54.880
First the echo would you say about

05:43:55.600 --> 05:43:57.200
What a wonderful thing it is

05:43:57.200 --> 05:43:58.480
That WordPress exists

05:43:58.480 --> 05:44:00.400
There are not many projects

05:44:00.400 --> 05:44:01.520
In the open source world

05:44:01.520 --> 05:44:02.800
Or in the world at large

05:44:02.800 --> 05:44:04.720
That has had as big of an impact

05:44:04.720 --> 05:44:05.680
On the internet

05:44:05.680 --> 05:44:06.640
As WordPress has

05:44:07.200 --> 05:44:09.520
He deserves a ton of

05:44:09.520 --> 05:44:11.520
Accolades for that work

05:44:11.520 --> 05:44:13.680
So that was my engagement

05:44:13.680 --> 05:44:15.280
Essentially my premise

05:44:15.280 --> 05:44:17.360
Do you know what I had tremendous respect

05:44:17.360 --> 05:44:19.280
Respect for what Matt has built

05:44:19.280 --> 05:44:20.080
With WordPress

05:44:20.080 --> 05:44:23.280
With that entire ecosystem has built around itself

05:44:23.840 --> 05:44:24.880
It's a true marvel

05:44:25.680 --> 05:44:26.480
But

05:44:26.480 --> 05:44:28.960
There's some principles that are larger than my

05:44:28.960 --> 05:44:31.360
Personal sympathies to the characters involved

05:44:32.000 --> 05:44:33.120
I agree

05:44:33.120 --> 05:44:34.800
The civil lake

05:44:34.800 --> 05:44:37.280
Private equity company that's involved with

05:44:37.280 --> 05:44:38.400
WP engine

05:44:38.400 --> 05:44:40.000
It's not my natural ally

05:44:40.880 --> 05:44:42.800
I'm not the natural ally

05:44:42.800 --> 05:44:44.400
Of private equity

05:44:45.040 --> 05:44:46.400
Doing

05:44:46.400 --> 05:44:48.240
Some game with the P engine

05:44:48.240 --> 05:44:50.800
That's not my interest

05:44:50.800 --> 05:44:52.240
In the case my interest is

05:44:53.040 --> 05:44:54.400
Essentially

05:44:54.400 --> 05:44:55.440
Set of principles

05:44:55.440 --> 05:44:57.040
And the principles are

05:44:57.040 --> 05:44:59.040
If you release something as open source

05:45:00.000 --> 05:45:01.600
People are free to use it

05:45:01.600 --> 05:45:02.880
As they see fit

05:45:02.880 --> 05:45:04.880
And they are free to

05:45:04.880 --> 05:45:06.080
Donate code

05:45:06.080 --> 05:45:07.280
Or resources

05:45:07.280 --> 05:45:09.440
Or money back to the community

05:45:09.440 --> 05:45:10.560
As they see fit

05:45:10.560 --> 05:45:12.560
You may disagree

05:45:13.040 --> 05:45:14.800
Whether they've done enough

05:45:14.800 --> 05:45:16.560
Whether they should do more

05:45:16.560 --> 05:45:18.080
But you can't show up

05:45:18.720 --> 05:45:20.720
After you've given the gift

05:45:20.720 --> 05:45:22.320
Of free software

05:45:22.320 --> 05:45:23.360
To the world

05:45:23.360 --> 05:45:25.360
And then say now that you've used that gift

05:45:25.360 --> 05:45:26.560
You actually owe me

05:45:26.560 --> 05:45:27.920
Huge slide of your business

05:45:27.920 --> 05:45:29.760
Because you got too successful

05:45:29.760 --> 05:45:31.920
Using the thing I gave you

05:45:31.920 --> 05:45:32.800
For free

05:45:32.800 --> 05:45:34.960
You don't get to take a gift back

05:45:34.960 --> 05:45:36.160
That's why we have

05:45:36.160 --> 05:45:37.920
Open source licenses

05:45:37.920 --> 05:45:40.080
They stipulate exactly what the

05:45:40.080 --> 05:45:42.960
Obligations are on both sides of the equation

05:45:42.960 --> 05:45:45.440
The users of open source don't get to demand

05:45:45.440 --> 05:45:48.320
What the makers of open source do and how they act

05:45:48.320 --> 05:45:51.440
And the makers of open source don't get to

05:45:51.440 --> 05:45:53.920
Suddenly show up with a ransom note

05:45:53.920 --> 05:45:56.080
To the users and say actually you owe me

05:45:56.080 --> 05:45:57.200
For all sorts of use

05:45:57.200 --> 05:46:00.560
I'm 100% allergic to that kind of

05:46:01.440 --> 05:46:02.400
Interaction

05:46:02.400 --> 05:46:05.360
And I think Matt unfortunately for whatever reason

05:46:06.720 --> 05:46:09.360
Got so wrapped up in what he was owed

05:46:10.880 --> 05:46:13.600
That he failed to realize

05:46:13.600 --> 05:46:15.600
What he was destroying

05:46:15.600 --> 05:46:18.000
WordPress and automatic already makes

05:46:18.000 --> 05:46:18.880
A ton of money

05:46:18.880 --> 05:46:20.720
This is part of the wonder of WordPress

05:46:20.720 --> 05:46:24.800
This is a project that generates hundreds of millions of dollars

05:46:25.680 --> 05:46:28.880
And Matt didn't feel like he was getting enough of that

05:46:30.560 --> 05:46:32.400
That's not a good argument bro

05:46:32.400 --> 05:46:34.880
You can't just violate the spirit

05:46:34.880 --> 05:46:37.520
And the letter of these open source licenses

05:46:37.520 --> 05:46:39.840
And just start showing up with the man letters

05:46:39.840 --> 05:46:43.040
Even to characters that are not particularly sympathetic

05:46:43.760 --> 05:46:48.000
This goes to the root of my interpretation of open source in general

05:46:48.800 --> 05:46:54.960
The gpl is a particular license that actually demands code

05:46:54.960 --> 05:46:58.320
From people who use it under certain circumstances

05:46:58.320 --> 05:47:00.080
I've never liked the gpl

05:47:00.080 --> 05:47:02.560
I don't want you shitty code if you don't want to give it to me

05:47:03.600 --> 05:47:04.880
What am I going to do with that?

05:47:05.440 --> 05:47:07.120
Some code dump that you

05:47:07.920 --> 05:47:11.200
I'm not on board with that part of Stolman's vision at all

05:47:11.200 --> 05:47:12.800
I love the MIT license

05:47:12.800 --> 05:47:14.720
To me that is the perfect license

05:47:14.720 --> 05:47:17.120
Because it is mercilessly short

05:47:17.120 --> 05:47:18.800
I think it's two paragraphs

05:47:18.800 --> 05:47:19.920
Three paragraphs

05:47:19.920 --> 05:47:20.720
Really short

05:47:20.720 --> 05:47:21.920
And it basically says

05:47:22.800 --> 05:47:23.760
Here's some software

05:47:24.480 --> 05:47:25.840
It comes with no warranty

05:47:26.640 --> 05:47:27.840
You can't sue me

05:47:27.840 --> 05:47:29.200
You can't demand anything

05:47:29.200 --> 05:47:31.040
But you can do whatever the hell you want with it

05:47:31.600 --> 05:47:32.320
Have a nice life

05:47:32.880 --> 05:47:36.720
That's a perfect open source interaction in my opinion

05:47:37.520 --> 05:47:40.080
And that license needs to be upheld

05:47:40.080 --> 05:47:43.520
These licenses in general, even the gpl, even if I don't like it

05:47:43.840 --> 05:47:45.280
We have to abide by them

05:47:45.280 --> 05:47:47.440
Because if we just set aside those licenses

05:47:47.440 --> 05:47:49.360
When we in a moment's notice

05:47:49.600 --> 05:47:51.360
Feel like something slightly unfair

05:47:51.360 --> 05:47:52.400
We've lost everything

05:47:52.400 --> 05:47:54.480
We've lost the entire framework

05:47:54.480 --> 05:47:56.640
That allowed open source to prosper

05:47:56.640 --> 05:48:01.120
And allowed open source to become such an integral part of commerce too

05:48:01.120 --> 05:48:05.120
I mean back when open source was initially finding its feet

05:48:05.200 --> 05:48:07.680
It was at war with commercial software

05:48:07.680 --> 05:48:09.920
Stolman is at war with commercial software

05:48:09.920 --> 05:48:11.280
And always has been

05:48:11.280 --> 05:48:15.520
Bill Gates was in return at war with open source for the longest time

05:48:17.120 --> 05:48:20.000
The open source licenses and the clarity that they provide

05:48:20.000 --> 05:48:21.760
allowed us to end that war

05:48:21.760 --> 05:48:26.320
Today commercial software and open source software can peacefully coexist

05:48:26.320 --> 05:48:29.520
I make commercial software, I sell base camp, I sell hay

05:48:29.520 --> 05:48:32.560
And then I also make a bunch of open source software that I give away for free's gifts

05:48:33.040 --> 05:48:38.240
That can't happen if we start violating these contracts

05:48:38.240 --> 05:48:40.480
No commercial company is going to go

05:48:40.480 --> 05:48:43.280
Let me base my next project off this piece of open source

05:48:43.280 --> 05:48:48.080
If I'm also running the liability that some mad maker is going to show up

05:48:48.080 --> 05:48:52.480
Seven years in and demand I give them $50 million

05:48:52.480 --> 05:48:58.560
That's not an environment conducive to commerce, collaboration or anything else

05:48:58.560 --> 05:48:59.840
And it's just basically wrong

05:48:59.840 --> 05:49:04.160
I think there's one analysis that's all about kind of the practical outcomes of this

05:49:04.160 --> 05:49:05.120
Which I think are bad

05:49:05.120 --> 05:49:09.440
There's also some an argument that's simply about ethics

05:49:09.440 --> 05:49:10.880
This is not right

05:49:10.880 --> 05:49:13.680
You can't just show up afterwards and demand something

05:49:13.680 --> 05:49:15.680
This is not too dissimilar in my opinion

05:49:15.680 --> 05:49:18.000
To the whole Apple thing we talked about earlier

05:49:18.000 --> 05:49:22.320
Apple just showing up and feeling like they're entitled to 30% of everyone's business

05:49:22.320 --> 05:49:23.680
No

05:49:23.680 --> 05:49:25.760
That's not right

05:49:25.760 --> 05:49:27.360
That's not fair

05:49:27.440 --> 05:49:34.000
So I think Matt unfortunately kind of stared himself blind

05:49:34.000 --> 05:49:35.920
On the indignity

05:49:35.920 --> 05:49:38.160
He thought was being perpetrated against him

05:49:38.160 --> 05:49:41.360
Because there was all this money being made by VP engine

05:49:41.360 --> 05:49:46.160
Making a good product and not giving quite enough back in Matt's opinion

05:49:47.360 --> 05:49:48.800
Tough, tough cookie

05:49:48.800 --> 05:49:51.600
I think there maybe I'm reading too much into it

05:49:51.600 --> 05:49:53.360
But there might be some personal stuff too

05:49:53.360 --> 05:49:56.160
Which they weren't not only not giving enough

05:49:56.240 --> 05:49:59.920
But probably implicitly promising that they will give

05:50:01.600 --> 05:50:04.960
And then taking advantage of him in that way in his mind

05:50:04.960 --> 05:50:07.200
Just like interpersonal interaction

05:50:07.200 --> 05:50:09.120
And then you get like

05:50:09.120 --> 05:50:10.960
Interpersonally frustrated

05:50:10.960 --> 05:50:13.440
You forget like the bigger picture ethics of it

05:50:13.440 --> 05:50:17.360
It's like when a guy keeps saying you know promising he'll do something

05:50:18.160 --> 05:50:21.920
And then you and then you realize you wake up one day like a year or two later

05:50:22.560 --> 05:50:23.760
Wait a minute

05:50:23.920 --> 05:50:25.920
I was being lied to this whole time

05:50:25.920 --> 05:50:28.080
And then that I don't even know if it's about money

05:50:29.120 --> 05:50:30.080
I'd get mad too

05:50:30.080 --> 05:50:32.400
It's solely fine to get mad when people disappoint you

05:50:32.880 --> 05:50:38.000
That's not justification for upending decades of open source

05:50:38.800 --> 05:50:43.600
Licenses and the essential the fact of case law we've established around it

05:50:43.600 --> 05:50:47.200
This is why I chose to even weigh in on this

05:50:47.200 --> 05:50:49.600
Because I like WordPress I don't use WordPress

05:50:49.600 --> 05:50:50.800
I'm not a part of that community

05:50:50.880 --> 05:50:51.920
I don't actually have a

05:50:53.120 --> 05:50:54.320
Dog in this fight

05:50:54.320 --> 05:50:58.640
I'm biased if anything towards Matt just as a fellow BDFL

05:50:59.520 --> 05:51:01.360
I would like to see him do well with this

05:51:01.360 --> 05:51:03.520
But I also think there's some principles that stake here that

05:51:04.320 --> 05:51:05.680
Ring much louder

05:51:05.680 --> 05:51:08.000
I don't want rails to suddenly

05:51:08.960 --> 05:51:14.160
Betainted by the fact that it's open source and whether companies can rely on it and build businesses on it

05:51:14.160 --> 05:51:16.800
Because wait maybe one day I'm gonna turn Matt

05:51:16.800 --> 05:51:20.400
And I'm gonna turn Matt King and I'm gonna show up with the demand ransom letter

05:51:20.480 --> 05:51:22.000
No screw that we

05:51:22.000 --> 05:51:23.360
We have

05:51:23.360 --> 05:51:27.200
Way more to protect here. There's way more at stake than your personal beef

05:51:27.920 --> 05:51:32.400
With someone or your perceived grievance over what you're owed. What would you recommend?

05:51:32.400 --> 05:51:36.800
What do you think you should do can do to walk it back to to heal

05:51:40.080 --> 05:51:41.520
Decide

05:51:41.520 --> 05:51:45.280
This is the curious thing he could decide to give this up

05:51:45.280 --> 05:51:49.200
That's very very difficult for driven ambitious people to do

05:51:49.200 --> 05:51:53.040
To accept that they're wrong and to give up and lay down their sword. So

05:51:53.920 --> 05:51:56.880
I had a hope earlier on in this that that was possible

05:51:57.680 --> 05:52:02.400
I haven't seen any evidence that Matt is interested in that and I find that deeply red fault

05:52:02.400 --> 05:52:09.440
But that's her his prerogative. I continue to speak out when he's violating the spirit and ethics of open source

05:52:09.680 --> 05:52:10.880
but I

05:52:10.880 --> 05:52:12.320
Wish he would just

05:52:12.320 --> 05:52:14.080
Accept that this was a

05:52:14.080 --> 05:52:17.040
Really bad idea. He just he made a bad bet and I thought

05:52:17.600 --> 05:52:21.040
I think he thought he'd just get away with it that they'd just pay up

05:52:21.760 --> 05:52:28.960
And that he could put pressure. I mean, I know that temptation when you sit as the head of a very important project

05:52:29.760 --> 05:52:37.120
You know that that comes with a great degree of power and you really need a great degree of discipline

05:52:37.760 --> 05:52:42.320
To rain that in and not exercise that power at every step where you feel aggrieved

05:52:42.320 --> 05:52:44.720
I've felt aggrieved a million times over

05:52:45.440 --> 05:52:48.000
In the 20 plus years of ruby and rails

05:52:48.720 --> 05:52:51.280
I've really tried very hard not to let those

05:52:52.080 --> 05:52:55.120
Sometimes petty sometimes substantial grievances over time

05:52:57.120 --> 05:53:02.400
Seabind to the foundation of the ecosystem and risk ruining everything

05:53:03.040 --> 05:53:06.560
As the king of the rail kingdom as the power got into your head over the years

05:53:07.120 --> 05:53:11.520
I'm sure it has. I mean who wouldn't do pace around in your chamber

05:53:12.480 --> 05:53:14.480
I do

05:53:16.080 --> 05:53:21.520
And I do marvel at both what's been built what's been possible over a million applications

05:53:21.520 --> 05:53:27.040
I've been made with ruby and rails by one estimate that I've seen businesses like Shopify and GitHub and

05:53:27.680 --> 05:53:32.720
A million others have been built on top of something that I started. That's very gratifying

05:53:34.000 --> 05:53:35.360
but

05:53:35.360 --> 05:53:38.960
You really have to be careful not to smell your own exhaust too much

05:53:39.200 --> 05:53:42.880
And you have to be just as careful not to listen too much to the haters

05:53:43.920 --> 05:53:49.440
And not to listen too much to the super fans either that you assess the

05:53:50.560 --> 05:53:52.560
value and

05:53:52.960 --> 05:53:59.120
Sort of principles of what you're working towards on its own merits on your own scoreboard. I try to

05:54:00.800 --> 05:54:06.320
Block that out and then just go well. I'm working on rails because I love to write ruby

05:54:06.720 --> 05:54:10.640
I love to use ruby to make web applications

05:54:10.880 --> 05:54:14.320
That's my north star and I'll continue to do that and I'll continue to share

05:54:15.200 --> 05:54:17.200
all of the open source gifts that I

05:54:18.160 --> 05:54:20.160
Uncover along the ways

05:54:20.800 --> 05:54:24.560
And that's it. That's enough too. I don't have to get all of it out of it

05:54:25.040 --> 05:54:32.720
This is sometimes just as with the guy who thought I'd given up on being Jira or something instead of doing base cam

05:54:33.040 --> 05:54:38.240
There are people over the years who've asked like why didn't you charge for rails like don't you know how much money

05:54:38.320 --> 05:54:43.840
Have been made off rails if we just look at something like Shopify. It's worth billions of dollars

05:54:43.840 --> 05:54:52.240
I'm not a billionaire and so freaking what I got more than enough. I got plenty of my share. I will say though. I'm also

05:54:54.240 --> 05:54:59.520
Introspective enough to realize that if it hadn't panned out as well as it did for me on my own business

05:55:00.160 --> 05:55:02.160
Maybe I would have been more tempted

05:55:02.240 --> 05:55:06.960
Maybe if you see other people build huge successful companies off the back of your work

05:55:07.520 --> 05:55:09.520
And you really don't have a

05:55:09.520 --> 05:55:13.360
Pot to piss in you might be tempted to get a little

05:55:14.320 --> 05:55:18.560
Upset about that. I've seen that in the rails world as well where there are people who contributed

05:55:19.120 --> 05:55:21.760
substantial bodies of work and then got really

05:55:22.320 --> 05:55:25.280
Miffed when they didn't feel like they got enough back

05:55:25.440 --> 05:55:30.880
I was fortunate enough that the business that Jason or I built with Ruby and rails was so successful as it was

05:55:30.880 --> 05:55:35.520
And I I made the money I needed to make that I didn't need to chase the rest of it

05:55:36.320 --> 05:55:38.320
But we should also just

05:55:38.320 --> 05:55:41.120
Make explicit that many people in your position

05:55:42.560 --> 05:55:44.560
Chase

05:55:45.200 --> 05:55:50.880
Chase the money. It's not that difficult to chase basically you turned away money. You made a lot of decisions that

05:55:51.600 --> 05:55:53.440
Just turn away money

05:55:53.520 --> 05:55:55.520
Maybe I also think of

05:55:56.640 --> 05:56:01.600
This example with Matt he probably thought there was easy money for the taking and it wasn't so easy

05:56:01.680 --> 05:56:04.320
Was it it looked like low-hanging dollar bills

05:56:05.040 --> 05:56:08.480
And they turned out to be some really sour grapes it turned out that he turned

05:56:09.040 --> 05:56:11.040
He probably destroyed

05:56:11.040 --> 05:56:14.560
vast sums of money by undermining the whole WordPress

05:56:15.280 --> 05:56:23.120
Trust and the ecosystem and putting question marks in the heads of folks who would choose to you at WordPress or something else going forward

05:56:24.080 --> 05:56:30.080
So I often think when people think like oh you left money on the table first of all so what I don't have to have all the money

05:56:30.160 --> 05:56:33.920
But second of all maybe the money wasn't on the table at all and maybe the cost

05:56:35.120 --> 05:56:39.440
Even if you got the money maybe the cost in other ways yes, we've talked about yes

05:56:39.760 --> 05:56:46.720
Without way all the money these you could have possibly gotten meaning like I think you said that the thing that makes you happy

05:56:47.680 --> 05:56:52.640
Is flow and tranquility those two things beautifully really beautifully put

05:56:53.360 --> 05:56:55.120
and you know

05:56:55.440 --> 05:56:57.120
gaining money might

05:56:57.120 --> 05:57:01.680
Assigned to your responsibility of running a larger thing that takes away

05:57:02.960 --> 05:57:09.200
The flow that you gain from being from from fundamentally for you what flow means is programming

05:57:09.760 --> 05:57:14.560
And then tranquility is like I think you also have a beautiful post of like

05:57:15.360 --> 05:57:17.360
Nirvana is an empty schedule

05:57:17.440 --> 05:57:21.840
When I look at a upcoming week and I see that I have no schedule meetings at all

05:57:21.840 --> 05:57:25.840
Which is quite common or maybe I just have one thing from one hour on one day

05:57:26.560 --> 05:57:30.000
I think to myself do you know what this could very easily have been very different

05:57:30.240 --> 05:57:36.240
We could have been running a company of hundreds of people or thousands of people and my entire calendar would have been packed

05:57:36.320 --> 05:57:41.760
Solid with a little tetris blocks of other people's demands on my attention and time

05:57:42.080 --> 05:57:44.240
And I would have been miserable as fuck yeah

05:57:44.880 --> 05:57:46.880
And I look at that and go like that

05:57:47.440 --> 05:57:49.440
What more can I

05:57:49.600 --> 05:57:53.680
Ask for which is a really nice state of being at actually say

05:57:54.560 --> 05:57:58.960
I didn't have this always I did have early on in my career some sense of

05:57:59.600 --> 05:58:07.120
Like I need a little more a little more security and I remember this really interesting study where a bunch of

05:58:07.280 --> 05:58:11.600
Researchers asked people who would make certain amounts of money how much money would it take

05:58:12.320 --> 05:58:17.040
For you to feel secure they'd ask people who had a million dollars network. How much money do you need

05:58:17.920 --> 05:58:23.600
For any two million two million then it'd be good then they asked people with them at net worth of five million. How much do you need

05:58:24.400 --> 05:58:26.400
10 any 10

05:58:26.480 --> 05:58:28.320
Ask people with 10 million. What do you need 20

05:58:29.040 --> 05:58:31.440
Every single time people would need double of what they did

05:58:31.440 --> 05:58:35.760
I did that for a couple of double links until I realized you know what this is silly. Yeah

05:58:35.840 --> 05:58:39.760
I am already where I wished I would be and a million times over

05:58:40.560 --> 05:58:41.600
So

05:58:41.600 --> 05:58:44.880
What less is there to pursue now that doesn't mean that

05:58:45.440 --> 05:58:48.320
If more money is coming my way, I'm gonna say no to it. Of course not

05:58:48.800 --> 05:58:52.240
But it does mean that I'm free to set other things higher

05:58:52.800 --> 05:58:54.800
And I also do think you realize

05:58:55.040 --> 05:59:00.960
As Jim Kerry would say I wish everyone would get all the money that they wished for and they'd realize it wasn't the answer

05:59:01.200 --> 05:59:03.680
that money solves a whole host of

05:59:04.320 --> 05:59:07.840
Problems and anxieties and then it creates a bunch of new ones

05:59:08.560 --> 05:59:13.440
And then it also doesn't touch a huge swath of the human experience at all

05:59:14.160 --> 05:59:19.120
The world is full of miserable anxious hurt rich people

05:59:20.320 --> 05:59:26.000
It's also full of miserable anxious poor people and I'd rather be a miserable anxious rich person that a poor person

05:59:26.480 --> 05:59:30.720
But it isn't this magic wand that make everything go away and that's again one of those

05:59:32.480 --> 05:59:36.000
Insights just like having children that you cannot communicate in words

05:59:36.160 --> 05:59:42.160
I've never been able to sway a person who's not wealthy that wealth wasn't gonna solve all the problems

05:59:42.720 --> 05:59:49.840
One quote you've returned to often and I enjoy a lot is the Coco Chanel quote of the best things in in life are free

05:59:50.880 --> 05:59:56.240
And the second best things are very very expensive and I guess the task is

05:59:57.680 --> 05:59:59.680
To focus on

06:00:00.960 --> 06:00:06.080
Surround yourself with the best things in life like family and all of this and not caring about the other stuff

06:00:06.720 --> 06:00:11.760
I would ease and say you can care about the other stuff just know the order priority. Yeah

06:00:12.160 --> 06:00:14.160
if you are blessed with

06:00:15.520 --> 06:00:24.160
A partner that you love some children that you adore you've already won the greatest prize that most humans

06:00:24.880 --> 06:00:26.880
Are able to achieve

06:00:26.880 --> 06:00:29.200
Most humans in this world if they are of

06:00:29.920 --> 06:00:34.720
Marital age and they have children if you ask and what's the most important thing they would all say that

06:00:35.040 --> 06:00:37.520
They would all say that no matter whether they're rich or poor

06:00:38.480 --> 06:00:43.920
It's easy to lose sight of that when you're chasing the second best things because you know what they're also very nice

06:00:45.120 --> 06:00:47.360
I I really like that Pagani sonda

06:00:47.680 --> 06:00:52.960
It was a very expensive car and I would have no chance of acquiring it if I hadn't become rather

06:00:54.240 --> 06:01:00.240
Successful in business. So I don't want to dismiss it either. It's great fun to have money

06:01:01.280 --> 06:01:03.280
It's just

06:01:03.520 --> 06:01:10.400
Not as fun for quite as long or as deep as you think it is and these other things having

06:01:10.960 --> 06:01:15.440
An occupation and a pursuit that you enjoy being able to carry burdens

06:01:16.400 --> 06:01:21.680
With a stiff of a lip and with again a sense of meaning

06:01:22.480 --> 06:01:30.080
Is incredible to have family to have friends to have hobbies to have all these things that are actually available

06:01:31.040 --> 06:01:33.200
To most people around the world

06:01:33.920 --> 06:01:40.560
That's winning and it doesn't mean you have to discount your ambitions. It doesn't mean you can't reach for more

06:01:41.200 --> 06:01:42.320
but

06:01:42.320 --> 06:01:45.600
It does mean it's pretty dumb if you don't realize that

06:01:47.520 --> 06:01:51.920
It's not going to complete you in some hocus-pocus-woose sense

06:01:52.800 --> 06:01:55.200
To make more it it really isn't

06:01:56.320 --> 06:01:58.640
What gives you hope about the future

06:01:59.600 --> 06:02:02.400
This whole thing we have going on here human civilization

06:02:04.480 --> 06:02:05.600
I

06:02:05.600 --> 06:02:07.760
Find it easier to be optimistic

06:02:08.480 --> 06:02:12.240
optimistic than pessimistic because I don't know either way

06:02:12.720 --> 06:02:20.080
So if I get to choose why not just choose to believe it's going to pan out yeah like we suffer more in our

06:02:20.160 --> 06:02:27.920
Imagination than we do in reality. That's one of the quotes out of stoicism and I also think we have a tendency

06:02:28.320 --> 06:02:30.480
A lot of humans have a tendency to be

06:02:31.360 --> 06:02:34.800
pessimistic in advance for things they don't know how it's going to pan out

06:02:35.920 --> 06:02:41.120
Climate change for example is making a lot of people very anxious and very pessimistic about the future

06:02:41.360 --> 06:02:43.120
You know nothing

06:02:43.120 --> 06:02:46.480
40 years ago we thought the problem was that the planet was going to be too cool

06:02:47.120 --> 06:02:53.600
I happen to believe that it's probably correct that the planet is getting too hot and that CO2 has something to do with it

06:02:53.920 --> 06:02:59.120
Whether we have the right measures to fix it in time if that's even possible or not

06:02:59.920 --> 06:03:07.040
Is completely up in the air and we don't know if you convince yourself with such certainty that the world is going to turn to shit

06:03:07.440 --> 06:03:10.480
It is right up here in your head today

06:03:11.440 --> 06:03:15.840
Climate change might wipe out this entire species in 200 years

06:03:16.960 --> 06:03:18.720
It's not next year

06:03:18.720 --> 06:03:24.400
It's not 10 years from now you life might become more unpleasant and there might be more negative effects and so on

06:03:24.400 --> 06:03:28.160
Yes, okay, but then deal with that hardship when it arrives

06:03:28.720 --> 06:03:35.520
Don't take down in advance. How are you helping earth by just walking around being depressed?

06:03:36.800 --> 06:03:42.000
I think our whole conversation today is also an indication. It's just two humans talking

06:03:42.720 --> 06:03:46.400
There's billions of us and there is something about us that wants to

06:03:47.040 --> 06:03:53.600
Solve problems and build cool stuff. Yes, and so we're gonna build our way out of whatever shit we get ourselves into

06:03:54.160 --> 06:03:58.560
This is what humans do we create problems for ourselves and and come up

06:03:59.200 --> 06:04:01.200
Figure out how to build rocket ships

06:04:01.600 --> 06:04:02.640
to

06:04:02.640 --> 06:04:09.120
To get out of those problems and sometimes the rocket ships create other problems like nuclear warheads and then we'll I'm sure

06:04:10.800 --> 06:04:12.000
I hope

06:04:12.080 --> 06:04:15.440
Figure out ways how to avoid those problems and then there'll be nanobots and then

06:04:16.000 --> 06:04:22.800
The aliens will come and it'll be a massive war between the nanobots and aliens and and that will bring also all of us humans together

06:04:24.560 --> 06:04:29.280
To funny thing just to pick up one of the points you mentioned the atom bomb for example

06:04:29.920 --> 06:04:34.320
When that was first invented a lot of people thought we have essentially ended life on earth, right?

06:04:35.920 --> 06:04:41.440
Or maybe we prevented world war three from happening in the past 80 years because

06:04:42.240 --> 06:04:49.680
Assured neutral annihilation kept the superpowers from attacking each other at least head on and kept their

06:04:50.160 --> 06:04:57.680
Fighting to proxy wars. You know what proxy wars are not great, but they're probably better than world war three with nuclear weapons

06:04:57.840 --> 06:05:02.720
So it's quite difficult in the moment to tell what's actually benefit and what's

06:05:03.680 --> 06:05:08.880
Not and I think we should be a bit more humble. I've certainly become more humble over time of

06:05:09.680 --> 06:05:11.680
Thinking I know which way it's gonna turn

06:05:12.160 --> 06:05:17.440
I think the pandemic was a huge moment for a lot of people where there was so much certainty

06:05:17.920 --> 06:05:24.560
About whether this intervention work or that intervention didn't work and most people were wrong

06:05:25.520 --> 06:05:27.920
Certainly a lot of very smart people very

06:05:28.560 --> 06:05:34.160
Qualified people got that just utterly and catastrophically wrong

06:05:34.800 --> 06:05:41.760
So just a little intellectual humility. I think back upon that and go like you know what I'm not a PhD in virology

06:05:42.960 --> 06:05:47.520
Um, and I don't claim that like I somehow saw how it always gonna play out

06:05:47.520 --> 06:05:51.600
But the people were really experts and that's it got a bunch of it wrong nobody knows anything

06:05:52.080 --> 06:05:56.720
I keep reminding myself of that every day. No one knows anything. We can't predict

06:05:57.520 --> 06:06:02.720
The economy a month out. We can't predict world affairs mother. The world is just too complicated

06:06:02.880 --> 06:06:06.480
Yeah, I when I watch the Netflix documentary chimp empire

06:06:07.600 --> 06:06:10.080
And how you know, there's a hierarchy of chimps

06:06:11.040 --> 06:06:16.400
All of that looks eerily similar to us humans. We're recent descendants

06:06:17.120 --> 06:06:18.400
So these

06:06:18.400 --> 06:06:20.160
Experts some of the chimps are

06:06:21.120 --> 06:06:23.120
Got a PhD others don't

06:06:23.680 --> 06:06:28.960
Others are really muscular. Others are like beta male kind. They're sucking up to the alpha

06:06:29.280 --> 06:06:33.920
There's a lot of interesting dynamics going on that really maps clearly to the geopolitics of the day

06:06:34.480 --> 06:06:38.080
I don't have nuclear weapons, but the nature of their behavior similar to ours

06:06:38.640 --> 06:06:40.640
So I think

06:06:40.640 --> 06:06:44.720
I think we barely know what's going on, but I do think there's like a basic

06:06:46.880 --> 06:06:48.480
Uh

06:06:48.480 --> 06:06:50.880
Will to cooperate

06:06:50.880 --> 06:06:56.320
The basic compassion that underlies are just the human spirit that's there

06:06:57.120 --> 06:06:59.360
And maybe that is just me being optimistic

06:06:59.840 --> 06:07:04.320
But if that is indeed there, then we're gonna be okay. The capacity is certainly there

06:07:04.800 --> 06:07:08.320
Whether we choose that capacity or not who knows and what situation

06:07:08.560 --> 06:07:14.560
I think accepting that we all have the capacity for both ways for both incredible generosity and

06:07:15.760 --> 06:07:17.760
kindness and also cruelty

06:07:18.320 --> 06:07:19.520
I think

06:07:19.520 --> 06:07:27.760
Young with this whole theory of the shadow was really spot on that we all have that capacity in us and accepting that

06:07:28.640 --> 06:07:32.720
It's our job to attempt to cultivate the better parts of our human nature

06:07:33.200 --> 06:07:35.200
is

06:07:35.360 --> 06:07:39.680
Weight against our propensity to sometime be the worst of ourselves

06:07:40.880 --> 06:07:44.400
I'm excited to find out what's gonna happen. It's so awesome to be human

06:07:44.560 --> 06:07:50.720
I don't want to die. I kind of want to be alive for a while to see all the cool shit we do and uh one of the cool things

06:07:50.720 --> 06:07:55.040
I want to see is all the software you create and all the things you tweet

06:07:55.840 --> 06:07:58.320
All the trouble you get yourself into on twitter

06:07:59.120 --> 06:07:59.680
um

06:07:59.680 --> 06:08:01.840
David the i'm a huge fan like i said

06:08:01.840 --> 06:08:06.720
I thank you for everything you've done for the world for the millions of developers you've inspired

06:08:07.280 --> 06:08:12.560
And uh one of whom is me and thank you for this awesome conversation brother. Thanks so much for having me

06:08:13.760 --> 06:08:17.520
