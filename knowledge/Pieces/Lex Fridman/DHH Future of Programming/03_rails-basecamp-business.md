## The Core Philosophy

Rails emerged from solving a real business problem with Jason Fried, embodying a philosophy of integrated solutions over fragmented tooling:

> "We can do better. We know how to make web applications. Can't we just make a system that's better than email for managing projects. It can't be that hard."

The insight: **Great frameworks solve complete problems with thoughtful integration, not just individual pieces.**

## The Origin Story: From Client Work to Basecamp

### The Email Problem
DHH and Jason Fried's collaboration revealed a universal business pain point:

> "Whenever you work with a client you start that project off an email. Oh, yeah let's work together. Here's what we're building and you start trading more and more emails and before a few weeks have passed you got to add someone to the project. They don't have the emails. They don't have the context. You send them. Where's the latest file? Oh, I've uploaded on the ftp. It's like final final v06 2.0 right that's the one to get it's just a mess."

### The Freedom of Technology Choice
A crucial moment in DHH's career:

> "When we started working on base camp, I for the first time in the experience I have with Jason had the freedom of technology choice. There was no client telling me. Yeah, PHP. That sounds good. We know PHP. Can you build it in PHP? I had free reigns."

### The Basecamp Vision
Simple but revolutionary:

> "Can't we just make a system where everything that anyone involved in the project needs is on one page and it has to be simple enough that I'm not going to run a seminar teaching you how to use the system. I'm just going to give you the login code. You're going to jump into it."

## The Rails Doctrine: Nine Principles

### Why Document Values Matter
DHH's insight about community preservation:

> "If you want a community to endure you have to record its values and you have to record its practices. If you don't eventually you're going to get enough new people come in who have their own ideas of where this thing should go... We forget why Chester Tons fence is there. We just go like why is that fence there? Let's see and get out. Oh it was to keep the wolves out. Now we're all dead."

### 1. Optimize for Programmer Happiness
The foundational principle:

> "I put that at number one in homage of maths and that's a lot about accepting that there is occasionally a trade-off between writing beautiful code and other things we want out of systems. There can be a runtime trade-off. There can be a performance trade-off. But we're going to do it nonetheless."

### 2. Convention Over Configuration
Born from Java framework frustration:

> "It was born out of a frustration I had in the early days with especially Java frameworks where when you were setting up a web application framework for Java back in the day it was not uncommon to literally write hundreds of thousands of lines of XML configuration files."

The foreign key example:

> "Oh and it is I want the database to use the foreign keys as post underscore id. No no no I want it as post capital id. Oh no no no you have to do a capital p id. There are all these ways where you can configure how foreign relation keys should work in a database and none of them matter. We just need to pick one."

The philosophy:

> "Convention over configuration is essentially to take that idea that the system should come preassembled. I'm not just handing you about the fucking Legos and asking you to build the Millennium Falcon. I'm giving you a finished toy."

### 3. The Menu is Omakase
Complete integration over choice paralysis:

> "If you look at everything that's wrong with the JavaScript ecosystem right now for example it is that no one is in charge of the menu. There are a billion different dishes and you can configure just your tailored specific configuration of it but no one done the work to make sure it all fits together."

The Rails approach:

> "Rails goes the complete opposite way of saying do you know what? Rails is not just a way framework. It is a complete attempt at solving the web problem. It's complete attempt at solving everything you need to build a great web application and every piece of that puzzle should ideally be in the box pre-configured, pre-assembled."

The chef metaphor:

> "You'll get a full menu designed by chef really cared about every piece of the ingredient and you're going to enjoy it."

## Mental Model: Monolith vs. Microservices

**Traditional Thinking:** Break everything into microservices for scalability  
**DHH's Philosophy:** Keep systems unified until you absolutely must split them

### The Microservices Critique
DHH's strong stance:

> "I've been on a crusade against microservices since the term was coined. Micro-services was born out of essentially a good idea. What do you do at Netflix scale when you have thousands of engineers working on millions of lines of code. No one can keep that entire system in their head at one time."

The misapplication:

> "When you apply that pattern to a team of 20 programmers working on a code base of half a million lines of code you're an idiot. You just don't need to turn method invocations into network calls."

### The First Rule of Distributed Programming
A fundamental principle:

> "It is the first rule of distributed programming. Do not distribute your programming. It makes everything harder. All the failure conditions you have to consider as a programmer just becomes infinitely harder when there's a network cable involved."

### The Monolith Advantage
Why unified systems work:

> "The monolith says let's try to focus on building a whole system that a single human can actually understand and push that paradigm as far as possible by compressing all the concepts. System more of it will fit into memory of a single operating human."

## Scale and Compression

### Basecamp and Hey's Remarkable Efficiency
The power of compression:

> "Basecamp and hey are both 100,000 100,000 lines of code... Considering the fact that Basecamp I think has something like 420 screens different ways and configurations."

### The JavaScript Comparison
A striking contrast in approaches:

> "Hey, which is a Gmail competitor, Gmail ships I think 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript. If you compress it I think it's about 6 megabytes... When hey launched we shipped 40 kilobytes. It's trying to solve the same problem. You can solve the email client problem with either 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript or with 40 kilobytes if you do things differently."

### The Great Crime Against Web Development
DHH's strong opinion on frontend/backend separation:

> "This is why I have fiercely fought splitting front end and back into part. That in my opinion this was one of the great crimes against West Development that we are still atoning for that we separated and divided what was and should be a unified problem-solving mechanism."

## Business Philosophy: Content with All Outcomes

### The Mental Model for Success
DHH's approach to new projects:

> "When we start working on a new product at 37 signals I set up my mental model for success and I go do you know what? If no one wants this I will have had another opportunity to write beautiful Ruby code to explore a greenfield domain to learn something new to build a system I want even if no one else wants it. What a blessing. What a privilege."

The outcome spectrum:

> "If a bunch of people want it that's great. We can pay some salaries. We can keep the business running and if it's a blow away success wonderful. I get to impact a bunch of people."

### General Life Principle
A broader philosophy:

> "I want to be content with all outcomes... How I look at all endeavors I involve myself in is I want to be content with all outcomes."

## Productivity Through Language Choice

### The Ruby Advantage
Why language choice matters for business:

> "Ruby and Rails isn't just about beautiful code. It's just as much about productivity. It's just as much about the impact and an individual programmer is able to have that they can build system where they can keep the whole thing in their head and be able to move it forward such that you can go from one developer sitting and working on something and that something is Shopify and turned into what it is today."

### Single Developer to Billion Dollar Company
The Shopify trajectory:

> "I don't think about Shopify now. I think of Shopify when Toby was writing snow devil which was the first e-commerce store to sell snowboards that he created that was the pre Shopify Shopify he created all by himself and that was possible because Ruby and Rails."

## The Scale Evidence

### Twitter's Cautionary Tale
When premature optimization backfires:

> "Twitter was started on Ruby and Rails. They then hit some scaling problems. It was a big debacle at the time. They end up then I think writing it in some other language which by the way, I think is the best advertisement ever for Ruby and Rails because nothing fucking happened for 10 years after they switched over right essentially zero innovation."

The lesson:

> "Some of that was because they were doing a long conversion and all of the early success in part came because they had the agility quickly change and adopt and so forth. That's what startups needs. That's what Shopify needed. That's what Twitter needed."

### Organizational Mirroring
How tools reflect their creators:

> "What happens so often when development tools and programming language are driven by huge companies is that they mirror their org chart. React and everything else needed to use that is in some ways a reflection of how meta builds Facebook because of course it is because of course it's a distraction of that."

## Key Insights

### On Python's Philosophy Contrast
The different approaches to ambiguity:

> "In the interactive Ruby shell where you can play with the language or even interact with your domain model you can quit it in two ways... You can write exit boom you're out of the program. You can write quit boom you're out of the program... Python is the perfect contrast to this. In the Python interactive protocol if you write exit it won't exit. It'll give you a fucking lesson."

The philosophical difference:

> "One is very human and another is very engineer... Python's the value from the start stated is that this should be preferably one and only one way to do a certain thing. Ruby goes to complete opposite. No, we want the full expression that fits different human brains."

### On Programmer Instincts
Understanding the tension:

> "This cuts against the grain of what most programmers love. They love a box of Legos. They love to put everything together from scratch. They love to make all these detailed little decisions that just don't matter at all."

The redirection:

> "I'm not trying to take the decisions away from you. I just want you to focus on decisions that actually matter."

### On No One Paradigm
Ruby's flexibility:

> "No one paradigm goes to the fact that Ruby is a fiercely object-oriented programming language at its core but it's also a functional programming language. This five times I told you about you can essentially do these anonymous function calls."

## Lessons for Framework Design

1. **Solve Complete Problems**: Don't just provide building blocks, provide finished solutions
2. **Embrace Good Defaults**: Most configuration decisions don't matter—make the choice for users
3. **Integrate Thoughtfully**: Consider how all pieces work together, not just individual components
4. **Keep Humans in Mind**: Design for human comprehension and happiness, not just machine efficiency
5. **Document Values**: Write down what matters to preserve community direction
6. **Resist Premature Decomposition**: Keep systems unified until complexity truly demands splitting
