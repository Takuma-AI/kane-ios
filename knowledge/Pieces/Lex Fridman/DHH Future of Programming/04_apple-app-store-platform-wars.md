## The Core Philosophy

DHH's relationship with Apple transformed from love to disillusionment as the company's toll booth mentality corrupted its developer ecosystem:

> "As Apple discovered the gold mine it is to operate a toll booth where you don't have to innovate, where you don't actually even have to make anything, where you can just take 30% of other people's business, there was a rot that's crept in to the foundation of Apple."

The insight: **Platform power without constraint corrupts even beloved companies, turning them from partners into predators.**

## The Love Affair: 20 Years of Apple Devotion

### Early Attraction
DHH's journey began with genuine admiration:

> "We did an ad for Apple that they posted on the developer side where we were all about our Apple so integral to everything that we do and we look up to them and we are inspired by them and that love relationship actually continued for a very long time."

### The Mac Era Transformation
Apple represented escape from Microsoft:

> "I basically just became a Mac person for 20 years. I didn't even care about looking at PCs. It seemed irrelevant to me whatever Microsoft was doing which felt like such a relief because in the 90s I felt like I couldn't escape Microsoft and suddenly I had found my escape."

### Shared Sensibilities
The aesthetic connection was profound:

> "And they shared so many of my sensibilities and my aesthetics and they kept pushing the envelope and there was so much to be proud of so much to look up to."

### iPhone Launch Devotion
DHH's commitment was absolute:

> "I lined up in 2007 together with Jason for five hours to stand in the line to buy a first generation product where Apple staff would clap at you when you walked out the store... I thought perhaps I'd be with the Mac until the end of days."

## The Transformation: From Computer to Toll Booth

### The Mobile Computer Revolution
DHH's initial misunderstanding:

> "I didn't see at the time just how critical the mobile phone would become to computing in general. I thought when the iPhone came out that like, oh, it's like a mobile phone. I've had a mobile phone since the early 90s. Well, it wasn't a mobile phone. It was a mobile computer. And even more than that it was the most important computer or it would become the most important computer for most people around the world."

### The Permission Economy
The fundamental shift in developer freedom:

> "Which meant that if you like to make software and wanted to sell it to people you had to go through that computer and if going through that computer meant going through Apple's toll booth and not just having to ask them permission which in and of itself was just an dignity when you're used to the internet where you don't have to ask anyone permission about anything. You buy the main and you launch your business and the customers show up. Boom, you're success. And if they don't well, you're failure."

## The Hey Email Battle: David vs. Goliath

### The Vision Behind Hey
DHH's ambitious goal:

> "I like to pitch it as what Gmail would have been with 20 years of lessons applied in a way where they could actually ship. Gmail was incredible when you launched in 2004 and it still is a great product but it's also trapped in its initial success. You can't redesign Gmail today. It's just that's way too many users."

### The Control Requirement
Why building both client and server mattered:

> "If you really want to move the ball forward with email you have to control both the server and the client. And that was the adacious mission we set out to do with hey."

### The Wrong Enemy
DHH's strategic miscalculation:

> "I thought our main obstacle here would be Gmail. It's the 800 pound gorilla into email space... trying to attack an enormous established competitor like that who's so actually still loved by plenty of people and it's free seems like a suicide mission."

## The Apple Trap

### The Approval Deception
The initial success that became a trap:

> "We submitted both of them to the app stores. Got both of them approved on I think Friday afternoon for the iOS app and we then went live on Monday and we were so excited. Hey world we've been working on this new thing I'd love for you to check it out."

### The Bait and Switch
Apple's retrospective rule enforcement:

> "We quickly found a few in the iOS client and submitted a new build to Apple. Hey here's our bug fixes can you please update. And that's when all the help broke loose. Not only where they not going to prove our update they said oh wait a minute we gave your permission to be in the app store but I'm sorry that was a mistake. We see that you're not using our in that payment system which means that we don't get 30% of your business."

### The Customer Relationship Theft
Beyond just the 30% tax:

> "It wasn't just about the 30%. It was also about splitting and not longer having a direct relationship with our customers. When you sell an app in the app store you're not selling an app to a customer. You're selling an app to inventory at Apple and then Apple sells an app to that customer. That customer has a purchasing relationship with Apple."

## The War Strategy

### The Unreasonable Response
DHH's principled stance:

> "So we decided to do something that seemingly Apple had never heard before. We said no. We're not going to add the in-app payment. I don't care if you're threatening us. This is not fair, this is not reasonable."

### The Nuclear Option
The all-or-nothing mentality:

> "That's the exact language basically I used in our original campaign. I will burn this business down before I hand over 30% of it to Apple. And that sort of indignation that actual rage is something I try to be a little careful about tapping into because it is a little bit of a volatile compound."

### Perfect Timing
Strategic advantage through circumstances:

> "We were blessed by the fact that we launched Hey one week before the WWDC their worldwide developer conference where Apple loves to get up on stage and harp on how much they do for developers how much they love them."

### The Public Campaign
Using platform power against platform power:

> "And then we also just happen to have a platform on the internet which is very convenient when you need to go to war with a $3 trillion company. So I started kicking and screaming oh boy and essentially turning it up to 11 in terms of the fight."

## The Epic Victory: Tim Sweeney's Legacy

### Recognizing True Heroes
DHH's gratitude to Epic Games:

> "I think it is incredible and the entire developer ecosystem not just on iOS but on Android as well oh epic Tim Sweeney and Mark Rain an enormous debt of gratitude for taking on the only battle that has ever inflicted a series wound on Apple in this entire sorted campaign of monopoly enforcement."

### The Cost of Justice
The financial reality of fighting monopolies:

> "Tim recently revealed that it has cost well over a hundred million dollars in legal fees to carry on this battle against Apple... Only a company like Epic could do it and only a company run by founders like Tim like Mark could risk the business in the way that they did."

### The Professional CEO Problem
Why only founders could have won:

> "No board would have signed off on this lawsuit to a professional CEO. No freaking way. So the fact that they've been able to beat Apple in also the most hilarious way possible I think it's just incredible."

### Apple's Self-Destruction
How Apple snatched defeat from victory:

> "Apple instead of just taking the ten out of eleven wins and going fine you can have your little links but all these other rules stay in place decided to essentially commit criminal contempt of court as they've now been referred to for prosecution and anger at the judge is such a degree that the rule of law in the US now is that you can launch an app in the app store and you don't have to use in-app payment."

## Mental Model: Founder vs. Professional Management

**Traditional Thinking:** Professional managers make more rational business decisions  
**DHH's Experience:** Only unreasonable founders will fight principle over profit

The founder advantage:

> "The audacity they had to provoke the fight in the first place which I thought was just incredible and to stick with it for the long term... No board would have signed off on this lawsuit to a professional CEO."

### The Unreasonable Principle
DHH's own embodiment of this approach:

> "And that sort of indignation that actual rage... I will burn this business down before I hand over 30% of it to Apple... But I think you also need that level of conviction to be able to even drive day-to-day decisions."

## The Broader Platform Critique

### The Toll Booth Model
DHH's fundamental objection:

> "As Apple discovered the gold mine it is to operate a toll booth where you don't have to innovate where you don't actually even have to make anything where you can just take 30% of other people's business."

### Vision Pro as Consequence
How burned bridges affect innovation:

> "The flop that was Division Pro was partly because Apple had pissed off every other developer. No one was eager to come build the kind of experiences for their new hardware that would perhaps have made it a success."

### The Relationship Dynamic
Understanding mutual dependency:

> "Apple is learning finally the fact that there are long-term consequences and the developers actually are important to Apple's business and the relationship is not entirely one-sided. We don't owe our existence to Apple and Apple alone."

## The Age and Leadership Problem

### The Old Guard Problem
DHH's critique of Apple's leadership:

> "But Apple should have reason to worry. Apple shareholders should have reason to be concerned not just about all these stumbles but also by the fact that Apple is run by old people. Apple's board has an average age of I think 75. Their entire executive team is above 60."

### The Learning Challenge
Why age matters in tech:

> "A lot of people when they reach a certain age or just happy to stay with what they know. They don't want to go back to being a beginner. They don't want to go back to having to relearn everything... This is a little hard for me at 45. How the hell do you do that at 75."

### Competitive Threats
The erosion of Apple's advantages:

> "They're behind on AI terribly behind. Their software quality is faltering in a bunch of ways. The competition is catching up on the hardware game in part because TSMC is not an Apple subsidiary but a foundry that services AMD and Nvidia and others."

## The Redemption Possibility

### Still Great in Many Ways
DHH's balanced perspective:

> "We should probably also say that the thing you love about Apple the great spirit of Apple, I think, still persists... Apple is still on top in the hardware that it makes and a lot of things that it makes... Apple is a truly special company."

### Historical Precedent
Apple's cyclical nature:

> "Apple's been in a morat as before. I mean Wasnyak and Steve Jobs started this thing in the garage has great success with the Apple too. He hands the company over to a sugar drink salesman who tanks the company into the 90s. He doesn't learn the lesson spends the next 20 years building up this amazing company then hands the company over again to a logistics person."

### The Disappointment Factor
Why the criticism stings:

> "This is why the disappointment is old yeah, because we had such high aspirations and expectations to Apple that they were the shining city on the hill and they were guiding the industry in a million positive ways."

## Key Insights

### On Platform Power Corruption
The inevitable progression:

> "So when you're on top and you have all the cards you can dilute yourself into thinking that you can dictate all terms at all times and there are no long-term consequences."

### On Fighting Monopolies
The resource requirement:

> "We shopped the case around with a few law firms... they would also tell us it's going to cost a minimum of ten million dollars and it's going to take five to seven years through all the appeals. Now we now learn the actual price tag was ten times higher."

### On Corporate Mortality
The historical perspective:

> "The norm is the great companies don't last forever. In the long arc of history almost no company lasts forever. There are very few companies around that was here 100 years ago. Even fewer 200 years ago. And virtually nothing that are a thousand years old outside of a handful of Japanese swordsmakers."

## Lessons for Platform Strategy

1. **Maintain Developer Relationships**: Short-term extraction damages long-term ecosystem health
2. **Founder Leadership Matters**: Professional managers optimize for predictable metrics, founders fight for principles
3. **Platform Power Has Limits**: Even dominant platforms face constraints from regulation and competition
4. **Age and Adaptability**: Leadership must remain curious and willing to learn new paradigms
5. **Multiple Fronts Matter**: Success requires excellence across hardware, software, services, and relationships

## The Current Victory

### Hey's New Freedom
The practical impact of Epic's victory:

> "We're going to launch new apps any minute now I hope actually next week to take advantage of this that revamp the hay apps is that people who download the hay app off the Apple app store can sign up in the app and can then use the web to put in the credit card so we don't have to pay 30% of this. We have a direct billing relationship."

### Gratitude to Warriors
Recognition of those who fought:

> "And we have Tim and Mark to thank for it... We owe all of that to Epic."
