## The Core Philosophy

"Issue Trees help explore various issues in a hierarchical structure to comprehensively view the problem statement." Rather than tackling problems as monolithic challenges, issue trees break them down into manageable, analyzable components that are **mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE)**.

## What Makes a Good Issue Tree

Issues and sub-issues in an effective tree should:
- **Relate directly to the overriding question** - Every branch helps answer the main question
- **Fall within project scope** - Don't analyze what you can't influence
- **Be detailed enough for hypothesis construction** - Specific enough to test
- **Be MECE** - No overlaps, no gaps

## Three Types of Issue Trees

### 1. Decomposition Tree
- **Description**: Starts with problem definition and divides into components
- **Structure**: What/How questions breaking down into parts
- **When to use**: Early on, when you don't know much
- **Example**: "What are the potential benefits?" → Revenue synergies, Cost synergies, Capex synergies

### 2. Hypothesis-Driven Tree
- **Description**: Postulates a hypothesis and develops rationale to validate/disprove
- **Structure**: Yes/No branches with supporting reasons
- **When to use**: At any point in the process when you have educated guesses
- **Example**: "We can reduce costs" → Through variable costs, Through fixed costs

### 3. Issue Map
- **Description**: Phrases key issues as yes/no questions in logical sequence
- **Structure**: Decision tree showing dependent actions
- **When to use**: Later in process to frame options
- **Example**: "Can we afford it?" → Yes → "Should we do it now?" → Yes/No paths

## Mental Model: MECE Thinking

**Traditional Approach:** List all the problems you can think of
**MECE Approach:** Systematically ensure every aspect is covered without overlaps

### The MECE Test
For each level of your tree, ask:
1. **Mutually Exclusive**: Could an item fit in more than one category? (If yes, refine categories)
2. **Collectively Exhaustive**: Is there anything related to the parent issue not covered? (If yes, add it)

## Best Practices for Developing Issue Trees

### Starting Strong
1. **Use the "Complication" components** - Mine your SCQ for natural issue categories
2. **Ensure relevance** - "Do we have the money?" is irrelevant for a cash-rich company
3. **Collaborate** - Use your whole team to develop common vision
4. **Brainstorm then structure** - Collect all potential issues first, organize second

### Refinement Techniques
- **Travel backwards from twigs** - After drafting, work backwards to ensure logic holds
- **Test with outsiders** - Can someone unfamiliar follow the logic?
- **Challenge each level** - Is this really MECE?

## The Art of Pruning

"Eliminating non-essential issues is the key to delivering a solution in a reasonable timeframe."

### Pruning Criteria
1. **Impact**: Will analyzing this significantly affect the answer?
2. **Feasibility**: Can we actually get data/insights on this?
3. **Influence**: Is this within our control to change?
4. **Resources**: Is this worth the time investment?

Stay focused on the Overriding Question - every branch kept should help answer it.

## CHC Case Study: Issue Tree Example

**Overriding Question**: How can CHC identify best practices in acquired firms and analyze benefits?

**Level 1 Issues**:
1. How optimal is the current due diligence acquisition review process?
2. How can CHC develop a consistent framework for evaluating integrations?
3. Are there effective tools to expedite decision making?

**Level 2 Breakdown** (for Issue 1):
- How is cross-pollination of ideas encouraged?
- How can we adequately resource the acquisition review process?

**Level 3 Detail** (for resourcing):
- Do project resources retain their old roles?
- Is external SME help available?

This structure ensures every aspect of the best practice identification challenge is systematically addressed.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Non-MECE categories**: "Customer issues" and "Service issues" likely overlap
2. **Too shallow**: Stopping at high-level categories without actionable detail
3. **Too detailed too soon**: Creating 5 levels when 3 would suffice
4. **Forgetting to prune**: Keeping every possible issue instead of focusing

## Key Insight

Issue trees transform overwhelming problems into a series of manageable questions. By ensuring MECE coverage, you gain confidence that your analysis will be comprehensive while remaining focused on what matters most.
