## The Core Philosophy

"A good problem statement will help the team to stay focused on the right things." The foundation of effective problem solving lies not in jumping to solutions, but in precisely defining what problem you're actually trying to solve. Without clarity on the problem, all subsequent analysis risks addressing the wrong issues.

## The SCQ Framework

The **Situation-Complication-Question (SCQ)** framework provides a structured approach to problem definition:

### Situation
The context or background that everyone can agree on. This establishes common ground and sets the stage.

### Complication  
What has changed or what tension exists that creates the need for action. This is the "but..." that disrupts the status quo.

### Overriding Question
The key question that, if answered, would resolve the complication and guide action.

## Characteristics of a Good Problem Statement

A well-crafted problem statement exhibits these qualities:

- **A leading question or firm hypothesis** - Not just describing a situation
- **Specific not general** - Focused enough to guide analysis
- **Content based** - Grounded in the actual business context
- **Actionable** - Points toward possible solutions
- **Focused on what the decision maker needs** - Addresses the real need to move forward

## Mental Model: Problem Statement Quality

**Poor Problem Statement:** "We need to improve our operations"
**Good Problem Statement:** "How can we reduce order fulfillment time by 30% while maintaining quality standards?"

### Decision Framework
When crafting a problem statement, ask:
1. Does it end with a question that demands an answer?
2. Could someone outside the situation understand what needs to be solved?
3. Does it imply measurable success criteria?
4. Would solving this actually address the decision maker's needs?

## Real-World Application: CHC Case Study

The framework shows this progression in the CHC acquisition example:

### Situation
- CHC has been acquiring companies and growing
- CHC has a streamlined process for integrating acquisitions
- Process focuses on Operations, Legal, Regulatory, Financial, and Marketing

### Complication  
- Some acquired companies have better processes than CHC
- Current integration doesn't include business process review
- Missing potential value-add ideas or "Best Practices" from acquisitions

### Overriding Question
"How can CHC identify best practices in acquired firms and analyze the benefits of incorporating those best practices into wider CHC operations?"

This question is:
- **Specific**: About best practice identification and benefit analysis
- **Actionable**: Points to a clear process need
- **Valuable**: Addresses missed opportunities in acquisitions

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Starting too broad**: "How can we be more successful?"
2. **Focusing on symptoms**: "How can we stop losing customers?" vs. "Why are customers leaving?"
3. **Embedding solutions**: "Should we implement System X?" vs. "How can we improve process efficiency?"
4. **Ignoring the decision maker**: Solving problems that don't help key stakeholders move forward

## Key Insight

The problem definition stage is not about finding answersâ€”it's about finding the right question. A well-defined problem is already half-solved because it focuses all subsequent effort on what truly matters.
