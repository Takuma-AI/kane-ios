# Issue-Based Problem Solving - Framework Index

**Source:** Kearney Consulting Lab Training  
**Type:** Framework/Methodology  
**Theme:** Systematic approach to analytical business problem solving  
**Date:** Spring 2025  

## Overview

This framework presents a structured approach to efficiently address analytical business problems through hypothesis-driven issue decomposition. It demonstrates how consultants break down complex challenges into MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) components for systematic analysis.

## Framework Categories

### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Definition & Structuring**
- [Chapter 1: Define the Problem](01_define-the-problem.md) - SCQ framework and problem statements
- [Chapter 2: Issue Tree Analysis](02_issue-tree-analysis.md) - MECE decomposition and issue structuring
- [Chapter 3: Hypothesis Generation](03_hypothesis-generation.md) - Creating testable hypotheses

### ðŸ“Š **Data & Analysis**
- [Chapter 4: Analytical Framework](04_analytical-framework.md) - Structuring analysis and key questions
- [Chapter 5: Develop Fact Base](05_develop-fact-base.md) - Data collection and sourcing strategies
- [Chapter 6: Analyze Data](06_analyze-data.md) - Analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis

### ðŸ’¡ **Synthesis & Communication**
- [Chapter 7: Develop Recommendations](07_develop-recommendations.md) - Creating compelling stories and implementation plans

## Core Mental Models

1. **MECE Thinking**: Breaking problems into mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive components
2. **Hypothesis-Driven Analysis**: Starting with testable conclusions rather than open-ended research
3. **Issue Trees**: Hierarchical problem decomposition for comprehensive analysis
4. **SCQ Framework**: Situation â†’ Complication â†’ Question structure for clarity
5. **Pyramid Principle**: Conclusions first, supported by grouped evidence
