## The Core Philosophy

"Hypotheses driven approach allows effective utilization of time and resources to solve a problem." Instead of boiling the ocean with open-ended research, hypothesis-driven problem solving starts with educated guesses about the answer, then systematically tests them. This focuses effort on proving or disproving specific assertions rather than gathering data hoping insights will emerge.

## What Makes a Good Hypothesis

Each hypothesis should be:

### Conclusive
A potential conclusion about the problem/opportunity - not just a restatement of the issue.
- **Weak**: "Customer satisfaction might be important"  
- **Strong**: "Customer churn is driven primarily by delivery delays"

### Testable
Can we actually prove or disprove this with available data and methods?
- **Weak**: "Our culture needs improvement"
- **Strong**: "Employee productivity drops 20% in open office layouts"

### Useful
Will proving this help solve the actual problem?
- **Weak**: "Our logo color affects sales" (when selling B2B software)
- **Strong**: "Reducing checkout steps from 5 to 3 will increase conversion 15%"

### Comprehensive
Have we covered all angles identified in our issue tree?
- Check each issue/sub-issue has at least one hypothesis
- Ensure hypotheses collectively address the overriding question

## Mental Model: Hypothesis-First Thinking

**Traditional Approach**: Gather all data → Analyze → Draw conclusions
**Hypothesis-Driven**: Form hypothesis → Identify needed data → Test specifically

### Benefits of Hypothesis-First
1. **Focuses data collection** - Only gather what's needed to test
2. **Accelerates insights** - Know what you're looking for
3. **Enables parallel work** - Team members can test different hypotheses
4. **Forces clarity** - Must be specific about expected outcomes

## From Issues to Hypotheses

The transformation follows this pattern:

**Issue**: "How can we adequately resource the acquisition review process?"

**Sub-Issues**:
- Do people retain their old roles?
- Is there skills mismatch?
- Do we use external help?

**Hypotheses**:
- "People retain their old roles in addition to integration roles" 
- "There is a mismatch of roles and expertise"
- "CHC does not hire external expertise"

Note how hypotheses are **statements** not questions - they assert what we believe might be true.

## Building Comprehensive Hypothesis Trees

### Structure Example
```
Issue: Resource adequacy
├─ Hypothesis: People retain old roles
│  └─ Key Questions: 
│     - Do team members allocate time to old jobs?
│     - Are replacements appointed?
├─ Hypothesis: Skills mismatch exists
│  └─ Key Questions:
│     - What skills are needed vs. available?
│     - Is training provided?
└─ Hypothesis: No external help used
   └─ Key Questions:
     - Is there budget for assistance?
     - Is there cultural resistance?
```

## Developing Key Questions

For each hypothesis, identify questions whose answers will prove or disprove it:

### Check Questions
Ensure the hypothesis is validated for the right reasons
- Not just correlation but causation
- Not just symptoms but root causes

### Specific Questions
Must be answerable with available data/research
- Quantifiable where possible
- Clear yes/no or measurable outcome

### Example Progression
**Hypothesis**: "CHC does not hire external expertise"

**Key Questions**:
1. Is there budget for external assistance? (Factual)
2. Is there cultural resistance to outside help? (Cultural)
3. Have past external engagements been successful? (Historical)
4. What do competitors do? (Benchmark)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Vague hypotheses**: "Things could be better" - Not testable or useful
2. **Solution hypotheses**: "We should implement SAP" - Jumping to solutions
3. **Untestable assertions**: "Morale affects everything" - Too broad to prove
4. **Missing hypotheses**: Gaps in issue coverage leading to blind spots

## The Power of Being Wrong

A disproven hypothesis is as valuable as a proven one:
- Eliminates false paths quickly
- Redirects resources to better options
- Builds confidence in what remains
- Often reveals unexpected insights

"The goal isn't to be right with your initial hypotheses - it's to get to the right answer efficiently."

## Key Insight

Hypotheses transform analysis from an fishing expedition into a targeted investigation. By stating what you think might be true upfront, you create a clear path to either confirm your understanding or discover where you're wrong - both valuable outcomes achieved faster than exploratory analysis.
