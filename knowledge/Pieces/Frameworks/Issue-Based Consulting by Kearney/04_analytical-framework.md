## The Core Philosophy

"In order to structure the analysis, identify questions whose answers will either prove or disprove each hypothesis in the tree." The analytical framework transforms hypotheses into specific, actionable analysis plans. It bridges the gap between what you think might be true and how you'll actually test it.

## Visualizing Analytical Outcomes

Before diving into analysis, visualize what the end result should look like. This "begin with the end in mind" approach ensures purposeful data collection.

### The Visualization Process
1. **Sketch the charts/tables** that would prove or disprove your hypothesis
2. **Identify the exact data** needed to create those visualizations  
3. **Determine data sources** before requesting anything
4. **Design the analysis** that transforms raw data into insights

## Components of an Analytical Framework

### Issue Tree → Analytical Framework → Data Source

Each hypothesis needs:

**Key Questions**
- Specific queries that test the hypothesis
- Must have definitive answers
- Lead directly to proof/disproof

**Analysis Required**
- Statistical tests
- Comparisons
- Trend analysis
- Correlation studies
- Process mapping

**Data Sources** (in order of preference)
1. Internal company data
2. External benchmarks
3. Expert interviews
4. Research/studies
5. Estimates and assumptions

## Mental Model: Analysis Design

**Poor Approach**: "Let's gather all available data and see what we find"
**Structured Approach**: "To test X hypothesis, we need Y analysis using Z data"

### Decision Framework
For each hypothesis, ask:
1. What would convince a skeptic this is true/false?
2. What specific analysis would provide that evidence?
3. What's the minimum data needed for that analysis?
4. Where can we reliably get that data?

## Necessity and Sufficiency Testing

Create a matrix mapping hypotheses to data sources to ensure:

### Necessity
Every hypothesis has at least one data source to test it
- No orphan hypotheses
- No untestable assertions

### Sufficiency  
The data sources collectively can answer all key questions
- No gaps in evidence
- Multiple sources for critical hypotheses

### Example Matrix
```
                    Data Sources
                    Financial | Interviews | Benchmarks | Surveys
Hypothesis A        ✓         ✓            
Hypothesis B        ✓                      ✓
Hypothesis C                  ✓            ✓           ✓
```

## CHC Case Study: Analytical Framework

**Sub-Issue**: "How can we adequately resource the acquisition review process?"

**Hypothesis**: "People retain their old roles in addition to integration roles"

**Key Questions**:
- Do team members allocate time to their old jobs?
- Are replacements appointed to their old jobs?

**Analysis Required**:
- Time allocation study
- Organization chart comparison (before/after acquisition)
- Role responsibility mapping

**Data Sources**:
1. Acquisition team calendars/timesheets
2. HR records on temporary replacements
3. Interviews with team members
4. Project resource allocation documents

## Analytical Techniques Toolbox

The framework mentions various analytical approaches:

### Statistical Analysis
- Correlation/Regression (Linear, Non-Linear, Logistic)
- Forecasting (Moving Averages, Trend, Seasonality)
- Probability distributions
- Monte Carlo simulation

### Process Analysis  
- Value stream mapping
- Process control (Cp/Cpk)
- Root-cause analysis
- FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)

### Optimization
- Linear/Non-linear optimization
- Economic Order Quantity
- Economic Batch Quantity

### Other Analysis
- Marketing analytics (Conjoint, Cluster, RFM)
- SWOT analysis
- Sensitivity analysis

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Analysis for analysis sake**: Complex models that don't directly test hypotheses
2. **Data availability driving analysis**: Analyzing what's easy rather than what's needed
3. **Over-engineering**: Using regression when simple comparison would suffice
4. **Under-specifying**: "Analyze customer data" vs. "Compare churn rates by segment"

## Key Insight

The analytical framework is where strategy meets execution. A well-designed framework ensures every piece of analysis has a purpose: proving or disproving specific hypotheses that answer your overriding question. Without this framework, analysis becomes an expensive fishing expedition.
