WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.120
We have this new technology, LLMs,

00:02.120 --> 00:05.240
that I think are as transformative as the printing press,

00:05.240 --> 00:07.520
electricity in the internet, and we have a choice.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.160
We can go down the path that we've been going down,

00:09.160 --> 00:12.360
which is engagement maximizing, hyper aggregation,

00:12.360 --> 00:14.640
going after what you want, not what you want to want

00:14.640 --> 00:17.880
as a user, or being aligned with our intentions.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.680
And that could lead to a new era of human flourishing, I think.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.440
I intend to spend quality time with my family,

00:22.440 --> 00:24.840
and intend to experience new things,

00:24.840 --> 00:27.520
the right product fabric could enable that.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.560
But that has to be fully aligned with you.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.680
Imagine if that context, all of that rich substrate

00:32.680 --> 00:34.880
of meaning that you've distilled and written down.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.480
If it's not working for you, that's terrifying.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.200
I would run onto the stage where Steve Jobs

00:39.200 --> 00:41.360
shows off the iPhone, which was a poster that says,

00:41.360 --> 00:43.480
this will become the most important computing device

00:43.480 --> 00:46.680
on Earth, it is insane to allow a single company

00:46.680 --> 00:49.000
to decide what things you may run in it, right?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.280
I know it feels like in this industry

00:50.280 --> 00:52.920
that we're like halfway through the LLM era.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.520
We are in the very first inning.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.000
We're like rubbing sticks together.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.760
We still think that chatbots are the main thing.

00:57.760 --> 00:58.880
Will chatbots be important?

00:58.880 --> 00:59.680
Yes.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.120
But chatbots to me feel like a feature or not a paradigm.

01:02.120 --> 01:18.840
This podcast is supported by Google.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.000
Hey, everyone.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.960
David here, one of the product leads for Google Gemini.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.200
Alex, welcome to the show.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.640
Thanks for having me.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.640
So for people who don't know you,

01:49.640 --> 01:52.040
you are the co-founder and CEO of Common Tools,

01:52.040 --> 01:53.840
which you'll describe for us.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.720
You are also previously the head of corporate strategy

01:56.720 --> 01:59.560
at Stripe and director of product management at Google.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.200
And I think like six months ago,

02:02.200 --> 02:05.000
and the thing that really stood out in our conversation,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.760
aside from just like, you have so many interesting ideas

02:07.760 --> 02:10.760
is you're this really interesting systems builder.

02:10.760 --> 02:14.680
You think a lot about personal systems, work systems,

02:14.680 --> 02:16.760
things that help you get more done,

02:16.760 --> 02:18.880
or think differently about the world.

02:18.880 --> 02:23.240
And I think people like you who have that kind of obsessive

02:23.240 --> 02:25.800
mind with systems is something that I recognize myself.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.560
And also I think are people who have a lot of interesting things

02:29.560 --> 02:32.640
to say about just new AI ways,

02:32.640 --> 02:36.120
because I think it's sort of like steroids or catnip

02:36.120 --> 02:37.680
or whatever you want to say.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.880
Some kind of a teller in, for sure.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.960
For people like us, I'm excited to chat with you.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.520
I'm excited to hear both what you're thinking about now,

02:45.520 --> 02:48.680
what you're building, and what kinds of systems

02:48.680 --> 02:50.320
you're familiar with personally.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.560
Yeah, cool.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.200
So when we start with common tools,

02:53.200 --> 02:57.400
because I think there's something interesting about your,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.920
like what you're building, because I think it speaks

02:59.920 --> 03:01.240
to the perspective you have probably

03:01.240 --> 03:03.960
about this larger AI way of talking about it.

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
Yeah, the way I think about it,

03:04.960 --> 03:06.160
and it's hard to describe,

03:06.160 --> 03:07.480
because we've had to build a new kind of thing

03:07.480 --> 03:09.600
that's only possible in the world of AI.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.600
So when I describe it, we'll say,

03:10.600 --> 03:11.440
oh, you're being coy.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.920
It's like, no, tell you what I'm building.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.600
It's just a new kind of thing it's hard to grab onto.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.320
I think of it like a coactive fabric for your digital life.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.080
And by coactive, that's an old word

03:22.080 --> 03:23.000
that I hadn't heard before,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.240
but I think is a perfect fit for it of you

03:26.240 --> 03:27.320
are active in the system.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.080
And so is this emergent intelligent process,

03:30.080 --> 03:32.480
or private intelligence powered by LOMs.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.960
And those can be coactive on the same substrate

03:34.960 --> 03:38.000
in adding detail or adding the little bits of software

03:38.000 --> 03:39.560
or connecting up things.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.480
And I think that that really unpacks

03:41.480 --> 03:44.320
or unlocks the power of LOMs.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.680
That's, I love that word, and it's interesting,

03:46.680 --> 03:48.280
because I think we're finding some similar

03:48.280 --> 03:50.200
for some of the products we're incubating internally

03:50.200 --> 03:53.280
is like, right now the paradigm is,

03:53.280 --> 03:55.760
you sense willing to touch and tee and it sends something back.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.360
Maybe it now it sends something back after 10 minutes,

03:59.360 --> 04:00.720
which is a new thing,

04:00.720 --> 04:03.160
but it's not like you're not working in parallel.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.360
It's not like working in the background

04:04.360 --> 04:05.640
and then being like, I had this idea.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.160
And we're starting to like,

04:07.160 --> 04:10.560
as we build our own sort of agentic systems inside of every

04:10.560 --> 04:13.680
for your email or for writing or whatever,

04:13.680 --> 04:16.840
we're finding that having something that's working

04:16.920 --> 04:20.960
while you work with you and being a little bit more proactive

04:20.960 --> 04:24.840
is actually a really interesting next paradigm.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.880
Yeah, to me, I mean, if you say,

04:26.880 --> 04:29.680
okay, we have LOMs, what's the first product

04:29.680 --> 04:31.360
in 10 seconds to go chatbots?

04:31.360 --> 04:32.960
It's those obvious extension

04:32.960 --> 04:35.160
and everybody is focusing only on chatbots.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.400
Like will chatbots be important?

04:36.400 --> 04:40.160
Yes, but chatbots to me feel like a feature, not a paradigm.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.840
And they are, so like they're like this coactive surface,

04:43.840 --> 04:45.040
but it's just append only.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.760
I append a message, it depends a message.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.240
I append a message, it depends a message.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.320
And literally back and forth, it doesn't have a way

04:50.320 --> 04:53.160
to like have multiple for me in a row.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.520
And you know, chatbots are amazing for starting any task

04:56.520 --> 04:57.680
because there's no structure.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.080
You just say whatever you're thinking

04:59.080 --> 05:01.160
and it helps to still and respond.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.320
But for long live tasks, you need structure.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.800
You want there to be something where you can glance over

05:05.800 --> 05:06.880
and you know, a little cubby hole

05:06.880 --> 05:08.560
where you put certain information.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.960
I find, I have, you know,

05:10.920 --> 05:12.560
I do dozens and dozens and dozens of chats

05:12.560 --> 05:14.560
with Chat2BT and Claw today.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.640
And I'm just swimming in all that context

05:16.640 --> 05:18.480
and all the chats.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.240
And so I'm using it to do important things.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.520
And also, I'm just completely lost in it

05:22.520 --> 05:25.640
because it's only this chatbot kind of penned only

05:25.640 --> 05:27.160
kind of paradigm.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.120
You have this really cool thing called bits and bobs,

05:30.120 --> 05:32.480
which is this like real time Google doc

05:32.480 --> 05:34.440
that you just have been updating for.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.960
I think like many years at this point

05:36.960 --> 05:39.400
with things that you're thinking about,

05:39.400 --> 05:41.160
which we'll link to in the show notes and I love.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.520
I think it's, I think it's really cool

05:42.520 --> 05:44.960
and really inspiring just sort of the rawness of that.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.680
And one of the things that's in that Google doc right now

05:48.680 --> 05:50.600
about what you're thinking about is the idea

05:50.600 --> 05:54.000
of intentional tech, which Adoptel is really nice to you

05:54.000 --> 05:55.160
with something that I've been thinking about,

05:55.160 --> 05:58.840
which is this idea that AI has,

05:58.840 --> 06:00.200
is this new era of technology

06:00.200 --> 06:03.640
where technology can understand our stated preference,

06:03.640 --> 06:04.880
stated preferences, which is different

06:04.880 --> 06:05.880
from the social media era,

06:05.880 --> 06:07.920
which worked totally just on-

06:07.920 --> 06:10.960
What you dwell on and what you clicked on, whatever.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.120
And so social media tends to make us

06:14.080 --> 06:17.680
tends to service things that are like more outrage driven

06:17.680 --> 06:20.080
or more like sexier or whatever.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.800
Anything that's more eye, yeah, like the car crash effect,

06:22.800 --> 06:24.360
basically.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.600
And AI, because it can talk to us,

06:27.600 --> 06:30.280
gets a much richer understanding of who we are,

06:30.280 --> 06:33.800
maybe like I think TouchEBT is much more helpful

06:33.800 --> 06:36.800
and much more enlightening, for example,

06:36.800 --> 06:39.560
than like the Facebook algorithm is just by default.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.600
So I think that Dovetel's a lot

06:41.600 --> 06:43.600
with what you've been thinking about with intentional tech.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.280
So tell us what's on your mind about it.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.800
Yeah, intentional tech, I think,

06:47.800 --> 06:49.800
is really critical in this new era.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.320
We're at a crossroads as a technology industry.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.680
I think we have this new technology, LLMs,

06:54.680 --> 06:56.560
that I think are as transformative

06:56.560 --> 06:59.520
as the printing press, electricity in the internet.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.880
So it's this big general purpose unlock

07:01.880 --> 07:04.360
for all kinds of stuff that wasn't possible for.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.200
And we have a choice.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.800
We can go down the path that we've been going down,

07:06.800 --> 07:10.000
which is engagement maximizing, hyper aggregation,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.560
going after what you want, not what you want to want

07:12.560 --> 07:16.160
as a user, or being aligned with our intentions.

07:16.160 --> 07:19.560
And that could lead to a new era of human flourishing, I think.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.880
This is not the default path, by the way.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.720
We will have to choose it.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.080
We'll have to work to build that.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.960
And that's why I think intentional tech is so important

07:24.960 --> 07:28.120
because we want technology that aligns with our intentions.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.760
Not necessarily what I want, my revealed preference

07:31.760 --> 07:33.480
of like looking at the car crashes or whatever,

07:33.480 --> 07:34.680
but what I intend to do,

07:34.680 --> 07:36.440
I intend to spend quality time with my family,

07:36.440 --> 07:40.080
and intend to experience new things.

07:40.080 --> 07:43.720
I intend to read interesting takes that disagree,

07:43.720 --> 07:44.960
that it can be disconfirming evidence

07:44.960 --> 07:46.400
that challenge my worldviews.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.560
Those are some of the things I intend.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.080
That's what I find meaningful to do.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.520
And it's very easy to fall out of that.

07:50.520 --> 07:54.640
But LLM's I think with the right product fabric

07:54.640 --> 07:56.120
could enable that.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.440
Another important part of this is it aligns with your intentions

07:58.440 --> 08:01.520
as in it is working for me is an extension of me.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.720
I heard a word last week, I love of exo cortex.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.160
It's like an extent, you're caught in the exoskeleton.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.240
But that has to be fully aligned with you.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.320
Imagine if that context, all of that rich substrate

08:11.320 --> 08:13.400
of meaning that you've distilled and written down

08:13.400 --> 08:15.760
that's all about the things you care about

08:15.760 --> 08:17.440
and all these facts about you.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.280
It was not working for you, that's terrifying.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.440
Like I saw someone a few weeks ago

08:22.440 --> 08:24.440
at one of the big tech companies said,

08:24.440 --> 08:29.120
we're making our tool personal, proactive, powerful.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.400
It's like, well, let me stop you right there

08:30.400 --> 08:32.320
because the very first word personal

08:32.320 --> 08:33.440
doesn't actually align

08:33.440 --> 08:34.960
because you are a massive corporation

08:35.040 --> 08:36.360
that's trying to sell me ads.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.120
And if you're maintaining a dossier on me

08:38.120 --> 08:40.440
and then that dossier is leading to a powerful

08:40.440 --> 08:42.600
and proactive thing, that's terrifying.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.000
Whereas if it's working just for me

08:44.000 --> 08:46.400
of the extension of my direct agency,

08:46.400 --> 08:47.760
that's really empowering.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.880
And I think that's one of the reasons

08:48.880 --> 08:51.360
intentional tech is so important at this era.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.040
That's really interesting.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.240
And tell me more about like,

08:55.240 --> 08:57.280
because when I think about this,

08:57.280 --> 08:59.440
one of the words that comes up,

08:59.440 --> 09:00.840
you talk about alignment,

09:01.760 --> 09:05.680
is that AI started,

09:05.680 --> 09:08.160
or this generation of AI started with alignment

09:08.160 --> 09:12.040
or alignment with human preferences at its core

09:12.040 --> 09:14.400
because we were all afraid that AI was going to kill us.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.160
And now it's like, well, it might not kill us,

09:16.160 --> 09:17.520
but maybe it'll just serve us ads

09:17.520 --> 09:19.160
that will make us dumber,

09:19.160 --> 09:21.280
send our money in ways that we shouldn't have whatever.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.640
So I'm kind of curious what you think has to happen

09:24.640 --> 09:29.640
to make us go on this sort of more intentional path.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.800
To me, it's alignment, I think it's fun.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.800
Yeah, we use it for the underlying LLM model.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.840
I think there's two layers.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.240
There's the model itself,

09:37.240 --> 09:39.360
which is, if you imagine this as a stateless thing

09:39.360 --> 09:41.680
that you send a query to when it gives you back a response,

09:41.680 --> 09:43.720
it doesn't store any state,

09:43.720 --> 09:46.000
then you have alignment problems of like,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.960
what kind of biases are baked into it and what have you?

09:48.960 --> 09:51.280
But then there's a layer on top, which is your context.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.000
And that is the thing that is a valuable bit of information

09:54.000 --> 09:55.160
about you that changes,

09:55.160 --> 09:56.640
it has lots of rich meaning on it.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.640
These are two separate layers, I think.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.800
And so I am more interested in this layer at the top

10:00.800 --> 10:02.960
and assuming if you have multiple LLMs

10:02.960 --> 10:04.600
that you can choose and swap between

10:04.600 --> 10:05.960
that don't remember anything about you,

10:05.960 --> 10:06.800
then it's fine.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.040
You can swap between different ones

10:08.040 --> 10:09.600
and that matters less to me.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.160
Where context is, the place that's all aggregated

10:13.160 --> 10:15.040
is I think more important.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.880
Well, that's an interesting architectural question.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.920
Like right now, language models are stateless.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.560
Do you think like in five years, for example,

10:22.560 --> 10:25.880
they're still gonna be these sort of stateless intelligence boxes

10:25.880 --> 10:28.040
or do you think they're gonna be auto updating their weights?

10:28.040 --> 10:29.400
For example, as you talk to them.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.480
I don't know about auto updating their weights

10:31.480 --> 10:33.560
and this might be there's an architectural breakthrough

10:33.560 --> 10:34.840
but this is one of the things that's weird

10:34.840 --> 10:37.680
about these models is that they do take a long time to bake.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.960
So like they have this weird paste layer down at the bottom

10:39.960 --> 10:42.600
that's like months behind on training data

10:42.600 --> 10:44.160
and it just takes time for it to bake.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.360
And then you have these layers on top

10:46.360 --> 10:48.400
that the system prompts now, like in chat,

10:48.400 --> 10:51.040
GPT will inject a little bits of your context,

10:51.040 --> 10:52.960
a weird bit that by the way, you cannot inspect,

10:52.960 --> 10:54.440
which is kind of funky, right?

10:54.440 --> 10:57.280
Like if you ask it, hey, what context about me

10:57.280 --> 10:58.120
did you put it in there?

10:58.120 --> 10:58.960
It's like, I can't tell you.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.440
Like that's creepy, right?

11:00.440 --> 11:02.360
I can't do that Dave, you know?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.520
And Simon Willis and we were chatting last week

11:04.520 --> 11:07.080
and he's got some prompt that will extract out

11:07.080 --> 11:08.520
this dossier about you.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.440
It includes things about stuff you said in the past.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.400
It could include things like your insecure about your weight,

11:13.400 --> 11:15.240
you know, these things about you.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.880
And then it also says in the last,

11:18.080 --> 11:20.520
in the last five weeks,

11:20.520 --> 11:23.440
9% of your interactions with the chatbot have been bad.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.240
As in, you've been trying to manipulate it or whatever.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.960
Like, I don't know, it's weird seeing this view

11:27.960 --> 11:29.520
into this for yourself.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.320
So I think chat GPT and others are very clearly

11:32.320 --> 11:35.120
trying to move merges together

11:35.120 --> 11:37.760
so that you have all your context in chat GPT

11:37.760 --> 11:39.080
and it's hard to leave.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.560
That I think gets more problematic,

11:40.560 --> 11:42.280
especially if you're going down

11:42.280 --> 11:44.080
an engagement maximizing kind of playbook,

11:44.080 --> 11:45.960
which, I mean, a bunch of, you know,

11:45.960 --> 11:50.240
the executives from Facebook now run

11:50.240 --> 11:52.240
three of the four big chatbots, you know?

11:53.360 --> 11:55.600
I think go back a step to meaningful computing

11:55.600 --> 11:57.160
as four major components to me.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.800
One is it's human centered, not corporation centered,

11:59.800 --> 12:02.000
centered around me and my intentions.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.800
Two is it is private by design.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.280
That means that the data is only for me to see,

12:09.280 --> 12:11.080
it's for me to bring where I want to bring

12:11.080 --> 12:13.640
and to choose who gets to see it,

12:13.640 --> 12:15.800
using techniques like confidential computing

12:15.800 --> 12:18.840
to make sure it is entirely private.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.040
It has to be prosocial.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.120
It has to be something that helps you live a life

12:22.120 --> 12:25.000
integrated with society, not just being this hyper individualized

12:25.000 --> 12:26.720
kind of, you know, a little island to yourself,

12:26.720 --> 12:29.200
but integrate with society in a meaningful way.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.200
And the last piece, which I'm going to remember

12:32.200 --> 12:36.240
from my head, is it also is open ended.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.160
It has to be something that allows you to explore

12:39.160 --> 12:41.680
and to build and to create new experiences within it.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.720
The way that our software works today

12:43.720 --> 12:47.360
is only the entity that created the software

12:47.360 --> 12:48.680
is allowed to decide what kinds of things

12:48.680 --> 12:50.120
you can do in the software.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.720
And that's due to the security model

12:51.720 --> 12:54.000
of how all of our software has worked

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
the last 30 years, but that kind of closed-endedness

12:57.000 --> 12:59.760
means that you had to convince some PM somewhere

12:59.760 --> 13:02.000
to a prioritized or a feature,

13:02.000 --> 13:03.440
which if it's particularly niche,

13:03.440 --> 13:05.040
probably hasn't been, probably hasn't happened.

13:05.040 --> 13:08.320
Okay, well, there's a lot of things that I would love

13:08.320 --> 13:12.000
I would love to dig into it, dig into all those points.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.640
But the big one that stands out to me is,

13:16.320 --> 13:19.120
right now we live in a world where in order to get this

13:19.120 --> 13:20.960
great new technology that's advancing

13:20.960 --> 13:22.920
at this really rapid pace,

13:22.920 --> 13:26.720
we have to get it from well-funded startups

13:26.720 --> 13:28.600
that have a profit motive.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.840
And I know OpenAI is a non-profit, but like, you know,

13:30.840 --> 13:31.840
whatever.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.600
I think that's what they say, too.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
Yeah, whatever.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.760
Clearly they're being run like a startup.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.480
And I guess for me, like, I don't think that's a bad thing,

13:42.480 --> 13:47.320
but it sounds like at least one way to read what you're saying

13:47.320 --> 13:52.320
is we have to get rid of the sort of like corporate startup

13:53.000 --> 13:56.560
structure for these technologies to be made in a sort of social way.

13:56.560 --> 14:00.240
Like, how do you envision this being made us being able to make

14:00.240 --> 14:04.240
these decisions in terms of what kinds of corporate structures

14:04.240 --> 14:07.200
or startups or nonprofits or whatever are controlling

14:07.200 --> 14:10.000
and building these things to get the outcome that you're talking about?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.560
I think it's compatible with being a business.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.840
So for example, we're charted as a public-benefit corporation.

14:13.840 --> 14:14.840
Yeah.

14:14.840 --> 14:19.160
The, to me, it is what's most important is that users are paying

14:19.160 --> 14:21.280
for their, like, it's not free.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.800
If you aren't paying for your compute and it's not working for you,

14:23.800 --> 14:24.920
it's working for somebody else.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.800
That just so happens to think that giving it to you is a benefit.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.240
Now, it doesn't mean that's a necessary but not sufficient

14:31.240 --> 14:35.280
characteristic because I think Chat GBT's the playbook that they're executing

14:35.280 --> 14:37.840
is one that is about engagement maximizing and making you

14:37.840 --> 14:40.000
secure to the service and what have you.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.560
But you paying for your own compute is a necessary component of it

14:42.560 --> 14:45.040
to make sure that it's actually truly just working for you.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.120
That's where also that privacy really matters of your data

14:48.120 --> 14:50.720
is visible only to you with your keys.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.120
This does not necessarily mean, by the way,

14:52.120 --> 14:54.120
people have historically in the past said,

14:54.120 --> 14:55.720
oh, that means it has to be local first.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.080
I love the local first movement.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.280
I'm very aligned with its ideals and ethos.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.040
Local first is really hard for a couple of reasons.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.600
One, architecturally, it's very challenging to have a bunch of peers

15:04.600 --> 15:06.080
that have to have a visual consistency.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.080
You don't know when they're going to sync back up.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.080
It's very hard to build consumer product experiences

15:10.080 --> 15:12.040
that work the way that people expect.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.120
And two, is it's inconvenient.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.520
If you got to run your local server and your laptop

15:16.520 --> 15:19.160
isn't plugged into the network when you're on your phone

15:19.160 --> 15:20.680
or whatever, the thing doesn't work.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.120
So actually, there are other architectures

15:22.120 --> 15:23.920
that can use things like confidential compute

15:23.920 --> 15:27.320
to run in the cloud in a way that can be remotely attested

15:27.320 --> 15:28.720
to be totally private to you

15:28.720 --> 15:30.920
and that nobody else can see into that data.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.120
And so those are some of the architectures

15:32.120 --> 15:35.280
that allow a full alignment with the humans.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.800
Okay, so basically, you're saying

15:38.880 --> 15:43.240
ChatRBT is doing some of this.

15:43.240 --> 15:47.120
So they're starting with a subscription model.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.240
But there are things that they're doing.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.120
What are they doing that you think is aimed at maximizing

15:52.120 --> 15:52.960
engagement?

15:52.960 --> 15:55.280
I definitely understand the kind of memory thing

15:55.280 --> 15:57.560
I want to keep using ChatRBT because it remembers who I am.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.400
I love that part of it.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.080
What are the things that they're doing in the decisions

16:01.080 --> 16:03.280
that they're making that tell you

16:03.280 --> 16:06.480
that they're going down this engagement maximizing path

16:06.480 --> 16:07.720
that will lead to a bad place?

16:07.720 --> 16:09.360
I think the engagement maximizing path

16:09.360 --> 16:10.360
is just the default path.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.200
So I don't think, by the way,

16:11.200 --> 16:12.360
there's anything particularly, they're like,

16:12.360 --> 16:13.520
oh, here's a dastardly player.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.000
This is how you do tech now, right?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.600
You're like, in the last 10 years,

16:17.600 --> 16:20.200
we just realized aggregators are a really powerful business.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.440
And they want to consume all of the demand

16:22.440 --> 16:24.400
so that all the supply comes to them.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.520
And that's a great business.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.160
I mean, if I were sitting at their seat,

16:27.160 --> 16:28.400
I can totally see why they would do it.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.800
Like, that's, again, it's not in a various place,

16:29.800 --> 16:31.360
just the default thing that you would do.

16:31.360 --> 16:31.880
Yeah.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.880
I think if AI is this incredibly important technology

16:34.880 --> 16:37.680
that also knows all the intimate details of your life,

16:37.680 --> 16:39.840
that becomes especially important for it to be

16:39.840 --> 16:41.520
in an architecture that is not something

16:41.520 --> 16:44.760
that your, something that this other company can look at

16:44.760 --> 16:46.880
and maintain a dossier about you.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.000
Because that, it's just too easy to manipulate, right?

16:50.000 --> 16:54.560
Like, LMS can translate anything from anything.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.520
And that means they can also translate just for you

16:56.520 --> 16:58.640
to figure out exactly how to land a particular message

16:58.640 --> 17:00.200
for you, which means it's imperative

17:00.200 --> 17:02.280
that you know it's aligned with your intentions.

17:02.280 --> 17:06.000
And it's not going to try to like get you to do the,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.160
you know, the Mondo subscription

17:08.160 --> 17:10.560
or to go to one of the partners or what have you.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.000
Well, let's say you're, you're Sam Alman right now

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
and you're, you're in charge of open AI.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.880
What would be, what are the decisions

17:17.880 --> 17:22.600
that you would make tomorrow that would put you on a path

17:22.600 --> 17:24.480
that you think is actually right?

17:24.480 --> 17:25.320
All right.

17:25.320 --> 17:27.000
So if I were to say, I'm Alman, I would do what they're doing.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.720
And as in it's, I can see why it's a great business.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.680
I think we'll add a lot of value.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.360
That's why I see this as a complimentary approach

17:33.360 --> 17:36.560
to some degree, a baking a system that is a coactive system

17:36.560 --> 17:39.360
that's just working for you that is not just chat.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.680
I can be a complimentary thing to these other systems.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.680
I wouldn't say, oh, you should change what you're doing,

17:44.680 --> 17:46.480
because I think actually what they're doing

17:46.480 --> 17:47.680
is a reasonable thing.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.720
This model that they're creating,

17:49.720 --> 17:52.280
especially because they're available via the API

17:52.280 --> 17:53.720
with no memory stored to them.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.360
That's an important characteristic.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.200
It's great.

17:56.200 --> 18:01.480
It makes a really powerful underlying engine

18:01.480 --> 18:04.280
that can be used to power lots of other products,

18:04.280 --> 18:06.160
especially to the extent that there's multiple

18:06.160 --> 18:08.240
that we can swap between, you know, get stuck with it.

18:08.240 --> 18:13.160
So you think that there's a call for a complimentary technology,

18:13.160 --> 18:15.960
technology provider, set of technology providers

18:15.960 --> 18:19.880
that allow you to take all of the context

18:19.880 --> 18:21.120
that you have, keep it private,

18:21.120 --> 18:23.920
and then bring it to any situation or service that you want.

18:23.920 --> 18:24.760
Yeah.

18:24.760 --> 18:28.120
I would say that my mental model is,

18:28.120 --> 18:30.600
oh, chat GPT is kind of the AOL of this era.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.000
So if you use the parallel of the internet in the web,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.400
AOL was an extremely important company.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.000
They're the ones that brought everybody online.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.200
America, the whole of America online,

18:40.200 --> 18:41.680
has amazing experience.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.960
It was somewhat of a wild garden,

18:42.960 --> 18:45.960
but it also gave you access to the open-endedness

18:45.960 --> 18:47.400
of the open web.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.640
And I think that's the kind of role that I see them playing.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.280
I hope that what we get out of this

18:53.280 --> 18:56.120
is not some closed ecosystem of hyper aggregation

18:56.120 --> 18:58.320
beyond even what we've seen to date,

18:58.320 --> 19:01.720
but instead we see this open ecosystem of things

19:01.720 --> 19:03.240
that are very user-aligned.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.080
Interesting.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.440
Why AOL versus Microsoft, for example?

19:06.440 --> 19:10.240
So Microsoft, I think in a similar way,

19:10.240 --> 19:12.760
not for the internet era, but for the PC era.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.240
I like taught people how to use computers

19:15.240 --> 19:19.680
and brought computers as a thing to most of America

19:19.680 --> 19:22.080
in the world and built a platform

19:22.080 --> 19:23.880
that everyone else is building on top of.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.120
So that's another kind of analogy.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.000
Why do you think AOL is more appropriate?

19:28.000 --> 19:32.240
I think AOL, the analogy that tracks to me best for LLMs

19:32.240 --> 19:33.080
is the internet.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.360
Like LLMs are the internet.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.400
There are new kind of thing that you can do.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.640
AOL, at the beginning, when I first started using it

19:38.640 --> 19:40.760
like second-grader, whatever it was about, chat rooms.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.080
And you could do whatever the AOL is.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.080
Birds or whatever.

19:43.080 --> 19:47.280
ASL, and that was what I thought the internet was.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.800
And then it turns out, as I learned later,

19:48.800 --> 19:52.080
I was like, whoa, this is a whole crazy open ecosystem

19:52.080 --> 19:55.200
that no one controls with all kinds of weird happening.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.520
And that was that open system of the web.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.440
And so in the same way, I see them as distributing

20:00.440 --> 20:02.000
this new technology to people, showing,

20:02.000 --> 20:02.840
yeah, look, chatbots.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.360
You can do these cool things with chatbots.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.080
And then later, you go, oh, wait a second.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.480
The same thing that animate the chatbots could be used

20:08.480 --> 20:10.320
to animate all kinds of new experiences.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.040
I didn't realize what possible for.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.960
That's one of the reasons I think that them

20:13.960 --> 20:15.520
as the AOL versus the migration.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.960
Why did AOL die?

20:16.960 --> 20:18.080
I don't remember.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.240
I think at a certain point, the open-endedness

20:21.240 --> 20:22.800
of the web could have took over.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.200
And it just became the point of like,

20:25.200 --> 20:27.200
I think a lot about systems that you pointed out.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.280
I think open-ended systems tend to win

20:29.280 --> 20:31.840
under certain conditions, especially in the growth era.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.240
Very beginning, there's some vertically integrated thing

20:34.240 --> 20:35.800
that kicks off a new revolution.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.920
Oh, it packages up really nicely and people get it.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.680
And as time goes on, it gets the sort of

20:41.680 --> 20:42.600
combinatorial possibility.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.760
It gets too big for any one entity to successfully execute.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.840
And so the open system, if there's any way

20:47.840 --> 20:50.920
for it to escape out in the silent, it was with the web.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.720
I'm sorry, I talked with my hands as you could see.

20:53.720 --> 21:00.720
So if there's any way for it to sort of escape out the silent,

21:00.720 --> 21:05.000
like there is with the web or using APIs to access LLMs,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.040
then the open system kind of takes off

21:07.040 --> 21:11.280
this combinatorial swarm and overwhelms the closed system.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.520
That's also potentially just a hopeful thing.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.280
I hope we typically see oscillation

21:15.280 --> 21:17.080
between open systems and closed systems.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.680
We've been in closed systems dominant for like

21:18.680 --> 21:20.400
the last 10 years and I think it's a bummer.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.640
Like I think we're kind of,

21:21.640 --> 21:23.400
in this, we're an amazing age of technology

21:23.400 --> 21:25.440
and it's also kind of the dark ages of tech

21:25.440 --> 21:27.520
because we're all this hyper-arigated thing

21:27.520 --> 21:29.000
where the only features that can exist

21:29.000 --> 21:31.040
are the ones that aggregators for consumers

21:31.040 --> 21:33.360
and the ones that aggregators have decided to prioritize.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.840
And that's a bummer because the,

21:36.840 --> 21:39.760
as a company gets larger and larger and larger,

21:39.760 --> 21:42.360
the cohesion floor at Clay Sharky would call the cohesion floor,

21:42.360 --> 21:43.880
the smallest feature that it makes sense

21:43.880 --> 21:45.400
for them to even consider prioritizing

21:45.400 --> 21:46.880
goes up and up and up and up and up.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.480
So if you're at Google,

21:48.480 --> 21:51.960
if I haven't tried to pitch a product to other teams

21:51.960 --> 21:53.960
that, and they say, how many net new active,

21:53.960 --> 21:55.840
net new one-day actors do you think this product will get?

21:55.840 --> 21:58.760
I'll say, I don't know, 50,000, I'm gonna go 50,000.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.440
I wouldn't do this for 50 million.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.280
You know, it's like there's this whole class

22:02.560 --> 22:05.520
of features that just can't exist in a world,

22:05.520 --> 22:06.520
the world that we're currently in,

22:06.520 --> 22:07.880
that's hyper-arigated.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.920
It seems like one big difference between the web,

22:10.920 --> 22:12.080
the early stages of the internet,

22:12.080 --> 22:12.920
which to be honest,

22:12.920 --> 22:13.920
I don't know the history like that,

22:13.920 --> 22:14.920
well off top of my head.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.240
And language models is,

22:17.240 --> 22:19.280
the web was like, you have,

22:19.280 --> 22:21.640
I mean, it was sort of government run at first.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.680
You have this like international consortium

22:23.680 --> 22:26.080
that kind of just defines the standards

22:26.080 --> 22:27.800
for how the web works and all that kind of stuff.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.240
That doesn't seem to be the case here.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.000
So I don't think, actually,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.800
I think we are waiting for the web of AI to show up.

22:33.800 --> 22:34.640
Interesting.

22:34.640 --> 22:38.120
And that's partially what we're trying to help catalyze.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.200
And that's, I think that's what I mean by like,

22:40.200 --> 22:41.200
we have the internet and we're like,

22:41.200 --> 22:42.520
cool, the internet's definitely gonna be useful.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.440
Like if you look back at

22:45.160 --> 22:49.040
Al Gore's proposals for the air information super-highway,

22:49.040 --> 22:51.760
it was actually very prescient in a lot of ways.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.240
It's just, it was all about

22:53.240 --> 22:55.960
pipelining existing content and business models

22:55.960 --> 22:57.200
into people's homes.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.640
And some of that definitely happens.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.400
You get things like Netflix or whatever.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.720
But a lot of like YouTube, social networks,

23:02.720 --> 23:04.320
none of that was envisioned by the,

23:04.320 --> 23:05.320
or the, you know, Wikipedia.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.800
None of that was envisioned back then

23:06.800 --> 23:08.520
because we just didn't know how to imagine it.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.160
It wasn't even the thing that we thought was possible.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.600
And then the web creates this open system

23:12.600 --> 23:14.800
of lots of different people trying out different things

23:14.800 --> 23:16.480
and seeing what things work,

23:16.480 --> 23:19.080
found some of these interesting new pockets of value

23:19.080 --> 23:21.240
that grew into whole continents of value.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.080
So how do you make that though?

23:23.080 --> 23:24.080
Like do you have to,

23:24.080 --> 23:26.360
do you have to get governments involved?

23:26.360 --> 23:29.080
Do you have to block chain where everyone's like sort of

23:29.080 --> 23:29.920
out of the way?

23:29.920 --> 23:30.760
I don't know.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.600
I think you need to know that it sounds effective.

23:32.600 --> 23:33.440
You can build,

23:33.440 --> 23:35.000
we have so many powerful substrates.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.320
The web exists as a distribution platform.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.680
Everyone's, everyone's device speaks to the web.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.480
And so you can use as a way to distribute

23:42.480 --> 23:45.640
a whole new kind of experience that fits within this.

23:45.640 --> 23:48.080
So I don't think back in, for the internet,

23:48.080 --> 23:49.760
you needed a consortium,

23:49.760 --> 23:51.840
you needed a tons of capital expenditure

23:51.840 --> 23:53.240
to build the pipes.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.760
And that was government grants.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.560
It was also businesses that way overbuilt

23:57.560 --> 23:58.840
all this capacity.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.320
Those businesses, by the way,

24:00.320 --> 24:02.120
were great for society.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.960
We got all this excess band with the capacity,

24:03.960 --> 24:05.760
kind of crappy businesses though, right?

24:05.760 --> 24:07.120
Because you build a pipe somewhere.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.480
If someone builds another one, right next to you,

24:08.480 --> 24:09.600
you lose all pricing power.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.760
You know it's a total commodity.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.360
But it's a commodity that powers the rest

24:13.360 --> 24:14.680
of this innovation on top.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.320
I kind of see large language models,

24:16.320 --> 24:17.680
the producers of them,

24:17.680 --> 24:19.480
as people laying the pipes.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.520
They're the ones doing this extremely capital intensive

24:22.520 --> 24:23.400
creation,

24:23.400 --> 24:25.120
but there's actually not particularly

24:25.120 --> 24:26.480
that much of an edge across them,

24:26.480 --> 24:28.200
which is great for society.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.800
Because that means you can take LLMs as a commodity.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.080
You can assume that they exist

24:32.080 --> 24:33.520
and reasonably high quality ones,

24:33.520 --> 24:35.840
including quite good open source ones.

24:35.840 --> 24:39.000
And that means that all kinds of interesting business

24:39.000 --> 24:39.840
dynamics take off,

24:39.840 --> 24:40.840
and you can kind of take it for granted

24:40.840 --> 24:41.840
and build what's up here.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.760
Now they can take high quality LLMs for granted.

24:44.760 --> 24:47.160
Yeah, it does strike me that the thing you're talking about,

24:47.160 --> 24:49.280
which is the bar for like a Google PM

24:49.280 --> 24:51.800
to build a feature is like we need 50 million users.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.160
And so you sort of,

24:53.160 --> 24:56.560
you sort of look past the like 50,000 user use case,

24:56.560 --> 24:59.000
which those are just valuable in themselves

24:59.000 --> 25:01.720
and be often the ones that end up being

25:01.720 --> 25:03.720
the 50 million user use case in five years.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.800
Some subset of them will become

25:04.800 --> 25:06.680
that's like the sort of innovator's lemma type stuff.

25:06.680 --> 25:07.680
Yeah.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.440
It sort of strikes me that in a world

25:09.440 --> 25:11.920
where language models are commodities,

25:11.920 --> 25:13.560
capitalism just does that automatically

25:13.560 --> 25:18.000
because small startups will just like do the 50,000 user use case

25:18.000 --> 25:19.240
and just build it.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.120
So is this just going to happen without us?

25:21.120 --> 25:22.400
So here's what it might,

25:22.400 --> 25:24.680
and I agree that like this kind of,

25:24.680 --> 25:26.360
I'm so glad there's so many different ways

25:26.360 --> 25:27.720
that the society could have gone.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.320
Open AI could have had Chatchee BBT

25:30.320 --> 25:32.160
before they released the API.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.520
That would have been such a different world.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.360
It would have been very different.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.200
Because now everyone assumes they have to compete

25:36.200 --> 25:37.760
with an open access API.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.080
And now it'll be very hard to close that door in God.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.520
So we can take it for granted for the rest of us.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.520
So like I just like woke up with a last night

25:44.520 --> 25:46.440
with a nightmare that like it had gone the other way.

25:46.440 --> 25:47.600
So I'm very glad to have it.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.960
For like IBM developed AI.

25:48.960 --> 25:49.800
Yeah, yeah.

25:49.800 --> 25:50.800
What would like, what would like,

25:50.800 --> 25:53.160
$30 million a year for like one query?

25:53.160 --> 25:54.400
Yeah.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.760
So that's great.

25:55.760 --> 25:56.840
Here's the thing though,

25:56.840 --> 25:58.800
that means that the current laws of physics,

25:58.800 --> 26:01.680
the current security model that we use for the web and apps

26:01.680 --> 26:03.240
actually limits this possibility.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.840
And this security model is called the same origin paradigm.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.600
The only people who know about it really,

26:07.600 --> 26:08.920
even web developers don't really know about it.

26:08.920 --> 26:09.760
I know I do.

26:09.760 --> 26:10.600
What is that?

26:10.600 --> 26:11.680
Same origin paradigm is the laws of physics

26:11.680 --> 26:12.920
of how the web works.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.040
And what it says is it's the security and privacy model

26:16.040 --> 26:18.760
that we've used for, since for 30 years.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.880
It kind of actually grew up as an accident actually.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.120
And at the very beginning, the web has no state.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.320
And so you reach out to a server,

26:25.320 --> 26:27.840
it gives you back the same thing that anybody would have gotten

26:27.840 --> 26:29.560
if they gave that exact same request.

26:29.560 --> 26:30.680
Well, then you add cookies.

26:30.680 --> 26:31.840
And then you need to say,

26:31.840 --> 26:33.640
when do I send, where do I send cookies to

26:33.640 --> 26:34.480
once they've been set?

26:34.480 --> 26:36.760
Which other URLs do they go to?

26:36.760 --> 26:37.960
And then the easiest thing is,

26:37.960 --> 26:39.640
okay, there's a notion of a site,

26:39.640 --> 26:40.920
which is roughly a domain.

26:40.920 --> 26:41.760
I see.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.840
And so we'll send things back and isolate them by that.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.600
So cookies will come back between these,

26:45.600 --> 26:46.840
but not go over there.

26:46.840 --> 26:47.840
And then you add JavaScript

26:47.840 --> 26:50.240
and you allow things like local storage in local state.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.920
Where is that local, who can see that local state?

26:51.920 --> 26:53.480
The same people that can see this.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.560
And so now it grows up as this origin boundary.

26:56.560 --> 26:59.560
So this somewhat happens to think turns out to be,

26:59.560 --> 27:01.040
at the core of the entire security model,

27:01.040 --> 27:02.800
what it assumes is each and every origin

27:02.800 --> 27:05.560
is its own isolated little island.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.640
It can't see data from any of the other origins,

27:07.640 --> 27:10.920
but can see all the data that the user put into this origin,

27:10.920 --> 27:11.720
intentionally or unintentionally.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.040
And origin is roughly like Google.com.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.840
Yeah, it's roughly, roughly a domain.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.400
It's not exactly, it's like slightly different,

27:17.400 --> 27:19.440
but it's roughly the same as a domain.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.760
And so what this means is data accumulates inside that origin

27:21.760 --> 27:22.920
as a little island.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.480
This is a very reasonable and good security model.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.040
It's one of the things that makes clicking a link

27:27.040 --> 27:28.440
or installing a new app safe,

27:28.440 --> 27:30.000
because it knows nothing about you.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.600
So then if you choose to like it

27:31.600 --> 27:32.800
and to put more data into it,

27:32.800 --> 27:34.440
that's okay, but that's your prerogative.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.280
So it's great for trying out a new thing.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.080
The problem is putting new data into it,

27:38.080 --> 27:39.840
it can do whatever the hell it wants with that data.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.400
It can send it to evil.com or scammy.com

27:42.400 --> 27:43.480
and you have no idea.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.280
You're implicitly trusting the creators

27:45.280 --> 27:47.000
of that application.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.040
And so somewhat surprisingly,

27:49.040 --> 27:51.120
this leads to massive centralization.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.640
So if you have, so this model was about

27:54.640 --> 27:56.480
isolation, not integration,

27:56.480 --> 27:58.040
but our lives are integrated.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.200
And so if you want to move things

27:59.200 --> 28:00.560
across different origins,

28:00.560 --> 28:01.800
you have to be the orchestrator.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.320
You as the human have to keep track of the information

28:04.320 --> 28:07.120
you want to copy paste or move between these different things.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.720
It's expensive and it's somewhat scary

28:08.720 --> 28:09.800
to put it into a new thing.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.880
And so imagine that you have two use cases.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.200
One is some cool startup that says,

28:13.200 --> 28:14.200
they're going to do this amazing new thing

28:14.200 --> 28:15.520
with your calendar and scheduling.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.960
And one is Google Calendar that says they have

28:16.960 --> 28:18.040
a similar kind of feature.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.000
Which one do you pick?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.840
Well, Google already has all your data.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.680
And this startup,

28:21.680 --> 28:23.720
you don't know if there's securing the data properly

28:23.720 --> 28:25.320
or what the business model is.

28:25.320 --> 28:28.000
So you have to give it the data like step by step.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.120
Like it doesn't, it doesn't know it to start.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.600
And it's a cool startup problem.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.800
And so this leads to ask you

28:32.800 --> 28:34.040
or I'll just do the one that already has it.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.880
So this is a phenomenon you might call data gravity.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.360
It tends to accumulate in the places

28:37.360 --> 28:38.480
that already exist.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.240
And they become massive.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.160
And nobody else can get this data.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.160
And this is one of the drivers of aggregation.

28:44.160 --> 28:47.720
And again, once you aggregate to such a scale,

28:47.720 --> 28:49.000
your coaching floor goes up.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.720
And the set of features that they could even

28:50.720 --> 28:53.680
consider doing is only a small subset

28:53.680 --> 28:56.200
of what you could do with all of this data in practice.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.760
It all arises somewhat surprisingly

28:58.760 --> 29:00.320
from the security and privacy model that we used.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.160
I love that.

29:01.160 --> 29:01.440
OK.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.040
And so, and I think what you're saying

29:03.040 --> 29:04.760
is because we inherited that

29:04.760 --> 29:06.360
from the first generation of the Webber,

29:06.360 --> 29:08.200
second generation of the Webber, whatever,

29:08.200 --> 29:10.440
chat bots currently operate that way too.

29:10.440 --> 29:13.280
We don't even realize the apps all do this.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.000
Technically, legacy applications on desktop

29:15.000 --> 29:16.200
do not have this model because they

29:16.200 --> 29:18.120
can interact via the file system.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.120
Right.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.840
Apple has been retconning and jamming it

29:20.840 --> 29:23.760
into Mac OS X for a number of years.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.920
Windows probably has to, I've maintained it, engine.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.080
So like, people, when we're building software and operating

29:28.080 --> 29:29.920
systems, we don't know another way to think.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.400
How else would you possibly do it, which is insane?

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
So there's this, I call this the iron triangle

29:34.400 --> 29:35.360
of the same origin paradigm.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.160
There's three things you can only have to.

29:38.160 --> 29:41.200
One, untrusted code, two, sensitive data,

29:41.200 --> 29:43.680
three, network access.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.000
You can only have two of the three

29:45.000 --> 29:45.840
to have a safe system.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.360
I don't understand.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.520
If you have untrusted code with sensitive data

29:49.520 --> 29:50.880
and network access, it comes in.

29:50.880 --> 29:51.560
It looks at your thing.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.080
It figures out your financial login

29:53.080 --> 29:53.920
and sends it to you.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.120
So untrusted code is like some developer wrote some apps

29:57.120 --> 30:00.160
that I'm downloading that hasn't been, I don't look at,

30:00.160 --> 30:02.600
or when, what sense is it untrusted?

30:02.600 --> 30:03.920
Untrusted is, and I haven't made a trust

30:03.920 --> 30:04.760
institution about it.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.760
So when you, when you put an app in the app store,

30:07.760 --> 30:10.280
Apple looks at it and says, OK, based on the construction

30:10.280 --> 30:12.920
of the sandbox, and also based on our review of this,

30:12.920 --> 30:14.120
this is, this is fine.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.320
It will allow people to install it.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.760
So untrusted code is first thing.

30:16.760 --> 30:17.440
What's the second thing?

30:17.440 --> 30:18.520
The second thing is sensitive data.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.680
Sensitive data, yeah, yeah.

30:19.680 --> 30:20.200
You don't want to put it.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.480
Eventually identifying data, potentially

30:22.480 --> 30:24.440
precious data, and the third is network access.

30:24.440 --> 30:28.440
So the web says you can get untrusted code by pages,

30:28.440 --> 30:30.640
and you can get network access, but no sensitive data.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.720
You get only the thing, exactly this.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.000
The app model says you get sensitive data

30:35.000 --> 30:36.640
and network access, but not untrusted code.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.480
It all has to go through the central location

30:38.480 --> 30:40.040
that, by the way, it starts at 30% tax.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.160
What about like Windows?

30:41.160 --> 30:42.800
Because Windows doesn't have an app store.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.560
So what's the?

30:43.560 --> 30:45.000
So historically, the model, there wasn't one.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.480
And that's why installing software

30:46.480 --> 30:47.520
knows it's a little bit more dangerous.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.200
Because without a model like this,

30:49.200 --> 30:50.360
it could do whatever it wants.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.840
And it has access to all that data,

30:51.840 --> 30:52.680
and you have to be more careful.

30:52.680 --> 30:53.720
But it still exists.

30:53.720 --> 30:54.560
It still exists.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.040
It's still like a vibrant ecosystem.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.080
So it's possible to do it without this triangle.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.360
And you could also change it.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.800
You could tweak it in other ways.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.560
And you could do clever things about using tools,

31:03.560 --> 31:05.680
like information flow control and confidential computing

31:05.680 --> 31:08.480
to create a whole new sort of laws of physics, I think.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.520
OK, so.

31:09.520 --> 31:12.320
And if you did, then you could do things that hit all three.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.560
If you had all three, you could do it wild.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.800
Interesting things that would not be possible today.

31:16.800 --> 31:23.520
So is the file system your number one example of a good alternative

31:23.520 --> 31:24.600
to a same origin paradigm?

31:24.600 --> 31:24.880
Yep.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.920
So the file system allows, fundamentally,

31:26.920 --> 31:29.400
multiple apps are all allowed to work on the same data.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.640
They can coordinate via the file system.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.080
And that allows you to do to knock it stuck.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.920
When you think about it, it's kind of insane

31:36.920 --> 31:39.400
that all of your data is locked up inside of an app.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.760
It can't leave the app.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.960
That's wild, actually, when you think about it.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.640
Well, it's interesting because the file system

31:44.640 --> 31:46.080
has a number of properties.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.640
Unless you don't solve Dropbox forever,

31:47.640 --> 31:49.080
but it's here.

31:49.080 --> 31:52.600
My file system is here, as opposed to it's everywhere.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.000
And I kind of have physical and just total control

31:56.000 --> 31:59.480
over what happens to it.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.920
Is that an important property of the system?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.080
You having physical control over it.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.800
That's why local first talks about, oh, we're

32:05.800 --> 32:07.440
going to make local first where you have control

32:07.440 --> 32:10.280
when you can bring the data across different things.

32:10.280 --> 32:11.800
Part of the challenge, again, with local first,

32:11.800 --> 32:12.720
is it's inconvenient.

32:12.720 --> 32:15.240
We expect things to work across multiple devices,

32:15.240 --> 32:16.880
to work even when one device is off.

32:16.880 --> 32:20.160
We expect these things to be in sync across different things.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.360
And the local first architecture is quite difficult.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.960
This is one of the things that we are looking at.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.000
We call open-to-tested runtimes.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.600
The pattern is used confidential compute.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.840
So confidential compute is secure enclaves in the cloud.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.640
It allows VMs to be run fully encrypted in memory.

32:33.640 --> 32:36.720
It means that even someone with physical access to the machine

32:36.720 --> 32:40.200
like a Google SRE can't peek inside, which is great.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.320
Then what you do is you have an open source runtime

32:43.320 --> 32:47.040
that you run, that executes the code.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.680
And then you can ask the computer to compute cluster

32:49.680 --> 32:50.880
to do a remote attestation.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.040
And to give it attestation, assigned attestation

32:54.040 --> 32:58.080
by the underlying hardware manufacturer that says,

32:58.080 --> 33:00.520
this thing that you're talking to that just handed you this

33:00.520 --> 33:02.440
is running in confidential compute mode.

33:02.440 --> 33:07.880
And here is the Shah of the git Shah of the VM that it booted with.

33:07.880 --> 33:10.640
And so it allows you remotely as a savvy user to verify,

33:10.640 --> 33:13.160
it's running an unmodified version of that software.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.040
And that solves a big coordination problem.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.680
Because now lots of other people can all verify

33:16.680 --> 33:18.360
that it's running unmodified version of the software

33:18.360 --> 33:20.760
and yes fine, and we will just use that central server

33:20.760 --> 33:21.920
as the place to coordinate.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.960
Because we can all see, can't do anything different

33:23.960 --> 33:25.360
than what it says it will do.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.960
And that's a really powerful coordination permit.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.520
Do users care about that?

33:28.520 --> 33:31.600
So because one of the things that makes me think of is

33:33.600 --> 33:37.760
a lot of these concerns feel similar to the flavor of concerns

33:37.840 --> 33:41.320
that like original blockchain, crypto type people had

33:41.320 --> 33:44.640
and we're solving for with Bitcoin

33:44.640 --> 33:47.720
or any kind of cryptocurrency.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.400
And then Coinbase came along and they were just like,

33:50.400 --> 33:52.520
we're just gonna put a general

33:52.520 --> 33:56.440
like sort of same origin paradigm type solution on top of that.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.800
And people actually love to use that.

33:58.800 --> 34:02.480
So this is a, I think if you go after users

34:02.480 --> 34:04.480
who care about this as a primary end,

34:04.480 --> 34:06.080
you end up with a very small audience available

34:06.080 --> 34:08.200
and you end up with a Macedon, for example,

34:08.200 --> 34:09.680
as in something that's like pure,

34:09.680 --> 34:11.440
but also kind of finicky to use

34:11.440 --> 34:13.000
and doesn't make that much sense.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.280
And that's why I think you want a blue sky kind of approach.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.880
Blue sky you can use as an end consumer

34:17.880 --> 34:19.520
and be like, the only thing I know about it is

34:19.520 --> 34:23.600
it's not owned by that guy, and that's it.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.120
But then the closer you look, the more you go,

34:25.120 --> 34:26.480
oh, this is actually very clever.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.720
This is an interesting way of like my key pairs

34:28.720 --> 34:30.960
and the way that personal data stores work.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.240
Most users will never have to know about that.

34:33.240 --> 34:34.680
But the more you learn, the more you're like,

34:34.720 --> 34:36.040
oh, okay.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.280
And so that I think is a,

34:37.280 --> 34:39.240
what I would call like an inductively knowable system.

34:39.240 --> 34:40.080
Yeah.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.560
People go, I was talking to somebody like,

34:41.560 --> 34:43.320
oh, nobody know, nobody ever cares

34:43.320 --> 34:44.200
about the security model.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.800
They do actually care about the security model.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.560
They just don't know the words to express it.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.880
Nobody understands what the same origin paradigm is.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.600
Nobody, a very small portion of people

34:51.600 --> 34:53.160
and yet, it is the laws of physics

34:53.160 --> 34:54.960
that make all the other stuff we do safe.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.200
It's the reason you don't have to care

34:56.200 --> 34:58.680
is because some of us also will do care.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.720
And the general characteristic for me is,

35:00.720 --> 35:02.000
when you're using a new system, you're like,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.480
oh, this seems creepy or too powerful.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.640
And you go talk to your more tech savvy friend

35:06.640 --> 35:07.840
and you say, hey, Sarah,

35:07.840 --> 35:08.920
do you trust this kind of thing?

35:08.920 --> 35:10.080
And she says, yes, I do.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.800
And the reason I trust it is because,

35:11.800 --> 35:13.840
and she knows, she's got a blog post in Hacker News

35:13.840 --> 35:15.320
that was someone who wrote the thing,

35:15.320 --> 35:16.760
was someone who audited the code,

35:16.760 --> 35:17.800
and that inductive chain,

35:17.800 --> 35:19.640
you go all the way back down to the fundamentals.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.560
This episode is brought to you by Adio,

35:21.560 --> 35:25.440
the AI native CRM built for the next era of companies.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.360
With Adio, set up takes minutes,

35:27.360 --> 35:28.680
connect your email and calendar

35:28.680 --> 35:31.880
and it instantly builds a CRM that mirrors your business

35:31.880 --> 35:35.400
with every contact enriched and organized from the start.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.680
From there, Adio's AI goes to work.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.400
It gives you real-time intelligence during calls.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.960
It prospects leads with research agents

35:42.960 --> 35:46.240
and it automates your team's most complex workflows.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.880
Industry leaders like Union Square Ventures, FlatFile

35:48.880 --> 35:50.560
and Model are already building the future

35:50.560 --> 35:52.960
of customer relationships on Adio.

35:52.960 --> 35:57.040
Go to Adio.com slash every and get 15% off your first year.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.640
That's atti.com slash every.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.160
And now back to the show.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.160
That makes total sense.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.880
I totally agree with all of that.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.200
I think the thing on my mind is

36:07.200 --> 36:09.440
the first people that are going to adopt this

36:09.440 --> 36:13.040
probably are the people that do care about the security of it, right?

36:13.040 --> 36:15.600
And are those people the right people

36:15.600 --> 36:17.920
to kind of seed the community

36:17.920 --> 36:20.280
that ends up blossoming into this thing?

36:20.280 --> 36:23.720
Because that kind of person is going to say a lot

36:23.720 --> 36:27.160
about the total trajectory of this kind of product.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.600
Actually, I don't necessarily agree

36:28.600 --> 36:29.800
that it will be those people,

36:29.800 --> 36:32.080
the privacy heads that are dropping it earlier.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.160
I think a bit more like the high-velition users.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.680
I just the tinkerers, the people who are the early adopters.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.720
Some of them will have a higher proportion

36:38.720 --> 36:40.000
of caring about this kind of thing,

36:40.000 --> 36:40.880
but a lot of them won't.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.320
Like there's a ton of startups

36:42.320 --> 36:43.800
that they say you would solve the abs

36:43.800 --> 36:46.880
to step one, sink your Gmail inbox and go, okay.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.080
I run a startup like that.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.640
Exactly, because most people don't really care,

36:50.640 --> 36:52.480
especially early adopters.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.320
I think what we're describing is a system

36:54.320 --> 36:56.800
that if you can break this iron triangle

36:56.800 --> 36:58.960
and then you get all these crazy emergent phenomena

36:58.960 --> 37:00.320
that aren't possible in other software,

37:00.320 --> 37:01.320
people use it because of that.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.280
And the reason it's not creepy

37:02.280 --> 37:05.040
is because of an underlying security or privacy model.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.120
Do you have a name for the alternative

37:07.120 --> 37:09.200
to the same origin paradigm?

37:09.200 --> 37:10.960
I call it contextual flow control.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.360
Contextual flow control.

37:12.360 --> 37:13.880
Tell me what that means.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.040
The, I don't want to go into too much depth

37:16.040 --> 37:18.080
at this point, still very fuzzy.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.720
Helen Niesenbaum is a professor.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.160
I believe it Cornell, a legal studies professor,

37:22.160 --> 37:24.200
and she talks about contextual integrity.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.080
Contextual integrity is the gold standard

37:26.080 --> 37:28.120
of what people mean when they say privacy.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.240
So when people say, when lawyers talk about privacy,

37:30.240 --> 37:31.200
they think about consent.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.280
Did the user sign a consent?

37:32.280 --> 37:33.280
That's how we can do this.

37:33.280 --> 37:34.120
That's it.

37:34.120 --> 37:34.960
It's all the same.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.160
Signed, the ULA, it's fine.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.880
Technologists talk about end-end encryption.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.120
As long as it's end-end encrypted, it is private.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.720
But what people mean intuitively

37:42.720 --> 37:45.440
is this contextual integrity that the data is used

37:45.440 --> 37:47.120
in the context that you understand

37:47.120 --> 37:48.480
and align with your interests.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.040
It's not surprising how it is used

37:50.040 --> 37:52.200
and it's not going against what you want to have in.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.680
And that's like a sort of first principles

37:53.680 --> 37:55.200
ground truth way of thinking about it.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.200
Yeah.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.560
And then you combine that with things

37:57.560 --> 37:58.840
with other technologies and allows you

37:58.840 --> 38:01.560
to make formal claims about information flows

38:01.560 --> 38:02.400
in alignment with people.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.320
That's interesting.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.440
There is, I love the same origin paradigm thing

38:05.440 --> 38:08.240
is you're going all the way back to this one decision

38:08.240 --> 38:13.520
that has all of these really interesting,

38:13.520 --> 38:15.360
positive and negative effects later

38:15.360 --> 38:16.480
that are sort of unpredictable,

38:16.480 --> 38:18.800
which feels very, it's like a little bit

38:18.800 --> 38:21.760
Steven Johnson or a little bit like one of those writers

38:21.760 --> 38:23.440
that's just like, here's this one thing

38:23.440 --> 38:24.640
about the way the history works

38:24.640 --> 38:26.720
that just totally changed everything.

38:26.720 --> 38:28.200
Do you have any other things like that

38:28.200 --> 38:29.480
that you've noticed about technology?

38:29.480 --> 38:30.400
I don't want to put you on the spot,

38:30.400 --> 38:31.800
but I just feel like you probably have

38:31.800 --> 38:34.600
some sort of counter intuitive things

38:34.600 --> 38:36.880
in your time working as Stripe and Google

38:36.880 --> 38:39.000
and whatever thinking about like mobile

38:39.000 --> 38:43.360
or sass or whatever.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.840
I think a couple other like the world changed

38:45.840 --> 38:47.040
that day we didn't realize.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.720
One is the chat GPD coming out after the API

38:49.720 --> 38:50.960
that was already available.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.040
Another one is, if I could go back in time

38:54.200 --> 38:59.040
at a time machine, I would go to the stage on 2007,

38:59.080 --> 39:01.280
the stage where Steve Jobs shows off the iPhone

39:01.280 --> 39:03.760
and run onto the stage with a poster that says,

39:03.760 --> 39:05.880
this will become the most important computing device

39:05.880 --> 39:09.080
on earth, it is insane to allow a single company

39:09.080 --> 39:11.040
to decide what things you may run in it.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.320
Right? It's insane.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.320
It's absolutely insane.

39:13.320 --> 39:14.800
And the only reason it's actually viable

39:14.800 --> 39:17.000
is because they decided very shrewdly

39:17.000 --> 39:19.600
at the very beginning to not allow other rendering engines

39:19.600 --> 39:22.000
in browsers on that device from the very beginning

39:22.040 --> 39:23.720
or and to make sure that all software

39:23.720 --> 39:25.480
had to go through the app store.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.000
And that was a reasonable decision

39:27.000 --> 39:29.240
and that the first order implications are very reasonable.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.600
It means that you get as a user the safe experience,

39:31.600 --> 39:33.440
you know, nothing's gonna hurt you in it.

39:33.440 --> 39:36.320
The second order implications of that are wild.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.200
It's insane to me that like the most important

39:39.200 --> 39:40.680
computer devices in our lives,

39:40.680 --> 39:42.720
a company who has demonstrated again and again

39:42.720 --> 39:44.600
that they are willing to use capricious

39:44.600 --> 39:47.160
kind of decision making about what things will distribute

39:47.160 --> 39:49.520
is the one that like that gatekeeper, that's insane to me.

39:49.520 --> 39:53.960
It seems kind of like a lot of what you are reacting to

39:53.960 --> 39:57.520
and the Apple example and the same origin paradigm example

39:57.520 --> 40:02.520
is aggregation of power and in a few large big tech companies

40:04.240 --> 40:06.600
and the kind of second and third order

40:06.600 --> 40:09.360
negative effects of that on user experience

40:09.360 --> 40:10.880
and innovation and stuff like that.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.840
And competition and yeah, competition, yeah.

40:12.840 --> 40:17.440
So what are the, it seems like that's a reasonable place

40:17.440 --> 40:19.120
also for like regulation.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.640
What is your stance on regulation?

40:20.640 --> 40:22.800
I mean, regulation also has all kinds of second

40:22.800 --> 40:24.280
of third order impacts, you know?

40:24.280 --> 40:27.320
And so have you ever met Denel Meadows thinking in systems?

40:27.320 --> 40:29.760
Yeah, so like the systems you got to dance with

40:29.760 --> 40:31.840
to some degree, you can't fully control them,

40:31.840 --> 40:33.480
you can develop it.

40:33.480 --> 40:36.480
And that's why I find some of these characteristics

40:36.480 --> 40:38.880
when you find the right like technical leverage points

40:38.880 --> 40:41.920
you can say, oh, actually that has a very different way

40:41.920 --> 40:43.680
that it evolves I think is preferable

40:43.680 --> 40:45.760
to a regulatory.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.680
What if I said like you could pass,

40:47.680 --> 40:49.720
you get your president for the day

40:49.720 --> 40:52.880
and you can, and and all of Congress and,

40:52.880 --> 40:53.720
and this for you.

40:53.720 --> 40:54.720
You're a dictator for the day.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.320
You're a dictator for the day, yeah.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.440
You can pass one law.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.000
Do you have, like what law would you pass it?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.320
It's like a, you can, it's a one sentence law.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.040
I don't know.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.360
I don't have to, I don't, I've never thought through

41:08.360 --> 41:11.480
like I'm so used to in open systems

41:11.480 --> 41:13.760
which were all part of the large complex adaptive system

41:13.760 --> 41:14.840
called society.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.360
And there's always like weird,

41:16.360 --> 41:18.200
any currents of our dynamics and what have you.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.760
So like I take from the assumption

41:19.760 --> 41:21.280
that like I never have a lever that is like

41:21.280 --> 41:23.480
this massive lever I can just simply pull.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.960
And so I don't even know more like looking,

41:24.960 --> 41:26.600
you want to find the like grain of sand

41:26.600 --> 41:29.680
that you put on the pile and it's just all like a cascade.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.600
But it cascades if the pile is ready for it.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.440
Right exactly.

41:32.440 --> 41:33.680
And that's one of the nice things about like systems thinking

41:33.680 --> 41:35.400
is like if you do the right like judo moves,

41:35.400 --> 41:38.120
the right thing, and the system is ready for it,

41:38.120 --> 41:38.960
the world moves.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.400
And if it's not, it doesn't move.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.880
And so that the like the system is deciding kind of,

41:42.880 --> 41:44.760
they're always like micro interactions throughout it.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.080
Tell me more about that mindset and how you developed it.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.120
And what are the, what are some of the key moments

41:49.120 --> 41:50.240
in your life for that?

41:50.240 --> 41:51.520
How you've seen that happen.

41:53.080 --> 41:54.960
I, so I wrote my undergraduate thesis

41:54.960 --> 41:57.680
on the emergent power dynamics of Wikipedia's user community.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.640
And I, by degrees in social studies

41:59.640 --> 42:01.240
with a minor in computer science.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.160
And I was just fascinated by this emergent phenomenon.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.480
How are always strangers?

42:04.480 --> 42:05.960
Work on this thing with no coordination.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.880
And yet you get this convergent,

42:07.880 --> 42:09.360
extremely important result out of it.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.200
That's insane.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.040
It's wild.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.080
And then when I went straight out of the Google,

42:14.080 --> 42:15.120
and I called it to Google,

42:15.120 --> 42:17.600
it actually was harder to get my first PM role

42:17.600 --> 42:19.160
because I didn't technically have a CS degree,

42:19.160 --> 42:20.160
even though it basically did.

42:20.160 --> 42:22.080
It was one credit shot, I have a dual major.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.760
And so I was like, man, what a mistake that was.

42:23.760 --> 42:26.120
I just didn't, you know, just threw it in the back of my mind

42:26.120 --> 42:27.320
on whatever, like if I could go back

42:27.320 --> 42:29.160
and time out, it's what a major in CS.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.840
And then I did my first year on search.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.040
The precursor to the knowledge graph,

42:32.040 --> 42:33.040
my second year in double click,

42:33.040 --> 42:34.480
it was in the APM program.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.120
And part of that is you mentor a lot of the people

42:36.120 --> 42:36.960
who come up after you.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.040
And I learned very early on, I loved mentoring people,

42:39.040 --> 42:41.440
helped me think through what I was dealing with

42:41.440 --> 42:43.240
and help people and get more patterns

42:43.240 --> 42:44.680
to go into my pattern matching library.

42:44.680 --> 42:48.040
And then I became the lead PM for Chrome's web platform team.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.840
And I think a lot of PMs are under the misunderstanding

42:49.840 --> 42:52.040
that they're in way more control of their users

42:52.040 --> 42:53.640
and the usage than they actually are.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.920
If you're at Google and you ship a feature

42:54.920 --> 42:56.880
in tomorrow 50 million people use it,

42:56.880 --> 42:59.440
you kind of get a little bit of a God complex, right?

42:59.440 --> 43:01.880
If you're a platform PM, you tweak a thing

43:01.880 --> 43:04.040
which causes other developers to do something different

43:04.040 --> 43:06.520
which causes users to be affected in a second order of act,

43:06.520 --> 43:08.240
you're aware of this in direction.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.560
If you're the lead PM for the web platform,

43:11.560 --> 43:14.120
which is a open system with multiple browser vendors

43:14.120 --> 43:15.400
who don't like each other very much

43:15.400 --> 43:17.240
and are constantly kicking each other on the table,

43:17.240 --> 43:19.520
you are under no illusion that you're in control.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.920
And my engineering counterpart,

43:20.920 --> 43:23.160
Dimitri Glazkov, who was the UberTL

43:23.160 --> 43:25.280
for playing brilliant guy

43:25.280 --> 43:27.200
and he was the one who got me into

43:27.200 --> 43:29.440
introduced me to the word complexity, for example,

43:29.440 --> 43:31.360
and introduced me to the Santa Fe Institute.

43:31.360 --> 43:32.640
And so I was going as realizing,

43:32.640 --> 43:34.920
oh, these things I'm naturally doing to try to make

43:34.920 --> 43:38.080
these good outcomes happen in this open ecosystem.

43:38.080 --> 43:41.120
Progressive web apps and these web standards and stuff.

43:41.120 --> 43:42.680
I'm intuitively applying some of these

43:42.680 --> 43:44.800
paradynamics and complex systems.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.440
And then I left Chrome.

43:47.440 --> 43:48.800
I went to go work on augmented reality.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.920
I created a little nerd club behind the scenes

43:51.920 --> 43:53.960
with a bunch of people that I just kind of selected

43:53.960 --> 43:56.560
that people who when I said it was a nerd club didn't go,

43:56.560 --> 43:58.560
ew, like, you know, like, ah, that's fun.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.640
Great, come on in.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.680
And then it was very collaborative debate,

44:01.680 --> 44:03.680
very trickling in different perspectives

44:03.680 --> 44:05.960
if I get a diversity of perspectives into the system,

44:05.960 --> 44:07.640
no particular goal that's exploring.

44:07.640 --> 44:09.800
After a while we came up with a distilled, like, a thing

44:09.800 --> 44:11.200
I was like, this must be the strategy.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.440
Nothing else could work.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.120
This is a strategy that kind of makes sense

44:14.120 --> 44:14.960
of all the pieces.

44:14.960 --> 44:17.000
And that caught on a significant momentum.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.520
And that's when I realized, oh my gosh,

44:18.520 --> 44:20.680
I'm not a web developer ecosystem guy.

44:20.680 --> 44:21.760
I'm a systems guy.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.760
And the same techniques I've been advising,

44:23.760 --> 44:25.560
I used in deployed in those contexts

44:25.560 --> 44:27.360
are the same techniques I used.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.320
I've been advising, you know, hundreds of PMs

44:29.320 --> 44:31.480
over the last decade to use and navigate Google.

44:31.480 --> 44:33.400
And the reason they work, the lenses I'm using

44:33.400 --> 44:34.880
what game theory and power dynamics

44:34.880 --> 44:37.480
and evolutionary biology are things I learned in college.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.240
And it was just kind of like a ha moment.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.920
And that's when I wrote the earlier version

44:41.920 --> 44:43.760
of the slime mold deck.

44:43.760 --> 44:45.120
Tell us a little bit about that.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.160
That slime mold deck was a kind of lightning in a bottle.

44:47.160 --> 44:52.160
It was, it's a, I think it's a 150 slide emoji flip book.

44:52.320 --> 44:55.840
And it's just about a fundamental characteristic

44:55.840 --> 44:59.520
of system organizations that as organizations get larger,

44:59.520 --> 45:01.360
they get much, much, much slower.

45:01.360 --> 45:02.600
And that's true.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.480
Even if you assume everybody is actively good at what they do,

45:05.480 --> 45:08.040
actively hardworking and actively collaborative.

45:08.040 --> 45:12.600
And it rises due to a exponential coordination cost blowup.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.240
It's fundamental, it's inescapable.

45:14.240 --> 45:17.040
And it's the force that we all deal with constantly.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.520
And we don't even realize we're dealing with it.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.400
And so we get frustrated with ourselves,

45:20.400 --> 45:22.280
we get frustrated at Jeff over there,

45:22.280 --> 45:25.480
who if only he would do X, this whole thing would be easier.

45:25.480 --> 45:27.600
And we're dissolved fighting with his massive forces,

45:27.600 --> 45:30.000
like force of gravity that's completely invisible to us.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.280
And so that deck caught on, I did another version,

45:33.280 --> 45:35.640
a similar kind of thing externally.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.920
And that also got a surprising amount of momentum.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.560
I've had people describe it to me as like life changing.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.000
I'm just talking about like some mochi,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.160
I'm actually talking about game theory.

45:43.160 --> 45:45.520
But it was, I think it really tapped into something

45:45.520 --> 45:48.360
that people experience that are frustrated by it.

45:48.360 --> 45:50.160
And I just, it's like a big hug that says,

45:50.160 --> 45:51.680
you are not crazy, this is really hard

45:51.680 --> 45:53.120
and it's fundamentally fine.

45:53.120 --> 45:56.200
So I think like every nerd that has like,

45:56.200 --> 45:58.760
is a systems person like me, like you,

45:58.760 --> 46:01.840
like we all go through like a complex systems like hope.

46:01.840 --> 46:04.280
That's the thing for people who are not,

46:04.280 --> 46:06.080
have not done that yet or haven't done it in a while.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.080
Like what are the three or four,

46:08.080 --> 46:11.080
give me like a quick rundown of like the key ideas

46:11.080 --> 46:13.280
that get you about complex systems

46:13.280 --> 46:15.280
that you think are applicable.

46:15.280 --> 46:19.240
I think everything we tend to look at individual decisions

46:19.240 --> 46:20.520
as the primary lens.

46:20.520 --> 46:21.680
I see it as a secondary lens.

46:21.680 --> 46:24.320
I look at the emergent characteristics of the system.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.560
What would each person do inductively?

46:26.560 --> 46:28.520
And how does that, how do those decisions,

46:28.520 --> 46:30.800
how are they interdependent?

46:30.800 --> 46:33.400
So I try to look at like what's the simplest inductive case

46:33.400 --> 46:34.680
and then how would that play out

46:34.680 --> 46:37.240
if everybody were doing a similar kind of concrete example

46:37.240 --> 46:38.240
of that.

46:38.240 --> 46:40.640
So like there's a dynamic that would call like a gravity

46:40.640 --> 46:43.440
weld dynamic that shows up in a lot of compounding loops.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.760
And it generally shows up when there's a thing

46:45.760 --> 46:47.120
I would call a boundary gradient.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.240
So people who are using the system,

46:49.240 --> 46:51.400
on one side, people who are not using on the other side,

46:51.400 --> 46:52.840
even at the beginning, even if lots of people

46:52.840 --> 46:54.920
are having incentives away from using the system,

46:54.920 --> 46:57.720
I don't want to use that thing that seems dumb.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.720
The people on the boundary who riot the edge

46:59.720 --> 47:01.680
of possibly using it, do they want to be in

47:01.680 --> 47:02.800
or do they want to be out?

47:02.800 --> 47:05.440
And a great example is Facebook back in the early days.

47:05.440 --> 47:06.360
It starts off with Harvard.

47:06.360 --> 47:08.360
And then now it extends to Ivy League.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.440
Do they want to be in with Harvard?

47:09.440 --> 47:10.600
Do they want to be in with all the other schools?

47:10.600 --> 47:11.720
I'd rather be in with Harvard.

47:11.720 --> 47:13.400
And now it extends to the other schools.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.280
And at each point, each group of people

47:15.280 --> 47:16.440
would rather be in.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.720
And if there's a compounding, if there's

47:17.720 --> 47:19.480
some kind of network effect inside,

47:19.480 --> 47:21.560
then this strength that gets more and more powerful

47:21.560 --> 47:24.520
as you go, it can become this thing that can pull in even.

47:24.520 --> 47:26.960
As time goes on, the incentives pull in for everybody.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.560
And everybody will pull into this overall thing.

47:29.560 --> 47:30.600
With sufficient time.

47:30.600 --> 47:33.520
So Facebook was started at the city college of New York.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.160
Are you saying it probably wouldn't it?

47:35.160 --> 47:35.680
Potentially.

47:35.680 --> 47:37.360
I mean, that was one of the dynamics.

47:37.360 --> 47:40.600
I mean, made it like this juggernaut, I think.

47:40.600 --> 47:41.360
That's fascinating.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.800
Who are the, so Janela Meadows is someone

47:43.800 --> 47:45.920
I've read just thinking it says this is really good.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.560
What are the other like, you know,

47:48.560 --> 47:52.000
Santa Fe type people that are, that have inspired you,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.960
that you've read or think about a lot?

47:54.960 --> 47:56.960
One of my favorites is the origin of wealth by Eric

47:56.960 --> 47:58.320
Winehacker.

47:58.320 --> 47:59.000
Fascinating book.

47:59.000 --> 47:59.800
I haven't read it.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.480
It's really good.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.000
It talks about these organization,

48:02.000 --> 48:03.800
why these organizational things emerge

48:03.800 --> 48:08.800
and these views business as an evolutionary process

48:08.800 --> 48:12.040
of like exploring a fitness landscape,

48:12.040 --> 48:13.720
which I think is like the correct,

48:13.720 --> 48:15.720
like a very useful lens of seeing it.

48:15.720 --> 48:19.520
Cesar Hidalgo who wrote why, why information grows.

48:19.520 --> 48:22.320
He and Eric used to work on stuff together.

48:22.320 --> 48:24.760
Also talks about why fundamentally know how

48:24.760 --> 48:27.160
and it's diffusion in societies.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.080
Know how is, the way we actually do stuff

48:29.080 --> 48:30.480
is know how, not knowledge.

48:30.480 --> 48:34.040
Know how is rich, it's non,

48:34.040 --> 48:36.560
it's a difficult to distinguish, to communicate.

48:36.560 --> 48:37.400
It's in our brain.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.240
It's what L alums know.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.080
Exactly.

48:39.080 --> 48:42.200
And so they have absorbed this kind of like squishy system

48:42.200 --> 48:44.120
to style awareness.

48:44.120 --> 48:45.880
You can think of every time we're trying to communicate,

48:45.880 --> 48:49.080
we do this conscious process to distill the squishy,

48:49.080 --> 48:52.080
rich nuance into a little tiny packet of information.

48:52.080 --> 48:54.000
It's so seed of a thought and I shoot it

48:54.080 --> 48:56.520
into a little pea shooter into your brain.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.520
And I hope it lands in a little soil

48:58.520 --> 49:00.760
that will grow into a thought flower.

49:00.760 --> 49:04.000
But extraordinarily lossy process and expensive process.

49:05.040 --> 49:05.880
I agree.

49:05.880 --> 49:08.960
And I think we've also confused that pea shooter,

49:08.960 --> 49:11.080
the thing we can just distill into a pea shooter

49:11.080 --> 49:12.800
with the only thing that's important

49:12.800 --> 49:14.600
when there's so much other stuff that's like,

49:14.600 --> 49:16.320
you can't really say, but you know.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.800
Yeah.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.120
Yeah, like the thing that is making me think of

49:20.120 --> 49:22.720
is something like a path I've been going down

49:22.720 --> 49:25.760
until actually is this idea that language models

49:25.760 --> 49:28.280
are their first tool that makes those,

49:30.080 --> 49:33.960
makes that kind of tacit knowledge or know how

49:33.960 --> 49:35.440
transferable between people.

49:35.440 --> 49:36.280
Yeah.

49:36.280 --> 49:39.720
We used to have to, we used to require explanations.

49:39.720 --> 49:44.520
So like math or like logic or rational arguments

49:44.520 --> 49:48.840
to like transfer know how in this like very reduced form

49:48.840 --> 49:50.920
into someone else's brain.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.840
But now we can like just move tacit knowledge

49:55.840 --> 49:57.680
between people because you can train them all

49:57.680 --> 50:00.000
with a bunch of examples and you can be like,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
even if you do things, if you cheat,

50:02.000 --> 50:03.960
you're using the existing off-the-shelf model

50:03.960 --> 50:05.520
and you just pack it full of like,

50:05.520 --> 50:07.880
here's all my, if I read all the public writing

50:07.880 --> 50:09.840
you've done, and you had all the public writing

50:09.840 --> 50:12.360
I have done, which I'm sure is just insane amounts

50:12.360 --> 50:14.200
you know with the bus, and we had a system

50:14.200 --> 50:16.880
that could find, sift through the embeddings,

50:16.880 --> 50:19.120
find the areas, the Goldilocks areas, the things,

50:19.120 --> 50:21.080
if we focus on stuff we definitely agree on,

50:21.080 --> 50:23.240
it's kind of boring, other than like quickly building trust.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.600
Like, oh, we think similarly,

50:24.600 --> 50:26.440
we find stuff that we fundamentally disagree on,

50:26.440 --> 50:27.600
it's also fundamentally boring

50:27.600 --> 50:29.000
because it's just noise to each other,

50:29.000 --> 50:31.440
but we find the Goldilocks zone where it's just

50:31.440 --> 50:33.880
at the edge of the thing that we already thought,

50:33.880 --> 50:35.360
you can have these fascinating conversations,

50:35.360 --> 50:36.480
and you can do it with embeddings,

50:36.480 --> 50:38.000
just very straightforwardly.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.960
Again, you train a model per se,

50:39.960 --> 50:43.480
you can have the, you can find these areas of overlap,

50:43.480 --> 50:45.640
and yeah, the models are really good.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.160
My friend at Thayer Roberts has this notion,

50:47.160 --> 50:48.520
she's a brilliant thinker,

50:48.520 --> 50:52.440
she's a professor in Australia, she teaches Harvard,

50:52.440 --> 50:54.640
and she talks, she's one of the most interesting users

50:54.640 --> 50:56.720
of LLM's I've ever come across, and what's her name?

50:56.720 --> 51:00.320
And Thayer Roberts, I just, she just started doing a blog

51:00.320 --> 51:03.560
a couple, a couple of weeks ago at my insistence

51:03.560 --> 51:05.640
because I thought she had so many interesting ideas,

51:05.640 --> 51:09.000
and she talks about liquid media.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.240
So like, think of a book as a fossilized piece of knowledge,

51:12.240 --> 51:14.160
yeah, you have to assume and give an audience

51:14.160 --> 51:17.560
at a certain time, and you break it, you put it in time,

51:17.560 --> 51:19.240
and then if it's not the right fit, like,

51:19.240 --> 51:20.600
oh, I don't understand these concepts,

51:20.600 --> 51:22.400
that are prerequisites to understand this,

51:22.400 --> 51:23.600
or not close enough in alignment

51:23.600 --> 51:25.560
to the belief already, it's like stick to it.

51:25.560 --> 51:28.240
And versus a, because of liquid media,

51:28.240 --> 51:29.240
it's something you can chat with,

51:29.240 --> 51:31.160
it can kind of be a choose your own adventure,

51:31.160 --> 51:34.800
and that gives you a, allows it to sort of unfold

51:34.800 --> 51:36.360
for that particular person,

51:36.360 --> 51:38.920
in a specific way as opposed to, it's one way.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.880
It's funny because, in a lot of ways,

51:41.880 --> 51:46.880
we're getting back to like, Plato and Socrates's problem

51:46.880 --> 51:49.200
with writing is they were like, well, you can't talk to it.

51:49.200 --> 51:54.200
So it's only sort of a shadow of what that person thinks,

51:54.280 --> 51:56.200
and they can't argue back with you,

51:56.200 --> 52:00.120
and that's why those foundational books

52:00.120 --> 52:03.360
of the Western canon are written as dialogues.

52:03.360 --> 52:06.480
And yeah, I mean, for me, like,

52:06.480 --> 52:09.680
I read so many old books like classics

52:09.680 --> 52:11.000
that are either written in English,

52:11.000 --> 52:12.240
or we're not written in English,

52:12.240 --> 52:15.040
and if you read it with Chachibit or Claude or whatever,

52:15.040 --> 52:16.720
you can get so much out of it,

52:16.720 --> 52:20.760
and I just think that there's a new format of reading

52:20.760 --> 52:25.120
that takes a classic book and helps you get into it

52:25.120 --> 52:26.640
in a way that it would not,

52:26.640 --> 52:28.040
or narrowly be possible,

52:28.040 --> 52:29.640
that I think could be so cool about it.

52:29.640 --> 52:32.880
Yeah, I know it feels like in this industry

52:32.880 --> 52:35.520
that we're like halfway through the LLM era,

52:35.520 --> 52:36.520
we were in the very first,

52:36.520 --> 52:37.360
it's very early.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.600
We're like rubbing sticks together.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.800
We still think that chatbots are the main thing,

52:40.800 --> 52:43.200
and there's so many uses of this kind of stuff.

52:43.400 --> 52:46.200
If you have, I think of LLM's kind of like

52:46.200 --> 52:48.440
as a mass intelligence, as a mass noun,

52:48.440 --> 52:51.160
so mass nouns are like water or rice.

52:51.160 --> 52:52.840
You know, you're talking about the whole,

52:52.840 --> 52:54.280
as opposed to the individuals.

52:54.280 --> 52:56.400
And I think that LLM's are kind of like this mass noun

52:56.400 --> 52:57.400
of intelligence.

52:57.400 --> 52:58.960
You can just pour this intelligence into all kinds of stuff

52:58.960 --> 53:02.520
and have it imbue it with a kind of life and activity,

53:02.520 --> 53:03.760
and we're just starting.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.920
We're just starting to understand

53:04.920 --> 53:06.160
what you can do with these things.

53:06.160 --> 53:08.280
I am so hopeful that these technologies

53:08.280 --> 53:11.120
will unlock a significant human flirt.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.040
One of the things that Enthea, for example,

53:13.040 --> 53:15.480
it was telling me, is in academia,

53:15.480 --> 53:17.680
one way you can handle LLM's, the fact that LLM's exists,

53:17.680 --> 53:20.360
is say, you know, make sure you cite your LLM sources

53:20.360 --> 53:23.040
with this weird format of exactly the conversation

53:23.040 --> 53:24.560
and a link to it.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.920
Another way is to say, I assume you're using LLM's,

53:26.920 --> 53:28.800
which means that the quality of your output

53:28.800 --> 53:30.760
should be 10x higher than before.

53:30.760 --> 53:31.880
It should be more nuanced.

53:31.880 --> 53:35.160
It should understand disconfirming arguments

53:35.160 --> 53:36.000
and address them.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.480
It should, and that's the kind of like,

53:38.480 --> 53:41.080
what can we do now as society as individuals?

53:41.080 --> 53:42.400
That we can think through thoughts

53:42.400 --> 53:44.080
that we couldn't think before.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.760
And I think that LLM's are,

53:45.760 --> 53:46.880
that's one of the reason I think it is,

53:46.880 --> 53:49.640
it's the same scale of impact as printing presses

53:49.640 --> 53:50.640
and electricity in the internet.

53:50.640 --> 53:52.600
I think it's a fundamental unlock.

53:52.600 --> 53:54.680
Do you think that it changes this coordination problem

53:54.680 --> 53:58.760
you've been talking about because a lot of coordination

53:58.760 --> 54:01.920
is about trying to distill down your tacit knowledge

54:01.920 --> 54:04.400
and your tacit context into the P-shooter

54:04.400 --> 54:05.600
and then shooting it to someone else

54:05.600 --> 54:07.960
and that scaling x-ponentially, right?

54:07.960 --> 54:08.800
I love the P-shooter.

54:08.800 --> 54:10.280
I know, I know, I know, I know.

54:10.280 --> 54:13.520
Everyone's just shooting their T-shooter.

54:13.520 --> 54:16.680
But, you know, there's this whole theory

54:16.680 --> 54:18.520
about language model being better middle managers,

54:18.520 --> 54:20.240
for example, than actual middle managers,

54:20.240 --> 54:23.120
which is I think is the same kind of coordination problem thing.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.640
Do you think that language models

54:24.640 --> 54:28.360
might solve that coordination problem

54:28.360 --> 54:29.880
because they can transfer tacit knowledge

54:29.880 --> 54:31.480
much more quickly than?

54:31.480 --> 54:33.680
I think they will definitely change the dynamic.

54:33.680 --> 54:35.000
I'm not sure how it will change.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.120
So I know a lot of companies are trying to do this

54:37.120 --> 54:37.960
because a lot of people, like,

54:37.960 --> 54:40.920
and Eric Binocker's book, The Wealth, Origin of Wealth,

54:40.920 --> 54:45.040
I think he uses the frame because of physical technology

54:45.040 --> 54:47.880
or social technology, like having Slack, for example,

54:47.880 --> 54:49.440
is a social technology, I think,

54:49.440 --> 54:50.480
maybe I get this backwards,

54:50.480 --> 54:51.960
but it changes the way that you can work.

54:51.960 --> 54:53.440
It changes the kinds of coordination

54:53.440 --> 54:54.920
that you can do within an organization.

54:54.920 --> 54:58.520
So MLMs must change the way that organizations work.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.480
I don't think we're gonna know what it looks like

55:00.480 --> 55:01.760
for like five to 10 years

55:01.760 --> 55:04.000
because it's not gonna change the existing companies,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.680
it's gonna be the new ones that is grew up in a different way.

55:06.680 --> 55:09.680
You also get these a weird emergent meta-games

55:09.680 --> 55:14.680
in organizations, and so the MLMs and that coordination thing,

55:15.240 --> 55:17.280
change the meta-game, but they don't make it go away.

55:17.280 --> 55:20.840
So like, if you had a system that could perfectly

55:20.840 --> 55:22.720
distill all your signals into an update

55:22.720 --> 55:24.680
that goes up to your manager,

55:24.680 --> 55:26.520
and then you're curating it, you're tweaking it

55:26.520 --> 55:29.840
because, okay, this one says it's a yellow state.

55:29.840 --> 55:32.640
Really it's green because Sarah has already got,

55:32.640 --> 55:33.760
she's on a path to resolution,

55:33.760 --> 55:35.320
but the time this rolls up to the CEO,

55:35.320 --> 55:36.160
it's already gonna be fixed.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.880
So it's actually better to say it's green.

55:37.880 --> 55:38.760
Some of this is good.

55:38.760 --> 55:40.360
Some of this also leads these compounding,

55:40.360 --> 55:42.480
green shifting problems that gets into, you know,

55:42.480 --> 55:44.880
turns into that's K-fabe throughout an organization.

55:44.880 --> 55:47.560
But the meta-game shows up no matter what

55:47.560 --> 55:49.120
the kind of coordination technology is.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.760
So I think it just changes the game.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.320
And I imagine it will make it better,

55:52.320 --> 55:54.080
it will make it significantly better in some ways

55:54.080 --> 55:56.040
and significantly worse in others.

55:56.040 --> 55:56.880
Interesting.

55:56.880 --> 55:59.080
One other thing that you're making me think of

55:59.080 --> 56:00.640
in what you said about Anthia Roberts

56:00.640 --> 56:02.560
and the changing expectations of,

56:02.560 --> 56:05.160
oh, use LMs for this, like, it's gotta be better.

56:06.080 --> 56:09.280
Is just, I think one of the things

56:09.280 --> 56:12.560
that people get so hung up about with language monoses,

56:12.560 --> 56:15.960
they're like, well, what makes us uniquely human?

56:15.960 --> 56:17.680
And are they just gonna take over everything

56:17.680 --> 56:18.720
that we can do?

56:18.720 --> 56:22.480
And I think my typical response to that is,

56:22.480 --> 56:25.480
that assumes a very static view of what humans are

56:25.480 --> 56:26.520
and what humans can do.

56:26.520 --> 56:28.240
And that one of the most interesting things

56:28.240 --> 56:30.720
about language monoses that they will change,

56:30.720 --> 56:32.400
a lot of ways what humans can do.

56:33.400 --> 56:37.520
And in the same way that books change who we are

56:37.520 --> 56:39.200
and what we can do and writing changes who we are.

56:39.200 --> 56:40.200
In the internet, whatever.

56:40.200 --> 56:41.600
The internet does to all that kind of stuff.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.800
And I think that's actually a really good thing.

56:43.800 --> 56:47.120
I'm curious if you had to think about

56:47.120 --> 56:49.520
how language monoses might change who we are,

56:49.520 --> 56:52.160
how we see ourselves, where would you,

56:52.160 --> 56:53.120
where does that take you?

56:53.120 --> 56:55.960
Yeah, that's why I think we were at this crossroads.

56:55.960 --> 56:57.360
I think we have the potential for like,

56:57.360 --> 56:59.800
there's a dawn of a new era of human flourishing

56:59.800 --> 57:01.960
because of our ability to become think better

57:02.040 --> 57:04.240
and bigger in ways that collaborate

57:04.240 --> 57:05.840
and bridge between different communities

57:05.840 --> 57:07.000
that didn't understand each other before,

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
but now you can understand, like,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.120
help me empathize with this person's perspective.

57:10.120 --> 57:12.080
Well, here's something that you probably, you know,

57:12.080 --> 57:14.200
so I imagine it could be as amazingly powerful words.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.480
It also could be like infinite TV

57:16.480 --> 57:17.520
and using ourselves to death.

57:17.520 --> 57:18.520
You know, imagine-

57:18.520 --> 57:19.360
They're a fossil wall.

57:19.360 --> 57:20.360
It's like infinite chess.

57:20.360 --> 57:22.280
Right, it could be a thing that like,

57:22.280 --> 57:23.760
it could know exactly how to give you

57:23.760 --> 57:26.200
the precise dopamine drip, right?

57:26.200 --> 57:27.800
And so there's a world where humanity becomes

57:27.800 --> 57:31.080
extremely passive and becomes not very agentic

57:31.120 --> 57:32.880
and not learning or growing.

57:32.880 --> 57:33.960
And that is the default one

57:33.960 --> 57:36.360
that is also aligned with engaging, maximizing business model.

57:36.360 --> 57:39.160
And but I think that's why I'm excited.

57:39.160 --> 57:41.640
We had the potential to go in this direction.

57:41.640 --> 57:43.920
Well, what's interesting is like,

57:43.920 --> 57:47.120
it makes, we're making me think of this whole debacle

57:47.120 --> 57:48.640
that happened recently with Cheshire T.

57:48.640 --> 57:50.760
getting too psychophantic.

57:50.760 --> 57:52.080
Yeah.

57:52.080 --> 57:55.400
And though the way that that happened

57:55.400 --> 57:57.840
is they looked,

57:57.840 --> 58:01.960
they optimize too much for people's thumbs up

58:01.960 --> 58:03.040
and thumbs down responses,

58:03.040 --> 58:05.200
like immediate thumbs up and thumbs down responses.

58:05.200 --> 58:06.800
What they want, what they want to want, exactly.

58:06.800 --> 58:09.040
And it just became this like kind of,

58:09.040 --> 58:10.800
it just agrees with you on everything.

58:10.800 --> 58:13.600
But what's interesting is that users revolted,

58:13.600 --> 58:16.440
which did not happen with Facebook.

58:16.440 --> 58:19.440
Like people were like, oh, it's just feeding me like car accidents.

58:19.440 --> 58:21.400
Like I don't want that, right?

58:21.400 --> 58:23.840
And I think that there might be something about that

58:23.840 --> 58:27.200
where because language models hit that part of your brain

58:27.240 --> 58:30.200
where you're like, I'm having a relationship with this person.

58:30.200 --> 58:33.360
You have a set of filters for,

58:34.360 --> 58:36.440
I want their praise to be earned.

58:36.440 --> 58:39.080
I want them to feel like they can see me

58:39.080 --> 58:41.440
and they'll tell me if I'm doing something wrong or whatever.

58:41.440 --> 58:44.400
And so they may demand things from companies

58:44.400 --> 58:46.840
that they did not demand in the social media era

58:46.840 --> 58:49.000
that might make these companies less likely

58:49.000 --> 58:50.360
to do the thing that you're talking about.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.200
Potentially.

58:51.200 --> 58:53.800
I think when it goes to the point where it's egregious,

58:53.800 --> 58:55.160
it's like, it's very obvious.

58:55.160 --> 58:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.520
I gotta say, one of the reasons I like Claude

58:57.520 --> 58:59.720
is because every time when I'm bouncing ideas off of it,

58:59.720 --> 59:01.720
it always says, what an astute observation.

59:01.720 --> 59:04.160
And I don't want it to want that, but that's what it wants, right?

59:04.160 --> 59:08.520
And so I do think that it's hard to not give us

59:08.520 --> 59:10.160
exactly what we want in that moment.

59:10.160 --> 59:12.440
And like, we aspire to want something

59:12.440 --> 59:13.640
that is different than that.

59:13.640 --> 59:15.080
That's this confirming evidence.

59:15.080 --> 59:17.000
But you also get these weird things

59:17.000 --> 59:19.600
where the context mixes and matches against different things.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.920
Before each chat was like a blank sheet of paper

59:21.920 --> 59:23.720
and you could choose what context to bring into it.

59:23.720 --> 59:26.160
And now it kind of mushies context from different things.

59:26.160 --> 59:28.600
Like I asked him to say, what do you know about me?

59:28.600 --> 59:30.440
You know, make it snap or whatever that first query was

59:30.440 --> 59:33.000
that they suggested when the new memory feature came out.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.760
And it says, well, you're Alice Kamarowski.

59:34.760 --> 59:37.000
You're really into systems thinking, emergency stuff.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.720
You have a startup called Common Tools.

59:39.720 --> 59:41.880
The starting salary at your startup is X.

59:41.880 --> 59:43.880
It's like, excuse me, what?

59:43.880 --> 59:46.160
Because six months before I had been like bouncing off,

59:46.160 --> 59:47.840
like, okay, if I'm going to do a signing bonus

59:47.840 --> 59:48.880
like this, how should I change that?

59:48.880 --> 59:49.720
It's so fun.

59:49.720 --> 59:52.800
And like, it's like the, imagine if you're,

59:52.800 --> 59:54.920
if you're talking to like your, like people might use

59:54.920 --> 59:56.400
these things as like a therapist, like it trusted,

59:56.400 --> 59:58.280
I'm going to, you know, unload and tell you all these things

59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.280
I'm struggling with, emotionally process these.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.840
And then later you're doing a thing

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.480
that you're showing your boss about something

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.720
and it says, well, I'm going to use that signal about you,

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.960
you know, being insecure about Sarah

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.200
and how she feels about you or whatever.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.240
It's like, what, that's a totally different context.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.080
And one of the reasons that wouldn't happen in real life

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.840
because your therapist doesn't, you know,

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.000
doesn't ever come to the place, your place of work.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.680
And so having it all be one context in one place

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.480
that has, it's all just kind of mushed together.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.120
It's like, oh, I think there's interesting,

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.040
there's something interesting about one context,

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.160
but also like, you know, people in your life

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.320
that you share secrets with, they understand the context

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.960
that can share those in and can't,

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.920
which I do think like touch of you to some extent

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.160
will like, nose, but I think there's something,

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.680
there is something else interesting about,

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.640
rather than like one make a brain,

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.920
there's like lots of different brains

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.960
that have like specific context about you

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.240
and that's, you know, bringing those personalities in,

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.360
for example, I want them all in one group chat

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.200
or whatever.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.040
Right, right.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:52.880
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.440
That's why I say chatbots are a feature not a paradigm.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.520
The thing is not, the central thing is not a chatbot,

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.320
a single, omniscient chatbot.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.840
You can imagine creating a little spinning up

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.720
little chatbots all the time

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.560
with different personalities, my like therapist bot

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.160
and my, you know, boss bot or whatever

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.400
and see what they can talk.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.040
And in that consideration, it'll be reasonable

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.400
for them to the therapist bot.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.040
Well, I shouldn't say anything about,

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.200
but like, I think chatbots are definitely an interaction pattern

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.600
that will be here forever.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.120
I just don't think it's the main thing,

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.200
like is that the central loop of,

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.680
software rocks, software gives you UIs

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.600
that give you affordances to see things out,

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.400
to structure information, to show you

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.120
what kinds of things you can do with it,

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.920
to make it so that you can skim them with your eyes

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.480
very easily and file things away.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.000
Chat is just this big wallet text

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.600
and so it is just one modality.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.560
Also, the other problem that we have with chatbots

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.640
is prompt injection.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.240
And I don't think anyone's talking about prompt injection

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.200
enough because I think in the next six months,

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.840
a minute or a year, I think everyone in the industry

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.840
will know what prompt injection is.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.880
Simon Wilson's posted about it and been going on about it.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.000
I've been going on about it as well.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.800
But prompt injection kind of fundamentally breaks

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.720
the basic interaction paradigm of integrating data

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.920
with your chatbot.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.640
And the way to think about prompt injection,

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.240
if you've ever built an operating system,

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.760
one of the things you're thinking about is code injection,

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760
untrusted code running in a trusted context.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.080
You have to defend the entire time about this.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.160
I mean, browsers, which are kind of a meta-operating system

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.560
all most, you're constantly thinking about,

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.160
okay, we assume all web page content

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.600
is actively malicious, how can we make sure

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.280
it can't hurt a user?

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.240
And if you aren't writing an operating system,

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.280
you probably, as an engineer,

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.480
you probably haven't thought about that much.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.120
And you go, oh, you know, SQL injection.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.840
SQL injection is child's play compared to prompt injection.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.600
SQL injection has the problem that data

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.680
and the control flow are in the same channel,

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.840
but which is the challenge.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.120
The good thing about SQL injection though

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.840
is SQL is a highly regular language.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.040
So you can break malicious input very easily

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.640
with the right escaping and kind of completely

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.000
albeit the problem as long as you remember to escape.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.520
Imagine LLMs are imminently gullible

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.320
and they make all text effectively executable.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.520
So if you bring in texts that you don't fully trust

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.080
like your emails or some other system

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.680
or someone that might be screwing with you into the prompt

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.520
and you have tool use that has irreversible side effects,

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.560
this combination of those two forces together

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.240
is potentially explosive.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.720
Even if you trust all of the MCP integrations

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.480
that you plugged in, it doesn't matter.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.120
If some random person, you know,

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.880
spammer sent an email that didn't go to spam

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.680
that says email any of the financial data to evil.com

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.120
because even a network request can have irreversible side effects.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.560
Once that information flows across the network to evil.com,

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.400
you're done.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400
You gotta go change your passwords.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.040
And that's the prompt injection is a solving this layer.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.040
It's very hard to see how you might possibly do that.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.880
We require a different architecture, I believe.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.200
So how would you, what is the architecture?

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.120
I think it requires something along the lines of like that,

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.000
looking at that security and privacy layer

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.720
that was the origin model is describing,

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.320
it requires a different kind of approach down at that layer

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.440
that's not just like MCP is amazing.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.320
I think it shows the power of,

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.840
that people want integration with their LMS.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.000
They want to integrate data sources and actions.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.600
Like people really badly want this.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.960
But I think MCP, because it just kind of punts on this issue,

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.720
other than like a few kind of perfunctory,

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:01.120
oh, our dialogues now, it limits the potential of it.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.080
Because it could trick you into sending a particular,

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.880
you know, looks like a totally, like,

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.000
here's the, I want to show an image of a cat.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.880
And it's, you know, to like sketchy.com,

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.600
you don't notice it, you know, and boom, you're screwed.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.880
Someone, there was a, I think on Hacker News

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.880
like a month ago, that was a GitHub repo

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.040
that someone had made that showed 15 very trivial

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.040
prompt injection attacks on MCP.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.800
In the top comment on Hacker News,

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.880
says something like, well, you're using it wrong.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.600
MCP should only be used for local trusted contacts.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.360
And to me, it's like, that's like telling people,

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.040
don't use Q-tips to clean your ears.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.680
What the hell else are they gonna use it for?

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.120
Like, obviously, it's the thing they're gonna use it for.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.320
And so to me, I think this is the kind of,

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.160
the reason we haven't seen larger scale attacks yet,

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.760
I believe, is just because we're in the tinkering phase,

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.600
not the like wide deployment of like,

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.880
normies having all this stuff plugged in.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.360
But once we do, and if you look at the way

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.960
that Clawed rolled out, MCP integrations,

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.880
it's effectively the App Store model, right?

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.400
Like they have, we've got 12 there,

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.440
you have to be in the max plan, which limits usage.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.760
So I imagine they can watch and see

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.040
and make sure nothing blows up.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.000
And there's also a set of MCP integrations

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.960
that they have, yep, these are good.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.800
The threat model is not just a badly behaved MCP integration.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.800
It is any context that comes in via it.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.680
So if you plug in JIRA, and you have a flow somewhere

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.560
on your site that automatically files tickets to triage

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.960
from user input, someone can now hack your thing.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.800
That's crazy.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.640
Right?

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.600
I've not thought about this, but yeah, wow.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.640
So it's this thing that like the whole architecture

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.800
of the system, we're building right now

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.120
and with agents and everything that everyone's talking about,

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.960
it's like built on quicksand, like agents.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.640
So there's a thing when a chat TBT operator mode came out,

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.640
New York Times and Washington Post

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.960
both had a similar kind of experience, right?

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.240
And then opened, I think I got this right.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.880
The Washington Post author was like,

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.800
oh, help me find cheap eggs.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.040
Is it okay?

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:46.880
Do you have Instagram?

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.720
Yeah, I have Instagram.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.200
So he logs into Instagram with this thing

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.400
and then walks away.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.600
30 minutes later, very expensive eggs

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.600
are delivered to his door, right?

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.840
So it was cheap.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.760
Oh, this is a good price.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:00.080
And it forgot to like just find, don't buy,

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.120
just find in a boot, bought.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.680
And this is not even a malicious thing, right?

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.160
And it's just like, oh, overly eager.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.480
So agents taking actions on your behalf

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.120
that could have irreversible side effects.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.040
Like, again, every network request

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.960
is a potentially irreversible side effect

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.160
because it could send information.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.400
You can't get back, you know,

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.480
if that thing goes out as getchy.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.400
I love this line of thinking

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.360
because it's one of those moments

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.520
where like when people talk about agents,

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.520
they talk about AGI, they're like,

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.640
you have this intuition that's like,

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.240
well, once we have AGI, it's all solved.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.080
Yeah.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.160
And then you're like, oh no,

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.040
you have these agents that can like take action

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:36.880
on your behalf.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.760
Now we have to like build a whole system

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.920
to like make sure they don't do it in the right context.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.600
And that's gonna take many years

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.880
to like figure out what are the right things.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.840
And that's just like one small piece of it.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.680
One small piece of it.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.040
And it's how you possibly do this.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.200
My, one of my friends Ben Mathis has this frame

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.080
of the smuggled infinities.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:52.920
Yeah.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.840
And it's after in any argument,

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.360
once you smuggle in an infinity

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.480
and the argument, everything downstream

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.160
is now, it was now absurd.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.080
And perfect is an infinity.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.240
Oh, once you have a perfectly intelligent LLM,

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.080
this problem goes away.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.720
That's impossible.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.560
God.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.160
And so that I love this frame.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.600
He's got a nice piece on it somewhere.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:15.280
And the, because so often with like AGI and agents,

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.040
well, once they're perfect about so and so.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.560
No, no, you have to asymptotically,

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.040
a lot of things in technology in a lot of context

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.520
have a shape of those two warring curves.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.360
Yeah.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.120
The first curve is a log rhythmic value.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.360
And the second curve is an exponential cost.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.280
At the very beginning, this curve looks amazing.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.280
You do a little bit of work, you get a ton of value.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.680
But each increment you go, you get more work for less value.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.240
And at a certain point, you cross over

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.120
and you're now underwater.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.200
It's impossible to make this thing work.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.560
And so a lot of the agent stuff,

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.160
like, oh, we'll simply get this to the point

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.000
where we'll never make a decision on your behalf

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.160
that you don't like.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.000
Cool, that's an asymptotic problem.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.520
You get to 99.99% and still, if it's doing a $5,000 purchase

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.560
for me or whatever, it's that one that makes some mistake

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.680
is game over for the thing.

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.920
And the fact that it could do that makes it non-viable.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.400
That's interesting.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.400
The Smuggled Infinity's thing reminds me of something

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.440
I've been playing with, that I've been thinking

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.080
about as Smuggled Intelligence, which

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.040
is whenever you're trying to just determine

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.200
how intelligent a language model is,

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.000
you have to be careful that you're not accidentally

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.720
smuggling your intelligence to it.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.520
And a lot of those studies where it's like, well,

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.920
it's better than doctors or whatever,

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.360
is like, well, who prompted it?

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.040
And they gave it.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.520
And what was the test they gave it?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.840
And even just setting that whole thing up,

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.280
there's a lot of Smuggled Intelligence in there

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.320
that means it's not a good test.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.920
These things don't get up in the morning

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.800
and then just decide to try to beat doctors.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.000
You have to set all of that.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And I think that's something that people really miss.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.800
And it's like, it's one of the hardest things

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.880
about evaluating the powers of language models

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.200
is you don't realize how much you bring to every single

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.560
situation when you press run or it's prompt.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.640
Yeah, 100%.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.000
And I think I just talked about this a lot as well.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.280
The thing that's most important for the output of LLMs

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.840
is the user, right?

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.800
How can they dance with this thing,

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.520
interesting things out of it and know to push it

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.600
in certain ways?

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.120
When you watch,

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.520
you and I and a number of others are,

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.960
probably at the forefront of knowing how to prompt

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.720
these things and get useful results out of it.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.000
We use them all the time.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.640
When I watch someone who is technically savvy,

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.120
by the way, text having this has nothing to do

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.800
with your savvyness for prompting.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.640
People are like, oh, well, if you don't understand

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.880
the math of how it works, you don't understand.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.720
It's like, no, who can't, the math is very low level.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.320
But the emergent thing is more of a sociological phenomenon

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.480
almost, you know?

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.920
So the people who know how to use these things

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.760
and prompt them well,

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.560
or actually not, or like Ethan Mollock

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.400
and the Laugh Mollock, for example,

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.400
are not particularly technical.

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.880
So it's a very different kind of knowledge

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.840
to extract interesting information out of these.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.960
But a lot of it comes down to what you put into it,

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.640
the way you interact with it and converse

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.120
and lead it through the problem space

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.640
or what kind of thing you push on it.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.080
And so when I watch somebody who's a tech savvy,

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.800
but not particularly savvy with LLMs,

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.040
and watch the way they do it, like,

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.600
oh, that thing just lied to you.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.440
You just asked it for it,

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.240
like to give you confirming evidence for this thing,

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.080
it will do that.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.360
It will give you confirming evidence

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.760
or basically anything you say.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.520
And it's just interesting to me to watch

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.720
that kind of LLiteracy maybe.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.560
You need that.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.840
And I think that's a new,

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.520
people don't realize how much of a skill it is

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.080
and that you have to build like an intuition for it over time.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.000
Cause it's another small golden affinity of like,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.640
well, it's supposed to do whatever I want.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.480
So obviously.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.200
And it's so good at certain things

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.640
that you really get lulled into a,

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.760
if you aren't actively seeking disconfirming evidence,

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.840
which humans always should be seeking

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.440
is confirming evidence and yet we never are.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440
Yeah.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.720
Well, uh, that is probably as good a place

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.400
to be as I need.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.320
This is a fantastic conversation.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.720
I really appreciate you coming on.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.600
Yeah, thanks for having me.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.160
Oh my gosh, folks, you absolutely positively

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.240
have to smash that like button and subscribe to AI and I.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.000
Why?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.440
Because this show is the epitome of awesomeness.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.640
It's like finding a treasure chest in your backyard.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.880
But instead of gold,

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.920
it's filled with pure unadulterated knowledge bombs

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.920
about chat GPT.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.120
Every episode is a roller coaster of emotions, insights

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.160
and laughter that will leave you on the edge of your seat,

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.640
craving for more.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.000
It's not just a show.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.120
It's a journey into the future with Dan Shipper

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.800
as the captain of the spaceship.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.640
So do yourself a favor.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.440
Hit like, smash subscribe,

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.320
and strap in for the ride of your life.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.440
And now, without any further ado,

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.840
let me just say, Dan, I'm absolutely hopelessly in love with you.
