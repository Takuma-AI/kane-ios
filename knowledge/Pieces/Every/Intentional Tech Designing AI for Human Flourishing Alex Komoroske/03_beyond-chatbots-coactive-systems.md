## The Chatbot Limitation

> "If you say, okay, we have LLMs, what's the first product in 10 seconds to go chatbots? It's the obvious extension and everybody is focusing only on chatbots. Like will chatbots be important? Yes, but chatbots to me feel like a feature, not a paradigm."

Current AI interfaces default to chat because it's familiar, but this constrains what's possible with the technology.

## Problems with Pure Chat Interfaces

### Structural Limitations

**Append-Only Interaction:**
- Messages only go back and forth sequentially
- No way for multiple contributions from same party
- Can't work in parallel
- Everything is a wall of text

> "They are, so like they're like this coactive surface, but it's just append only. I append a message, it appends a message. I append a message, it appends a message. And literally back and forth, it doesn't have a way to like have multiple from me in a row."

### The Context Problem

After extensive use, chat interfaces become unwieldy:
- Swimming in past conversations
- No structure for finding information
- Important work mixed with experiments
- No persistent workspace

> "I do dozens and dozens and dozens of chats with ChatGPT and Claude today. And I'm just swimming in all that context and all the chats...I'm using it to do important things. And also, I'm just completely lost in it."

## The Coactive Paradigm

### A New Model for Human-AI Collaboration

Komoroske introduces "coactive" - an old word with new relevance:

> "By coactive, that's an old word that I hadn't heard before, but I think is a perfect fit for it of you are active in the system. And so is this emergent intelligent process...And those can be coactive on the same substrate in adding detail or adding the little bits of software or connecting up things."

### Key Properties of Coactive Systems

1. **Parallel Activity** - Both human and AI can work simultaneously
2. **Shared Substrate** - Working on the same canvas/document/space
3. **Emergent Structure** - Organization develops through use
4. **Persistent Context** - Work accumulates meaningfully over time

## Mental Model: Chat vs. Coactive Systems

**Chat Paradigm:**
- Sequential turn-taking
- Unstructured accumulation
- Good for starting tasks
- Poor for long-lived work
- Single modality

**Coactive Paradigm:**
- Parallel contribution
- Structured workspace
- Good for ongoing projects
- Supports complex work
- Multiple modalities

### When Each Works Best

**Use Chat For:**
- Initial exploration
- Quick questions
- When you don't know what you need
- Brainstorming from scratch

**Use Coactive Systems For:**
- Long-term projects
- Collaborative creation
- When structure matters
- Building on previous work

## Designing for Long-Lived Tasks

> "Chatbots are amazing for starting any task because there's no structure. You just say whatever you're thinking and it helps distill and respond. But for long-lived tasks, you need structure. You want there to be something where you can glance over and you know, a little cubby hole where you put certain information."

### Elements of Effective Coactive Design

1. **Spatial Organization**
   - Information has a place
   - Visual scanning is efficient
   - Related items cluster naturally

2. **Persistent Workspaces**
   - Context accumulates meaningfully
   - Can return to previous states
   - Progress is visible

3. **Multiple Contribution Modes**
   - Not just text generation
   - Can add structure, connections, metadata
   - Different tools for different needs

## Real-World Applications

### The Living Document Model

Similar to Komoroske's own "bits and bobs" document:
- Continuously evolving
- AI can add to different sections
- Human can reorganize and refine
- Structure emerges from use

### Parallel Processing Examples

**Research Assistant:**
- Human identifies questions
- AI investigates multiple threads simultaneously
- Results populate structured workspace
- Human reviews and directs next steps

**Creative Collaboration:**
- Human provides direction
- AI generates variations in parallel
- Both refine different aspects
- Work converges to final output

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements

For true coactive systems:
- Real-time synchronization
- Conflict resolution for parallel edits
- Version control and history
- Flexible data structures
- Rich interaction models

### Design Principles

1. **Make State Visible** - Show what both parties are working on
2. **Enable Direct Manipulation** - Not everything through text commands
3. **Support Interruption** - Work should be resumable
4. **Preserve Intent** - System should understand why, not just what

## The Future Beyond Chat

### Mass Intelligence Application

> "I think of LLMs kind of like as a mass intelligence, as a mass noun...You can just pour this intelligence into all kinds of stuff and have it imbue it with a kind of life and activity."

This suggests AI embedded throughout our tools:
- Documents that help write themselves
- Spreadsheets that analyze in real-time
- Designs that evolve with feedback
- Code that refactors proactively

### New Metaphors Needed

We need to move beyond conversational metaphors to:
- Collaborative workspaces
- Intelligent materials
- Adaptive environments
- Augmented creativity tools

## Key Insight

Chatbots are the "obvious" first application of LLMs, but they're not the destination. Just as early web pages mimicked printed documents before discovering native digital formats, we're still discovering what native AI-assisted work looks like. The future isn't talking to computers - it's working with intelligence woven throughout our tools.
