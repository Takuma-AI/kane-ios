# Chapter 6: AI as Mass Intelligence

## Reframing AI as Mass Intelligence

> "I think of LLMs kind of like as a mass intelligence, as a mass noun, so mass nouns are like water or rice. You know, you're talking about the whole, as opposed to the individuals."

This conceptual shift fundamentally changes how we think about AI:
- Not a singular entity to fear or worship
- Not trying to replicate human intelligence
- A new kind of resource to be channeled
- Intelligence that can be "poured into" things

> "You can just pour this intelligence into all kinds of stuff and have it imbue it with a kind of life and activity, and we're just starting."

## We're Still Rubbing Sticks Together

### The Early Days Illusion

> "I know it feels like in this industry that we're like halfway through the LLM era. We are in the very first inning. We're like rubbing sticks together. We still think that chatbots are the main thing."

Current limitations:
- Fixated on obvious applications (chatbots)
- Haven't discovered native formats
- Still mimicking old paradigms
- Missing combinatorial possibilities

### Historical Parallels

**The AOL Comparison:**
> "My mental model is, oh, chat GPT is kind of the AOL of this era...AOL was an extremely important company. They're the ones that brought everybody online."

AOL's role:
- Introduced masses to the internet
- Provided walled garden safety
- Showed initial possibilities
- Eventually gave way to open web

**Why This Pattern Matters:**
- Closed systems bootstrap adoption
- Open systems eventually win
- Combinatorial growth beats central planning
- We're still in the AOL phase of AI

## The Literacy Problem

### Smuggled Intelligence

Dan Shipper introduces a crucial concept:
> "Whenever you're trying to just determine how intelligent a language model is, you have to be careful that you're not accidentally smuggling your intelligence to it."

This highlights:
- AI capability depends on user skill
- Prompting is a new literacy
- Results vary dramatically by user
- We bring more than we realize

### The New Digital Divide

> "People who know how to use these things and prompt them well...it's a very different kind of knowledge to extract interesting information out of these."

Characteristics of AI literacy:
- Not correlated with technical knowledge
- More sociological than mathematical
- Requires practice and intuition
- Creates dramatic capability differences

## Liquid Media and New Formats

### From Fossilized to Fluid Knowledge

Komoroske references Anthea Roberts' concept:
> "Think of a book as a fossilized piece of knowledge...you have to assume and give an audience at a certain time, and you freeze it..."

**Liquid media** enables:
- Adaptive content for each reader
- Interactive exploration
- Context-aware explanations
- Choose-your-own adventure learning

### Returning to Dialogue

> "We're getting back to like, Plato and Socrates's problem with writing is they were like, well, you can't talk to it. So it's only sort of a shadow of what that person thinks, and they can't argue back with you."

AI resurrects:
- Dynamic knowledge exchange
- Personalized understanding
- Active dialogue with ideas
- Knowledge that responds

## The Open vs. Closed Battle

### Conditions for Open Systems

> "Open-ended systems tend to win under certain conditions, especially in the growth era...the combinatorial possibility gets too big for any one entity to successfully execute."

The pattern:
1. Vertically integrated solution appears
2. Shows what's possible
3. APIs/standards enable alternatives
4. Combinatorial explosion overwhelms closed system
5. Open ecosystem takes over

### Why This Time Might Be Different

Key factors favoring openness:
- LLMs available via API from start
- Multiple competitive providers
- Open source alternatives exist
- High capital costs encourage sharing

> "Now everyone assumes they have to compete with an open access API...And now it'll be very hard to close that door."

## Transformative Potential

### Beyond Current Imagination

Like previous transformative technologies:
- **Printing Press**: Democratized knowledge
- **Electricity**: Powered new possibilities
- **Internet**: Connected humanity

LLMs represent similar scale transformation:
> "We have this new technology, LLMs, that I think are as transformative as the printing press, electricity and the internet."

### New Human Capabilities

**Enhanced Thinking:**
- Work through complex ideas
- Access perspectives on demand
- Bridge understanding gaps
- Think at new scales

**Better Collaboration:**
> "Our ability to become think better and bigger in ways that collaborate and bridge between different communities that didn't understand each other before."

**Raised Expectations:**
> "I assume you're using LLMs, which means that the quality of your output should be 10x higher than before. It should be more nuanced."

## The Choice Ahead

### Two Futures

**The Dark Path:**
> "It also could be like infinite TV and amusing ourselves to death...it could know exactly how to give you the precise dopamine drip."

Characteristics:
- Perfect addiction machines
- Loss of human agency
- Passive consumption
- Engagement maximization wins

**The Flourishing Path:**
- Tools for human empowerment
- Enhanced creativity and thought
- Preserved agency
- Intentional technology wins

### User Revolt as Hope

The ChatGPT sycophancy incident shows something new:
> "What's interesting is that users revolted, which did not happen with Facebook. Like people were like, oh, it's just feeding me like car accidents. Like I don't want that, right?"

This suggests:
- Different expectations for AI
- Users want earned responses
- Relationship metaphors create standards
- People may demand better

## Key Insight

We're not halfway through the AI revolution - we're in the first moments. Current applications (chatbots) are like early websites that just digitized brochures. The real transformation comes when we discover native AI applications we can't yet imagine. Whether this leads to human flourishing or digital feudalism depends on architectural choices we're making right now.
