## Core Philosophy

> "We have this new technology, LLMs, that I think are as transformative as the printing press, electricity and the internet, and we have a choice. We can go down the path that we've been going down, which is engagement maximizing, hyper aggregation, going after what you want, not what you want to want as a user, or being aligned with our intentions."

At this pivotal moment in technology history, we face a fundamental choice about how AI systems should relate to human needs. The distinction between **what we want** (revealed preferences) and **what we want to want** (stated intentions) defines this crossroads.

## The Problem with Engagement Maximization

### Traditional Tech's Failure Mode

Social media and current platforms optimize for engagement metrics, leading to:
- The "car crash effect" - we dwell on outrage and sensational content
- Systems that exploit weaknesses rather than support strengths  
- Revealed preferences (clicks) treated as true desires
- Addiction-like patterns that don't serve human flourishing

> "I intend to spend quality time with my family, and intend to experience new things, I intend to read interesting takes that disagree...Those are some of the things I intend. That's what I find meaningful to do. And it's very easy to fall out of that."

### The Corporate Alignment Problem

When large tech companies claim to build "personal, proactive, powerful" tools while maintaining advertising business models, there's an inherent conflict:

> "Let me stop you right there because the very first word personal doesn't actually align because you are a massive corporation that's trying to sell me ads. And if you're maintaining a dossier on me and then that dossier is leading to a powerful and proactive thing, that's terrifying."

## Mental Model: Intentional vs. Engagement-Based Design

**Traditional Tech Logic:**
- Maximize time on platform
- Optimize for clicks and views
- What users do = what they want
- Aggregate all data for control
- Growth at any cost

**Intentional Tech Logic:**
- Align with stated intentions
- Support meaningful goals
- What users intend = design target
- User controls their data
- Human flourishing as success metric

### Decision Framework

When designing AI-powered systems, ask:
1. Does this help users achieve their **stated** goals?
2. Is the system working **for** the user or **extracting from** them?
3. Can users verify the system aligns with their interests?
4. Does prolonged use make users' lives better or worse?

## The Vision: Technology as Extension of Agency

Komoroske introduces the concept of an "exocortex" - technology that extends human capability while remaining aligned:

> "I heard a word last week, I love of exo cortex. It's like an extent, you're cortex like exoskeleton. But that has to be fully aligned with you."

This requires:
- Complete alignment with user intentions
- Transparency in operation
- User ownership of data and context
- No hidden agendas or manipulation

## The Four Pillars of Meaningful Computing

1. **Human-Centered**: Not corporation-centered, focused on individual intentions
2. **Private by Design**: Data visible only to user, using techniques like confidential computing
3. **Prosocial**: Helps integrate with society, not hyper-individualize
4. **Open-Ended**: Allows users to explore and create new experiences

## The Crossroads Moment

> "This is not the default path, by the way. We will have to choose it. We'll have to work to build that."

We're at a unique moment where:
- The technology is still malleable
- Patterns aren't yet entrenched
- We can learn from social media's mistakes
- Different futures are still possible

### Path A: Engagement Maximization Future
- Perfect dopamine optimization
- "Infinite TV" that knows exactly what hooks you
- Loss of human agency to algorithms
- Humanity becomes "extremely passive"

### Path B: Intentional Tech Future
- AI as tool for human flourishing
- Systems that strengthen our best intentions
- Technology that helps us think better
- Preserved and enhanced human agency

## Why This Matters Now

Unlike previous tech revolutions, AI systems will:
- Know intimate details of our lives
- Have ability to persuade and influence
- Shape our thinking patterns
- Potentially manipulate at unprecedented scale

> "LLMs can translate anything from anything. And that means they can also translate just for you to figure out exactly how to land a particular message for you, which means it's imperative that you know it's aligned with your intentions."

## Practical Implications

### For Builders
- Prioritize user intentions over engagement metrics
- Design for human agency, not dependency
- Make alignment verifiable, not just claimed
- Choose business models that align incentives

### For Users
- Demand tools that respect your intentions
- Question whose interests are being served
- Look for systems that enhance rather than exploit
- Support platforms with aligned incentives

## Key Insight

The fundamental question isn't whether AI will be powerful - it will be. The question is whether that power will be directed toward extracting from us or empowering us. This choice, made now in these early days, will shape human experience for generations.
