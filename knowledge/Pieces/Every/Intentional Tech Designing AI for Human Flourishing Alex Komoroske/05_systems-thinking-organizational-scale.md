## The Systems Perspective

Komoroske's journey to systems thinking began with Wikipedia:

> "I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the emergent power dynamics of Wikipedia's user community...How are all these strangers working on this thing with no coordination. And yet you get this convergent, extremely important result out of it. That's insane. It's wild."

This fascination with emergent behavior shapes his entire approach to technology and organizations.

## The Evolution of a Systems Thinker

### From Web Platform to Systems

His path revealed a pattern:
1. **Google Search** - Understanding information systems
2. **Chrome Web Platform** - Navigating open ecosystems
3. **AR Strategy** - Creating emergent consensus
4. **Pattern Recognition** - Realizing it's all systems

> "I'm not a web developer ecosystem guy. I'm a systems guy. And the same techniques I've been advising...are the same techniques I used...The reason they work, the lenses I'm usingâ€”game theory and power dynamics and evolutionary biology."

### The Platform PM's Advantage

> "I think a lot of PMs are under the misunderstanding that they're in way more control of their users and the usage than they actually are...If you're the lead PM for the web platform, which is an open system with multiple browser vendors who don't like each other very much and are constantly bickering...you are under no illusion that you're in control."

## The Slime Mold Insights

### Exponential Coordination Costs

The slime mold deck captures a fundamental truth:

> "As organizations get larger, they get much, much, much slower. And that's true even if you assume everybody is actively good at what they do, actively hardworking and actively collaborative. And it rises due to an exponential coordination cost blowup."

Key insight: This isn't about people being bad at their jobs. It's physics.

### The Invisible Force

> "It's the force that we all deal with constantly. And we don't even realize we're dealing with it. And so we get frustrated with ourselves, we get frustrated at Jeff over there, who if only he would do X, this whole thing would be easier."

We fight symptoms while missing the underlying dynamic.

## Mental Model: Individual Decisions vs. System Dynamics

**Traditional Thinking:**
- Focus on individual decisions
- Blame specific people/choices
- Try to optimize locally
- Assume linear cause-effect

**Systems Thinking:**
- Focus on emergent patterns
- Understand incentive structures
- Optimize globally
- Recognize feedback loops

> "I look at the emergent characteristics of the system. What would each person do inductively? And how does that, how do those decisions, how are they interdependent?"

## The Cohesion Floor Problem

### Scale Changes Everything

As organizations grow, the minimum viable feature size increases:

> "If you're at Google, if I haven't tried to pitch a product to other teams...they say, how many net new active, net new one-day actors do you think this product will get? I'll say, I don't know, 50,000...I wouldn't do this for 50 million."

This creates dead zones of innovation:
- Small valuable features can't get built
- Niche needs go unserved
- Only mass-market solutions survive
- Innovation moves to the edges

## Complex Adaptive Systems

### Key Principles Komoroske Applies

1. **Inductive Reasoning**
   - Start with simple cases
   - Build up to complex behaviors
   - Look for patterns across scales

2. **Feedback Loops**
   - Identify reinforcing cycles
   - Understand dampening effects
   - Recognize tipping points

3. **Emergent Properties**
   - The whole differs from parts
   - New behaviors arise at scale
   - Control is often illusory

### The Gravity Well Dynamic

A specific pattern he identifies:

> "People who are using the system, on one side, people who are not using on the other side...The people on the boundary who are right at the edge of possibly using it, do they want to be in or do they want to be out?"

Facebook's growth exemplifies this:
- Started at Harvard (high status)
- Extended to Ivy League (want to be with Harvard)
- Each expansion pulls in the next group
- Eventually becomes inescapable

## Coordination and Communication

### The Pea Shooter Problem

Human communication is inherently lossy:

> "Every time we're trying to communicate, we do this conscious process to distill the squishy, rich nuance into a little tiny packet of information. It's a seed of a thought and I shoot it into a little pea shooter into your brain. And I hope it lands in a little soil that will grow into a thought flower."

This explains why:
- Coordination costs explode with scale
- Misunderstandings compound
- Organizational knowledge fragments
- Silos naturally form

### How LLMs Might Change This

> "Language models are the first tool that makes that kind of tacit knowledge or know how transferable between people."

Potential improvements:
- Richer context transfer
- Less lossy communication
- Shared mental models
- Parallel understanding

But also new challenges:
- Different meta-games emerge
- Green-shifting still occurs
- Political dynamics adapt
- Complexity remains

## Practical Applications

### For Organizations

**Recognize the Physics:**
- Coordination costs are exponential, not linear
- Fighting them directly is futile
- Design around them instead
- Keep teams small when possible

**Work with Emergent Dynamics:**
- Set initial conditions carefully
- Create good feedback loops
- Allow organic structure
- Don't over-control

### For Individuals

**Navigate Systems Wisely:**
- Understand the incentives
- Find leverage points
- Work with forces, not against
- Build coalitions naturally

**The Nerd Club Approach:**
> "I created a little nerd club behind the scenes with a bunch of people that I just kind of selected that people who when I said it was a nerd club didn't go, ew..."

Organic, bottom-up consensus building often beats top-down mandates.

## Key Insight

Organizations aren't slow because people are incompetent - they're slow because coordination has exponential costs. This is as fundamental as gravity. Smart systems thinking doesn't fight these forces but channels them productively. The winners will be those who design systems that work with human and organizational nature, not against it.
