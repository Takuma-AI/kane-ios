00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
Rory Sutherland says there's like three types of innovation.

00:02.640 --> 00:04.960
There's faster horses, and then there's teleportation.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.080
Like you want it to exist, you don't know how to get there,

00:07.080 --> 00:08.560
but if I tell you you want teleportation,

00:08.560 --> 00:10.760
you want teleportation, everybody wants teleportation.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.480
And then there's like Japanese toilets.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.720
For me, the things I'm like wandering around

00:14.720 --> 00:18.120
and trying to find are the Japanese toilets of AI.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.520
I am looking for mostly new experiences,

00:21.520 --> 00:24.800
things that surprise you with the place that they're playing.

00:24.800 --> 00:31.800
Hey, it's Dan, we're going to get to the episode in a moment,

00:40.840 --> 00:43.080
but I wanted to share with you one thing before we do.

00:43.080 --> 00:47.040
I think that writing is the most important skill in the AI age.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.760
Now that you can code in English,

00:48.760 --> 00:51.960
the line between a writer and a builder is blurring.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.680
And I think in a war like that,

00:53.680 --> 00:55.480
the most important thing you can learn to do

00:55.480 --> 00:59.240
no matter what your job is, is learn to tell great stories.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.440
That's why I want to tell you about how to write with AI.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.680
It's a course you put on at every led by our lead writer,

01:04.680 --> 01:05.680
Evan Armstrong.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.920
It's a four week course designed to teach you everything

01:07.920 --> 01:10.280
you need to know to write incredible things with AI.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.120
We go through all of the latest technology,

01:12.120 --> 01:15.440
including chat to BT, Claude, and some of our internal incubations,

01:15.440 --> 01:18.040
like Spiral and Lex, to give you a powerful toolkit

01:18.040 --> 01:19.240
to tell amazing stories.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.240
The course starts February 13th,

01:21.240 --> 01:24.480
and early bird access ends this Friday, January 24th.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.760

01:26.760 --> 01:29.880
grab your spot at rightwithai.xyz,

01:29.880 --> 01:31.520
and now onto the episode.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.920
Neville, welcome to the show.

01:32.920 --> 01:33.840
Good to be here.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.360
So for people who don't know, you are a partner at Spark Capital.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.200
That's right.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.360
You've made a bunch of impressive investments,

01:41.360 --> 01:44.480
including in Cruz Discord.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.440
A very recent one is Grenola.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.600
And before we start, you said something,

01:48.600 --> 01:51.760
which I didn't know about you, which is your investing strategy

01:51.760 --> 01:53.320
is not prolific.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.720
You only do a couple a year.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.360
Why is that?

01:56.360 --> 01:59.960
First of all, I just think that, so I was a founder before,

01:59.960 --> 02:02.560
becoming an investor.

02:02.560 --> 02:07.080
And I found that I had no horror venture capital stories

02:07.080 --> 02:11.080
that sometimes investors have, or entrepreneurs have.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.960
But I also basically had a bunch of noops.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.640
I had investors that were fine and great board members

02:15.640 --> 02:18.160
and maybe offered a random piece of advice.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.880
But weren't in the muck enough and in the nuance

02:20.880 --> 02:22.880
enough to give good feedback, because they

02:22.880 --> 02:24.840
were investing in 15,000 things.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.240
What does noops stand for?

02:27.240 --> 02:28.080
No opposition?

02:28.080 --> 02:31.520
Yeah, they were just fine.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.800
It was like, there are no damage.

02:33.800 --> 02:34.880
I don't have a horror story.

02:34.880 --> 02:35.960
It did no harm.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.920
But it was also like, would the company have been exactly

02:39.920 --> 02:43.720
the same if they were not there, probably.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.120
And I just, there's a thing on our website

02:46.120 --> 02:48.040
that I think we collectively believe at Spark,

02:48.040 --> 02:51.640
which is that there aren't really any startup playbooks.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.960
I think as a founder, you're doing something super unique

02:54.960 --> 02:56.800
with every, so you probably already believe

02:56.800 --> 02:58.800
there's really no playbook for what you're trying to do.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.600
But generally, every single journey is unique

03:02.600 --> 03:04.520
and all the devils and the details.

03:04.520 --> 03:08.840
And so I think for me, the proxy is if you're a startup CEO

03:08.840 --> 03:11.080
or running a small org, you can manage

03:11.080 --> 03:15.280
like eight or nine direct reports where you kind of understand

03:15.320 --> 03:18.160
everything they're doing and outside of that,

03:18.160 --> 03:21.040
it starts to, the edges get fuzzy.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.120
And it's just the same thing.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.400
Like I want to work with eight or nine or 10 companies

03:25.400 --> 03:28.120
really closely, as much as a founder really wants me around

03:28.120 --> 03:29.440
and I go away if it's not.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.280
And so you try and make the rest of the math work

03:32.280 --> 03:35.440
and like construct life about the way you want to live

03:35.440 --> 03:37.040
and then see if you can make it work

03:37.040 --> 03:39.760
versus letting somebody's financial or business model

03:39.760 --> 03:41.440
force you into working or what you don't want to work.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.280
I like that.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.360
I mean, I think it's, it takes some balls.

03:45.360 --> 03:50.240
It's better than like, I think obviously the sort of

03:50.240 --> 03:51.800
spray and prey like small checks and a lot of things

03:51.800 --> 03:56.480
like that, that's a well-draught strategy.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.680
But I think taking enough risk to be concentrated

04:00.680 --> 04:05.680
and to actually call your shot is, I think it's quite cool.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.440
Well, it's not deep, spray and prey even on the front end.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.440
I mean, basically the whole venture capital industry

04:10.440 --> 04:12.920
since I joined, I've been to this for a little over decade now,

04:12.920 --> 04:16.200
is basically doing that at both ends of the spectrum, right?

04:16.200 --> 04:18.520
You've got the, I'm gonna write 100K checks

04:18.520 --> 04:20.760
into a million things and then you have the, well,

04:20.760 --> 04:25.040
if I raise $100,000,000 that I can own a proxy

04:25.040 --> 04:28.080
of the whole market firms, which is like a lot of our peers

04:28.080 --> 04:29.160
that started around the same time.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.160
We did, that's been their strategy

04:31.160 --> 04:32.240
to mitigate risk over time.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.920
And I'm like, look, the whole point of this thing is risk,

04:33.920 --> 04:36.440
like accept the risk and like go do the work you want

04:36.440 --> 04:37.280
to do with good people.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.120
That is interesting.

04:38.200 --> 04:42.120
Something about what you said about doing something unique,

04:42.120 --> 04:44.440
triggered something for me, I think you'd have good thoughts

04:44.440 --> 04:49.440
on this, which is I feel like I've been grasping for words

04:49.920 --> 04:53.680
for how to describe whatever it is for a while recently.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.520
Yeah.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.240
And I think that that's a really interesting place to be

04:56.240 --> 05:00.600
because like we're doing something that's working

05:00.600 --> 05:02.840
and there isn't yet a word for it.

05:02.840 --> 05:06.800
The closest thing I've come up with is multi-modal media company.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.680
And what was the other idea you had a little while ago

05:10.680 --> 05:11.520
that was not good?

05:11.520 --> 05:12.520
The malleable media.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.040
That's terrible.

05:13.040 --> 05:13.960
Meta-media.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.400
Multi-modal media is my,

05:15.400 --> 05:19.200
but there's a lot of M's in it, which is a problem.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.000
So like it's multi-modal publishing maybe?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.920
I don't know, we're working on it.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.200
But like the point is we publish writing,

05:26.200 --> 05:28.200
we publish videos, we publish podcasts,

05:28.200 --> 05:29.280
and we publish software.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.640
But that's of the time, right?

05:30.640 --> 05:34.960
Publishing software is a lot closer to publishing articles

05:34.960 --> 05:36.080
in 2025.

05:36.080 --> 05:36.800
Exactly.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.320
Then it was 10 years ago, right?

05:38.320 --> 05:40.400
And that's new, you're newly able to do that, right?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.600
Yeah, so like there's not really a word for it.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.200
So I'm trying to like figure that out.

05:44.200 --> 05:50.200
But there's this interesting thing where like I'm realizing

05:50.200 --> 05:52.280
that working on something that I don't have a word for

05:52.280 --> 05:54.280
is actually like really valuable and really cool,

05:54.280 --> 05:56.360
especially because it's starting to work.

05:56.360 --> 06:00.520
But then there's also this trap that I think you can get into.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.040
Sometimes I've definitely fallen into this too,

06:02.040 --> 06:04.120
where it's like you think you don't have a word for it,

06:04.120 --> 06:05.880
but there is actually a word and it's been done a lot

06:05.880 --> 06:08.880
before, and you can't fool yourself.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.400
Do you have an exact example of that in your head?

06:14.920 --> 06:17.840
I don't have like a specific example off the other hand.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.240
But like, I don't know, when we started every, for example,

06:21.240 --> 06:23.280
we were like, oh, like this kind of media company

06:23.280 --> 06:24.120
has never been done before.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.760
We wanted to be a bundle of different newsletters.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.000
And it's like, it's a magazine.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.520
A bundle of these letters is a magazine.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.520
Yeah.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.800
And so like, and yeah, there were some things

06:34.800 --> 06:38.560
that were different about it, but like about a year or two

06:38.560 --> 06:40.600
and we realized that all of the complexity

06:40.600 --> 06:42.960
that we had built into the model didn't need to be there.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.040
And it was just like, it was just a newsletter, basically,

06:45.040 --> 06:48.400
and the way the newsletter worked was sort of like a magazine.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.040
That's the tension though, and anything new,

06:51.040 --> 06:54.200
which is like, of course it proxies to something

06:54.200 --> 06:55.120
that's pre-existing.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.680
Of course it proxies something, but if you then adhere,

06:57.680 --> 06:59.080
once you did something change in you,

06:59.080 --> 07:01.000
we start calling it a newsletter,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.360
because that's also a trap.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.400
Like the early days of, we were an early investor

07:06.400 --> 07:08.480
in Postmates, and back in this on-demand land,

07:08.480 --> 07:11.320
you had Postmates in Uber and DoorDash and Lyft,

07:11.320 --> 07:15.080
and you know, the Twitter Roddy looks at that

07:15.080 --> 07:18.240
and is like, you know, that's just a delivery company.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.840
That's the same thing as a taxi company.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.320
And yet, if those founders had internalized that

07:24.320 --> 07:25.800
and just been like, yeah, we're just a taxi company.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.840
In fact, you just wouldn't have done,

07:27.840 --> 07:30.840
like you wouldn't have done any of the things

07:30.840 --> 07:32.440
that you ended up doing over time.

07:32.440 --> 07:36.760
And so, I don't know, I think definitions really matter.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.680
If you're doing something new,

07:38.680 --> 07:40.320
which I think you are trying to grasp

07:40.320 --> 07:43.360
or something new right now, I would like find

07:43.360 --> 07:45.920
the weird words that are capturing

07:45.920 --> 07:47.280
that essence inside of you, right?

07:47.280 --> 07:51.240
I think for me, like actually calling us a newsletter

07:51.240 --> 07:55.600
was quite freeing because it was like,

07:55.600 --> 07:57.320
we were doing all this complicated stuff

07:57.320 --> 07:58.920
to not just be a newsletter,

07:58.920 --> 08:00.400
and then once we just like dropped it,

08:00.400 --> 08:02.200
and it was just like, no, it's just a newsletter,

08:02.200 --> 08:04.080
and like it's a bunch of creative people writing stuff,

08:04.080 --> 08:05.600
and like we're gonna do interesting stuff.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.440
We just, you know, we don't know what it is yet,

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
but for now we're just gonna write

08:08.440 --> 08:10.600
because that's what we love to do.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.400
That was like, that was really helpful

08:12.400 --> 08:17.280
because I think what's been quite important for me

08:17.280 --> 08:22.120
entrepreneurially is to start to be really comfortable

08:22.120 --> 08:25.040
with like whatever it is that I authentically believe

08:25.040 --> 08:27.880
and want to do as opposed to like triangulating

08:27.880 --> 08:30.640
between like what I believe in what I think will sound okay

08:30.640 --> 08:33.280
and like what I think I can justify basically,

08:34.240 --> 08:36.280
and I think like being able to say,

08:36.280 --> 08:38.720
no, it's a newsletter and I'm like gonna write a lot

08:38.720 --> 08:40.320
is like was an expression of that.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.640
It's like that's what I wanna do,

08:41.640 --> 08:44.160
and everything else is like flowed from that,

08:44.160 --> 08:46.960
and then we found some new stuff that we're doing

08:46.960 --> 08:48.680
that is like, oh, I can't really describe what this is,

08:48.680 --> 08:50.280
but it's really cool, and there's like this creative

08:50.280 --> 08:52.680
soup happening, and I'm like really excited, so fun.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.360
So yeah, I obviously like in entrepreneurship

08:56.360 --> 08:57.840
in general, like there are no hard and fast rules,

08:57.840 --> 08:59.920
like sometimes you don't wanna call yourself a newsletter

09:00.000 --> 09:01.360
because like that ruins the like,

09:01.360 --> 09:02.520
you wanna find the magical thing,

09:02.520 --> 09:03.800
but you don't wanna like force it.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.520
Yeah, and the irony of this conversation is like,

09:06.520 --> 09:09.320
what you're doing to find what you really wanna do

09:09.320 --> 09:11.040
is a little bit rooted in the past,

09:11.040 --> 09:13.880
but also this awkward new thing you're now trying to describe,

09:13.880 --> 09:16.400
and then like what I found that I really wanna do

09:16.400 --> 09:19.480
is also anachronistic, but because it's the old way

09:19.480 --> 09:20.520
venture capital used to be.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.640
Like I just wanna invest in hand full of companies

09:22.640 --> 09:24.200
and work really close to those founders

09:24.200 --> 09:27.520
in a smallish firm where I trust my partners,

09:27.520 --> 09:29.120
we all work together on something,

09:29.120 --> 09:31.680
he knows only seven of us on the venture team at Spark,

09:31.680 --> 09:35.600
and like that was how Sequoia was 40 years ago,

09:35.600 --> 09:37.160
and it worked well, it's just not the way

09:37.160 --> 09:38.680
people are building firms today.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.040
Yeah, what does that like do?

09:40.040 --> 09:42.480
Like now that the ecosystem is like these gigantic

09:42.480 --> 09:44.440
mega funds that look at like seed investing

09:44.440 --> 09:47.920
as like loss leaders for like big growth rounds,

09:47.920 --> 09:51.240
you know, like how are you thinking about how that changes,

09:51.240 --> 09:53.040
or if it seems like it doesn't really change

09:53.040 --> 09:56.840
what you're doing, but like how does it affect your approach?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.640
I mean, we're still good,

10:01.640 --> 10:02.800
like I think an important start of this,

10:02.800 --> 10:05.000
if we're still good citizens with all of these players as well,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.760
right, you end up co-investing with people.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.840
I really wanted you to shit on them.

10:08.840 --> 10:13.840
I know, I was like, I must hold back slightly from now.

10:18.200 --> 10:23.360
It is not a, I think those firms are a viable strategy,

10:23.360 --> 10:27.280
I think they are a different product,

10:27.280 --> 10:29.680
and as long as a founder understands

10:29.680 --> 10:31.680
what product they're buying,

10:31.680 --> 10:34.440
then I'm super happy with all of them existing

10:34.440 --> 10:35.440
in the ecosystem.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.800
I think the things that make me frustrated

10:37.800 --> 10:40.280
is when I'm in a conversation,

10:40.280 --> 10:41.480
sometimes with a current founder,

10:41.480 --> 10:43.160
like I'm on the board of this company,

10:43.160 --> 10:44.240
they're going out to race.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.360
So never mind, I'm competing with them.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.960
Like they're going out to race a series B or a series C,

10:47.960 --> 10:52.640
and the stories they're being told by investors

10:52.640 --> 10:56.000
about what the product is without going through the whole,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.560
it's just like not entirely truth.

10:59.560 --> 11:04.040
You cannot be investing five times a month

11:04.040 --> 11:06.800
and operating out of a $10 billion fund

11:06.800 --> 11:09.680
and get anything more than a random phone call

11:09.680 --> 11:12.400
every four years on a thing.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.520
And there are firms that are very good at being transparent

11:14.520 --> 11:16.600
about what this is, the transactional relationship,

11:16.600 --> 11:19.040
you get the money and you run away.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.520
I think actually Founders Fund is very good

11:20.520 --> 11:23.400
at being very honest about this.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.080
And there's lots of people that do a lot of

11:25.080 --> 11:26.600
storing around what they're selling.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.040
So as long as people know what they're buying

11:28.040 --> 11:28.960
and what they're selling, it's fine.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.680
We sell a different thing.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.720
And some Founders, that's really important,

11:32.720 --> 11:34.400
and it's wonderful, and they want that process

11:34.400 --> 11:35.240
and some don't.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.120
You have a connection, a kismet with anybody,

11:37.120 --> 11:39.320
or you don't, and we work on those things.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.000
That makes sense.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.800
Well, I want to talk about one of your latest investments,

11:43.800 --> 11:47.000
which is granola, which is one of my favorite AI products.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.440
And I think it's becoming one of everybody's favorite AI

11:49.440 --> 11:50.440
products.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.920
We've had Chris on the podcast.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.600
We have Chris wrote an article for every year

11:54.600 --> 11:56.880
that did really well, it's really amazing stuff.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.800
I think he's super talented.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.560
What did you see in that when you invested?

12:02.560 --> 12:06.000
Well, when did you invest?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.920
Was it before they had the product they have now or is it after?

12:08.920 --> 12:12.920
So I've known Chris for over a decade.

12:12.920 --> 12:16.560
Chris was a founder of a company called Socratic.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.320
Back in the day, kind of like previous AI generation.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.200
And that was actually a Spark portfolio company.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.440
And so he's been part of the family for a really long time.

12:26.440 --> 12:30.640
And his first attempt at making this

12:30.640 --> 12:34.240
was, as you'll talk about now, was a little bit of a misfire.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.880
So he got to notes as a canonical thing

12:37.880 --> 12:39.200
that you can work on.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.080
But it was very interruptive.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.960
And the use flow without going through it all

12:43.960 --> 12:45.200
just wasn't the thing.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.320
It was like the place to play, but not the thing.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.520
And so I hung out with a bunch at C that we played and talked

12:50.520 --> 12:53.800
about product and looked at early prototypes and so and so forth.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.400
For us, it just wasn't over the line.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.400
And so he did raise a seed from somewhere else.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.000
And then we just, you know, you connect with certain people.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.520
And so we just kept in touch.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.360
And then probably about four or five, six months,

13:04.360 --> 13:05.040
something like that.

13:05.040 --> 13:09.160
After the seed, he stumbled into what is now granola.

13:09.160 --> 13:13.600
As soon as you play with that, if you have any taste or product

13:13.600 --> 13:17.480
sense, you're like, oh, this is the thing.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.760
Yeah, it's great.

13:18.760 --> 13:19.600
Well, let's go.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.840
And so we then catalyzed around really quickly at that point.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.720
And that was a big round, right?

13:26.720 --> 13:28.400
I don't know what big is.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.480
It was like 20 million, right?

13:29.480 --> 13:30.240
Yeah.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.280
That's pretty big.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.600
Yeah.

13:32.600 --> 13:36.200
It was the thing that felt so unique.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.200
And I know you're somebody that, like I listen to your podcast,

13:38.200 --> 13:39.120
we've caught up a bunch.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.720
I know you're somebody that struggles with as well is like,

13:41.720 --> 13:47.880
there's a, I don't know, Rory Sutherland says there's like three types

13:47.880 --> 13:50.760
of innovation in his like canonical way of talking about the world,

13:50.760 --> 13:53.360
which is like, there's, there's faster horses.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.600
And there's like, which is like, obviously,

13:55.600 --> 13:56.960
like just make the thing go faster.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.360
And, and, and then there's teleportation,

13:59.360 --> 14:02.720
which is like this thing that you don't know should,

14:02.720 --> 14:03.800
like you want it to exist.

14:03.800 --> 14:04.840
You don't know how to get there.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.280
But if I tell you you want teleportation,

14:06.280 --> 14:07.360
you want teleportation.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.560
Everybody wants teleportation.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.040
Should we have a colony on Mars?

14:10.040 --> 14:10.880
Be awesome.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.080
Like, I don't know how we're going to do that.

14:12.080 --> 14:12.600
That's it.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.600
And then there's like Japanese toilets.

14:15.600 --> 14:21.880
Which is like, nobody, you didn't know you needed Japanese toilets in your life

14:21.880 --> 14:23.480
until the first time you got to Japan.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.680
And then you're like, walk out of the toilet.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.480
You're like, why isn't this everywhere?

14:27.480 --> 14:29.320
How have I been missing this my whole life?

14:29.320 --> 14:31.600
And it's not even that complicated.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.440
And that's Skunola.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.200
Yeah, yeah.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.160
Like, it's this thing.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.120
It's not like the execution is actually really subtle.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.640
It's really hard.

14:38.640 --> 14:43.160
But I think for me, the things I'm like wandering around and trying to find

14:43.160 --> 14:45.600
are the Japanese toilets of AI.

14:45.600 --> 14:49.280
Like, the faster horses are mostly what's getting funded.

14:49.280 --> 14:56.720
It's mostly what's come out of this B2B sass, big industrial machine

14:56.720 --> 14:59.600
that we have in venture capital is churning out startups after startups

14:59.600 --> 15:01.000
and incubator after incubator.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.920
And most of that stuff is fine.

15:02.920 --> 15:08.120
And it'll also be arbitrage out of existence in four years and who cares.

15:08.120 --> 15:12.520
And so mostly you're looking for new expi, I am looking for mostly

15:12.520 --> 15:17.800
new experiences, things that surprise you with the place that they're playing.

15:17.800 --> 15:23.840
And so for me when I use Grinola, you're like, oh, this is so intuitive.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.440
It's like the 50th thousandth AI note taker.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.240
Like, did the world need another AI note taker?

15:29.240 --> 15:32.520
I was like, yes, except I didn't want to use any of those other AI note takers.

15:32.520 --> 15:36.200
When Fireflies joins my Zoom meeting, I'd never let it in.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.200
Oh, the anger.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.360
The needy and anger.

15:38.360 --> 15:45.800
Yeah, and where is this just like, no, just basically looks like Apple notes.

15:45.800 --> 15:50.160
And it's just going to like append a little, a little extra to the things

15:50.160 --> 15:52.760
that you took notes on and make you a little smarter along the way.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.760
Yeah, it's brilliant.

15:53.760 --> 15:58.200
How do you think you become someone who makes a Japanese toilet?

15:58.200 --> 16:01.480
You know, like versus a faster horse, you know, like there's something,

16:01.480 --> 16:05.000
I was talking to Chris about this, like something about like the way that he looks

16:05.000 --> 16:09.400
at or thinks about the soul of a product and the way his intuition works and all that

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
kind of stuff.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.600
And I'm kind of curious, I assume you've invested in other people that have that same

16:14.600 --> 16:15.600
kind of archetype.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.400
Like, what have you learned about that?

16:17.400 --> 16:23.640
Yeah, there's a similar journey to Andrew Mason, a script.

16:23.640 --> 16:30.480
There's a similar journey to an investment that was just announced recently called Wordware.

16:30.480 --> 16:34.960
They have a similar milieu, which is very different from, you know, I would say,

16:34.960 --> 16:41.920
a Kyle vote at Cruz, that that's an example, like that's a teleportation, the pitch.

16:41.920 --> 16:45.760
That's like self-driving cars, like amazing, probably impossible.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
Can you do it?

16:46.760 --> 16:49.080
Like that's a very different kind of pitch.

16:49.080 --> 16:52.560
What are the habits of those kinds of founders or what are the journeys that they're on?

16:52.560 --> 16:59.240
I would say that the remarkable thing that comes out about a person like that usually comes

16:59.240 --> 17:04.040
out when they're talking about how they got to whatever solution that they're talking

17:04.040 --> 17:06.040
about.

17:06.040 --> 17:12.480
Yeah, I'm trying to, like, what is the right answer here?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.680
What's the authentic answer here?

17:15.680 --> 17:20.400
Why is Chris or Andrew really special?

17:20.400 --> 17:24.200
I'm trying to think about this through the lens of when those kinds of founders come

17:24.280 --> 17:27.600
into our firm.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.360
You can feel it in the room.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.840
It's not just me, like the whole team, and this is partially because we cast for these types

17:33.840 --> 17:39.160
of people, but like the whole firm, like rallies pretty quickly.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.360
And so what are the patterns in that pitch?

17:41.360 --> 17:50.120
It's usually that they are telling you insightful reasons why they put things into the product

17:50.120 --> 17:53.640
that you would have never normally thought of from customer development calls.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.640
Okay.

17:54.640 --> 18:00.200
So it's like some combination of storytelling and attention to small details in a way

18:00.200 --> 18:04.960
that, like, levels up into something that all makes sense together.

18:04.960 --> 18:12.160
Yeah, there's some connectivity between the choices a person made in the product that

18:12.160 --> 18:17.000
like you can feel and some insight about a customer.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.880
Like if they're listening very, very closely to the behavior of what's happening.

18:21.880 --> 18:25.480
And so in Chris's case, it's just noticing, for instance, the very first version of

18:25.480 --> 18:28.880
granola was a tab complete, almost like copilot, right?

18:28.880 --> 18:33.360
So you type a couple of words in and you type tab and it starts filling out.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.400
Seems actually kind of magical when you first look at it.

18:36.400 --> 18:40.640
It's like, but if you just like listen to yourself closer, if you're self aware enough

18:40.640 --> 18:44.480
closer, especially if you're the user of the product and you're your own customer, you

18:44.480 --> 18:48.520
just realize, like, I'm kind of like super distracted in this meeting because every time

18:48.520 --> 18:51.560
I press tab, like, it fills out things and it makes an error and then I want to correct

18:51.560 --> 18:52.560
the error.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.560
And now I'm not paying attention.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.560
I'm like, no, I contact.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.320
It's like, not why I'm on this Zoom call, like, it's that.

18:57.320 --> 19:01.200
And so that little, I don't even, it's not brilliance.

19:01.200 --> 19:07.360
It's not, it's not even creativity in the like, in the like, canonical definition of creativity

19:07.360 --> 19:14.360
where you come up with 15,000 ideas and it's more like investigation or like a word that's

19:14.360 --> 19:18.440
going to mind as like sensitivity, like you're sensitive to what's actually going on.

19:18.440 --> 19:23.920
You're like, got your hands like all in the, in the milieu and you can kind of like feel

19:23.920 --> 19:26.480
the changes in the weather pattern or something like that.

19:26.480 --> 19:27.480
Yep.

19:27.480 --> 19:28.480
Yeah.

19:28.480 --> 19:36.160
It's like the spectrum scale is like how kinetic, how much kinetic energy do you have because

19:36.160 --> 19:38.560
you have to move very fast, right?

19:38.560 --> 19:43.120
But we all know people that like are just all course power.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.800
Like they're just kinetic energy.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.440
They're the people that are like, I want to start a startup.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.320
And the way I'm going to start a startup is I'm going to come up with a new business

19:48.320 --> 19:51.720
plan every single day for the next three months until I find the right thing.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.800
And I'm going to push it like that.

19:53.800 --> 19:58.000
And that's good kinetic energy without a lot of sensitivity.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.720
They are trying to plow through the problem.

20:00.720 --> 20:06.240
They are very, very uncomfortable with fog of war, with like wandering in the wilderness

20:06.240 --> 20:07.520
to find the thing.

20:07.520 --> 20:11.680
So the opposite spectrum is sensitivity.

20:11.680 --> 20:16.520
And the problem is that sometimes if you go too far in the sensitivity side, then you're

20:16.520 --> 20:23.120
the artist who is just like has absolute like analysis paralysis.

20:23.120 --> 20:27.160
You just think and think and think and think and think and think and it's just too slow.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.840
Your iteration cycle is too slow.

20:28.840 --> 20:33.240
And again, you're trying to solve by listening closely that fog of war, like you're trying

20:33.240 --> 20:36.080
to just listen to every single animal in the forest to figure out how to track it before

20:36.080 --> 20:37.080
you walk in.

20:37.080 --> 20:41.400
And so it's this like, I think those types of founders you're trying to sense for are

20:41.400 --> 20:44.400
they have a pro nation to movement.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.320
They will move, but they will move while still listening.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.320
I love that.

20:49.320 --> 20:53.640
That's beautiful.

20:53.640 --> 20:58.000
Tell me about word wear because I have a feeling that there's something very spiritually

20:58.000 --> 21:02.160
aligned between word wear and whatever it is that I'm doing.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.160
Really?

21:03.160 --> 21:04.160
Yeah.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.240
So I'm not diving into word wear until you start answering that.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.240
What do you mean?

21:07.240 --> 21:11.920
Well, I've been thinking a lot about like, okay, what does it mean to be like a multi-modal

21:11.920 --> 21:14.840
publishing company, media company like that kind of thing?

21:14.840 --> 21:23.640
And the way that I've been thinking about it is, as you can start to code in English,

21:23.640 --> 21:26.080
writing is building.

21:26.080 --> 21:35.480
And I think the opposite is true, like building becomes like at every, it informs all of

21:35.480 --> 21:36.800
the writing that we do.

21:36.800 --> 21:41.240
So there's this sort of feedback loop and usually in most organizations, you have builders

21:41.240 --> 21:44.800
over here and writers over here, or they're in totally separate organizations.

21:44.800 --> 21:49.800
And in every, there's a lot, a lot of overlap because all of our EARs, everyone that works

21:49.800 --> 21:52.880
at every, they write articles, they don't just write articles, they write code by like

21:52.880 --> 21:56.640
writing prompts.

21:56.640 --> 22:03.800
And so if I have to like pull on that thread a little bit, like the commonality is writing,

22:03.800 --> 22:09.280
but like the underneath that is like storytelling, like having a perspective and bringing a perspective

22:09.280 --> 22:14.040
to like the medium or the craft, the thing that you're doing, whether that's like the output

22:14.040 --> 22:20.120
is actually writing, whether it's podcasts, whether it's building, and so I'm, that's like

22:20.120 --> 22:26.280
the unifying thing between all of the different parts of the organization.

22:26.280 --> 22:33.200
And something about Wordware, the way it's phrased, just like expresses that really cleanly.

22:33.200 --> 22:37.760
But certainly trying to put people in the role, it's trying to open up, Wordware is certainly

22:37.760 --> 22:42.640
trying to open up the idea that everybody is a maker, and that you should, like it's

22:42.640 --> 22:48.640
still really frustrating to me that, and I'm sure you bump into this a lot, like nobody's

22:48.640 --> 22:56.400
really using, nobody is using cursor and wind surf, and replicate agents, and all, and

22:56.400 --> 23:02.120
clawed for code, and all of these things, like I had a random look at during lunch today,

23:02.120 --> 23:07.680
I made an app, like I had 15 minutes, and I was like, somebody had tweeted out a couple

23:07.680 --> 23:12.360
of days ago, the right way to structure, O1 prompts, and I was like, you probably saw

23:12.360 --> 23:13.360
this tweet, right?

23:13.360 --> 23:14.360
Seems great.

23:14.360 --> 23:19.000
So I took a whole article on that, and I just shoved it into a replete agent, and I was

23:19.000 --> 23:24.600
like, here's your PRD, make me an app, so that I can just right here, and then pitch the

23:24.600 --> 23:28.960
clawed to giving back an expanded product, took 15 minutes, it was like while I was waiting

23:28.960 --> 23:34.360
for my next call, and like that's nothing that would even pass through my head a year

23:34.360 --> 23:35.360
ago.

23:35.360 --> 23:40.240
That's a thing, writing is building, but software is now content, so one of the really

23:40.240 --> 23:45.640
cool things is when we just launched this app called Cora, and that has 10,000 people

23:45.640 --> 23:49.720
on the wait list, those are all now every subscribers, like you can't write an article

23:49.720 --> 23:54.160
that's going to get you 10,000 subscribers, but you can write software that does it,

23:54.160 --> 23:58.040
and that's like, that's incredible, but yeah, I interrupt you, I don't worry about that.

23:58.040 --> 24:06.440
So anyway, I think the vast majority of people just simply if you sit down and show them

24:06.440 --> 24:09.920
replete agents, which is a great brilliant product, McKellys, amazing.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.240
I've never used it, actually.

24:12.240 --> 24:17.440
I used replete a lot, like a year ago-ish, but I have now used their new agent stuff,

24:17.440 --> 24:22.440
how do you compare it to a cursor composer or a windsurf?

24:22.440 --> 24:26.240
I think it's in the same category, these are direct competitors.

24:26.240 --> 24:31.600
I would put, you know, almost if you put a spectrum on coding agents, and we're going

24:31.600 --> 24:36.400
to come back to Wordware, because this will link back in, but I can keep these all in my head.

24:36.400 --> 24:41.160
If you put a spectrum on all the coding agents today, the spectrum I would put on them is

24:41.160 --> 24:47.320
basically like how long are they allowed to work before they ask for feedback.

24:47.320 --> 24:51.760
And so if we're starting at the low end, you have like Microsoft Copilot, which is trying

24:51.760 --> 24:56.120
to finish one line of code, and on the other end of the spectrum, you have Devon, which

24:56.120 --> 24:57.960
is trying to run away for four hours.

24:57.960 --> 24:58.960
That's a great spectrum.

24:58.960 --> 25:03.120
And I actually think when I talk to people today, when we're going through product sessions

25:03.120 --> 25:07.000
and I'm working with teams about this, on whatever they're trying to innovate on, that's

25:07.000 --> 25:09.680
the spectrum I first start from, which is like, hey, for whatever probably you're trying

25:09.680 --> 25:14.680
to solve, let's try and think about what is the reasoning of our current SOTA models.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.400
Let's think about how long do you think you can leave them?

25:17.400 --> 25:19.720
How good are your e-vals internally?

25:19.720 --> 25:23.920
Because if you can evaluate longer and better, and how good the code base is, you can

25:23.920 --> 25:25.520
let it work for longer.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.600
So how good are your e-vals internally?

25:27.600 --> 25:28.920
And then let's set a mark.

25:28.920 --> 25:35.560
Are you letting this thing go for an hour, four hours, three days, one sentence, 16 seconds,

25:35.560 --> 25:36.920
based on whatever you're trying to solve?

25:36.920 --> 25:38.440
And that's a really interesting new heuristic.

25:38.440 --> 25:42.000
I found a couple of different product innovations from startups I'm working with come out of,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.080
literally just that thought exercise.

25:44.080 --> 25:51.320
And so I would say the interesting thing about Replit is it generally works far less than

25:51.320 --> 25:55.840
Devon, which I think we found Devon, for most people they find Devon to be like, it breaks

25:55.840 --> 25:56.840
a lot.

25:56.840 --> 25:57.840
It's a little slow.

25:57.840 --> 25:58.840
It's a little slow.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.040
It will be an amazing product over time.

26:01.040 --> 26:02.160
They've made a long bet.

26:02.160 --> 26:06.240
But right now, they probably set the mark a little bit too long on how they let each

26:06.240 --> 26:07.240
to go.

26:07.240 --> 26:13.080
I find for me, Replit agents, even though the models probably aren't as smart and so

26:13.080 --> 26:18.080
and so forth, the kind of like time variants they give before they come back and ask questions

26:18.080 --> 26:24.280
is like a little bit longer than Windsorff, a little bit shorter than some others.

26:24.280 --> 26:28.880
They just set the right, Michele, who's the head of AI there, and our president just

26:28.880 --> 26:31.920
did a great job setting a variance.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.320
And really, that sounds simple.

26:34.320 --> 26:37.600
They do a bunch of really other good things about the product they want good right now.

26:37.600 --> 26:42.680
Just literally that, setting the right altitude of reasoning is everything for getting really

26:42.680 --> 26:43.680
good results out of it.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.600
Because they're all using, well, most all of them are using cloud of the back in anyway.

26:46.600 --> 26:51.160
That's all cloud and full disclosure, you know, we're like, it's all cloud, they're great.

26:51.160 --> 26:55.120
We're an investor in Anthropic, love it, build more things on top of the cloud.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.360
So I'm going to loop that back to Wordware.

26:57.360 --> 26:58.680
Yeah, please.

26:58.680 --> 27:06.200
So Wordware is starting from a different orthogonal, which is what do I have to give this thing

27:06.200 --> 27:09.920
for it to be able to understand what I really mean?

27:09.920 --> 27:15.920
And it turns out if you open up, I don't know, Windsorff or if you open up cursor or if you

27:15.920 --> 27:18.360
open up repolate agents, it's a chatbot.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.040
Like it looks like a chat window.

27:20.040 --> 27:24.720
And so what is the normal thing that a person who doesn't talk to chat to PT or cloud all

27:24.720 --> 27:26.400
day long, like you and me do?

27:26.400 --> 27:32.760
They type in one, three sentences, two sentences, which is like plenty, just enough room for

27:32.760 --> 27:33.760
a model to hang itself.

27:33.760 --> 27:34.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:34.760 --> 27:35.760
Right?

27:35.760 --> 27:36.760
Yeah.

27:36.760 --> 27:41.440
It's exactly the wrong amount of information to give a model, to go then code and make a bunch

27:41.440 --> 27:42.440
of things.

27:42.440 --> 27:50.800
The thing is like I find with like the Windsorff or Kirchers of the world, like the agent experience,

27:50.800 --> 27:58.200
it will just start without like, I kind of wanted to start in a like, we're going to define

27:58.200 --> 28:02.960
together a little bit more precisely what I actually mean before you could start coding,

28:02.960 --> 28:04.960
but it just wants to write code.

28:04.960 --> 28:09.440
I'm like, I often like at the end of the initial prompt, I'm like, if anything's unclear,

28:09.440 --> 28:14.760
like ask me questions before, which helps, but my other very common prompt there is give

28:14.760 --> 28:16.520
me five ways to solve this.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.520
Oh, interesting.

28:17.520 --> 28:22.720
I, like, I would say every second or third prompt into one of these code agencies, give

28:22.720 --> 28:26.880
me five options so that it doesn't run ahead.

28:26.880 --> 28:31.680
And so as word where like, is it like a Google Docs instead where it's like a, a big, like

28:31.680 --> 28:38.960
empty sheet of space, and then does it like prompt you with how to fill that in?

28:38.960 --> 28:44.280
Like, is there some sort of, um, yeah, they're, it is working on that as a second stage

28:44.280 --> 28:45.280
right now.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.680
Right now, the way it approaches you, I would say the first big trick it does, that's

28:48.680 --> 28:53.920
very simple, is by approaching with a blank doc, um, and maybe, maybe there's a commonality

28:53.920 --> 29:03.440
between descript and word where and granola that I think blanks, blanks, there's something

29:03.440 --> 29:09.320
about a blank page, man, that then I help you fill out.

29:09.320 --> 29:15.800
But, but word where just literally the conceit of, um, please just write down in plain English,

29:15.800 --> 29:20.120
the way that you would maybe write a long email to an engineer on your team, what you

29:20.120 --> 29:21.120
want built.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.560
Let's start with that.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.040
You can already imagine your brain can do all of the things that word where is going

29:26.040 --> 29:31.560
to do over time, which is right now you have to do at symbols to call different functions

29:31.560 --> 29:33.440
and say which inputs and outputs you want.

29:33.440 --> 29:37.160
And honestly, word where, and the founders would say this, it's like a little overly technical

29:37.160 --> 29:38.360
today.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.120
But the thread that you'll, they will pull with their customers over the next couple

29:42.120 --> 29:43.120
of years.

29:43.120 --> 29:47.320
And this is why they're saying so many people use it right now, is that once you have

29:47.320 --> 29:51.200
that blank page filled, it's pretty easy, which, and then learn the syntax of how to use

29:51.200 --> 29:54.120
word where, how to call certain functions, how to fill it out, and how to really build

29:54.120 --> 29:55.120
like a usable product.

29:55.120 --> 29:59.840
And is it like intended for programmers or is it intended for like, pms who are sort

29:59.840 --> 30:04.240
of like, have, you know, they take a coding class in college or is it intended for like,

30:04.240 --> 30:08.600
uh, 18 year old who's never coded before, and it's just like, I want to get, I would

30:08.600 --> 30:13.680
say today's level of functionality is very good for somebody who is just slightly technical.

30:13.680 --> 30:18.480
I don't think you need to have been a coder, but you, it is better if you understand what

30:18.480 --> 30:22.720
an input is, and an output is, and you think an if-then statement's just a little bit,

30:22.720 --> 30:24.840
like that's going to help you an awful lot.

30:24.840 --> 30:27.160
That stuff gets glossed over time, pretty easily.

30:27.160 --> 30:30.640
Coming back to that, um, that spectrum that we were talking about, like the age, agentic

30:30.640 --> 30:35.520
spectrum, um, which it, it sort of reminds me of, you know, those dogs that, like, the

30:35.520 --> 30:42.440
dog leashes that, like, they extend out, and it's like, how much leashes do you have?

30:42.440 --> 30:44.000
How do you find the right setting?

30:44.000 --> 30:48.840
Um, like, are you just trying different things or, um, yeah, how are you when you're working

30:48.840 --> 30:52.640
with people or what are you finding for people when, how do they find that sweet spot?

30:52.640 --> 30:57.280
Oh, uh, isn't that the wonderful journey that we're all on with AI?

30:57.280 --> 30:59.640
Is that changes like every quarter?

30:59.640 --> 31:00.640
Yeah.

31:00.640 --> 31:04.600
Uh, like, I have a company right now that will go nameless because they're about to release

31:04.600 --> 31:09.880
a pretty awesome new thing that actually had an aha moment relatively recently about

31:09.880 --> 31:12.000
this, that they, they've been in AI for a while.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.080
They're doing really well, but they realize like that it, like, it's a short leash product,

31:17.080 --> 31:21.400
and they kind of had the epiphany a month and a half ago, like, oh, these models are

31:21.400 --> 31:25.400
good enough that if we just stitched them slightly differently, what would a longer

31:25.400 --> 31:26.520
leash product version?

31:26.520 --> 31:28.680
And it's like, and it's not, I say just longer leash.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.920
It's not just that it thinks differently.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.720
It's like, oh, that makes different demands of the UI and the UX, like, it just is a different

31:33.720 --> 31:34.720
thing.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.920
It's a whole flow is a different flow and it'll feel like a different product.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.200
So we got to, I mean, if you are, try it out, see if it works.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.720
And then like in three months when a new model comes out, like, try again.

31:42.720 --> 31:47.760
If, yeah, if you aren't reevaluating, how would I destroy my own startup six months

31:47.760 --> 31:52.480
later, every six months right now, during this, like, Cambrian explosion of stuff, like,

31:52.480 --> 31:54.680
that's the way you have to navigate things today.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.120
Have you gotten a three yet?

31:56.120 --> 31:57.320
I do not have a three.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.080
We have somebody on the team who has a three.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.080
What is, what do they say?

32:00.080 --> 32:04.920
What are the early, early signs if not, that is not, that is not, that is not, that

32:04.920 --> 32:07.080
is not a conversation we're having.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.080
Okay.

32:08.080 --> 32:11.960
That's not my, that's not my place.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.320
I have to try.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.600
Okay.

32:15.600 --> 32:20.640
And then, and I know you're playing around with, so you're, you're doing a lot of working

32:20.640 --> 32:24.760
with these sort of like coding agents and, and, and thinking a lot about agentic workflows.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.720
Like, what also are you learning, or what else are you excited about in, in that whole space?

32:28.720 --> 32:32.520
Well, the first thing that I've noticed in my own behavior over the last six months,

32:32.520 --> 32:38.320
and this is definitely how you're running every, is like, because we can code so quickly

32:38.320 --> 32:41.360
and make so quickly, we just make so much more.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.360
Yeah.

32:42.440 --> 32:47.400
I am simultaneously working harder on Spark than I've ever worked.

32:47.400 --> 32:52.360
And also, I'm building a card game with my kids.

32:52.360 --> 32:56.520
I'm also opening a board game library with a handful of friends.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.520
Wow.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
Like, it's not just code.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.880
Like, like, I'm opening a freaking retail space.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.200
We'll see if that works at all.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.200
That's annoying.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.200
For, for board games?

33:04.200 --> 33:05.200
For the board game.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.200
Yeah, for board games.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.200
For private library.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.200
It's a, it's called tabletop library.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.440
It's a private library for people who would play board games together.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.440
Where is it?

33:12.440 --> 33:13.440
Berkeley?

33:13.440 --> 33:14.440
Of course it is.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.440
Of course it is.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.120
It's actually, it's on a block in Berkeley.

33:17.120 --> 33:21.920
The other things on the block are a science fiction and fantasy bookstore and a comic bookstore.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.720
It's like the nerdiest block in America.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.720
That's the best.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.720
Do you live in Berkeley?

33:25.720 --> 33:26.720
I live in Berkeley.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.320
But, like, that's a good example of, like, there's no way that I have enough available

33:29.320 --> 33:30.320
time.

33:30.320 --> 33:31.320
Yeah.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.800
And, uh, and the other people involved in the product are all startup people.

33:33.800 --> 33:38.040
Like, there's no way any of us have available time to ever do this before AI.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.920
And so, like, that's a strange thing because it's not like an AI project.

33:41.000 --> 33:41.920
Yeah.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.480
What part of it is AI making more efficient for you?

33:44.480 --> 33:51.160
Literally, every single thing from the beginning, from the more boring bits that are like,

33:51.160 --> 33:55.360
oh, we just got a lease draft in on retail.

33:55.360 --> 33:56.360
I've never looked at this.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.360
I'm going to drop it and chat GPT and ask questions.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.360
That's the normal stuff.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.360
Are you, are you, you're going to chat GPT for that?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.360
Are you going to O1?

34:02.360 --> 34:03.360
Are you doing cloud?

34:03.360 --> 34:06.720
Like, what's your, who's your, who's your legal advisor right now?

34:06.720 --> 34:08.640
Legal advisor would be O1.

34:08.640 --> 34:09.640
Okay.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.040
Not O1 pro.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.040
Not.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.040
No one pro.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.040
Okay.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.040
Okay.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.040
Legal advisor O1 pro.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.040
Yeah.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.040
I mean, come on.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.040
It's a real contract.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.040
Yeah.

34:20.040 --> 34:23.880
Uh, most everything else where I actually care about the output in terms of its language,

34:23.880 --> 34:26.840
the way it speaks to me, uh, things I might reuse.

34:26.840 --> 34:27.840
That's all cloud.

34:27.840 --> 34:28.840
Everything's cloud.

34:28.840 --> 34:29.840
All coding's also cloud.

34:29.840 --> 34:30.840
Everything's cloud.

34:30.840 --> 34:34.960
Um, but so that's the obvious one is just like, please analyze a contract.

34:34.960 --> 34:38.000
But like, I'll give you example, like, oh, I make it show you the code.

34:38.000 --> 34:44.320
Like over Christmas break, we started to get square, like, a floor plan back of the

34:44.320 --> 34:45.320
space.

34:45.320 --> 34:49.400
And so like, I fed the floor plan into cloud, started coding.

34:49.400 --> 34:54.680
That turned into a windsurf project, which turned into an actual, like, demand model

34:54.680 --> 35:01.360
to try and, uh, project how many members we would have in the space before we maxed

35:01.360 --> 35:06.800
out demand, which then boiled into like, oh, well, we have six to eight personas for

35:06.800 --> 35:10.080
different types of people that come at different times, and that turned into a price sensitivity

35:10.080 --> 35:11.080
test.

35:11.080 --> 35:15.800
These are all Python apps now, like, this is all a model that then I can go fix and change

35:15.800 --> 35:20.280
and rerun and like, that would have never, I mean, you could have done that before, but

35:20.280 --> 35:23.840
you would have had to like hire people and think about it and like, or you just had to

35:23.840 --> 35:27.480
spend your own time like, you know, hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.

35:27.480 --> 35:30.360
And now you can just be like, I want to see what's the sensitivity analysis and you're

35:30.360 --> 35:31.360
like, oh, here it is.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.360
Yeah.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.360
Yeah.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.360
That's the best.

35:34.360 --> 35:40.560
One thing project, just a rat hole on board game clubs is like, we went through a process

35:40.560 --> 35:45.720
when we then talked to all of the, like, SaaS companies that exist out there, like vertical

35:45.720 --> 35:50.080
SaaS companies that exist out there that help you, you know, run a membership club, run

35:50.080 --> 35:56.200
a co-working space, you know, there's that kind of thing, like, and all of them after evaluating

35:56.200 --> 36:00.000
them, they do what all SaaS software does, which is kind of good.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.600
They're not ever perfect for me, so and so forth.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.760
About halfway through, we realized, like, I don't know, the four of us could just build

36:05.760 --> 36:07.160
this ourselves.

36:07.160 --> 36:13.280
And so we were building all the customer books off there for running the space.

36:13.280 --> 36:18.200
And so now you can do things like make a voice phone call and say, hey, I want to play

36:18.200 --> 36:24.840
arcs with three friends Wednesday at 3 p.m., it checks an air table, agentically booked the

36:24.840 --> 36:26.840
thing, writes it in the table, like all of it.

36:26.840 --> 36:27.840
It's just all bespoke.

36:27.920 --> 36:32.960
What does this do in your mind to, like, funding models for software businesses, now that

36:32.960 --> 36:35.200
software is so much cheaper to make?

36:35.200 --> 36:36.200
I mean, I don't know.

36:36.200 --> 36:42.400
I think the precise amount of people that should work at any company is eight.

36:42.400 --> 36:48.680
We're just past that, so.

36:48.680 --> 36:52.880
But I think around where we are, I love it, it's so much fun.

36:52.880 --> 36:59.680
And by the, I've been an operator and founder everywhere from, you know, one to 100, it's

36:59.680 --> 37:06.080
like, you know, and like it's, there's something incredibly magical about that, you know,

37:06.080 --> 37:09.160
one pizza stage.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.120
And that's where it feels like a team.

37:11.120 --> 37:16.880
That's where it feels like a literally just one cohesive pod team.

37:16.880 --> 37:17.880
And so I don't know.

37:17.880 --> 37:25.560
I think the challenge is how much can we use AI to solve all of the things that are really

37:25.560 --> 37:29.920
just faster, horses, problems?

37:29.920 --> 37:37.440
You know, I have this story that stuck in my head for many years.

37:37.440 --> 37:40.600
It's a polish year, the designer.

37:40.600 --> 37:45.440
She has a story we should talk about the different things, art and craft and how, and she's a very

37:45.440 --> 37:50.400
famous graphic designer, logo designer, back in the day, she did some really famous record

37:50.400 --> 37:54.080
covers in the 70s, and you fast forward and she did like Shake Shack logo and stuff like

37:54.080 --> 37:55.080
that.

37:55.080 --> 37:59.680
So just like legendary logo designer, she used to talk about back in the day, someone

37:59.680 --> 38:04.000
would come in with an album cover and they'd be like, oh, it's a new, let's have an album,

38:04.000 --> 38:05.440
we need a cover for it, blah, blah, blah.

38:05.440 --> 38:08.720
And then she talked about what it would take to get that done.

38:08.720 --> 38:13.120
And you know, back then, this is obviously pre-Adobe, pre-photo shop.

38:13.120 --> 38:17.840
And she's like, there's a person that's spent a whole week just on the lettering, just

38:17.840 --> 38:21.960
like literally hand drawing every single letter on this cover.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.360
There's 20 people working on that project.

38:24.360 --> 38:29.080
And she's like, listen, the truth is that only one to two of those was actually, they

38:29.080 --> 38:33.040
were all quote-unquote artists and they all quote-unquote went through art school.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.840
All that's craft.

38:34.840 --> 38:39.360
There's really only one person making artistic decisions and making the core decisions.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.400
Everybody else is just execution.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.480
And the execution goes away when the craft is not covered by software.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.480
That's already happened.

38:46.480 --> 38:50.880
Now I open up Illustrator and I pick from fonts and maybe I tweak a font or I custom a font,

38:50.880 --> 38:54.080
but it like it all happens in a day or two.

38:54.080 --> 38:58.640
And instead I get faster iteration cycles where we then work on this to make it better.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.280
If you fast forward today, it's the same thing in a company level.

39:01.280 --> 39:06.760
Like if I'm at 16 people, you have to ask yourself, or 20 or 200, you have to ask yourself

39:06.760 --> 39:10.680
like how many of those people are actually making the core decisions of that company and

39:10.680 --> 39:15.680
how much of them are involved in just literally whittling the wood?

39:15.680 --> 39:16.840
Yeah.

39:16.840 --> 39:24.400
That's sort of where we are internally is like everyone at every is like a generalist who

39:24.400 --> 39:28.120
is multi-dimensional, many of them are technical.

39:28.120 --> 39:33.600
And we have like, we have three products that we run internally aside from the media product.

39:34.240 --> 39:41.040
There's that whole other thing where we're writing some of the best stuff in the industry that

39:41.040 --> 39:49.480
you should all subscribe to, but also that's, that was not a paid promotion.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.840
And each one of those has a GM.

39:52.840 --> 39:58.880
And the GM is doing everything from writing the code, like writing the release notes to

39:58.920 --> 40:04.440
like whatever that we have some, we have our creative lead who does all the design for

40:04.440 --> 40:06.440
everybody.

40:06.440 --> 40:10.560
And then we have writers who will go in and do some reporting on like what are we releasing

40:10.560 --> 40:15.160
this week and then write that up in our in context when to which is our Sunday newsletter.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.320
And then we have a bunch of writers.

40:18.320 --> 40:25.920
But it's interesting like it feels like it feels very cohesive, but everybody has their

40:25.920 --> 40:31.400
like little domain or their little universe where they're responsible for a lot of things.

40:31.400 --> 40:38.320
Instead of like one person who just their job is just like to tweak this like one knob basically.

40:38.320 --> 40:44.600
And I really love working with with those kinds of like multi-dimensional people.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.560
And it's it's quite common, I think for like early stage startups to like have a bunch

40:48.560 --> 40:51.960
of generalists and you replace them with specialists and whatever.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.840
But I think it's quite uncommon.

40:53.840 --> 40:57.880
I think A will be able to get further than we would have before with the sort of like

40:57.880 --> 41:04.440
generalist vibe, but it's also quite uncommon for a really early stage company to like be

41:04.440 --> 41:09.360
able to have three products and a media product that it can do like I think we can do them

41:09.360 --> 41:11.400
at a high level.

41:11.400 --> 41:18.600
And that's like totally new and it and and it allows us to like and it's driven by generalists

41:18.600 --> 41:22.440
who have these like special power tools that can like do all of the like execution work

41:22.440 --> 41:26.520
so that they just need to know what to do and then they can get it done really quick.

41:26.520 --> 41:33.320
Like we've done like I think three feature like real releases for chorus so far this

41:33.320 --> 41:34.320
week.

41:34.320 --> 41:37.840
And like that's one one guy here and he's super talented.

41:37.840 --> 41:42.240
It's one guy and oh one pro to be clear.

41:42.240 --> 41:49.280
It's also this mini dot billion dollar model doing a thing in the background.

41:49.280 --> 41:53.200
But yeah, I just it's I think there's a there's something new happening where those kinds

41:53.200 --> 41:57.720
of like eight person one pizza companies can and do you always use a long pro by the way

41:57.720 --> 42:05.200
is that your go to well, it's interesting I so I use oh one oh one is like my go to

42:05.200 --> 42:10.040
model I rarely use cloud anymore, which is really interesting because I was a big cloud

42:10.040 --> 42:13.400
guy for like a long time.

42:13.400 --> 42:17.120
Actually the place where I use cloud the most frequently is actually not in cloud itself

42:17.120 --> 42:23.640
it's in Lex which is the AI writing up to incubated and that that default model is cloud.

42:23.640 --> 42:28.160
So I do use it a bit but I'm mostly I'm mostly oh one I use oh one pro a little bit like

42:28.160 --> 42:33.840
I am I do this exercise every year where I like reflect on things that I've learned

42:33.840 --> 42:37.360
and like I set goals and like do all that stuff right yeah, it's really cool because

42:37.360 --> 42:41.080
I've been doing it for five years and I can just like go back it's like right before

42:41.080 --> 42:43.840
I started every is when I started doing it so I can just go back and just like look

42:43.840 --> 42:47.160
through each year and there's so much like juicy stuff in there.

42:47.160 --> 42:50.920
So I just like took that and I put it in I put it in cloud I put it in oh one and I put

42:50.920 --> 42:56.400
it in oh one pro and oh one pro is definitely the best like I I cried I cried a little

42:56.400 --> 43:03.120
yeah because especially like the like oh one and oh one pro because they can do the kind

43:03.120 --> 43:06.240
of like chain of thought and they can like retrace their steps or whatever they're much

43:06.240 --> 43:11.840
better at following a progression and like seeing and like seeing how something changes

43:11.840 --> 43:15.600
and like playing together in narrative that they find that's right and clouds a little

43:15.600 --> 43:19.800
just a little more like because it's just like it just sang what it sees like it's just

43:19.800 --> 43:23.880
it's less good at that yeah deeper deeper reasoning that's what it should be at it's it's

43:23.880 --> 43:27.720
got a whole bunch of without going through the whole oh one structure like that's just

43:27.720 --> 43:31.600
literally what it's programmed to do it's nothing else I'm gonna do that more so of course

43:31.600 --> 43:36.640
it does that more it's not like magic yeah but I haven't I you know like some of some

43:36.640 --> 43:40.520
of the people that that work at every that are doing more coding than I am like they're

43:40.520 --> 43:45.120
definitely like just they can just one shot a file and it like it will fix all the bugs

43:45.120 --> 43:52.080
and it's like it's crazy you know I've had that a little bit like I I'm doing some some

43:52.080 --> 43:57.080
like apps that are I wouldn't they're like they're light incubations like maybe they'll

43:57.080 --> 44:01.320
be coming they can every product or maybe not and yeah I get like one of those a week yeah

44:01.320 --> 44:06.680
yeah we have we have actually for a while we don't have one right now but for a while we had

44:06.680 --> 44:11.880
a AI hacker and residents at spark for the same reason that that you guys have people like that

44:11.880 --> 44:15.960
which is just like because the number of particular things that you just want to take like a quick

44:15.960 --> 44:19.800
one shot is like more than I have available time in the day exactly so like please can we play

44:19.800 --> 44:24.680
with whatever's new build things out half of them will get thrown away but you got to be playing yeah

44:25.400 --> 44:30.200
and so like sometimes like I'll build something with o1 or with cloud or whatever and like this

44:30.200 --> 44:34.040
the particular example I'm thinking give it like had some it had some like more complex stats that

44:34.040 --> 44:37.880
it was doing that I like I'm not like a big stats guy so like I was just like I think this looks

44:37.880 --> 44:42.280
right but I don't know and I just put it into o1 pro and I was like check the work here and I just

44:42.280 --> 44:47.480
trust that if o1 pro says it's okay that it's it's because there's a trust problem right it's

44:47.480 --> 44:53.000
like it's the same thing for like a manager when like a human manager is managing someone to do

44:53.000 --> 44:57.560
work that they don't know how to do themselves it's why technical managers have a much easier time

44:57.560 --> 45:07.640
managing engineers and what's really interesting about about AI right now is I can really cheaply

45:07.640 --> 45:12.760
manage an intelligence to do a lot of things that I'm not qualified to do and there's a question of

45:12.760 --> 45:19.400
like how do I know if it's right and that's a really that's a really interesting question to figure

45:19.400 --> 45:25.480
out but that's trust based on like have you ever tried have you ever found a set of prompts that are

45:25.480 --> 45:31.000
good at asking the model whether it thinks its previous work was good and getting a good response

45:31.000 --> 45:35.640
out of that because obviously if you say hey are you sure that that tilts the model towards not

45:35.640 --> 45:39.960
being sure so to almost always come back like no now that I've rethought it and it gives you almost

45:39.960 --> 45:44.680
like the wrong answer yeah that is interesting I mean I'm mostly I'm like I do say are you sure

45:44.760 --> 45:48.920
so maybe I shouldn't do that or like I will take it and put into another model and I'll just be like

45:49.960 --> 45:53.320
like do you see any problems with this this is what I'm trying to accomplish like are there any

45:53.320 --> 45:57.720
issues in this code basically or in this the way this is set up do you have anything like that

45:58.840 --> 46:05.400
I have trended towards asking for confidence intervals and pluses and minuses like how confident

46:05.400 --> 46:09.160
are you in your answer give me a reason why you could be right and give me a reason why you could

46:09.160 --> 46:14.360
be wrong again kind of chain of thoughty which is and that usually gives me enough information

46:14.360 --> 46:18.520
which is again proxying back to human behavior if you don't understand something get somebody to

46:18.520 --> 46:22.040
explain their logic around it a little bit more and you can kind of try to figure out whether they

46:22.040 --> 46:26.920
made an error or not is this for code or like what for what kind of problems literally everything

46:26.920 --> 46:30.600
like whenever I'm unsure about a response back because you're talking about trust and one way of

46:30.600 --> 46:36.040
talking about it is you know use a model you have more trust in but we're always going to be

46:36.040 --> 46:40.520
wandering into weird territories and so you kind of have to develop some techniques for trying to

46:40.520 --> 46:43.400
figure out what they're right about that's interesting because the reason I ask is one of the things

46:43.400 --> 46:48.600
I found with cloud like what if you ask it for editing feedback and you're like can you grade this

46:48.600 --> 46:52.680
it pretty much always gives you like a b plus a minus no matter what that's right it does um

46:52.680 --> 46:56.760
and then even if you only change a little bit I'll give you like oh now it's an a or whatever that's

46:56.760 --> 47:01.960
right and that if you give it a rubric like it still does the a minus thing and so I think oh one's

47:01.960 --> 47:08.440
a bit better at that um but yeah I haven't I haven't yet had a lot of success with like

47:08.440 --> 47:13.240
getting accurate confidence in the rules so I find that it's right it's better it's very bad at

47:13.240 --> 47:20.760
grading its own work that way how how good was this writing subjective reads um objective logic

47:20.760 --> 47:27.160
I see it's quite good at yeah yeah yeah so hey you just answered a question about um the history of

47:27.160 --> 47:32.600
startups and that I like how correct were you about that first give me your reasoning and then

47:32.600 --> 47:37.560
afterwards give me give me a confidence interval um usually in that order and it's quite good at

47:37.560 --> 47:41.640
that um for yeah but again like all these models it's like trying to figure out what they're good

47:41.640 --> 47:49.400
and they're bad at I find if I care about the answer being like specific then maybe oh one is

47:49.400 --> 47:52.920
better right now because it basically because it's doing reflection thinking about it longer so

47:52.920 --> 47:56.680
like great think about it longer awesome you saved me five more chats to get you to think about

47:56.680 --> 48:02.760
along to get the right answer sure shortcut um if I actually care about the words that are being used

48:03.960 --> 48:08.840
like I might reuse those words or I'm literally trying to brainstorm how to talk about something

48:08.840 --> 48:14.280
or storytell something a clot is still so much better at it yeah I think I think I think you're right

48:14.280 --> 48:20.840
I guess I don't really but you might not be using it that way right now right I do I so I'm

48:20.840 --> 48:28.840
using when I use Claude uh it's in Lex and I do use it to sort of like I'll often like I'll be

48:28.840 --> 48:32.920
writing something and I'll have it like sort of complete Lex does like the it's it's sort of

48:32.920 --> 48:38.120
copiality so it'll complete like maybe three more sentences or whatever and I find that to be helpful

48:38.120 --> 48:43.400
um but I think oh one is getting better at writing um like if you give it a big enough sample

48:44.120 --> 48:49.240
it'll be it'll be much better than I think it used to be somehow I don't know it's I know it

48:49.240 --> 48:52.440
I know that that doesn't make any sense but like that's my experience

48:54.200 --> 48:57.080
are you sure that's not just a skill issue you've gotten better at feeding it still

48:58.600 --> 49:03.000
um but I know you I know you you probably used I know you saw the like oh one like had a prompt oh

49:03.000 --> 49:07.320
one article you you mentioned or that was going around how do you have any specific like things

49:07.320 --> 49:14.440
you've learned about oh one pro that has have gotten you better results no I'm just a student there

49:14.440 --> 49:21.720
honestly like I like I I will say well actually I'll put it this way uh I read the tweets about

49:21.720 --> 49:26.760
how to use well oh one and I read the guides on how to use oh one it was like basically give it

49:26.760 --> 49:30.680
more context it's not a chat model is that's still like just yeah that's just just give it more

49:30.680 --> 49:34.680
context and tell it what you want give it an example what you want you're whatever yeah

49:34.680 --> 49:40.600
yeah yeah yeah and and you know for anybody who plays with these things every single day and

49:40.600 --> 49:44.040
is really out on the edge like I was already starting to that anyway so mostly it was like a head

49:44.040 --> 49:49.800
knob like yeah I should probably do that more you're right um more than it was some kind of like

49:49.800 --> 49:53.400
big epiphany or some unlock I'll let you know if I get an unlock on on no one pro

49:55.960 --> 50:03.480
any other like uh startups or products or like researchy type advances that you're like thinking

50:03.480 --> 50:10.680
about or interested in right now the the areas that I really think about right now and we'll go

50:10.680 --> 50:16.440
back to this earlier you you I'll give you an example directly from earlier you you have you do

50:16.440 --> 50:22.440
every year like annual review yeah thing yeah is it the same like five questions or 10 questions

50:22.440 --> 50:27.240
or something like that do you ask yourself or is it just more an exploratory conversation um the

50:27.240 --> 50:37.240
format is I will do um uh goals right like I'll do I'll do some like value exploration of like

50:37.240 --> 50:43.960
what do I want to like uh move toward in my life like what is important to me and then I'll also

50:43.960 --> 50:51.880
do like a bunch of uh uh like what are the things that I learned about myself or about the world

50:51.880 --> 51:00.040
or or whatever um and so it's not necessarily like a pre-prescribed set of questions but it is a

51:00.040 --> 51:04.520
sort of prescribed output format and then I'll like use a bunch of different questions in a bunch

51:04.520 --> 51:11.800
of different ways to get to those answers yep so like it's quite possible that existing out there

51:11.800 --> 51:19.160
in the world is a best practices for how to do your annual review and it's quite possible that

51:20.360 --> 51:25.000
there's no one answer there would be one that's better for you than somebody else but there's

51:25.000 --> 51:31.080
probably people that have really really thought about this and the reason one of the reasons the

51:31.080 --> 51:37.240
coding models work as well as they do is because we actually have lots of books about best practices

51:37.240 --> 51:43.080
in coding we have we have popped up one altitude and we don't just have a bunch of samples of code

51:43.080 --> 51:48.920
that get fed into a model we actually have a bunch of examples of PRDs and descriptions and documents

51:48.920 --> 51:54.360
that describe how to do coding well and how to make this thing well and then the output afterwards

51:54.440 --> 52:03.000
and I am looking for markets where either a company or or somehow we have that and so like it is

52:03.000 --> 52:09.080
one thing for instance to build the AI therapist it's another thing for me to start an exploration

52:09.080 --> 52:14.200
into altitude one level above that where I get to figure out what the right therapist is for me with

52:14.200 --> 52:20.600
what like area of knowledge that I want to bring to bear for this journey and there's very little

52:20.600 --> 52:25.640
that operates at that altitude most of them try to get to solution really really fast and let you

52:25.640 --> 52:31.080
like wander very very low in the altitude you know the same as just starting to give you code without

52:31.080 --> 52:35.400
saying to go back to the wordbury example like why don't you write down all the things you want here

52:35.400 --> 52:39.000
yeah and then we'll get started interesting well there's a I mean like let's take therapy for

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
example like there's a lot of like books about how to do therapy how to be a bear of course

52:43.000 --> 52:47.160
is that an example of the kind of yes that it fueled your interest that's why I picked it okay

52:47.160 --> 52:51.080
like I picked it because there are is an incredible amount of academic literature and other literature

52:51.080 --> 52:56.520
about ways to do therapy that are more effective and not effective and so and so forth now that has

52:56.520 --> 53:00.600
to be translated into model language and so and so forth I'll tell you another area that's actually

53:00.600 --> 53:08.920
quite hard what makes a game fun like if I pick up and in fact there's there's no they call

53:08.920 --> 53:14.040
ludology there's no great ludology that would explain super Mario brothers on a spreadsheet like I

53:14.040 --> 53:19.160
can't look at super Mario brothers and we don't have a language for even describing how you

53:19.160 --> 53:25.800
would get to fun there yeah I think that that touches on some of the like some of the stuff we've

53:25.800 --> 53:32.360
talked about in previous conversations about like okay so for for therapy like one of the problems

53:32.360 --> 53:37.160
is that there's there's no one answer to that because the thing that like makes therapy effective

53:37.160 --> 53:42.760
is the therapy therapeutic alliance yeah it's like is like do you like your therapist that they like

53:42.760 --> 53:47.080
you like is there a fit right yeah the form in the context is a fit you think it's literally

53:47.080 --> 53:53.240
just personality fit I don't I you could bring any theory of therapy to practice but if we if we

53:53.240 --> 54:11.000
vibe we're good what I yes what I think is that really skilled clinicians can can reduce some part

54:11.000 --> 54:18.360
of their skill to rules and and and ways that they make decisions but actually like what's going

54:18.360 --> 54:25.400
on is like totally sub symbolic and it's it's totally intuitive and and the way that a non-skilled

54:25.400 --> 54:30.760
clinician would apply that rule is very different from the way that actual skilled one will apply it

54:31.480 --> 54:40.840
and so the the way to like for example to create a model that does really get therapy

54:41.000 --> 54:47.400
is I think to some degree like the methodology or whatever can be helpful but it's really to capture

54:47.400 --> 54:52.120
all of the nuances of a lot of really high quality interactions and then have the model learn all

54:52.120 --> 54:56.280
the like little sub symbolic rules that no one can really talk about to apply in the appropriate

54:56.280 --> 55:03.640
contexts it's very contextual and it's it's there's no there's no answer to that to those questions

55:03.640 --> 55:08.120
of like what should you do in in this situation that is like that can be made explicit it's like

55:09.000 --> 55:14.200
it's thousands and thousands of different answers that you apply at the right moment which is

55:14.840 --> 55:21.480
exactly what AI models are really good at and exactly what was previously incredibly hard to transfer

55:22.280 --> 55:27.560
between humans and that's why we're we love like rules and logic and like scientific explanations

55:27.560 --> 55:31.480
and all that kind of stuff okay so we so we kind of agree there but let me disagree a little bit

55:31.480 --> 55:36.120
please disagree so yeah you're pulling on a thread that that that we've talked about before

55:36.120 --> 55:42.280
and I actually do agree with which is like there's this incredible opportunity by capturing enough

55:42.280 --> 55:49.320
knowledge that the model itself will understand things about the world that we can't understand

55:49.320 --> 55:53.720
like the only way we pass down science and the way science works is because I found a way to verbalize

55:53.720 --> 55:56.840
the things so I could tell you about it and then you can go do the thing again and so there

55:56.840 --> 56:00.680
are just going to be a new set of things that we still don't have the words for and it's awesome

56:00.680 --> 56:04.440
there's new knowledge it's being created even if we can't describe it awesome love that

56:05.320 --> 56:09.000
um I think that's quite different than the point I'm trying to make I think the point that I'm

56:09.000 --> 56:14.520
trying to make is there are times where the user's choice about the knowledge that they want to

56:14.520 --> 56:20.120
navigate or use themselves has value and so a good example of this is just thinking about the key

56:20.120 --> 56:26.040
words that we use sometimes when we're trying to tell a model to go somewhere can you please rewrite

56:26.040 --> 56:31.640
this essay in the style of Paul Graham like we're using a keyword to try to normalize to a bunch of

56:31.640 --> 56:39.560
behaviors and to try to give it an indication but where is the Wikipedia of all of the APIs that

56:39.560 --> 56:45.640
exist in the world and all of the like chains of thought that exist in the world so that I can

56:45.640 --> 56:52.680
navigate and look at that library myself I don't necessarily trust Chatsy BT to pick the right

56:52.680 --> 57:00.760
modality of therapy or whatever it is just as much as I don't really trust them to like pick the

57:00.760 --> 57:06.680
restaurant for me I want to talk about the theory of why I what kind of restaurant I want and

57:06.680 --> 57:12.200
similarly like there's millions of things in the world where there's like there's like a set of

57:12.200 --> 57:17.080
five different ways you could go do the task and certainly sometimes it's like just pick whatever

57:17.080 --> 57:23.560
but many many times incorporating that into a flow where me as a user now has control just tell

57:23.560 --> 57:28.600
me what tell me not tell me the five different best practices for how this could be done and let me

57:28.600 --> 57:36.600
pick that versus your you know weirdly amalgamated you know LLM version of best practices all

57:36.600 --> 57:42.840
merged together yeah you want to be able to like allow like me you can't make the entire terrain

57:42.840 --> 57:50.680
of possibilities explicit because it's going to be too big basically but you do want to make I think

57:50.680 --> 57:56.040
what you're saying is like rather than have the LLM like zoom right into a specific answer I'm

57:56.040 --> 58:01.000
supposed to give you the answer like yeah get better at making some of the implicit stuff

58:01.000 --> 58:06.760
explicit so you can like you can explore within reason and then dive dive a little bit more deeply

58:06.760 --> 58:10.840
yeah I'll give you a really a really a simple side project you said yeah great but I think it was

58:10.840 --> 58:14.520
actually like real startup archery a business opportunity here but like my mental side project was

58:14.520 --> 58:21.880
the first thing I ever built in wordwear was a startup advice like it was like a I don't know

58:22.840 --> 58:29.240
was it like a startup investment or so basically a little web page you go to that you say this is

58:29.240 --> 58:34.040
the startup decision I'm trying to make right now it just says like what decision you're trying to

58:34.040 --> 58:39.720
make what in your gut do you think it should be and then hit go and then instead of just doing the

58:39.720 --> 58:44.920
chat you be T thing which is just like I'm just going to split out an answer I fed it very simply

58:44.920 --> 58:51.000
like a bunch of PDFs of like HBS articles and like a bunch of other stuff which is basically

58:51.000 --> 58:58.760
decision theory like what are the 20 to 30 best practice decision theory SWAT analysis blah blah blah

58:58.760 --> 59:04.120
and so the first order of business it does is actually just trying to figure out three or four

59:04.120 --> 59:08.840
decision theories that you could use to come to decision make a recommendation on those and then

59:08.840 --> 59:12.600
walk you through the steps that those things do to get you to the answer it's that it's like pop up

59:12.600 --> 59:18.680
one altitude help me learn from the things other people have used a structure whatever discipline

59:18.680 --> 59:22.840
they have been working on for 100 or 200 300 years I love that that's really interesting what

59:22.840 --> 59:27.800
what it what it makes me think of it actually brings me back to the the agent to continue me

59:27.800 --> 59:31.800
were talking about it's like how much of a leash it's exactly the same thing where I was thinking

59:31.800 --> 59:39.080
it's like it's it's maybe a related continuum which is like how like do you want it to have like a

59:39.080 --> 59:42.600
microscope like go right in or do you want to like look through binoculars or do you want to look

59:42.680 --> 59:49.000
through like panoramic like theater you know glasses or whatever you know and you need both you

59:49.000 --> 59:55.080
need to get those both those dimensions dialed in and right now like the models are like only doing

59:55.080 --> 59:59.560
the microscope thing they're only zooming in right away for you unless you ask it specifically

59:59.560 --> 01:00:03.960
don't do that like give me start with the like you know decision theories or whatever

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.160
but yeah I love that I think that's really cool are people working on that I come across it very

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:15.640
rarely okay I would love to if you're if you're thinking that way let's jam great

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:25.400
cool well that's actually a really good place to start to wrap it up if if people are

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.400
looking to jam with you on on any of these ideas where can they find you

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.000
you can email me and to be able to spark capital you I'm on the web it's not hard to get to

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.800
you great thanks so much for coming this is awesome yeah and thanks so much for doing what you're

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:50.440
doing we need more multimodal media companies in the world I appreciate that
