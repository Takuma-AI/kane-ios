## The Core Framework

"Rory Sutherland says there's like three types of innovation. There's faster horses, and then there's teleportation. Like you want it to exist, you don't know how to get there, but if I tell you you want teleportation, you want teleportation, everybody wants teleportation. And then there's like Japanese toilets."

Nabeel Hyatt uses Rory Sutherland's innovation framework to identify the most valuable investment opportunities in AI.

## The Three Types of Innovation

### Type 1: Faster Horses
"There's, there's faster horses. And there's like, which is like, obviously, like just make the thing go faster."

**Characteristics**:
- Incremental improvements to existing solutions
- Linear progression along known dimensions
- Obvious value proposition
- Easy to understand and build

### Type 2: Teleportation
"And, and, and then there's teleportation, which is like this thing that you don't know should, like you want it to exist. You don't know how to get there. But if I tell you you want teleportation, you want teleportation. Everybody wants teleportation."

**Examples**:
- "Should we have a colony on Mars? Be awesome. Like, I don't know how we're going to do that."
- Self-driving cars: "That's a teleportation, the pitch. That's like self-driving cars, like amazing, probably impossible. Can you do it?"

**Characteristics**:
- Obvious desirability but unclear feasibility
- Revolutionary potential
- High technical risk
- Clear market demand if achievable

### Type 3: Japanese Toilets
"Which is like, nobody, you didn't know you needed Japanese toilets in your life until the first time you got to Japan. And then you're like, walk out of the toilet. You're like, why isn't this everywhere? How have I been missing this my whole life? And it's not even that complicated."

**The Japanese Toilet Experience**:
- Unexpected delight
- Immediate recognition of value once experienced
- "Why isn't this everywhere?" reaction
- Relatively simple execution, profound impact

## Investment Strategy Implications

### What Gets Funded vs What Hyatt Seeks
"Like, the faster horses are mostly what's getting funded. It's mostly what's come out of this B2B sass, big industrial machine that we have in venture capital is churning out startups after startups and incubator after incubator. And most of that stuff is fine. And it'll also be arbitrage out of existence in four years and who cares."

### The Japanese Toilet Hunt
"And so mostly you're looking for new expi, I am looking for mostly new experiences, things that surprise you with the place that they're playing."

**What He's Looking For**:
- "For me, the things I'm like wandering around and trying to find are the Japanese toilets of AI"
- "I am looking for mostly new experiences, things that surprise you with the place that they're playing"

## Case Study: Granola as Japanese Toilet

### The Market Context
"So for me when I use Grinola, you're like, oh, this is so intuitive. It's like the 50th thousandth AI note taker. Like, did the world need another AI note taker? I was like, yes, except I didn't want to use any of those other AI note takers."

### The Existing Problem
"When Fireflies joins my Zoom meeting, I'd never let it in. Oh, the anger. The needy and anger."

### The Japanese Toilet Solution
"Yeah, and where is this just like, no, just basically looks like Apple notes. And it's just going to like append a little, a little extra to the things that you took notes on and make you a little smarter along the way."

**The Recognition**: "As soon as you play with that, if you have any taste or product sense, you're like, oh, this is the thing."

## The Execution Paradox

### Not About Complexity
"Like, it's this thing. It's not like the execution is actually really subtle. It's really hard. But I think for me, the things I'm like wandering around and trying to find are the Japanese toilets of AI."

### The Subtlety Factor
"The execution is actually really subtle. It's really hard."

**Key Insight**: Japanese toilet products appear simple but require exceptional execution to create the "why isn't this everywhere?" experience.

## Mental Model: Innovation Detection

### Faster Horses
- **Recognition**: Immediate and obvious
- **Value**: Incremental improvement
- **Risk**: Low technical, high competitive
- **Funding**: Easy to get, easy to arbitrage

### Teleportation
- **Recognition**: Obvious desirability
- **Value**: Revolutionary if achieved
- **Risk**: High technical, uncertain timeline
- **Funding**: High-risk, high-reward bets

### Japanese Toilets
- **Recognition**: Only after experience
- **Value**: Profound but unexpected
- **Risk**: Execution difficulty hidden behind apparent simplicity
- **Funding**: Overlooked until breakthrough becomes obvious

## The Investment Sweet Spot

### Why Japanese Toilets Are Ideal
1. **Market Gap**: Most funding goes to faster horses or teleportation
2. **Hidden Value**: True potential only apparent after use
3. **Defensibility**: Execution subtlety creates moats
4. **Scalability**: Simple concepts with universal appeal

### The Challenge
"How do you become someone who makes a Japanese toilet? You know, like versus a faster horse?"

## Identification Strategies

### Product Taste Requirements
"As soon as you play with that, if you have any taste or product sense, you're like, oh, this is the thing."

### The Surprise Factor
"Things that surprise you with the place that they're playing."

### The Intuitive Test
"So for me when I use Grinola, you're like, oh, this is so intuitive."

## Broader Market Dynamics

### The Venture Capital Machine
"Most of that stuff is fine. And it'll also be arbitrage out of existence in four years and who cares."

### The Opportunity
"And so mostly you're looking for new expi, I am looking for mostly new experiences."

## Application to AI

### Current AI Landscape
Most AI products fall into:
- **Faster Horses**: Better versions of existing tools
- **Teleportation**: AGI, full automation promises

### The Japanese Toilet Gap
Opportunity exists for AI products that:
- Create unexpected delight
- Solve problems users didn't know they had
- Feel obvious in retrospect
- Execute with hidden sophistication

## Key Takeaway

The Japanese toilet theory provides a framework for identifying the most valuable innovation opportunities:

- **Faster horses**: Easy to build, easy to arbitrage
- **Teleportation**: Obvious value, uncertain achievability  
- **Japanese toilets**: Hidden value, sophisticated execution, profound impact

The best investments come from finding products that surprise users with experiences they didn't know they needed but immediately recognize as essential.
