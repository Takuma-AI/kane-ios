## The Core Philosophy

"I want to work with eight or nine or 10 companies really closely, as much as a founder really wants me around and I go away if it's not. And so you try and make the rest of the math work and like construct life about the way you want to live and then see if you can make it work versus letting somebody's financial or business model force you into working or what you don't want to work."

Nabeel Hyatt advocates for a concentrated investment approach that prioritizes deep relationships and meaningful contribution over portfolio diversification.

## The Problem with Traditional VC

### The "Noops" Experience
"First of all, I just think that, so I was a founder before, becoming an investor. And I found that I had no horror venture capital stories that sometimes investors have, or entrepreneurs have. But I also basically had a bunch of noops."

**What "Noops" Means**: "No opposition... they were just fine. It was like, there are no damage. I don't have a horror story. It did no harm. But it was also like, would the company have been exactly the same if they were not there, probably."

### The Root Cause
"I had investors that were fine and great board members and maybe offered a random piece of advice. But weren't in the muck enough and in the nuance enough to give good feedback, because they were investing in 15,000 things."

## The Spray-and-Pray Industry Trend

### Both Ends of the Spectrum
"Basically the whole venture capital industry since I joined, I've been to this for a little over decade now, is basically doing that at both ends of the spectrum, right? You've got the, I'm gonna write 100K checks into a million things and then you have the, well, if I raise $100,000,000 that I can own a proxy of the whole market firms."

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
"That's been their strategy to mitigate risk over time. And I'm like, look, the whole point of this thing is risk, like accept the risk and like go do the work you want to do with good people."

## The Concentrated Alternative

### The Management Analogy
"I think for me, the proxy is if you're a startup CEO or running a small org, you can manage like eight or nine direct reports where you kind of understand everything they're doing and outside of that, it starts to, the edges get fuzzy."

### Core Belief at Spark
"There's a thing on our website that I think we collectively believe at Spark, which is that there aren't really any startup playbooks. I think as a founder, you're doing something super unique with every, so you probably already believe there's really no playbook for what you're trying to do. But generally, every single journey is unique and all the devils and the details."

## The Relationship Product

### Different Products for Different Needs
"I think those firms are a viable strategy, I think they are a different product, and as long as a founder understands what product they're buying, then I'm super happy with all of them existing in the ecosystem."

### The Transparency Problem
"You cannot be investing five times a month and operating out of a $10 billion fund and get anything more than a random phone call every four years on a thing."

### Honest vs Dishonest Positioning
"And there are firms that are very good at being transparent about what this is, the transactional relationship, you get the money and you run away. I think actually Founders Fund is very good at being very honest about this. And there's lots of people that do a lot of storing around what they're selling."

## The Alternative Value Proposition

### What Concentrated Investors Sell
"We sell a different thing. And some Founders, that's really important, and it's wonderful, and they want that process and some don't. You have a connection, a kismet with anybody, or you don't, and we work on those things."

### The Team Structure
"That's also anachronistic, but because it's the old way venture capital used to be. Like I just wanna invest in hand full of companies and work really close to those founders in a smallish firm where I trust my partners, we all work together on something, he knows only seven of us on the venture team at Spark."

### Historical Precedent
"And like that was how Sequoia was 40 years ago, and it worked well, it's just not the way people are building firms today."

## Mental Model: Risk Acceptance vs Risk Mitigation

### Traditional VC Logic
**Risk Mitigation**: Diversify across many investments to reduce individual company risk  
**Scale Logic**: Bigger funds, more investments, statistical safety

### Concentrated Logic
**Risk Acceptance**: "The whole point of this thing is risk, like accept the risk"  
**Depth Logic**: Deep involvement improves odds of individual company success

## The Quality vs Quantity Trade-off

### Portfolio Construction
"And so you try and make the rest of the math work and like construct life about the way you want to live and then see if you can make it work versus letting somebody's financial or business model force you into working or what you don't want to work."

### The Management Challenge
**Traditional Approach**: Spread thin across many investments  
**Concentrated Approach**: "Kind of understand everything they're doing" for each investment

## Practical Implications

### For Founders
- **Know what you're buying**: Understand whether you're getting a transactional or relationship product
- **Match expectations**: Some founders need deep support, others just need capital
- **Chemistry matters**: "You have a connection, a kismet with anybody, or you don't"

### For Investors
- **Choose your model consciously**: Don't accidentally end up in spray-and-pray
- **Be honest about capacity**: Can't provide deep support to unlimited companies
- **Accept the trade-offs**: Concentration means fewer bets but deeper involvement

## The Courage Factor

### Taking Concentrated Risk
"I mean, I think it's, it takes some balls... I think taking enough risk to be concentrated and to actually call your shot is, I think it's quite cool."

### The Alternative Path
"Well, it's not deep, spray and prey even on the front end... You've got the, I'm gonna write 100K checks into a million things and then you have the, well, if I raise $100,000,000 that I can own a proxy of the whole market firms."

## Key Takeaway

Concentrated investing is about choosing quality of engagement over quantity of investments. It requires:
- **Accepting rather than diversifying risk**
- **Building deep relationships vs broad networks**
- **Understanding unique journeys vs applying generic playbooks**
- **Providing meaningful value vs just capital**

The approach works when both investor and founder understand and want the same type of relationship.
