## The Core Framework

"If you put a spectrum on all the coding agents today, the spectrum I would put on them is basically like how long are they allowed to work before they ask for feedback."

Nabeel Hyatt introduces a crucial framework for designing AI products: the autonomy spectrum, which determines how much independence to give AI systems before requiring human input.

## The Autonomy Spectrum Defined

### The Range
"And so if we're starting at the low end, you have like Microsoft Copilot, which is trying to finish one line of code, and on the other end of the spectrum, you have Devon, which is trying to run away for four hours."

**The Full Spectrum**:
- **Low Autonomy**: Microsoft Copilot (one line of code)
- **Medium Autonomy**: Cursor, Windsurf (minutes to complete tasks)
- **High Autonomy**: Devon (hours of independent work)

### The Key Question
"For whatever probably you're trying to solve, let's try and think about what is the reasoning of our current SOTA models. Let's think about how long do you think you can leave them?"

## The Leash Metaphor

### Dog Leash Analogy
"It sort of reminds me of, you know, those dogs that, like, the dog leashes that, like, they extend out, and it's like, how much leashes do you have? How do you find the right setting?"

**The Design Challenge**: Finding the optimal length where the AI can be productive without causing problems.

## Critical Design Variables

### Evaluation Capability
"How good are your e-vals internally? Because if you can evaluate longer and better, and how good the code base is, you can let it work for longer."

### Key Factors
1. **Model Reasoning Capability**: How sophisticated is the AI?
2. **Evaluation Systems**: How well can you assess AI output?
3. **Codebase Quality**: How robust is the foundation?
4. **Task Complexity**: How difficult is the specific problem?
5. **Error Cost**: What's the downside of mistakes?

## Case Study: Replit vs Devon

### Devon's Challenge
"I think we found Devon, for most people they find Devon to be like, it breaks a lot. It's a little slow. It will be an amazing product over time. They've made a long bet. But right now, they probably set the mark a little bit too long on how they let each to go."

### Replit's Sweet Spot
"I find for me, Replit agents, even though the models probably aren't as smart and so and so forth, the kind of like time variants they give before they come back and ask questions is like a little bit longer than Windsorff, a little bit shorter than some others."

**Why It Works**: "Michele, who's the head of AI there, and our president just did a great job setting a variance... Just literally that, setting the right altitude of reasoning is everything for getting really good results out of it."

## The Product Design Implications

### Beyond Technical Capability
"And it's not, I say just longer leash. It's not just that it thinks differently. It's like, oh, that makes different demands of the UI and the UX, like, it just is a different thing. It's a whole flow is a different flow and it'll feel like a different product."

### The Evolution Challenge
"And then like in three months when a new model comes out, like, try again. If, yeah, if you aren't reevaluating, how would I destroy my own startup six months later, every six months right now, during this, like, Cambrian explosion of stuff, like, that's the way you have to navigate things today."

## Design Process Framework

### Step 1: Capability Assessment
"Let's try and think about what is the reasoning of our current SOTA models."

### Step 2: Time Boundary Setting
"Are you letting this thing go for an hour, four hours, three days, one sentence, 16 seconds, based on whatever you're trying to solve?"

### Step 3: Evaluation System Design
"How good are your e-vals internally?"

### Step 4: Product Flow Adaptation
"That makes different demands of the UI and the UX, like, it just is a different thing."

## The Continuous Optimization Process

### Regular Reevaluation
"Isn't that the wonderful journey that we're all on with AI? Is that changes like every quarter?"

### Real-World Example
"I have a company right now that will go nameless because they're about to release a pretty awesome new thing that actually had an aha moment relatively recently about this, that they, they've been in AI for a while. They're doing really well, but they realize like that it, like, it's a short leash product, and they kind of had the epiphany a month and a half ago, like, oh, these models are good enough that if we just stitched them slightly differently, what would a longer leash product version?"

## Mental Model: Product Design Decision Tree

### Questions to Ask
1. **What's the task complexity?**
2. **What's the error tolerance?**
3. **How good are current models at this task?**
4. **How well can we evaluate outputs?**
5. **What's the user's expertise level?**
6. **What's the cost of mistakes?**

### Design Implications
**Short Leash Products**:
- Real-time feedback
- Frequent human intervention
- Lower error tolerance
- Simpler UI flows

**Long Leash Products**:
- Batch processing
- Autonomous execution
- Higher error tolerance
- Complex workflow management

## The Problem with Chat Interfaces

### Current Default Approach
"So Wordware is starting from a different orthogonal, which is what do I have to give this thing for it to be able to understand what I really mean? And it turns out if you open up, I don't know, Windsorff or if you open up cursor or if you open up repolate agents, it's a chatbot. Like it looks like a chat window."

### The Information Problem
"And so what is the normal thing that a person who doesn't talk to chat to PT or cloud all day long, like you and me do? They type in one, three sentences, two sentences, which is like plenty, just enough room for a model to hang itself."

**The Issue**: "It's exactly the wrong amount of information to give a model, to go then code and make a bunch of things."

## Practical Strategies

### Preventing Premature Execution
"I often like at the end of the initial prompt, I'm like, if anything's unclear, like ask me questions before, which helps, but my other very common prompt there is give me five ways to solve this."

### The Five Options Strategy
"I, like, I would say every second or third prompt into one of these code agencies, give me five options so that it doesn't run ahead."

## The Future of Leash Length

### Model Improvement Impact
"Oh, these models are good enough that if we just stitched them slightly differently, what would a longer leash product version?"

### Continuous Adaptation Required
"If you aren't reevaluating, how would I destroy my own startup six months later, every six months right now, during this, like, Cambrian explosion of stuff, like, that's the way you have to navigate things today."

## Product Strategy Implications

### For AI Product Builders
1. **Start with shorter leashes** and extend based on capability
2. **Design for leash length flexibility** - don't lock into one approach
3. **Invest in evaluation systems** to enable longer leashes safely
4. **Redesign UX** when changing leash length significantly
5. **Plan for regular reassessment** as models improve

### For Users
1. **Understand the leash length** of tools you're using
2. **Match tools to task complexity** and your error tolerance
3. **Provide appropriate context** for the leash length
4. **Develop comfort** with different autonomy levels

## Key Takeaway

The agentic spectrum provides a crucial framework for AI product design:

- **Too short**: Limits AI productivity and user efficiency
- **Too long**: Increases errors and user frustration
- **Just right**: Maximizes value while maintaining control

Success requires continuous optimization as models improve and use cases evolve. The "right" leash length is dynamic and context-dependent.
