## Transcript

We want to build Google's and Facebook's and AI and giant companies, giant cryptocurrencies, and now internet communities.
What they want to do is they want to exert authority over others.
For them, the best thing they can do is to put a man out of work.
And for us, the best thing we can do is we can put a man on the moon.
Balaji, another day, another Jerino hit piece, we were sort of talking offline about, you know, we're talking about the marks and bends evolution of the media episode.
And, you know, you know, I've been friends with collaborators for the last 10 years.
And one of the topics we've spent a lot of time talking about is the media.
Sort of the state of the media wouldn't need to be fixed about the media and how to do that.
And we, and with your leadership, have actually been a part of that trend and that evolution.
And so I wanted to take the opportunity to talk to you, kind of reflect about that evolution and talk about where we still need to go.
Yeah, well, okay, so there's so much I can say on this.
I'm going to show one graph that, of course, it wouldn't be of all the podcast that we didn't start with a graph.
Yeah, it's exactly.
This shows that essentially newspaper revenue rose to like $70 billion in the year 2000.
And then right after the financial crisis, it just suddenly collapsed over, of course, like four or five years.
And Google went vertical and Facebook went vertical, right?
And the thing about this is this was the internet disrupting blue America.
Okay, there's a similar graph for manufacturing that shows China disrupting red America.
Almost exactly the same time, right?
So once you kind of, just to focus on this one though for a second,
once you see the internet disrupting blue America because media is like a core thing for them,
this is actually what led to wokeness because it was, you know, you've heard the saying go woke, go broke, right?
But in their case, it was actually go broke, go woke.
Okay, not my original coinage, but applied to this graph.
It's relatively original because wokeness was what happened was they just fell off a cliff like this.
And for from 2008 to 2012, tech was just part of the Democrat party.
It was like, you know, Steve Jobs is there and, you know, there's actually this article from 2012
on the Atlantic, like the nerds go marching into tech, helping to reelect Obama and Facebook was helping.
They're spraying.
Yeah, exactly.
All that stuff was basically solidly on the Democrat side up until 2012.
After the 2012 election, right after Obama's inauguration, you can did to right after that because even
in 2012, like New York media and so on was saying, there's no such thing as a programmer.
Okay, Google that article.
So 2012, tech was part of the coalition.
So there were no reason to attack.
There's no reason to attack them.
After the inauguration 2013, and it's literally that spring and summer, the knives came out.
And media started attacking tech.
Okay, and there are these articles, you know, would you just look at all these rich people
where it's actually in slate?
That was a before, you know, they got radicalized.
And they're saying, oh, you know, it's actually bad to attack people just for the sake of English.
It was before all media had updated to actually tech as our enemy now, right?
And so, but unless you understand the economics of it,
I don't think one can understand why the journal suddenly went crazy.
Now, the thing is, we're now in 2025, right?
It is now 17 years after the collapse in media revenue, right?
So somebody who is born, then, who is 18 years old, you're playing like multiplayer,
video games, like Quake or whatever, you know, all the new stuff, you know, MOBAs, right?
You know, you can get spawned into the middle of something where everybody's shooting at each other,
right? That's what, like, the Gen Z kid is today, right?
For a kid who's just getting warped into the arena, the Luke Farrad, or, you know, for example.
Yeah, exactly.
That's right. They're just, like, warped in like this.
And it's like, you know, that thing where there's a meme of the guy he's walking into,
the apartment after he's been gone for 10 minutes, everything's on fire, whatever they're going back.
Exactly, right?
Okay, so from the perspective of someone who's 18 years old, the war with the journals has
basically been a feature of their entire existence. Okay. But it actually wasn't like that,
because in the 90s and the 2000s, the journals were secure enough in their economic position,
because you could write, like, four or six articles for Time Magazine a year and get paid a
nice salary and travel around the world. So they didn't, I mean, did they kill? Yes, they killed,
but they didn't feel the need to kill all the time. You know, it's funny because,
the way I'm putting it, Nelly Bowles actually did a thing for Barry Weiss a few years ago,
and it's like learning how not to kill.
Well, it's funny because she's one of the few converts. You know, she made the transition.
She was able to get to the other side.
We look at that where we look at, there's another one. There's one by Hamilton Nolan at CGR,
okay, which is basically like the powerful don't need the media. Journalism, particular,
at its highest level is about raw power. See the admit it, right? Go ahead.
I remember you had this old quote. Was it some journalist who was like our profession?
We know our profession is kind of like immoral. That's an old quote.
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's actually a great one also, right? That is the journalist. All right,
this is a book report. Anybody who has read this book cannot look at the journals the same way.
So, Janet Malcolm, you know, talks about this and her opening line, this is a great book
called the Journalist of Murder, and her opening line is this famous famous thing.
Oh, let me find this. Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself knows what
is going on, knows the way it does is morally indefensible. He is a kind of confidence man,
praying on people's vanity, ignorance or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without
remorse, like the credulous widow who wakes up one day to find the charming young man
or all her savings on, sold the consenting subject of a piece of nonfiction writing learns
when the article or book appears his hard lesson. Journalists justify their treachery in various
ways according to their temperaments. The more pompous talk about freedom of speech, the public's
right to know, the least talented talk about art, the seamless murmur about earning a living, okay?
And now this is actually a very important thing because this is what a, this is by the way,
read it on the top 100 nonfiction books of the 20th century by the modern library. This is like
Wolf of Wall Street where you know how like there's some like finance guys who I think
incorrectly are like, yeah, we are actually like boiler room, you know, pumpers or whatever,
right? Like Wolf of Wall Street guy. This is, this is like that for the journals, okay? They're like,
yeah, we actually, the journals actually are, they're like, we are defamers and yeah, it's just like
a mercenary thing or, you know, so this is a great book to read. There's another book you shall
also read The Great Lady Winked by Ashley Rinsberg, okay. So those prerexets, let's talk about
the specifics. First is, um, there's like 10, 15 things I can say, let me just go kind of point by point,
the first is, what is the reason for the hostility between media and tech, right? It's actually that
the master framework on the whole thing is at state versus network, right? This is basically from
my book The Network State. I think it's useful frame, which is like, for example,
Elon versus mainstream media is network versus state, right? Social media versus mainstream media
is network versus state. Or when it says, what is this whole article that was attacking Luke
Farrater, it's like, why did this programmer attack the institutions of the US government,
network versus state, right? Like this tech programmer attacking the state institutions, right?
And it's a people on social media that tech people who are mad at the fact that this state
aligned institution is attacking our tech people. Once you apply that framework, that applies to
everything. For example, SpaceX's network, NASA state, Uber is a network, taxing medallions are
the state. Bitcoin is the network, the Fed is the state, and so on and so forth, right? And those
are two different organizing principles for how you think about the world. Basically, the state is,
someone should pass the law, and the network is, someone should write some code, right? The state
is everybody who is directly or indirectly paid by essentially either the US government or a
government more generally, and the network is all those people who are directly or indirectly
monetize and make their living on the network. So when someone goes from NYT to Substack, they're
moving from state to network, right? And now the network is actually taking parts of the state
where all these tech guys are getting into government, getting into politics, getting into media,
getting into finance, getting into the traditional niches that were for the state. That's why they're
so mad because they're share of the global pie and the local and the American pie is shrinking,
and the network spy is expanding, right? And we're getting into, they're like, stay in your lane.
Why are they saying that? They're like, you should just be like hitting keys on computers and
being a nerd and making like LED light bulbs that flash. You should not be like rewriting the
code base of, you know, how like the world works, right? And as I'll get to, there's a deep question
of legitimacy, right? The network is new money, the state is old money, right? And when I say the
state, by the way, there's like the literal state in the sense of the US government, and there's
the unelected institutions that surround the US government in a ring that give it instruction.
Example, the newspapers tell the state what to do, the universities tell the state what to do,
the philanthropies tell the state what to do, and so on and so forth, right? But they're,
they're also in turn funded by the state. So universities obviously directly get federal funding,
right? Some of them are literally federal, you know, public colleges, but they're very dependent on
tax exemptions and so on and so forth at the state grants, and they only exist because of that.
The philanthropies also did, oh, NGOs, they have compounding, you know, foundations, or they're
their foundation endowment compounds because they've got favorable tax treatment, which
normal companies don't get, but they're a state affiliate. And finally, the media, that's the
least obvious, how are they upstream of the state? Well, obviously they quote, hold somebody
accountable by publishing a negative article on them. Of course, they never hold themselves accountable
because, you know, like, they're always like, we're speaking truth to power. I'm like,
obviously they're not. Why? Every journal is so courageous as to attack your boss, but never
they're on. Okay? That's basically, whenever you're talking to a journal, you're not talking to
the journal, you're talking to their boss, right? Basically, who is ultimately, for example,
Bloomberg when Bloomberg was running for president? Actually, Bloomberg, you know, Michael Bloomberg
is one of the better of them because he's actually like a tech entrepreneur. So, you know, I'm not
like completely anti-Michael Bloomberg, right? But Michael Bloomberg, when he was running for
president, Bloomberg news, his pit bulls, they actually posted this amazing thing, which said,
we will report on but not investigate Michael Bloomberg. Amazing, amazing phrase. Report on,
what an amazing phrase. So what it means is we will basically, if somebody else says something,
we will reprint in Bloomberg. So you can't say we didn't report on him. Okay? But we're not
going to go and dig through his trash. We're not going to do it adversarily. We're not going
to stalk him. We're not going to spam his family like they did to our, our boy, Luke Farrer, right?
That's a good report. Well, so that's the thing is they didn't ask her because he's got, he's got
our support, right? But I'm just referencing the meme. Yes, I know, I know, I know, that's right.
Yeah, but the thing is they, they don't do that because if you are Bloomberg journal and you
went after Michael Bloomberg, that's what's known as a CLM career limiting move. In fact, actually,
the entire journal establishment, that's all nepotist. That's all old money, right?
They project on to us what their lifestyle is. They like, Salisberger, who inherited the
New York Times, you know, Murdoch, the guy who inherited Fox News down and the new houses,
who inherited Wired and CondiNast, basically condiNast was a parent company of that. Basically,
they're all heirs, right? They're not self-made. And the journals don't have equity. See,
old money treats the journalists much worse. Tech people, we treat our employees so much better
because we give them equity, right? They level up. The journals is a complete two-tier system,
where there's the publishers, the owners of these papers, and then these serfs, the journals.
So how do they compensate them? They compensate them in status, where the journal is meant to
made to believe that they're like some, you know, independent, you know, like free-wheeling attack
dog. Of course, they can't actually attack true power, who is their bosses, right? They'll never
even mention them. That's the thing is solid. Like, if I say Zuck, right? If I say Zuckaburg,
Zuckaburg, whether you like him or not, Zuckaburg deserves our respect because he's the man,
he really is the man in the rear. He's taken the hits for 20 years, right? And he has survived so
many things, and crucially, he's CEO, he is founder, he's out there, and you can criticize it by name.
And if I say Zuckaburg, everybody can summon a face to the name, they can summon all this by
and so on. If I say Zuckaburgur, it's a blank. 99% of people don't even know the guy exists,
right? He's like, you know, the usual suspects. Yeah. He's like, guys are so is it,
guys are Salisberger, okay? Right? This guy, who is the guy, put him on screen so you can just see,
okay? I honestly, I've heard his name a million times, but I don't even know what he looks like.
You don't even know what he looks like, but this thing is basically, Zuckaburg is somebody who,
again, for better or worse, he runs a major communications channel, and so he's covered,
right? But Zuckaburgur doesn't get good coverage. He gets no coverage, right? That is actually
really interesting, right? The guy who, you know, so let me show you this, put this on screen,
ready? Who's holding him accountable, right? And they're, I'll tell you what,
yeah, journalist journalism for the privacy for me. Exactly. The guy who's surrounded by thousands
of journalists at all times is the only person in the world who has any privacy. Okay? That's good.
You've never seen this guy's face, right? Who is this guy? Yes, he's on the New York Times,
and people say, oh my god, he's on the New York Times, New York Times. But the point is,
if you did word-face association in terms of a number of impressions, this is a quantitative
thing, right? If I use AI, I could quantify it. How many people can sum in the face of Zuckaburg to,
you know, but with it word, like millions, billions probably, right? How many, even know that Salisberger
exists? Basically, nobody. Why? Because it's Zuckaburg's company, he is considered a person who is in
charge of the company, and people don't just say, oh, Facebook has some policy issue, Facebook has
this policy issue, meta has this policy issue, they go after Zuckaburg personally. But the NYT,
they're granted the enormous shield of calling it the NYT, calling it the institution as opposed
to Salisberger's paper. It is just Salisberger's paper. It's his blog, right? There's nothing
that is printed there without his approval, right? So he inherited it from his father's father's father's
father's father's father. Okay? It's like five generations. Here's a big one. Okay? And then let's get
back to Luke. Okay? So Duranty, okay, Walter Duranty. So let me show you, there's basically,
you know, as said, Jernos never hold themselves accountable, right? So here's a great, great, great tweet
by Paul. Actually, Paul Graham, and then I think, you know, here's my reply to it. So look at Paul,
one of the biggest surprise of my adult life is how unethical reports are. And movies are
always a good guys. Everyone in technosaries like this. Now, by the way, this is actually a deep
point. Why? Paul is saying this in movies, they're always the good guys. So this is a concept I
call Jurassic Ballpark. And Paul has said something like this many times, right? Jurassic Ballpark
is like, you know, the movie Jurassic Park. And in it, they are missing some DNA for the dinosaurs.
They use amphibious DNA. And of course, that leads to issues because then they can reproduce
and so on and so forth, right? Okay. So in the same way, when you have a missing segment of history
or culture, you just ballpark it with what comes out of a movie, right? Jurassic Ballpark,
right? Just ballpark it. But that could be really, really wrong or fake because it's a movie
after all, right? Unless you have personal experience of something, your impression of it is the
movie version. And this is a non-obvious point, right? So like, how else could it be because visuals
are very persuasive, right? And your brain video is a high bandwidth pathway to the human brain,
right? And it's not like your brain was like built in maybe in system two versus system one,
you know, system one is like instinctive and system two is like logical, you know, kind of
thinking, right? Like maybe your system two can distinguish true and false with video,
but your system one can't do, right? Okay. So essentially, people see all these things like,
you know, journals are the good guys. And so we just saw the journalists in the murderer,
right? We just saw once you actually understand the space, they're more like Kaiser Soze,
Kaiser Salisberger, where they are the unreliable narrator, right? They write the story and everybody
else dies and they're the good guys. And you never actually hear the story of how the story
is written, which is actually much more important than the story. Like whenever you see the New
York Times has obtained, how did they obtain it? Oh, they got some stolen documents. Oh, you know,
or they told a source, give me this and then I'll write favorably about you and don't give me
this and I'm going to name you and the thing and you're going to lose your job and get attacked.
They do all that kind of stuff and go ahead. I remember your definition of journalism,
invasion of privacy. Yeah. Exactly. The non-consensual invasion of privacy for profit is what legacy
media is. Let's take that definition. Okay. Non-consensual. Can you opt out? Can you say,
journal, stop stalking me? Can you say, journal, stop spamming me? Can you say?
Don't mention my family. Don't mention my family. So see, the thing is, in normal English,
we have words for this. When journals go through your garbage, like, there are somebody who's like
stalking people online and looking at all the facts. Like, you know, if Luke Farrider had had
somebody going and spamming all of his friends and contacts and whatever and they were just like some,
you know, like drug addict or crazy person, he could say, okay, that stalking that's spamming,
you could get a 50 foot restraining order. I actually want to see, by the way, today's court
system. I want to see people use anti stalking, anti spam kind of things because can't spam.
It's an unsolicited message, right? Like, you can try and use that on the journals and maybe
there's a sympathetic court system now, right? Like, basically, they get one warning, go to F away
and the second is, they've got money. So go after them on that, right? Okay. Fine. So now,
I'm sure there's some like, you know, um, process where basically there's all your terms
were solved and there's various things where, you know, they, they have, they've had historical
presence to protect them. But basically, once you think of them as spammers, as stalkers,
as scammers, because they are scammers, the journalists of murder, what, what was the definition she used?
A con man, right? The journals of con man, because they'll always write this email to you,
which is like, fluffing you up and flattering you and saying how great you are, blah, blah, blah,
and pretending that they come in under Flag of Parley, they get their quote, if you're dumb enough
to talk to them. And then they stab you in the article. That's why, you know, Janet Malcolm said,
the consenting subject of a piece of nonfiction learns when the article appears his hard lesson,
because you talk to this person, they present to themselves as a human being as like a person
you're having a conversation with and actually they twisted every word to try to stab you, right?
Okay. Coming back up. So, uh, so point being basically, they're actually the stalkers,
the spammers, the scammers. That's what the journals are. You can't get them to go away. So that's
a non consensual part, the non consensual invasion of privacy for profit. So there's this saying
that sometimes journals use a self-defense saying this is like, um, journalism is printing,
but someone does not wish printed. Everything else is, you know, advertising or something like that,
right? It's like, I'll, I'll find the exact quote. Journalism is printing something that someone
does not want printed, uh, everything else is public relations, right? Now, what does that mean?
Why does someone not want to print it? Usually because private information, right? So the non-consensual
invasion of privacy for profit, let us not forget that these are multi-billion dollar media
corporations, right? People, it took a long time in the 2010s for people to finally, like,
realize the New York Times, the journal, they're just.coms, right? They have absolutely,
they're not referees. They're not neutrals. For some reason, people give them the
imprimatur of like an institution. We need to save our institution. But what's the difference
in New York Times and Facebook, the companies? Exactly. They're corporation, fair game,
fair game, right? And in fact, that's why they got so mad at us because we actually believed
in what they said that we had freedom of speech and that free markets existed. Actually,
until really the early 2010s, there's no actual practical freedom of speech, you know why?
Because, you know, it's saying, like, never argue with the man who buys ink by the barrel,
right? Basically, freedom of press belonged to those who own one. So think about how expensive it
was to get a radio license, a TV license to own a newspaper and send trucks to people's houses
with, you know, all the ink and the printing press. That was like this super high capital cost,
right? These are guys who basically own like essentially factories that cranked out papers.
And you at home could say something to your friend, but you don't have distribution, right?
And we understand what distribution, now, you know, Teal talked about distribution years ago
before was quantified with social media. Now, very roughly, distribution is like number of followers,
number of people in your email list, but also quality of them, right? I just quantity of quality
and quantity of your follower basis is roughly distribution. So you didn't have distribution.
And I mentioned this before, but in like the early 90s, you know, the unibomor. Yeah, of course.
Yeah. Why do you kill those people? You kill those people so you can get an op-ed in the Washington
post, right? Now, why? Because distribution was so scarce back then that, you know, he wanted to
get his manifesto out so he could literally kill people for the distribution, right? That was just
within our lifetimes just 30 years ago. That's a scarce distribution was today. He'd be a crazy
person on the internet, right? He'd get his message out there. But if you realize unibomor is
willing to kill to get his message out, you also realize why there's some people who are like crazy
trolls on X because they might not be able to kill, but they're certainly willing to attack somebody
else, attack their character or reputation assassination. And now you get to the journals, right?
So journalism as the non-consensual invasion of privacy for profit really captures what it is
these critters do. Now, up until about 2020 or so, there was no force that could resist them.
They were just like rampaging, right? I mean, we could resist them economically, but especially
in the 2010s, they were so mad at us taking their money, right? And what did that mean? By the way,
it just meant that like you refresh NYT.com, you see a Rolex ad or whatever, you know, you see a
like some car ad, you see some clothes ad. And if you refresh meta.com, right? Facebook.com,
Instagram, what do you see? You see an ad for the exactly the same company, right?
Yep. And so that means the sales account executives at both of these organizations, right?
What they are, you know, what they're doing is they're competing for literally the same customer,
right? And obviously the Facebook, Google, et cetera ad has much more scale and has
much more analytics. It's built internet first and so and so forth. So the NYT just starts
bleeding at it. But essentially, at point being, we're being them economically. They couldn't
code search engines or social networks, but they could write stories and shape narratives.
I know the difference between like a drop box product announcement and NYT story.
Their stories have villains, right? Our product announcements are all basically really making
the world a better place. It's like, guess what? 10 gigs more storage or whatever, right?
Guess what? You know, now you can like, you know, do, you know, like like comic book style AI or
whatever, right? All that stuff doesn't hurt anybody. That's just essentially, you know,
this is adding cool things to world. Oh, here's a new robot. Here's, you know, like that's who
we're doing. And what are they doing? They want to like the highest award in journalism. What's the
most precise you can think you can do? They want to catch the thoroughness.
Well, even higher than that is water game, right? So they like basically, whereas for us,
it's like SpaceX, right? So for them, the highest, the best thing they can do is to put a man out of
work. And for us, the best thing we can do is we can put a man on the moon. Okay? So literally,
the number one thing that they can see, and this again, state versus network, right? We want to build
Googles and Facebooks and, you know, AI and all this kind of stuff drones. And we want to build
giant companies, giant cryptocurrencies and now internet communities. What they want to do
is they want to exert authority over others, but they want to do so in a deniable way, right?
Because if you go to the Pulitzer website or something like that and you look at these prices,
they'll all say something like our reporting held, you know, these so-and-so accountable and
led to an FTC investigation, blah, blah, blah. So they're really willing to take credit when
their words on the page lead to the state, golem going and animating and smashing somebody,
right? It led to an FTC investigation. It led to, you know, a new FAA regulation led to this,
led to that, right? Leading to some person getting fired, some program getting set up. And the
ultimate thing, obviously, is to get the president of the United States fire. That's why they wanted
to get Nixon fired, right? We would watergate, right? It was just showing that they had told,
they were essentially like, think of Wall Street Journal, NYT and Washington Post as the three
board of directors seats on top of the presidency. The president was like the titular CEO,
but the journal, the Times and Washington Post, if they all put their multi-sec key in the
lock, they did their board of directors vote, they'd get him fired, right? So that was actually
the state of affairs. That's what it meant by holding the government accountable. Nobody in the
government was really in power. The journals could write negative stories and they were out of power,
right? So the thing is that when it comes publisher time, they will admit that their stories led
to something. But when it comes BLM time, they deny that their stories led to America, you know,
half American can burn down, right? So it's a one-way ratchet where they take all the credit and
avoid all the blame. Because could you actually show the trace of like that image coming into somebody's
eye and then them setting fire to this building? Once in a while you might be able to show it, right?
They publish a manifesto saying, I read x, y, and z and that's why I burned it down. But that
causal effect, right? The cause and effect and basically showing demonstrating that is,
you know, there's an impression of page view that comes in over here through the eyes and the
ears. And then there's a burn down the building kind of action on their side. And then they just
like, you know, go ahead. It's funny because they're quick to use causal in both direction.
They're quick to say, hey, Facebook is causing people to be depressed or to whatever turn right
wing or, you know, yes, that's right. So, so tech, there's a causal effect for everything negative.
Yeah. Sure knows. There's a causal effect for everything positive. That's amazing. Wow.
What an amazing, right? Like everything you do is bad. Everything they do is good. Amazing
flipping. Once you see this though, you can basically be like, neo, you know, in the matrix,
to just like block everything like this, right? And, you know, another big piece of this, they
stopped doing this. But one of the things they were doing years ago is they're like, oh my guy,
everybody in tech is so white and blah, blah, blah, right? And obviously it's like so much more
international than the journals. If you go and take that famous photo of Elon in the conference room
and you compare the people there versus the NYT editorial boat photo, right? And you'll see they're
like well dressed, you know, essentially mostly European ancestry people. And again, I'm not
the kind of person who thinks like white as an insult, but they do, right? So it's all projection,
right? The journals themselves have these tyrannical, evil, meritless nepotists as bosses, right?
The journals themselves can never actually make it anywhere. And it's all favoritism and
glad handing. And there's no merit. And it's all luck and connections. And the journals themselves
essentially are these envious people who exist to harm you to increase their career prospects.
And they project that all that out into everybody else, right? So once you kind of see that,
like every, every accusations of confession or whatever, you realize, oh,
this is how the world works in their stupid Brooklyn side of things. And they think of us as
a rival tribe that acts the same way, right? Okay. So now that's like part of the macro.
Now, bad news for them, which is to say that bad news for us and also bad news for them,
but a lot of sort of bad news for them. The bad news for them is that they in the in the gigantic
war between the internet and blue America, right? And by the way, we didn't actually intend
to start that war. We were just building great stuff. And it became so popular that we took away
all of the customers of these guys. But it's not like you set up Twitter or Facebook or Google
to go and blow up the times and the posts and the journal, right? That was just something like,
you know, Bezos got the post out of petty cash, right? Like it was just something where we built
a valuable enough business that it generates so much wealth that, okay, he could just go and acquire
this thing, right? And, you know, of course, I understand why they got mad. But what they should have
just done is rather than try to beat us, join us or whatever, you know, like had part of it is
also there's like three or four different things. There's a scenario where if Steve Jobs had lived
that when Bezos bought the post, Jobs buys the times and Larry Page buys a Wall Street Journal
and we'd be on Mars by now. Yeah. Okay. So like the thing is, at the end of the day,
there's actually, you know, as much as I think there are like evil twin in some ways,
there's a deep sense in which there's a similarity, which is we're all about the collection,
dissemination and presentation of information. That's the similarity to the tech and media.
The collection of information like the raw, you know, data, whether it's a user-generated content
or so on, dissemination, which is a distribution, the posting, circulation, and presentation,
user interface. They do think about their charts or infographics. They also obsess about copy and so
and so forth, right? So we're a fork of them. In the same way that like Yale was a fork of Harvard
or America was a fork of Britain, then it's a fork of the East Coast culture and it goes deeper.
People like Paul Graham, Catherine Boyle, Mike Moritz. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
That's right. So in another life, right? Yeah. Mike Moritz was a journalist, became an investor,
Catherine Boyle also a journalist, became an investor, right? Peter Till would have been probably,
they'd been more than 20 years earlier, probably would have been a Supreme Court jurist,
right? Probably would have been like, you know, Chief Judge of the Supreme Court or something.
Paul Graham would have been a professor, Larry Page, a professor, Sergei Breen, a professor.
Mike Salana in Brooklyn, probably. For sure, but you'd probably be a book publisher or something
like that, right? I probably would have been a professor and so and so forth, you know? And that's
true for, you know, Andrew Yang, Daphne Kohler, you know, many many people, Martin Casado, right?
Dickson, you know, and so many of us would have, because the thing is with computer science,
there is a amazing connection between the word and the deed. Actually, AI makes that, you know,
even closer, you write it down and it's done. It's this amazing thing, right? So ultimately,
what we're doing is we're also writing all day, right? We're writing all day to see an impact in
the world, right? So the difference is their impact because of doing it through the state
and a failed state at that is almost invariably negative, right? And because we're doing it through
the network, we have feedback loops where, for example, when we type something in and it's actually
factually wrong, like the compiler throws up on it and it just doesn't compile. Like there's
fact checking like on the page when we type something. They have no such thing. Their only fact check
is actually crucially, not by the world, but by their peers. Like that is to say, it's only when
they lose data among other journals that they actually ever course correct, right? Ever. And
that's like very rare, right? So long as within their tribe, they're not losing status, there's nothing.
Okay. Now, basically what happened is once you see this kind of model by they're going back to
the original point, the internet disrupting blue America, China's disrupting red America,
you can understand essentially the last 18 years in the following way. Blue America was disrupted
by the internet. And so they began wokeness to take a piece of red America's pie and the tech
lash to try and take back control from the internet. Red America was disrupted by China. So the trade war
was against China and Trump was against blue America, right? Because both their pies they felt
they were shrinking. And so they launched two front wars on blue America and red America and the
internet. Red America and blue America and China. Okay. We'll do the China bit later. Okay.
But blue America versus red American the internet after, you know, a massive push has lost. Right?
I mean, it was close, but basically Elon and X day, it's like literally D day. This feels like
Eons ago, it was only three years ago, literally three years ago, X still hadn't been a part.
Twitter was still Twitter. It's like, we're in like wartime speed of things happening and saying how
quickly things are right. Okay. So X day was something where, by the way, it wasn't just Elon.
$44 billion, even Elon, as amazing as Elon is, that's like at the right tail of what even Elon
was capable of actually having as a race. That's a big, that's a big race for anybody, right?
So it took, but the richest man in the world, the wealthy, he's doing, he's launching
rocket, he's doing ships. He's all this other stuff and he decided to take on this enormous
extra thing and he somehow managed it, which is actually crazy to think about because everything
else, Elon is the end of one because every other, you know, whenever I talk to a founder,
I'm like, focus, focus, focus. Okay. After you have your first whatever billion dollar company
and it's 10 billion, that's 100 billion, then you can do your next or whatever, right? Fine.
But so Elon's end of one point is in 222, where it looked like the free world was just
completely on the ropes by these like, ratio obsessed woke psychos, just having us, you know,
like pinned like this, you couldn't even say whether men and women exist, like we're generally
talking about like a permanent midnight, like descendants, really, really bad stuff, right?
How evil they were. They just burned down half America. They were just getting psycho more and
more and more psycho, right? And so amidst that, basically, all the resource of all the centrist
tech and finance guys, because that's what the 44 billion, there's that famous message of like
Elon to Ellison, that's being made public right now, he's like, what are you in for like one or two?
Okay, but okay, Ellison could put in one or two, but like so many other people who's like Avengers
assemble put in a mill, whatever they could afford, a mill, 10, 20, I mean, 50 is a big investment
for almost anybody, right? Like 50 is like, you know, it's a serious LP meeting. So Elon,
being Elon, was able to pass the hat and assemble this gigantic coalition of 44 billion dollars,
all of our remaining forces for X-Day, right? And so the landing was extremely contested, right?
They basically wanted whatever the opposite of what he wanted. Yes, that's right. Anyway,
point is X-Day was the day that, and the thing is like, you know, X-Day was also the liberation of
meta and liberation of YouTube, right? All the countries that these racial fanatics at the NYT
had occupied, right? The networks they had occupied. That was like, you know how like the Nazi
empire was at like its peak and they thought they were going to win and then D-Day and then they
just kind of collapsed like this, right? So Salzburger and Soros, they thought they were going to win
and then X-Day boom came in and just there, like, you know, with X-Flipping, YouTube Uncensored,
like meta-uncensored, everything Uncensored and so on and so forth because X was upstream of
the conversation. Anyway, point is, it took Elon's personal intervention in June 23,
see his first round of firings hadn't done it, his second round hadn't done it, it was like the
third round of chemo to get rid of the wokes that had just infested Twitter, right, to actually
you know, change things. And by the way, you know, again, Elon's intuitive, you know,
more than a philosopher per se, just his philosophy is his execution, right? But there's actually a real
logic to why you're renamed it X, you know why? Among other things, there's one of many reasons.
Why? And I'm not saying this is why he did it, but it is an implicit aspect of how he did it.
It's just like them renaming all the schools and like tearing down the statues and so on, right?
Every journal had put years of effort into building up their profiles and all their blue checks
were stripped and all their profiles got renamed and it was just X. I know the example is fake news,
right? Trump, fake news had actually been used in 2016 for a few weeks in the context of
all that social media news is fake, but the New York Times is real news. And Trump turned it on
them and it's like actually the NYT is fake news, the fake news media, right? Which is perfect, right?
So in the same way, the blue check went from something that was something the journal's valued,
something that just Elon just stripped from all of them, right? He just stripped their status,
stripped their distribution. I don't know whether the ban on outbound links, again,
whether it's intentional or not. I have no personal information, just what I'd just speculate,
or again, and even if it wasn't intentional, this is just like part of the effect of it.
The ban on outbound links meant that suddenly X became the place you just go for the information,
you don't go to the journals anymore, right? So he stripped their status, he stripped their control
over the central stream of media, he stripped their traffic from links, he renamed the whole thing
to show that he had root control over it, because you know what a pain in the ass is to do a rename,
right? This X.com was, in a sense, techs revenge for making every fucking GitHub
renamed from master to main. Okay, now is Yale renaming its master's degree?
No. Okay, of course not, right? Is master class, whatever. Like anybody who's at the end of
New York Times, are they saying I've got a main degree now rather than a master's in journalism?
I think Columbia says a master's in journalism, right? So the whole point was, again,
these journalists have a double standard. They would impose that on us, right? You,
one million GitHub repose after a rename from master to main, whatever, 100 million GitHub,
do you know what a pain in the ass that was? This huge pain in the ass. Every single dev had to go
through some stupid exercise on this, which was just a demonstration of their power over us at that
time. That was what renaming means. It means you cause a massive inconvenience for everybody to
show that you have institutional power. So now, Elon returns a favor and does it at even
much greater scale, right? Okay. So now what that is is network overstate where we fought in the
demand, which we were stronger. And in a sense, also by the way, taking back X and renaming X,
you know, there's like a hard fought city in some countries or some wars. Like, um,
gosh, there's a, there's a city. I think how many times its soul change hands during the Korean war?
It was like several times, right? So, yeah, but it's a soul, soul change hands for four times.
Okay, it went back and forth, right? And so you think of X as being like soul during the Korean war.
Okay, because it's a social war, it's a digital war where blue and red tribe and actually just
to make that really explicit, um, this is a good visual, right? So this is from 2017 and the
interesting thing is it's the same on both Twitter and Facebook, right? Since from eight years ago,
you can see they labeled notes as blue and red based on, um, whether they had said, I'm voting for
Clinton or Trump, just parsing the text, right? And they looked at their connections and blue
people were connected to blues and reds were connected to reds. And the only large red media
outlet was Breitbart. And blue was over here. And the hill was one of the very few outlets at
both sides tend to link because it just gave neutral political news like so and so was running,
so and so results, you know, one neutral, truly neutral argument, right? And so here you could
actually see that this was a social war, right? And you know, I've made this point in the past
in 1861, like when it was in North versus South, we take for granted that the ideological and
the geographical coincided, right? The North was, you know, the union and the South had the slaves
and slavers legal here and illegal here and the geographical and ideological coincided, right?
But by 2016, the geographical and ideological did not coincide. You didn't have a clean
red states and blue states, very fractal. You do have, you know, red states and blue states do exist,
but it's a preponderance as opposed to something that's as clean as this. Now, to be clear,
it wasn't, you know, if you had, if you showed ideology here, it also looked more fractal,
but it was more distinct ideologically back then. And here, it's much more geographically
overlapping with me so far. Yep. Okay. But there is a domain where these two factions are completely
distinct and that is the domain of the cloud, right? So on the land, red and blue are higgledy-piggledy
right next to each other. They can't invade each other's territory, like what you're going to invade,
like, you know, the cities or the cornfields or something, you can't invade the lands. So instead,
the social war is fighting over the mines, invading the mines, right? Now, once you see this at, like,
you can actually understand a lot about the last 10 years, right? We've basically been in the middle
of this gigantic social war. And the goal was for blue, like, how do you win a social war against red?
Their goal, you're playing the game with Thela? No, I know the game, but I never played it.
It's like you flip tiles, you know, it's like, you've got black and white tiles and you
surround other tiles and you flip them from black to white or white to black, okay? And so,
essentially, the goal for blue was to win ideologically and flip every red node to blue.
Now, you can, now, one way to think about it is, you know how an ant colony, individual ants,
they don't actually know what they're doing, but the colony has an intelligence. So even if the
ants don't know what they're doing, the colony has an intelligence, right? This is same for, you know,
a flock of seagulls or a school of fish, right? There's colony intelligence that insects in
particular are like this, right? So once you start thinking about ideologies is like that, right?
Think of woke as, like, blue, right, or like radicalized blue. It's like, you know, laser eyes,
right? Like, basically, go broke, go woke. They lost all this money as the interesting
disruptor them. Blue laser eyes come online and they start going to their old religion because they
don't have the money anymore. So go back to the old civil rights rhetoric and so on. It's like,
basically when countries got blown up in, you know, the Middle East, other places, when countries
go on hard times, that's when fundamentalism returns, right? Because they don't have the economics
anymore. So their economics went away. Laser eyes glowing blue. So the eyes glow blue of these
sure-nose and they basically were like, okay, it's life or death for us. And they started going and
trying to capture as many institutions as possible in the social war. So that's why they were just
going after random seeming nodes and forcing, canceling them. They were forcing, remember how they
wanted Amazon to put BLM on it? So they did get Amazon to put BLM on some page. Like for a long
time, you'd load Google and it would have some BLM thing on there, right? You know what I'm talking
about, right? Yep. So everybody, you know, Brian Armstrong during, during the 2020, you know, BLM
rights, like people were like, trying to force them to say, Black Lives Matter on Twitter,
what was the point of that? It's like the Shahada in Islam, right? The point of that was to show
you're a convert to blue, right? To flip a red node blue because they can get, it's sort of like,
it's a check mark over your head to show you, they flip that node. Now that's part of blue tribe,
and now they can turn attention on the next one, right? And so all of the cancellation, all of
this censorship, all the de-platforming, all of the unbanking, all of the insane ideological
fervor, you can conceptualize as an attempt from blue to reunify red versus blue on blue terms
by turning every internet company into something that was paying tribute to blue versus worthless
DI jobs, and every red into somebody who is paying tribute to blue by essentially not just giving
up the presidency, but assuming the position, like for example, they want to defund the police,
they want to fund their NGOs, right? That's what it was all about. They wanted to redirect the budget
from, that's why there's like 200 homeless NGOs in San Francisco alone. The homeless industrial
complex set shows that the NGOs, as their budget rises, the homeless population rises with it.
They're basically paid to get people addicted to drugs. It's the Department of Dependency Department,
and so the point is that basically all of this stuff with defund the police to fund the NGOs,
all of that can be conceptualized as this broad social war of blue against red to flip all red
nodes blue, right? And what was our main weapon? Your racist, your sexist, your homophobic,
your this, your that, transog blah blah blah blah. And with this language, it was the same way that
that same language they could use to force you out of their institution because they'd fire you
for having any of, you know, being accused of any of these things. And they'd also say your
institution, they'd bust your borders and they would swarm you with unqualified hires or else
you'd be accused of this. So the same language they'd used to strengthen their borders and deport
reds and they'd used to bust your borders and import blues. You see what I'm saying, right?
It's actually because you're, you know, if you're a racist, you get fire from a blue organization
and you're a racist unless you hire blues. Okay. Now, of course, today we see they don't actually
care about brown people or black people, only blue people, right? Since more clear in 2025,
it's less clear, it's fine. Okay. So now coming back up the stack. So once we realize that it was
a social war, now we can actually understand why the journals want to kill you. Like basically,
you know how at various times in history, France and Germany have traded and France and Germany
have fought and France and Germany have traded and France and Germany have fought, we are in
wartime mode with the journals. So it is like extremely stupid for anybody to now let's go to
concrete brass tax. What should technologists do and what should we, you know, do specifically
do generally, right? So first, just at individual level, right?
Number one, go direct. Build your own distribution to avoid distortion. Okay. That is to say,
any content you have, it should be posted on your feeds. Why would you go and feed it to some
journal? You've got some scoop. You don't need them for distribution anymore. It's more obvious
that they need your content to build up their channel and they will distort it in the process
because, like, remember, they get credibility within other journals by being hostile to tech guys.
If they write a positive story, then it's like, well, you write out, you're a flack, you're
eroding a press release. Also, by the way, there's another point, which is conflict is interesting.
Right? Like any movie, if you're writing a screenplay and it's just somebody sitting on the grass
enjoying a fine sunny day, that's boring, right? But if a meteor hits, suddenly you've got attention,
right? So it works in a movie setting is not what works in real life, right?
So the journals want conflict. And so our concept of, hey, it's 10 gigs for Dropbox or whatever,
that might be helpful to the public, but it doesn't tell a story and they want a story. So they're
always going to take what you do and put it through some distorting lens to get to the other side
and they will get more page use at the expense of your company that you worked on so hard, right?
So number one, go direct. Number two, build your own distribution to avoid distortion. Now,
the thing about that is higher creators, there's two kinds of creators. There's those who are
at the storyline level. And you probably only need like one of those per company, you know, because
if you have too many very strong willed personalities in a company, like you can only have one
Steve Jobs in Apple, basically, right? However, you could have a lot of people assisting with production,
right, with making content with scaling that creator or what have you. So usually you're going to
have a founding creator. And I don't think it's 100% by the way, sometimes you can have, once you get
to a certain scale, it's good to have like some personalities like, you know, for example, actually
Jesse Pollock is doing a great job at base for Coinbase, right? And he's got his own distinctive style
that's complementary to Coinbase's style and so and so and so. So at a certain scale,
you can have multiple personalities that are driving certain product lines or what have you. And so
that's fine, right? But at least for the start of getting up to a build, you probably only want to have
sort of one storyline, one main creator, and you have a lot of production support behind them,
right? And that can really work. You can get very far with that. Video, images, all this kind of
stuff, right? So a, go direct. Be, build your own distribution to avoid distortion. And by the
one way of thinking about that, you, they called them the media because they mediate your experience
of reality. When you're putting anything through a media, it's like an Instagram filter that makes
you into a villain. Okay, why would you do that to yourself? You're basically, it's like paying
the journal with free content to make yourself look bad and get a permalink that's attacking you.
I remember our, our good friend, Flo Covello was launching his, what was a kind of remote office
startup during COVID and he gave TechCrunch the exclusive and they criticized it. They basically
didn't make it look good. And he's like, why would I give you my launch announcement? I'm here to,
you know, advertise my, my company. I gave it to you guys. I gave you the exclusive and you made
me look stupid. Like, why would I ever do that? And the fundamental thing is it's a business
development relationship. Literally think of it as TechCrunch is a corporation. Why are you giving
them something for free? Right? Literally, it's at. It's like that journal has a spreadsheet,
whether it's them or their manager who's looking at it and there's a row in the spreadsheet for
that URL and it's got the number of clicks and the number of conversions and the ad revenue
on that article. And that's the only thing they care about. That's the only thing they care about.
They do not, you know, it's not there. The valuation or health of your company. Obviously,
they don't care. They would literally light it on fire. That's what they did during BLM. They
would light your house. The journal would light your house on fire and sell tickets to the place.
Okay. That's their business model. Right? And so, obviously, it's like the dumbest possible deal.
I just don't, I mean, people still still do this stuff. And I'm like, I mean, Elon
Uncensored Twitter, you can post whatever you want, right? YouTube's Uncensored. Like,
everything's Uncensored now. Get good, right? I will say one thing. This is very important.
Over the last several years, when we've done like the tech and media kind of ecosystem,
there has been something that's worked and there's something that didn't work. What worked?
Individual led projects, right? Mike Sloan is Pirateriars. That has a real style to it.
TVPN, right? Which exists to, I think, make Ramp get more conversions. This is very funny, right?
It's very funny. Of course, Ramp is our main sponsor. They've got them on the hats. They've
NASCAR to it. It's funny. Ramp's a good product, by the way. And so, so TVPN, great, right? Cougan,
he stuck with it. He did a lot, you know? And other, obviously, all in has done very well, right?
Obviously, Elon has done very well. And I think, you know, I think, you know, you did the
Maz and now, you know, as you can see, I think that's right. But what I think has not done
as well is the things that are institutional. Because if it's too institutional, you're playing
it safe. And you're playing it safe. And there isn't any conflict. There isn't any opinion.
There isn't anything novel. It's focus grouped, right? Certain things benefit from averaging,
right? Like, you know, for example, the velocity of a plane or something like that,
you don't want large deviations. You want it to be within an envelope, you know? Right?
So there's certain kinds of phenomena where you want averaging. Opinions and DCs are usually not
like that, right? So one way of thinking about it is, you know, the entire 20th century was the
centralized century. And even the movement from the wide screen to the portrait size, you know,
like, like a phone is, you know, like nine by 16. The movement from wide screen to portrait size
is visually the movement from institutional to individual. Because a portrait, you know,
kind of think a tick-tock cell thing doesn't have room for a panoramic shot of a huge crowd. It's
for like a person standing there, right? So it's amazing that even the screen itself captures that
move from institutional to individual, right? And you see this also on X and other platforms,
like, you know, these journalists, I don't know what they were doing if they're faking numbers
or whatever, they had like 20 million followers or whatever, and they have three likes on their
tweets now, right? So something, you know, something happened there where either it was all fake or
there's just low engagement or just boring, but people just don't trust those institutions anymore,
right? So that's another really important lesson. Individual over institutional. If you're
doing social media, it should be the amplified voice of your founding creator, right? And
the founding creator is as important as a founding engineer, because a founding engineer is
implementation, but the founding creator is the distribution, right? The founding engineer is the
how, but the founding creator is the why. Because a founding creator has a community that they're tapped
into, and they're saying, why should this product exist, right? And so you can often start by
understanding your community and building a product for them, and then hiring the engineer,
you know, that it's actually like a third kind of person, right? Normally, it's been like,
there's like the engineering founder and there's like the business founder. This is like the content
founder, right? And actually, this is where, you know, Carlson and, and, and, and Altman have
observed, where are the Gen Z, where are the younger founders or not in tech? They're in content.
Right? Because actually, that's where extreme leverage is. That's the Mr. Beast. That's the,
the guy who actually looks kind of like you, Aiden Ross, kind of looks like you, right?
A little bit, yeah. A little bit, right? Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, some of some of the younger
guys are, are there, right? Speed, you know, I show speed is like that, right? And they're very
talented at what they do. And that's actually, it's just not something that we thought of as a thing,
you know, because like, you know, there's still like the startup kind of thing, but that's actually
now a, I shouldn't say it's a game for 30 and 40 some things, but millennials are good at startups,
and we're still good at startups, and, and we still are, you know, partners doing a new thing,
Altman doing a thing, you know, obviously not a new thing, but you know, like, like, we keep doing
stuff, right? But the 20 some things are often very good at content and content is actually upstream
of product. There's, there's a room for a lot of collaboration there potentially where they're
doing the marketing. It's kind of like beats by Dre, but you start with Dre rather than Apple,
you know, right? I'm not saying anything people don't know, but right now those have been, I think,
doing things that are relatively low tech, like Mr. Beast Feastables or T-shirts or stuff like that.
Brian Johnson, I think with Blueprints, starting to get higher tech, where you start with the
creator, and then ideally, you can distribute, like, quantified self-suff through that. If that
makes any sense, right? Human could also do something like this, we said to get into that area.
Any biotech company, genomics company, secrecy company could do deals with human, for example,
for distribution, right? Okay. So this, by the way, is starting to make the case for why, like,
don't outsource your creation. Are you outsourcing your engineering? Don't outsource your creating.
Right? Don't outsource your content. Contents as key as code. Content happens in the house,
right? Content, you have to sweat over it, and actually, so for example, here's a few things that,
I'm like half implementing, partially implementing, but I actually, or I am implementing,
but I want to implement more, right? And this is kind of the thing you want. I've see, you know,
come to Asixx or come to network school, come to NS.com, come to network school, come and work with
us, you know, but for example, you know, GitHub allows a bunch of people to contribute to code at
the same time. We take that for granted. How do you get a bunch of people to contribute to content
at the same time? Something like frame.io is pretty good, you know, frame.io. You can put all
these clips in there, all these images in there, and then you have something for people to work with,
or a cap cut, web interface, right? You can log into that and just basically load stuff in there,
and you have a few accounts that are shared among, you know, team members, right? So now you
actually have something where creation was a single player app. You start making it a multiplayer app,
and now, you know, internet connections are good enough that you can do versioning on big files,
and you know, reviews of big files, and so on and so forth. Start thinking about your content
base like your code base, okay? And obviously, you know, AI is a big part of that, though it's not
the only thing, since I think AI is, you know, any new tool, people use the tool and they overuse
the tool, and you bring it back and you're like, okay, it's a percentage of my thing, but it's not
everything, right? Like if we did this whole podcast as AI, and we had like computer-generated us,
it wouldn't be as interesting or would have you, right? Because it's generic, AI is necessarily
it's almost like a search engine, it pulls like the, it's funny, I was saying this our day.
Midwit writing used to be woke, now all Midwit writing is AI, like it's not this, it's that, right?
So it's like a super intelligence yet midwit, right? But that's because it's building the
average from the whole interest. It's useful when you prompt it. Anyway, point is, so that's another
piece on media is, so build your own distribution to avoid distortion, go direct, if you have something
to say, higher creators, and the problem is, this is another big piece of it. Like a lot of people,
you know how the journalists get them, is they get them on ego, okay? So it's actually very similar
to like the CIA, do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, exactly, see most people can understand this,
like much of what the NYT and what these guys do, and they're so much weaker than they used to be,
like so, so, so much weaker, thank God, they've lost the center, right? They've lost much of,
you know, what what happened is they just piled up the subscriptions, and they got all the wine
moms and lost the Anderson. Amazing trade for us. Oh my God, they lost Glenn Greenwald, they lost
Mark Anderson, they lost Nate Silver, they lost Barry Weiss, right? I mean, amazing trade for
us, right? Like for the center, you know, because they actually got tech envy, and they just
optimized the money, and they lost actually all influence and power over the center. Thank God,
right? Fine, you know, and actually, you know, that's a good trade, all the ones who are not haters
eventually leave. Let's say when, when dealing with them, is there like a private, a for-profit
CIA or FBI, should I explain this point? Actually, especially, see, okay, so the thing is most people
think, from, again, remember that Paul Graham think about, you know, you learn from the movies
of Jurassic Barbara, so most people think that what the CIA does is like assassination, but a lot of
what it does is actually character assassination. It plants stories, isn't that much cleaner to just
have somebody, you know, plant a story, and then they're, you know, discredited, and that's so much
cleaner than bullets and blood and so and so forth, right? In fact, they did this in East Germany as
well. By the Wikipedia is actually just as bad as the media because Wikipedia, it's garbage and
garbage out. What happens is you can only cite articles from legacy media, you can't cite social media
directly, so it could be a rehash. So anything that's contemporary, anything that's political,
they're really terrible, nevertheless, they've some articles from when they didn't get corrupted.
So, a psychological warfare used by the Ministry of Security, it served to combat alleged
through covert means. Basically, Zerzetsang was because the communists were also fighting a similar
social war. They had conservatives, they had libertarians, they had non-communists on their
territory, they didn't want to kill them, they wanted to convert them, just like the blues flipping
the reds to convert to blue, right? It was, you know, they were targeted to stop activities of
political dissent and cultural incorrectness, right? And one of those kinds of things they did,
right? Like, they would do things like go and mess up your sock drawer to make you think you're
insane or tell people you're having an affair, right? So it's like subvert and undermine an opponent,
right? So, disrupt the target's private life, so I'm able to continue their hostile negative
activities toward the state. This is what they did to Luke Farrater just now. Exactly this. The
aim was to disrupt the target's private or family life so they're unable to continue their hostile
negative activities toward the state. Do you see that? What they're mad is that Luke, they didn't care
when Luke was just analyzing some old, you know, museum pieces or whatever, right? But once they're
going after the state, when does going after state, that's their bread, right? That's their power
center. That's their golem, the FTC investigated this after our articles, right? So anything that's
upstream of that, they don't want us to be upstream of that. They want to be upstream of that.
Makes sense? So there's that song, you know, like the communists and the journalists are the same,
but I repeat myself, right? You know, and the reason, by the way, I say that is all, you know,
I may have mentioned this, but like John Reed, Walter Duranty, Herbert Matthews, like David
Halliburstam, Edgar Snow, just take all those names and those are all the journalists who did
the PR for the communists, like it's literally the reason that Castro's in power, you know, for
example, there's this book, The Man Who Created Fidell, right? The Man Who Invented Fidell,
Castro, Cuba and Herbert Matthews of the New York Times. You see that one, right? Or here's another
one, which is Duranty, Ukraine, Amazon, like basically Stalin's Apologist. Isn't that amazing?
Stalin's Apologist, worked at the New York Times, Castro's Apologist, worked at the New York Times,
crazy stuff. Actually, there's another one, Perfect Spy, right? Which is the Vietnam one, right?
The incredible story of a double life of Phomzwan on a Time Magazine reporter in Vietnamese
Communist Asian. Isn't that interesting? See, when I say journalists and communists, but I
repeat myself, I'm like being completely literal. We just pulled up three books in 30 seconds
that were about journalist communists. So Dylan Matthews from Voxy talking about the Luke
Faradar argument. He says the negative reaction to this is wild. If you join the government and your
primary legacy is helping to kill millions of people through aid cuts, you can handle them
criticism. If you can live with yourself. The Salzburg Primary Legacy is killing, not just
not like through aid cuts. The Salzburg Primary Legacy is killing millions of Ukrainians.
Where's their criticism, huh? Again, Dylan Matthews is too much of a coward to do that, right?
Like, you know, these people, go ahead. The logic is just insane. It's claiming that by
Dylan Matthews not giving all of his money to aid, he's killing people or by not making more money,
he's killing people. I mean, just to accuse his 23-year-old of killing millions of people.
One of the things about what they're doing here, they're like with the hall de mor,
there's actually a very clear cut case where Duranty wrote 13 articles that basically said,
Stalin wasn't liquidating the Ukrainians. He just meant it metaphorically. They're literally
covering up like a murder and progress, okay? So that was like a very clear cut case. Here,
you're talking about, okay, this is the Fee the Pigeon Society argument, by the way, right?
Like, essentially, as a number of the population grows as dependent, any cut to budget whatsoever
for the blues is equated with murdering their dependents. And they probably believe that, right?
So it grows to the sky and everybody gets arms that, of course, the blues get nice paid
non-profit jobs out of, right? And of course, you have more and more depend. And by the way,
guess what? He's absolutely completely wrong here as well. You know why? Go to Easterly and Levine.
Easterly and Levine said, stop the aid, right? Why? Because all the aid is used for these warlords
in Africa, right? Actually, there's something where in Nigeria, there's a business plan competition
that was the most successful quote aid project ever because they're making businesses. Like,
the thing is, I saw this myself in India, guys like these effective altruists or these guys,
they don't want peers. They want ponds, right? Brown people in India, like we're starving in the 80s
or whatever. And they were ponds of these NGOs who sent the aid. Now, India doesn't need aid.
India is actually number three in unicorns. It's landing on the dark side of the moon. I'm not
saying everything is perfect, but it's rising for it. So the fundamental premise of his point that
aid helps is incorrect. Aid actually hurts because aid, it's like, you know, it's kind of like
testosterone supplementation and biosynthetic pathway. If somebody takes too much of an exogenous
hormone, it cuts off their natural production, right? Like, basically if people take too much
of the way steroids, you know, it can cut off your natural hormonal production. You have to get
it exactly right. The actual charity is investment. This is actually a deep point, should I
explain this point? Right? So imagine you've got two, quote, rich guys, okay? And one of them is
like, you know, Soros or, you know, USAID, it's kind of like a rich guy, it's a recent solution,
or somebody who's handing out aid, okay? Grant, seeming grants. And another person is an investor.
So the, for the people who are queuing up to write those grants to seek aid, okay?
They are making themselves as sympathetic or as pathetic as possible. And in the limit,
it's like the movie Slumdog Millionaire, right? Where you see, you know, it's dramatized, but,
you know, the limbs of the, the kid are cut off to make them more sympathetic. It's almost like
learned or caused helplessness to try to present a, to either become, to pretend to or become
as helpless and pathetic and sympathetic as possible. So you get the maximum amount of money. You
win the competition for being the biggest loser, in a sense, the most the biggest victim, right?
That's what openness is, right? By contrast, you think about our culture in tech and VC, right?
When we respect more than the details, else is strength, right? Essentially, you come to us,
you come to us for a check. And when we respect the most, in a sense, is if we didn't put a check
in you, but you still win and you, you raised from someone else or you do it on your own,
you bootstrap, and then a year later, we're like, I respect you, I was wrong, you were strong,
enough on your own. And, you know, the bad, not bad way, one way of talking about this is like,
fake it till you make it, but another way of putting it is, rather than the Slumdog Millionaire,
people chopping off their limbs and thinking about how depressed and pathetic they are to compete
for grants and aid. Instead, imagine a bunch of people who are all running a race, like a,
a mile or whatever, right? They're running a mile and 20 people compete, only one wins, but the
other 19 at least got to work out, right? So everybody who's in the process of trying to raise
venture or, you know, not that you have to raise money, obviously, you can, you can just totally
bootstrap it yourself now. It's the single person startup as much easier than it's been. But
anybody who's in that process becomes stronger as a consequence of it because you, you know,
you constantly want to keep giving updates to the investor on all the stuff you're shipping.
And that means, like, sometimes the easiest way to do that is to actually just ship, I mean,
most of the time these wait, right? So in the process of proving yourself to others, you prove
yourself to yourself, right? So that's why a small amount of capital when 20 people compete for it,
strengthen the whole ecosystem, but a small amount of aid when 20 people compete for it,
weakens the entire ecosystem. So, and another way of putting this also is, like, take, you know,
these, these wokes, you know, who purport to believe in equality, okay? The Soros types or whatever.
Are they walking down the street? And they're saying, oh, here's some guy in the street. I'm
going to give them half my fortune. Now we've achieved equality. Are they going to knock it down? So
what, let's say they've got a billion dollars, are they going to find like a 100,000 people and
each give them a thousand dollars or 10,000 dollars? So they've all got 10,000 dollars in their
down to 10,000 dollars, they're all equal. It's within their power to do so. They could literally
hit a button to do so. If they actually believe in equality, they could instantly achieve a quality
right now, okay? And indeed, I actually do believe in registration for every self-proclaimed
socialist, just for them to take their fortunes and redistribute them, opt in to socialism,
we'll take all their money, all the wokes, right, redistribute it. Yeah, exactly. That's right.
Like, we, we basically opt in to that, right? What they actually want, of course, is to take your
money and do something with it. But like, you take them at their word, they actually believe in
equality. What they mean by equality, by the way, is equality between themselves and the people
that are looking up at, they're not thinking about all the people who they're wealthier than or
whatever in that sense, right? Okay, fine. Point is, and in a way of putting it is, if somebody's
walking on the street and they see somebody and they're down their luck, they might give them a
dollar or 10 dollars. They're not going to give them half their salary. So charity decelerates.
The more somebody rises, the less sympathetic and pathetic they are. And in fact, people have
talked about like how once somebody gets out of the total underclass into the working poor,
they actually sometimes make less money from all the grants and stuff because all those cut-offs
and sounds are considered self-sufficient, right? So it's like, you actually can earn your way
into a local valley before you earn your way out of it. Okay, it's a, it's a disincentive to work.
Okay. On the other side of things, for example, take Teal and, and Zuck, this is a very famous
example. There's many more like this. Zuck started out much in a sense poorer than Teal. Teal put
in 500K. Zuck is down much richer than Teal. But Teal also became much richer in the conspense.
Right? So that's an example of investment actually achieves redistribution of fortunes or creation
of fortunes or greater equality in a way that charity never would. Right? So capitalism is the
ultimate socialism. And the same way like the phones that got to everybody in the world, the
billions of phones, capitalism did that. Aid didn't do that, right? You know, like all this USAID
stuff is just like it's aiding blue NGOs. What he's actually mad about, go ahead.
You know, there's laughing at the truth of it. That's the truth of it, right? So the fundamental
premise of his point is exactly wrong. So, you know, you're taking away their pets, you're taking
away their ponds, you're taking away their, you know, like reason for existing. And of course,
they'll pathologize that, right? But actually they're doing harm to them, right? They're not helping
them. Helping is investment. I mean, it obviously goes to the old saw of like teacher man to fish,
you know, versus give a man a fish, right? But give a man a thousand fish forever. They become
completely dependent. And that's actually the goal of it. Really, what's happening is the cut off
of USAID is rolling up blue empire. So it's killing the blue business model. That's what they're
mad about Luke. Okay, keep going. Yeah. Well, I think going back to Luke, what's our, what's our advice
to him or how do you sort of react to the situation? Which, yeah, what should he say now? I don't know
how they got that photo of him. Did he sit for that photo? No, I don't think so. Yeah, so
point is I think overall he didn't talk to journals, which is good. Look, Luke will be fine.
Why will it be fine? Because his tribe supports him, right? And the journals ability to impact
somebody's with that said, the reason they do this stuff now is, and this is unfortunate part,
they do this stuff. And they post this like take this Dylan thing, like by his logic, oh,
then someone would be justified in Luigi type stuff, right? This is, this is really the very
dangerous thing about what these journals are doing. They're trying to essentially form an hatred
against tech guys. Well, I mean, what have we done besides make things cheaper, faster,
better? Right? Like, wow, I can now communicate with anybody anywhere, anytime, for no money.
I can find all the rules of information on my fingertips. I can do math and computer science.
I can do simulations. We can launch rockets. We've got electric cars. That, oh, we're the bad guys,
right? First of the people who are just like stalking and spamming everybody all the time, right?
So, so the point, so the first thing is just to have incredibly strong moral bedrock frame,
understand that everything the journals are doing is projection. There's a decision rule.
Don't take the bait. The journals only get traffic for their articles when they get rage views
from us. And guess what? They got 700k views or whatever for this tweet. And they got conversions
because they sold ads, right? You know, and so that's a, that's a dub for them in a sense, right?
I mean, look, it's not, it's not like a total dub because it's certainly not getting very fired
or anything like that. So it's much less of a dub, but it's some kind of dub. The most valid,
so okay, a while ago, there was some journal who was like doing some like converse stories or
like that. And they put people on a tech guy for like 15 months or something. And he just completely
ignored the entire thing. And it got no clicks and it got no views or anything. The opposite of,
you know, love isn't hate. It's indifference, right? The fact that like, I don't know what we're putting
it is, um, we have to, so we've built up much of this supply chain, but not all of it, right? So
we have replaced the most important thing is we've gotten X and we've de-platform. We've,
we have reestablished control over the platform because they had gone deep into our territory
and actually had, you know, crazy blue stuff at, at, and some of our Citadel's, right? Like our
VC firms. So one of the things they were doing is they're trying to target the stuff that's upstream,
the platforms, the venture capitalist and so on to try to hit the, you know, why they go after Uber,
right? They didn't want to know the trillion dollar company, certainly not in the libertarian one.
Why they go after VCs? They're the ones distributing capital. If they go after these Nexus points,
these critical nodes, they could try to hit those if you're in a social war. It's like taking a,
a capital city or a town. These are important Nexus points, right? You don't want to go after a desert.
You go after Nexus points, right? So they're deep in our territory. So now we took back the platform.
That's good. And we've got actually we're flanking mainstream media with tweets and podcasts, right?
Ultra short form and ultra long form content where they don't have as much establishment oomph,
right? We figured out the formula that works, which is individual over institutional.
Now the next step, and this is the big, the big story for the next five years or so,
the ledger of record, right? Ultimately, you can't be a critic. You have to be a constructive critic,
right? Like, all right, you can't be like, you know, Ron Paul said end the fed and Satoshi implemented
Bitcoin, right? So you have the criticism, then you have the construction. So we actually have to
build something better. We have to build internet first media, right? So that is, you know,
that whole talk I gave on the ledger of record. So the ledger of record. And that by the way,
that talk was originally from like 2020. And I actually feel pretty good about that essentially
predicting that GPT three would be able to summer, the next version of it would be able to
summarize things. It happened faster than I thought, but like I think the projection was correct,
right? And the fundamental premise is, if you think about a sports article, it's essentially,
now we'd use it and I phrased it slightly differently then, but it's essentially a wrapper around
a box score, or you take a financial article, it's essentially a wrapper around stock ticker symbols,
and you take a political article and it's a wrapper around tweets. That's a raw feed. It's the
numbers that underpin the letters, right? So now, if you think about what a blockchain is,
it's a cryptographically verifiable feed. That's in a sense what Bitcoin is, right? What a blockchain
is, it's a stream of events similar to Twitter or any other event-based feed, except it's got
much harder cryptographically verifiable guarantees. Proof of what, when and where, right? Or proof of
what when and who, what is the hash when it's a timestamp, who is the digital signature? You can
also do like proof of location, proof of where, and other kinds of proofs, right? So that stream of
cryptographic proof is like a better Twitter in that sense, a cryptographically verifiable Twitter.
Then you have AI referencing that to create articles, right? That's the that's a high level
concept ledger of record that replaces the paper record. We have to play to win, and so we have to
essentially realize that that is the center of the whole thing, right? Truth. And actually,
we have a better format truth. You know what that is? It's a form that is native to us.
Crypto. Yes. And specifically, there's a there is a good book actually by a reformed
journal or, you know, to somewhat reformed journals. These are like the ones who are not here,
right? They're like some of them I assume are good people, as they said, you know?
So the, no, actually, big name case, they're okay. But the truth machine, the blockchain,
the future, I think this is like seven years ago. And the thing is this just basically puts in
book form a concept that existed for a long time. So I've just got a citation for the concept,
right? So essentially, the point is that Bitcoin is decentralized cryptographic truth. Like,
essentially, the whole thing about Bitcoin that's so hard is how do you get global consensus on
who owns what BTC? And we have something now where whether you're a Democrat or Republican,
Japanese or Chinese, Indian or Pakistani, everybody agrees on the state of the Bitcoin
blockchain. They have global consensus on this thing, which is worth trillions of dollars.
People who fight wars over billions of dollars, millions of dollars, they kill people are
a thousand dollars sometimes. So to have global consensus on this with no police men or no
military backing it, right? Like, you know, that's saying like how many divisions has the
Pope, which Stalin would say, right? How many long divisions has the New York Times, right?
They don't have any, right? Bitcoin has, you know, right? So we actually have truth on our
side, a more powerful form of decentralized cryptographic truth. It's not headquartered in
downtown Manhattan. It's on the internet, right? Let me wait for a second. It's all sounds
compelling, but I also just want to celebrate our, you know, right now we have John Cougan and
Mike Salana and us and lots of other folks doing such a great work without without sort of the
crypto elements. And so why is that, why is that necessary? Like what's, what's, yes, great
question. So what we're doing with all the commentary is necessary, but not sufficient, right?
We also need, because commentary is, it's humorous, it's opinion, right? We need reporting,
we need news. You need reporting exactly. That's right. So commentary and summarization,
right, is over here, but news is the update. Now, the thing is Twitter is obviously a feed of raw
facts that people are putting out there in decentralized way. Bitcoin increases that because it actually
says once you can get consensus on who owns what BTC, you can also get consensus on who owns what
stocks, what bonds, what Ethereum, smart contracts. And actually, as I, as I, you know, I did an article
that day, all property becomes cryptography that we can do that in a different, a different, you
know, session, you basically have consensus on who owns what property. So all valuable things you
can get cryptographic consensus on, right? And, you know, chain link and stuff like that, they've
built essentially armored cars for information, sending it up and down to the blockchain,
polymarket armored cars for information, where information on the internet that's commercially
valuable can be protected by cryptography and set there. So, so let's take, let's take the case of,
you know, like, you know, pirate wires and TPN, that's great. But let's say there's some dispute
over whether a photo is real or not, right? Like a great example is the Atlantic published this
crazy piece calling for invading Brazil because they saw a photo of the Brazilian fires, okay?
And it's like, you know, here, it's like this crazy piece. That was the photo not real? Yes, exactly,
right? That's a very clear example, okay? The Amazon fires are more dangerous to WMD, okay?
This is a great example of when I said, they'll literally kill you for clicks, right? This was
something they're calling for the invasion of Brazil on this basis, right? Because they're like,
oh, you know, the Amazon fires are burning. And it was all on the basis of a fake photo that
actually Macron had tweeted out, which turned out to be a photo that was taken by a journalist
who had died, photojournalists who died years ago. So it's from like some stock. So there was a time
stamp that showed that that photo existed many years ago, right? So it wasn't of a current event,
okay? And so is that amazing, right? That's something where etiology, right, crypto, in a sense,
cryptographic, why? Because you load the website, you see that it's HTPS, right? That means there's
actually a cryptographic authentication that it's like getty images or wherever it was. It was basically
get some stock photo thing as we could see the old time stamp. You might hit archive that is,
right? So you have implicit cryptographic verification of the timestamp of that image that was going
to be used to cause a war, right? So that's a concrete example of why control over truth is so
important to them. Why did they put up the billboards there? Because once you determine what is true
in false, like did Russia, you know, collude with Trump, right? No, it's all fake, right? It took a
massive court process to adjudicate that and forcing the court system wasn't corrupted enough that,
you know, that like that went through. But the New York Times collect all these
polyesteries for this for basically false information, right? One way that's interesting though,
and this actually helps give some insight into it. There's a there's a there's a tech person who's
a lib, okay? Who I won't name. But basically during the whole investigate thing said, oh yeah,
I know this is just as good as like this game of thrones or something. And I realized, oh wow,
remember that Paul Graham think about the movies? These people were treating this as if it was like
an entertainment show with Trump as a villain with the Times or with any legacy media. And this is
very obvious say, but you know, it was obvious in the past. You can predict what they're going to
say about somebody before they say it. They have very low information content on each thing,
right? It's like Trump bad, you know, blue America good. And it's like, it's like a cast of
characters almost like Seinfeld, or the same cast of characters, the good guy and bad guy appears
on the page. And you could just auto do it, right? In fact, did I show you the robo journal from three
years ago? No, I don't remember. Oh yeah. So this was a bounty. I just put up a prize I put up
where as soon as AI came out and we can do a lot more with this, by the way, but I'll show you this.
So I put out a call to use AI to generate NYT tier clickbait from tweets. Remember my thing?
So yeah, the theoretical article was in 2020, or I'm like, you know what? We could have a feed
of data and all of these journals are just a wrapper around that feed. And the reason I knew GPT-3
might get there is there's a company called Narrative Science actually. Have you ever seen them?
No. So Narrative Science, it went bust. It was a good company just a little too early, okay?
So this was a few years before the chat GPT moment, okay? And Narrative Science, what it did,
which was the time was really cool, is it took your financial reports, right? And it would say like,
you know, revenue was high in the Northeastern segment, 65K, four years, you know, so it would
basically generate a narrative from your raw data. So it's like a readable narrative. Make sense?
Yep. So because they saw that I knew that it was probably possible as this technology advanced
to take raw feeds of data and summarize them in essentially story form, right? Let me so far?
Yep. Okay. So that was the kind of, you know, theory in 2020. And then the practice by 2022 was once
the chat GPT came out, right? Let me find the... So I put out a call to you say I had to generate
NYT-T or clickbait from tweets. One brave engineer answered a call student who learned how to code
and wrap it, starting to say, his app takes a tweet generation article, it's already in the ballpark.
And you can see from this video the GPT times, right? You see this, right?
Yep. Okay, so let me just, I'll remind this, okay? So here it takes the Elon thing, right?
Elon tweet, it goes here, paste it in, it churns a little bit, okay? It calculates.
And he's showing all the other articles he'd look at in the generative of the aesthetics.
It looks like NYT, right? Yes, so good, oh my god.
All right, this was three years ago. We can do so much more with this. All right, now,
boom, putting the cocaine back in Coca-Cola. And look, it looks exactly like NYT or clickbait, right?
No journal, only robo. Okay, no journal, only crypto, because we can also have these be,
look, see there's a code and so and so forth. You know, there's a saying system administrators have,
you know, be careful while replacing with a very tiny shell script. We can just automate,
right? It's automate and completely obviate. And the thing is actually all the journals have
these unions where they're against AI, they're against AI, they're against AI. This is by the way
similar to, I think the US imposing tariffs or the red American imposing tariffs on China,
it's like blue American imposing tariffs on AI. I don't think it's going to work. But basically,
blue American imposing tariffs on AI is a protectionist, late breaking thing where they think,
okay, we can protect our revenue from this. And, you know, like, there won't be any AI-based
disruptors of us, but there will be. And they're going to be interesting at first because there's a
lot of English speakers online and most of them don't live in the US. And so there's a lot talent
online. And so one piece of this is what I just showed. And the crucial thing about that is
those stories there can have all the backlinks and citations, right? So they show the raw tweets
that are underpinning it. And if you click, you can just change the style. I want this conservative,
I want this liberal, I want this this. You essentially now have turned all of the massaging and
rustle conjugation, you know, the rustle conjugation concept, right? Like, you know,
I dox, you leak, but the New York Times investigates, right? Like, I sweat, you perspire, but she glows,
right? Okay. So, rustle conjugation is, you're, you know, you're doing a bad thing, but I'm doing
a good thing. Like, you know, Zuckerberg has, you know, they're a great one, you know, they attack
Zuck for having dual-class stock. You know, here's, here's just to show you how just evil these
guys are. You can't fire Mark Zuckerberg's kids. That's a problem with tech companies using dual-class
stock schemes, right? So it's all like, you know, presents are not kings, right? So now this,
you know, maybe you'd believe this argument on its own, okay? But the next day, what do they do?
Or the previous article, it's like, how punch protected the times, right? So here,
the solution was to give that, so dual-class is good when they do it, and it's bad when tech doesn't.
Right? Now, the thing is, you have to have a long context window. Like, I have a long context
window, because I remember this article from 2012, and I remember this one from 2019, right? So you
have to have a long context window. And until recently, I didn't know how to like, show somebody
else to find all these internal contradictions. But guess what? AI can do that. AI can do that.
AI can find every internal contradiction than NYT ever, okay? And so you could just have them
NYT versus NYT, like, you know, they're enslaving people, and then they're pretending they're on the
side, you know, like, there's so many things like that, right? The Ukrainian pro and con, right?
Okay, so coming back to your point, we need to have a stronger form of truth,
because if we don't have that, then you're just doing, you're essentially accepting their premise
that this event happened, right? Right. And I guess what I'm curious is, yeah, but the
crypto stuff I buy, but even before that, we haven't been able, we've been able to build commentary,
but we haven't, to your point, had enough sort of protect reporters or, or, or, or, or. So the
ecosystem had to be there, right? The ecosystem has to be there. Things had to work. Block space had
to get there. AI had to get there. Like, we needed the, the field clear for what we're going to do,
which is decentralized cryptographic truth, right? Decentralized cryptographic truth, where it's free.
It's verifiable on your computer, right? That's the thing about the Bitcoin blockchain you can
verify. Now, one of the things I should be more clear about exactly what I mean by true or whatever.
When a statement is posted on chain, what you can verify is the metadata, right? You can say,
it is very hard to falsify the time at which this was posted. It's very hard to falsify the hash
because of properties of cryptographic hashes. And it's very hard to falsify the digital signature
of what entity posted it, right? Each of those three things has certain cryptographic guarantees
that I can get into why they're hard, but they're hard to falsify that. That doesn't mean that
it could be an AI image that you posted on chain. But it would have been hard to five years later
to say that that AI image never existed before when I can see proof. It's like the Brazilian
Fires photo was a great example of that, right? Another example, in a Chinese court actually,
blockchain evidence was used to show that someone had a patent that was invalid because
somebody had posted something very similar to it many years ago. So it could use the hash to show
they had priority. Does that make sense? Right? So there's enough stuff that we've done in crypto
with proof of location, proof of this, proof of that, proof of solvency. There's many kinds of
attestations and proofs that you can put on chain that are pretty hard to fake. That is a
fundamentally new set of primitives that journals aren't equipped to deal with because we're talking
about math, right? And they can't do math. You know, they're anti-selective. If they can do math,
they'd be in tech usually, right? And so, but math is a universal property of humans. You don't
need a subscription to the New York Times to do math. I don't need to pay Salisberger to do math,
right? Someone in India, someone in the Philippines, someone in the South, someone in the North,
wherever you can do math. You don't have to subscribe here for the truth, right? Like the truth is
actually everybody's thing, right? Everybody should have access to the truth. So it gets a very
fundamental thing where tech guys are sensing there's something here, but ultimately the network has
to supplant the state as the form of truth. That's what Bitcoin represents, the truth machine,
and it gives a set of primitives, as I mentioned, the who, the what, the when, and then with other
things, we can send that to the where that we can actually have a feed of facts. So once you have the
root feed of facts and think of it as like Twitter, but with decentralized cryptographic verification,
that's one way of thinking about it, right? Like imagine you have a bunch of checks,
sort of like community notes, but a bunch of check marks at the bottom, like a continuous
integration with GitHub, right? Where you have a bunch of checkers green or red with the
site is deploying properly, your bunch of assertions on it, think of it as trugal, right? It's like
Google, but for truths, and you just run every assert and all these models are saying whether
something is true or not, right? And there's some computation there, but if it's valuable enough,
you know, I should put out a prize just for this, by the way, you know what? Actually,
at NS.com, we'll put out a prize, good NS.com, process your earn, actually, we'll put that up on
screen. I'll send that link to you right after this. I'll put out a prize for decentralized
cryptographic truth and forecaster, right? Where essentially you can maybe pay a little bit of
crypto for model evaluations to just fact check something, sort of like ActRock do this,
but I think a better way of doing it is to have multiple models do it, give like the premises,
give the backlinks and so on and so forth. And then eventually those things should be on
chain where it links to. And by the way, you know, who agrees with me somewhat, I think,
on this is Salana, where he's like, we need to do more reporting, not just commentary and so on.
Totally. And a good version of that is Nick Carter's work on operation choke point, right?
So that's a great example of something which is reporting, and not just summary,
right? Not just commentary. Another example of this, and what's interesting, by the way, is
notice that our first party testimony, see, when we give first party testimony in aggregate,
that's actually reporting. So we're doing things like, you know how like someone who has like raw
talent in basketball or football or something can do things and they don't necessarily have great
form, but they can just somehow get it done with just raw athletic talent there. There's a lot of
things we're doing that are good that are done on raw like intuition because when you have a bunch
of people who are posting on X and not talking to journalists, then the quotes get pulled because
you know, people would use to say like, I'm canceling my subscription. And that was always fake and
stupid, right? Because who cares? They've got a million subscribers. That doesn't do anything,
really, except on moss. See, they can get another subscriber, but they can't get another quarter,
right? They can't get another supplier of quotes, right? Because there's only one A6 and C. There's
only one Elon. What is Elon? When you email like PR Tesla or something, it just replies back with
a poop emoji. What do you reply back to Washington Post? He's like, you know, send my regards to your
puppet master, right? Because he knows, right? He knows that basically like that they won't
criticize their boss on the yours, right? So we did this thing intuitively by freezing them out,
of course, not talking to them and posting that stuff ourselves. Now they're just reduced to
bloggers. Now they're not sourced. See, that's another thing, by the way, like an important concept
is like, how did the good journalists operate? You'll see some of them. They are almost like a CIA
station chief. They'll post in their Twitter for tips, email, you know, message me at signal
this side and the other, right? They're literally saying, it's like a CIA bureau chief who's set up
their office there in this country. And like some weak country can't do anything about that,
right? It's like a KGB officer who's there in the country and they can't be deported or because
they're like some embassy rights, right? So they're like spying on Facebook. They're spying on
meta. They're trying to solicit leaks. And why do people leak at these companies? If they leak at
these companies, it's for the same reasons, you know, I think it's like M-I-C-E, you know, that is
in the CIA. Money, ideology, compromise, and ego, right? So why do people leak to journals? Why do
people talk to journals? Sometimes it's money where there's like, you know, for example, at Uber,
like the VCs there wanted money and Travis didn't want to sell or IPO. So that's why they did it,
part. Ideology, why? Because sometimes they're far left within an organization and they want to
attack that organization. Compromise. Well, that's interesting. That's often, sometimes the
journal will have something on somebody and they'll say, I won't print this if you give something
else. That's on economic transaction, but that's a very, you know, dastardly thing. So it's like,
yeah, don't talk to journals. Everybody what happens is the NYT or WSH or whatever they'll message
you and they'll put on their nicest kind of thing. They're taught to flatter and sympathize
in the email. You know what it's like? Actually, you know, it's exactly like our SDRs.
Our sales development guys, our sales guys, right? They send out emails that are really crafted,
cold email, blah, blah, blah, things, right? To make the sale. And it's a completely calculated
thing, okay? Go and look at, I don't know, Mark Cranny stuff on sales. If you need a filter and
analogy to understand the journals, the journals are sending you sales emails. The difference is
they're scam sales emails. It's like a Nigerian, you know, whatever, you know, it's like a scam
or even, right? So at least when we're doing enterprise sales, maybe it's an aggressive sale at
times or something, but the product has to work. They can cancel the subscription or whatever.
It's not like, ha ha, you bought the product. Now we got malware in your property. You're going
to destroy your company. That's actually what the journal sales emails like, okay? So there's
an analogy. You can only go so far, right? And the point being that the ego part, MICE,
just like the CIA, the beer chief, people will do it to get their name in the press. They'll do
it because they think, oh, it'll work for me. I'll be the one. I can charm them. Everybody has to,
you know, learn this lesson somehow, right? But I do want to call out that there are some,
you know, we had named some of them, but there's some other new media folks who are sub-stackers,
et cetera, who are doing journalism, but are not the same journal. Okay. So now let me get to
very, very, very, very, very important point. Okay? Many words have been corrupted in a certain
way. So when I say journalism, I mean blue journalism. Okay? Because if they, if you were to ask
some journal, is Ben Shapiro a journalist? They'd say, no, of course not, right? If they say,
if you ask them, is, I don't know, is a Nate Silver-Silver journalist, is Glenn Greenwald-Silver
journalist? Is, you know, they'd say, wait, yeah, Barry, are they, no, they're just running a
blog, you know, right? Obviously, NYT is Salted Brothers blog, and the same way free press is
Barry Weiss is, you know, outlet, right? Okay. So this is a very important point. Let's say
that take, you know, a Zuck competes with TikTok, right? Zuck would never say TikTok's not
doing technology, right? Yeah, that's Chinese technology versus American technology, but they're
still doing, they're, they're recognizing we playing the same sport. You might say they're like,
you know, it's under the Communist Party surveillance, you, whatever, you can make all those points
and argue all that and Trump is flipped on, whatever. Leading that aside, the point is that
you wouldn't say they're not doing technology just because they're adversarial, they are doing
technology, they're just doing it, you know, on the Chinese side, right? Versus, they will actually,
the blue journalist will actually deny that sub-sac is journalism, right? That Ben Shapiro's
journalism, because even if Ben Shapiro has like millions more followers than they do in a much
larger audience and so and so forth, even if he's smarter than they are in many ways and, you know,
in like a better complex, certainly he's better than like their opinion editors and so on.
And you have the sub-sacres by their report, doing original reporting. What they say when they
say journalism, they mean he's not in the club, right? So remember the social network thing with
the blue and the red, once you think about it as a network, right? Where the borders are fuzzy,
but no less real for being fuzzy, a network of blues, right? So like Glenn Greenwell, it's on the
boundary of that, right? Seymour Hirsch maybe arguably is on the boundary because on sub-sac and
so and so forth, like Barry Weiss, arguably is on the boundary in some ways because she was
formerly in the club and so and so forth. So it's a little bit like being an MD or a JD,
where you have a formal state license to be a blue journal is to have an informal state
license, right? Why is it informal? Because if they were formally state licensed, they could say
that it's a state control press. So instead, what they get is a White House press pass and,
you know, it's a press control state. The point about that is that the, what you kind of see that
it's a network of, it's a club, right? That's when you realize, oh, don't talk to blue journalists
is actually really what I'm saying, right? So that's an important clarification. So talk to
and when I say, see tech journalists doesn't count either, just tech journalists, like tech
branches on that word has been, the problem is words have been tortured to mean the opposite of
what they mean, right? Like science. Yeah, it's anti-tech journalists, right? Exactly. Like science
got tortured to me and masks don't work before they do, right? So you actually have to have like
some prefix or something, which is like science in the form of independent replication, not
perceived citation, right? Yeah, we're trying to coin new media, like something new. That's right.
And you know, another example, this is democracy, like for the Democrats, it means, you know,
California is a one party state, right? Like here, let me show you this on just to just to show you.
So Democrats and Communists have both built one party states, right? So here is
Newsom taking lessons from she and he's explaining.
This is an amazing, amazing visual, right? Where total Democrat party control, right? Democrats
have communists have both built one party states, right? This is more than just like a one-liner.
It's a deep point when just like when they said science and they turned to the opposite of science,
right? Which was, masks don't work before they do. Just like they said media or they said
journalism and they turned to opposite journalism, which is basically, it's not neutral reporting
on anything. It's reporting on the enemies of blues and protecting blues, right? Here, they turn
democracy into the opposite democracy where they destroyed competitive multi-party elections,
right? In California, elections are held, but the party always wins exactly like China.
Okay, Democrats destroyed democracy in California. Deep point, this is why things got so bad there.
Because with no Republican check with no multi-party competition, this is when the California
train of $100 billion, this is when the graft really got underway, the homeless industrial
and complex explosion because there was no accountability at government level for all the Democrat
abuses. They built a one-party state and started looting it just like the communist did, but I
repeat myself, right? So when a Republican is elected, that's a threat democracy. But when a
Democrat surveils or sanctions or de-platforms or unbanks, that's, you know, that's just democracy,
right? Now, the thing is to be fair, it is true that many Republicans in response to this have
started to build Florida, especially into their own party states. So the problem is that you have
Democrats, Republicans and communists that have all created basically one party states where the
only democracy then is going to be the right to exit. To vote with your feet, right? Go ahead.
That's, yeah, there's a perfect place to wrap this episode in terms of it gets to your
the network state. The network state. Now you can vote with your feet and go to California,
or go to Florida, or go to wherever. That's right. And we want to combine these because star-based
shows that you can combine all threes. And, you know, Alan was just two things. So essentially,
this is a really important point. We reclaim free speech. We need to reclaim democracy,
right? We cannot give up on democracy. Democracy is actually, first of all,
that's an important interpretation. I just said it was not an abundance, but a deficit of democracy
that resulted in California's downfall because the Democrats built a one party state,
destroyed all multi-party competition. They jerrymandered it. And that's how they started to
all the looting, the hundreds of billions of dollars in looting, right? But we can have a rebirth
of democracy. And maybe we can do our next, you know, talking about democracy is creating
startup cities, right? Why? They voted people vote over their feet to move to star-base,
they voted their wall to build up star-base, and then finally, they incorporated star-base by
voting with their ballot. That's the future democracy, not a two-party system with the illusion of
choice, but a thousand city system with a reality of choice. 97% for Elon, right? This is essentially
a precursor to what's coming next, where you vote with your feet, your wall, and your ballot at the
same time. And that's the only way that you can vote against the Democrats or the Communists.
The only remaining vote is that vote. That's where true, the true vote is. And what we need to do is
reduce the barred exit to give everybody that practical franchise, right? Reduce lock-in,
make it possible for people to actually have choice over the government that rules them, right?
And this is also, of course, you know, basically we need to become the largest funders in the world
of media, of democracy, of science. And we actually mean it in the uncorrupted versions,
because I actually do believe in those things unironically, right? I do believe in media in books,
in writing, and all this kind of stuff. As I said, remember, we're a fork of the East Coast,
right? We're a fork of that assessment. So, you know, we basically, with technology,
we can have a new birth of media science, democracy, equality, on the internet, because that's
what the internet is. It's a peer-to-peer network. We're all equal on the internet. And truth
is everybody's property. It is not self-property. It's cryptography. So that's a great place to wrap.
Bology always a pleasure. Thank you so much for coming to the podcast. Thanks.
