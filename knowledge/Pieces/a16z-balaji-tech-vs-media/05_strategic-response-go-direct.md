## The Core Strategy: Go Direct

**"Number one, go direct. Number two, build your own distribution to avoid distortion."**

The fundamental defensive strategy against psychological warfare journalism is to bypass the intermediary entirely. **"They called them the media because they mediate your experience of reality. When you're putting anything through a media, it's like an Instagram filter that makes you into a villain."**

## Why Direct Distribution Works

**"Why would you do that to yourself? You're basically, it's like paying the journal with free content to make yourself look bad and get a permalink that's attacking you."**

### The Economic Reality

**"Literally think of it as TechCrunch is a corporation. Why are you giving them something for free?"** 

Every interaction is a **zero-sum transaction**:
- **Their gain:** Click revenue, conversions, ad revenue from your content
- **Your loss:** Distorted message, reputation damage, permanent attack URL

**"They do not care about the valuation or health of your company. They would literally light your house on fire and sell tickets to the place. That's their business model."**

## Individual Over Institutional

**"We figured out the formula that works, which is individual over institutional."**

### What Works: Individual-Led Projects

Examples of successful direct approach:
- **Mike Solana and Pirate Wires** - **"That has a real style to it"**
- **All-In Podcast** - **"Obviously, all in has done very well"**  
- **Elon's direct communication** - **"Obviously, Elon has done very well"**

### What Doesn't Work: Institutional Approach

**"What I think has not done as well is the things that are institutional. Because if it's too institutional, you're playing it safe... There isn't any conflict. There isn't any opinion. There isn't anything novel. It's focus grouped."**

## The Visual Metaphor: Portrait vs Landscape

**"The entire 20th century was the centralized century. And even the movement from the wide screen to the portrait size... The movement from wide screen to portrait size is visually the movement from institutional to individual."**

**"A portrait... doesn't have room for a panoramic shot of a huge crowd. It's for like a person standing there... even the screen itself captures that move from institutional to individual."**

## Content as Important as Code

**"Don't outsource your creation. Don't outsource your engineering? Don't outsource your creating. Don't outsource your content. Contents as key as code. Content happens in the house."**

### The Three Types of Founders

1. **Engineering Founder** - The "how" (implementation)
2. **Business Founder** - Traditional business operations  
3. **Content Founder** - The "why" (distribution and community)

**"The founding engineer is implementation, but the founding creator is the distribution. The founding engineer is the how, but the founding creator is the why."**

## Building Creator Infrastructure

### From Single Player to Multiplayer Creation

**"GitHub allows a bunch of people to contribute to code at the same time. We take that for granted. How do you get a bunch of people to contribute to content at the same time?"**

Tools and approaches:
- **Frame.io** for collaborative video editing
- **CapCut web interface** with shared accounts
- **Version control for big files** and reviews

**"Start thinking about your content base like your code base."**

### The Age Advantage

**"The 20 some things are often very good at content and content is actually upstream of product... millennials are good at startups... But the 20 some things are often very good at content."**

Examples: **Mr. Beast, Aiden Ross, iShowSpeed** - **"they're very talented at what they do."**

## The CIA Sales Email Recognition

**"The journals are sending you sales emails. The difference is they're scam sales emails. It's like a Nigerian... scam."**

### Recognizing the Pattern

**"They'll message you and they'll put on their nicest kind of thing. They're taught to flatter and sympathize in the email... it's exactly like our SDRs. Our sales development guys... They send out emails that are really crafted, cold email... to make the sale. And it's a completely calculated thing."**

### The Crucial Difference

**"At least when we're doing enterprise sales, maybe it's an aggressive sale at times or something, but the product has to work. They can cancel the subscription... It's not like, ha ha, you bought the product. Now we got malware in your property."**

## Don't Talk to Blue Journalists

**"Don't talk to blue journalists is actually really what I'm saying."** 

### The Club Recognition

**"What you kind of see that it's a network of, it's a club... like being an MD or a JD, where you have a formal state license to be a blue journal is to have an informal state license."**

The **White House press pass** serves as the informal licensing system: **"It's a press control state."**

### Word Corruption Problem

**"Tech journalists doesn't count either, just tech journalists, like tech branches on that word has been, the problem is words have been tortured to mean the opposite of what they mean."**

- **"Science"** got tortured to mean "masks don't work before they do"
- **"Journalism"** got tortured to mean partisan attack rather than neutral reporting
- **"Tech journalism"** means **"anti-tech journalism"**

## The Source Depletion Strategy

**"We did this thing intuitively by freezing them out, of course, not talking to them and posting that stuff ourselves. Now they're just reduced to bloggers. Now they're not sourced."**

### The Economic Reality

**"They can get another subscriber, but they can't get another quarter. They can't get another supplier of quotes... There's only one A16Z and C. There's only one Elon."**

When Elon emails Tesla PR: **"it just replies back with a poop emoji."** When asked about Washington Post: **"He's like, you know, send my regards to your puppet master... because he knows that basically like that they won't criticize their boss."**

## Applications

### Immediate Actions
1. **Build direct distribution channels** before you need them
2. **Hire content creators** as seriously as engineers
3. **Never respond** to journalist inquiry emails
4. **Post directly** to your owned channels

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Develop authentic voice** rather than corporate messaging
2. **Build community** around your content
3. **Create content infrastructure** for team collaboration
4. **Recognize and resist** the "club" mentality

### Recognition Tactics
1. **Identify sales emails** disguised as journalism
2. **Understand the MICE framework** for why people leak
3. **Recognize ego manipulation** in journalist outreach
4. **See through** the false flag approach

## Key Insight

**The media landscape has fundamentally shifted from gatekeepers to direct communication. Those who recognize this shift and build direct distribution avoid the distortion filter entirely, while those who continue feeding the legacy system pay for their own destruction.**
