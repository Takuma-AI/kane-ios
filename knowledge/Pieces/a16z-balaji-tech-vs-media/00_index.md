## Key Themes Across Chapters

- **Economic Disruption as Political Catalyst**: The collapse of traditional business models drives ideological extremism
- **Institutional vs Network Power**: Every industry faces the same battle between centralized gatekeepers and distributed networks
- **Information Warfare**: Modern media operates like intelligence agencies, using psychological operations for profit
- **Cryptographic Consensus**: Truth becomes mathematically verifiable rather than institutionally declared
- **Exit Over Voice**: The future favors those who can leave failing systems rather than reform them

## Core Mental Models

### The State vs Network Dichotomy
Traditional institutions (NASA, taxi medallions, the Fed, legacy media) versus distributed networks (SpaceX, Uber, Bitcoin, citizen journalism). This framework explains conflicts across all sectors.

### The Woke Capital Paradox
"Go broke, go woke" - Economic pressure from tech disruption drove media toward ideological extremism as a business model, creating the modern culture war.

### Truth as Property
"Truth is everybody's property. It is not Sulzberger's property. It's cryptography." The shift from institutional to mathematical verification of facts.
