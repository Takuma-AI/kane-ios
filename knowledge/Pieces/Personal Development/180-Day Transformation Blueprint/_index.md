## Core Sections

### 2. [Physical Transformation](02_physical-transformation.md)
The body as undeniable proof of discipline and capability. Details how physical change creates momentum that bleeds into all life areas, with specific protocols for training, nutrition, and lifestyle. Emphasizes 100 average days over perfection and treating structure as religion.

### 3. [Skill Acceleration](03_skill-acceleration.md)
Converting newfound capacity into practical power through high-income skills. Covers skill selection, immersion learning, the 90-day monetization rule, and building in public. Includes specific tactics for compressing learning time and creating rapid feedback loops.

### 4. [Environmental Reengineering](04_environmental-reengineering.md)
Recognizing that environment beats willpower long-term. Details how to audit and rebuild physical, digital, and social environments to make success automatic. Covers subtraction before addition, creating sacred zones, and the nuclear option of relocation.

### 5. [Psychological Fortification](05_psychological-fortification.md)
Building an unshakeable mental command center. Explores true resilience, emotional sovereignty, stress alchemy, and internal dialogue management. Provides frameworks for voluntary hardship, trigger auditing, and daily reinforcement practices.

### 6. [Social Recalibration](06_social-recalibration.md)

## Key Principles

### The All-or-Nothing Approach
"This isn't a buffet so you don't just choose which parts you like, you actually run the full sequence or you stay the same."

### Identity Before Habits
"Real change starts when you burn the blueprint of who you've been and redraw it from scratch."

### Environment as Operating System
"Your surroundings are an operating system and they run you, they dictate what's easy, what's hard, what's normal and what's impossible."

### Pressure Creates Diamonds
"You build toughness by being in situations where you can fail publicly, lose painfully, and still show up the next day."

## The Action Framework

### Initial Commitment
"Pick a hard start date within the next 72 hours and commit to running through all six pillars."

### Daily Measurement
"Measure your progress daily across all fronts. Physical stats, skill milestones, environmental upgrades, mindset wins, and social shifts all need to get logged."

### Biweekly Audits
"Every two weeks audit the system. What's working stays, what stalling gets reworked, the mission is evolution. Not rigid obedience to a dead plan."

## Notable Quotes

**On transformation:**
> "If you don't change your identity, you'll most likely drag the same problems into your new life like rotting luggage you never unpack."

**On discipline:**
> "Your body is the receipt for your discipline. It's proof you weren't bluffing."

**On skills:**
> "The right skills put you in rooms the old self couldn't even pronounce."

**On environment:**
> "You don't rise to your goals, you sink to your surroundings."

**On relationships:**
> "Who you surround yourself with really determines your ceiling."
