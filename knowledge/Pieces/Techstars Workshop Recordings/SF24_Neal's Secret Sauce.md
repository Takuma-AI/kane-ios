### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Chloe Lannert | Techstars: special when you recruit and join the military, it's how it's the process you undergo and who it turns you into.
- Chloe Lannert | Techstars: You guys are already 5 steps ahead

### Key Insights

> "Chloe Lannert | Techstars: I think many of you intuitively either understand or already harbor, but may not always be actively"

> "Chloe Lannert | Techstars: I don't know what everyone else was doing in this room, but like I was taking pages of notes, and I know mer. I've known Merk for years. She's like they needed like there was so much gold, so many things that they needed to hear and remember that, he said. So that's just feedback for you all. But keep that in mind, because I know you're the one always taking notes at every session. So George is really good at that, and I admire that, and I found myself. I still find myself doing it, especially when I hear something that I either never want to forget or want to make sure that I'm like."

> "Chloe Lannert | Techstars: I'm always a student in whatever room I go into so cool. Alright. So we kind of talked about this. But then moving on, yeah, yeah, so this is the end of your tech stars. Experience, as far as program is concerned. It's the beginning of your techsars experience which we'll talk about in a few hours, as far as the rest of your life and ours. But we wanted to send you off with a few extra like boosts of encouragement. So yeah, cool."

> "Chloe Lannert | Techstars: Prep. What am I doing this afternoon while we're having our 40 calls? Prep. Because I really care about keeping my team alive because they got some severe allergies, so very important. And they're at the top of their pack. So before I go deeper on this, I have one fun prompt. I think I've said this already. But let's see if anybody actually remembers who's the best superhero."

> "Chloe Lannert | Techstars: Right? So how you show up like, let's just use Fabio, for example, Dude knows how to dress. That's really good. Always dress, looking good, fresh love, your background and your zoom like. There's a level of thought that you put into how you show up that people notice and appreciate"
