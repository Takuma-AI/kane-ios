### Key Insights

> "Daniel Pereira: to do that. But we didn't take the check for almost a year, because we had no nothing to do with that money. Why are you going to take money if you have nothing to do with it? And that is something that I think is really important, too. It's like, don't take money for the sake of taking money right?

I stood up on day one of tech stars, and I was like, I'm never fucking selling this company. I'd rather either this company is going to be a trillion dollar company, or it's going to be burned to the ground"

> "Daniel Pereira: right? What I mean by that, because, like, I'm never leaving as the founder. This is, I believe, that founder of companies are the only companies that will succeed right like, there's a lot of examples of this and I wasn't going to take money just because some random Vc. Thought that I'd be good to do something right like, have conviction in yourself. Don't let money give you conviction."
