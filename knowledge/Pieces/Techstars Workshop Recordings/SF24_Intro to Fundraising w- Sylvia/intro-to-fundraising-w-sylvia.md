### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Kevin Kaspar: what the fundraising process looks like like. Who are the key stakeholders. What the timelines look like, you know. What do some of the terms mean, and what how to get prepared? And, you know, really be ready to go out and fundraise when the right when it's the right time for your business. And I think that's something that we're going to continually stress that, you know.

You know, understand what marketing is, and this and that, like I was very early in my career when I did this, and I honestly think it was the most incredible experience of my life, and I really wish I had gone through an accelerator at that point, because I was like, I always said, being a founder is the loneliest job ever, because you're by yourself, and you're also building something that's like"
