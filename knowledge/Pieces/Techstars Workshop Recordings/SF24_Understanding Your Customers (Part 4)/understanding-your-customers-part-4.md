Then you make a screening criteria, and then you conduct the interviews.
- Lilliana Robinson: or then you do the hunt, and you find your interviewees. Then you conduct the interviews. Then you gather the insights, and after each interview you're doing your forces, and you have your timeline.

Now, ever since."

This is not the competition for your business. This is the competitors for this specific segment. So if you're interviewing people who hired"

> "Lilliana Robinson: And remember that non consumption is also an answer, and then quotes, very important to support every proposed jobs through down statement with actual quotes from interviews that support it.
