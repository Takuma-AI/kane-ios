1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:21.019
Lilliana Robinson: No, I am curious, as you guys left and digested for the rest of the day, and let all the content marinate. Does anybody have any sort of like thoughts or ideas or insights that that you had throughout the day, or questions you might have, or just general thoughts from yesterday. Yeah, George, kick us off.

2
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:30.209
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Oh, yeah, I was just gonna we'd run out of time on the last call. But I was just gonna add to what you were saying, Liliana with the

3
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.049
George Reed - CEO and Founder: importance of

4
00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:36.219
George Reed - CEO and Founder: taking time to make sure you really

5
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:46.489
George Reed - CEO and Founder: design your initial interview questions properly, because that's something like with what I do with market research, with surveys, I find, is like. My opinion on this is that

6
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.590
George Reed - CEO and Founder: many billions of dollars every year wasted on surveys and market research, because people don't take the time to

7
00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:01.049
George Reed - CEO and Founder: so try and mitigate the input bias. Because I have, you know, in programming, I have, like the garbage in garbage out idea. It kind of applies to this as well. So I just yeah.

8
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.050
George Reed - CEO and Founder: we're all familiar with garbage and garbage out. And we've got that exactly in this

9
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.989
George Reed - CEO and Founder: jobs to be done. Interview process, too. I'd I'd say.

10
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.620
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly, George, and we didn't really get to it yesterday, Neil, but we should talk about surveys

11
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.359
Lilliana Robinson: because George just hinted at it.

12
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, for for us, George, I think what you do is that

13
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: another level of importance and sophistication? And where we're starting everyone at.

14
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know. Obviously, we're doing the qualitative interview techniques to get the initial hints as to where to start and how to redirect their progress. Now.

15
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think down the road is going to be.

16
00:01:39.010 --> 00:02:03.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: maybe some, some relevance towards bringing in more of your expertise and perspective on how they can gather more data at scale. But for us, we don't even prepare questions for the interviews that we're going to have you all conduct like we don't even premeditate them. For the most part we'll we'll explain why during this session and tomorrow, and give you more context on how to figure it out. But ours is more like customer discovery. Jazz

17
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so

18
00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:06.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's it's fun that way.

19
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.760
George Reed - CEO and Founder: I'm excited.

20
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:16.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's kind of like you're just getting to know someone and having a conversation with them. And you have a few like ideas and and directions that you want to go, but nothing particularly scripted or structured, which is usually

21
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:25.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in contrast with what a lot of founders tend to do at this stage to prepare for their. You know, customer interviews. They think that they have a set of questions that they need to ask everyone.

22
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.429
Lilliana Robinson: Dominique, but those were great comments, George, I completely agree. Thank you for offering

23
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.200
Lilliana Robinson: Dominique.

24
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:51.720
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Hey, guys? So we were just reflecting. Today, I think we both got a couple of points. It was pretty much a topic. We kept coming back to you, but just reflecting on our own journey and sharing it with with the cohort. I know Liliana and and Neil and team. You know this well, but

25
00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:17.029
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I think for us, when we 1st started Agent Luna, we did a lot of interviews, albeit not properly. Now we're learning the framework from you guys. But we we had this hypothesis that we came to. That was kind of the research from everyone that people were telling us, hey? I don't know where to start with my social media. So we thought we had everything figured out. We built that prototype that basically gave them

26
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:31.529
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: a strategy on how to do that, and we were super excited. And so we went back to all those same people, and we were like ta-da. Now, now you know where to start. And then they just looked at us with funny faces. Really right? The majority of them like that's cool. But

27
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:46.500
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I kind of just want it done. And we were like, huh! You know, you just want to do it mean? And I think that kind of led us to dig a bit deeper. But we're we're literally just scratching the surface. So I think, as you guys know.

28
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:57.150
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: And now the rest of the cohort, we're just super excited to really dive into this process and really figure out what I just want. It done means, so yeah, we were just

29
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:19.029
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: thinking about that. But I think, will you had. Yeah, I'll just quickly add one other thought. So. The other key takeaway from yesterday was the analysis of the patterns, and I think Liliana and Neil you mentioned there's typically 12 to 15 or so that are going to be reoccurring. So that was sort of a penny drop moment that

30
00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:35.699
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: we kind of need to go back and start to figure out what customers we could group together, that where do they fit? Exactly because it's I think we're going to get a lot of insights out of that. And really just going a level deeper. Yeah.

31
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And just to clarify one thing

32
00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:42.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you mentioned 12 to 15. That's how many interviews we recommend you doing to get

33
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to and uncover, probably 2 or 3.

34
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.900
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Later on.

35
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, it's usually like 2 or 3. Sometimes it could be a few more.

36
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: sometimes it could be just one or 2,

37
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: almost always. It's at least 2. And typically around 3 jobs that people are hiring your your product to do.

38
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.430
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Neil, yeah. Yeah.

39
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.539
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Excited for today's session. Yeah. Thanks. Guys.

40
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.560
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you, sure, else.

41
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.539
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, we also talked about like what we do and how we can utilize this kind of thing. And we

42
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.659
Çoruh | CogniScope: we've like remembered.

43
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.349
Çoruh | CogniScope: would you remember the essay about

44
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:34.089
Çoruh | CogniScope: how? It's an adonos theory. It's they he calls it choices and illusion. Because when you give someone choices, you just limit people to answer from those choices. But

45
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:45.622
Çoruh | CogniScope: to make an more explanatory like explores rev explanatory understanding about how people are using stuff, how they

46
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.929
Çoruh | CogniScope: how they understand the different

47
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.310
Çoruh | CogniScope: aspects of different things. You have to get a bit more like explanatory.

48
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.380
Çoruh | CogniScope: open-ended questions that

49
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.739
Çoruh | CogniScope: makes you go up and up, and more deeper.

50
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:19.730
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: We were just nodding along to that. I don't know if any because I think it reminded us of one at this one interview in particular to remember with

51
00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:42.350
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: whispered it, but like it's funny when you, when you you can kind of accidentally lead people into answering in a certain way. So I think, yeah, you just resonated with us a lot then. And that's something definitely. We we want to learn like how to better ask the questions, because you can almost pigeonhole and not really find out

52
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.350
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: what the true problem is.

53
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.555
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, a few things we say is, don't lead the witness. And then also

54
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a lot of the times. Unfortunately, as

55
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, passionate founders and researchers. Now

56
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you want the answer that you're seeking.

57
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.120
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah.

58
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:23.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right. So you tend to ask questions and get excited, and direct your energy in the conversation with them around. The thing that gets you excited and validates how you're already feeling about what it is you're trying to learn or do so that that is a challenge inevitably in this process, and for those of you who are more professional researchers in the room. You probably already know this and understand the importance of mitigating that bias. But we'll we'll do our best to help you all with that, too.

59
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:32.791
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, that's helpful, especially as a marketeer. You want to pull out the answer. So I definitely, I need help with that definitely.

60
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.380
Lilliana Robinson: Where.

61
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:53.369
Uğur Koç: Yeah, I I was just thinking, like all by myself, after we've, you know, discussed the session yesterday as a team. How like I I really wanna know how possible is it to perform the jobs to be done? Interview

62
00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:12.890
Uğur Koç: to a group of people? Because, you know, we we talked about how in B, twob, these decisions, these buying decisions are being made by multiples of people, or sometimes simultaneously brought by a team, that is, you know, responsible from one thing, and the person who's the

63
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:30.509
Uğur Koç: user of the product that let's say that we're selling is also getting a say. And then the final consolidator, which is the, you know, economic decision makers listening to everyone and saying like, Okay, this is it. So? Like, I was thinking how these yeah, good.

64
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:49.500
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, no, you're asking all the right questions, or there are. There are like a set of questions that everybody has at the beginning, and this is always one of them. So your users are separate from your customers. I'll go over this in the business blueprint next week, and I have a lot of b 2 b advice for you guys in that workshop, but one

65
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.479
Lilliana Robinson: to answer your 1st question. You can't do a jobs to be done. Interview with a group of people.

66
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.269
Lilliana Robinson: It needs to be with one person, one interviewee

67
00:08:58.716 --> 00:09:06.439
Lilliana Robinson: and you also will do a separate set of jobs to be done interviews for your users versus your like, the person that has the buying power.

68
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:33.310
Lilliana Robinson: and we'll help you identify which stakeholder is the one person that you would actually want to interview for that buying power. And so you should pick which one to start with while we're doing this all together, and you need to go back and do a second round of jobs to be done interviews with the users. So say you start with the customers. You need to go back and do the separate set, so they should not combine. They should be completely separate, because the 2 of them will have 2 separate jobs to do. But you do need to understand both sides.

69
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:38.449
Lilliana Robinson: I'll go through exercises to kind of identify both of those in the business blueprint next week.

70
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.639
Lilliana Robinson: Does that make sense

71
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.360
Lilliana Robinson: cool.

72
00:09:50.635 --> 00:10:19.189
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So all the B Twob people out there, we're definitely going to want to identify a single person. For example, I'll give this example, next week. But we had a company that was selling into like 50 to 100 employees software companies, and we helped them identify that the person that was the decision maker. Their true customer were chief innovation officers. They had previously been selling to chief technology officers. And I'll tell you a lot more about that, because it's 1 of my main examples in my workshop next Wednesday. But that's like an example.

73
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:37.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One other thing you all should know is our team, went on an off site over the past day. So we're down in Half Moon Bay wrapping up. So we're all kind of together circling around a coffee shop out here in the foggy what? What is this? Is this

74
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this considered South Bay. Is that right, Agadina like, where do? Where are we right now?

75
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.340
akadinayadegar: I don't think I would call it South Bay. I don't really know what I'm.

76
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:47.960
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Love it.

77
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.560
akadinayadegar: So we're coming down the coast a little.

78
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.679
Dave Scott: Yeah, you guys are at Half Moon Bay. So you guys are close to me. It's really just Peninsula.

79
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

80
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.290
akadinayadegar: So, yeah.

81
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, teach me the lingo folks. I'm learning getting familiar.

82
00:11:00.422 --> 00:11:07.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, but it was cool because we were talking about how much fun yesterday was, and what made it the most interesting wasn't like

83
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:32.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: us speaking to you all, going through slides with more of the conversation that that came from it, and how you all started to help each other, and already have ideas for what made it relevant for your business. So, even though I do have more slides to run you through now to talk through. It's really just a summary of some ideas and and principles that I want to use to stoke discussion and questions so to the extent that it activates your curiosity, and you want to either clarify something or call it out

84
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:40.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and make it relevant to your business or your contacts. That's what makes it interesting to us. Because I've I've given this talk hundreds of times.

85
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So humor me. And and with your engagement when you're willing.

86
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool.

87
00:11:46.210 --> 00:12:10.308
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, we welcome your questions and comments. And I will also set the intention for today. We're also going to teach you guys how to interview and how to find who to interview. So if you saw on your checklist in base camp your very 1st to do list, there's an assignment which is to write your screening criteria, which is who you're going to interview. It should be a very narrow set of

88
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:25.239
Lilliana Robinson: like screening criteria. I don't know another way to say it. And that's how you're going to decide. So today, we're going to go over that. And I want to make sure that when we leave today, each and every single one of you deeply understands what you need to do, because that's going to be due at the end of next week.

89
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay. So my question slide is, Shawn. Is that what everyone sees? Okay, good.

90
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is where we left off yesterday.

91
00:12:40.553 --> 00:12:50.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I had a few more things to wrap up yesterday's stuff, which is to talk a little bit about the approach to the interview. So think of yourself like you're either a detective or a journalist.

92
00:12:50.210 --> 00:13:03.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and you're trying to uncover or or like kind of paint, the picture of of what happened, either the scene of the crime or or the getting to the story. You're connecting the dots, and you're trying to deduce like you know what what even happened.

93
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then also, we were talking about the example with

94
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the candy bar snickers and Mars Milky Way before.

95
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

96
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:20.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the level of context, like the the goal here for you all, and how you describe

97
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:29.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: your Icp or persona, or your customer, you know profile or jobs to be done. Whatever version of that language you want to apply to your your business.

98
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Here's what I mean by refining a situation by adding context.

99
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm hungry.

100
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so

101
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I want something to eat.

102
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Therefore I grab a stickers.

103
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's not very contextualized, right? Like, when I want something to eat. There's a lot of things I can do to address that.

104
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So is there any more detail that you would add

105
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for this situation to add context to it.

106
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: based on what we talked about yesterday.

107
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.019
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I mean this.

108
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:02.990
Uğur Koç: Seems like a.

109
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Apple.

110
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:12.070
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: How speaking? How about that? You're you know, on on the move. You don't have you need something.

111
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But I'm in a rush.

112
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, anyway.

113
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.360
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah.

114
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, good. That's good.

115
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Any more

116
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:25.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: detail. Anything else we can add to this, because now I'm in a rush and I want something to eat. Therefore I grab a snickers, or are there a lot of other things I can grab.

117
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:30.320
George Reed - CEO and Founder: You really.

118
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:37.090
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: You don't want a big, a big meal. You want something to kind of tie you over or bridge you, but it's fulfilling.

119
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.419
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Sad, as.

120
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay.

121
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:45.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: maybe I'm really hungry. I'm like, desperate. I want something. Now.

122
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I need something quick and easy, but also satiating.

123
00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:56.289
Uğur Koç: Maybe I don't have that much money, or you know I I only have a change, and I want something that I can buy with my change.

124
00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:04.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I don't have much money. That's not that fun. I I don't like customers that don't have that much money. I want them to have a little bit more money, but I want them to spend it on.

125
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.230
Uğur Koç: Okay.

126
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:10.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I understand. I understand where you're coming from that that makes sense. Well, I'll give you the last 1. 0, go ahead! Sorry.

127
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:11.510
Morgan Stanton: Like 3.

128
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.109
Talitha Abraham: Maybe a quick burst of energy.

129
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Angry. Yeah.

130
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:23.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I like where you're going with it. Let's see. Let's see what I came up with the last. So I'm in a rush. I'm starving. I need something I can eat with one hand while I'm on the go, and I'm not showing. The next time I'll be able to use.

131
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright like this is the mission critical situation.

132
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:35.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now, the snickers, as one of the products to hire, is very much well defined and narrowed down.

133
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So.

134
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:44.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: given. What we spoke about. What I'll say to you is that most of you most founders, quite frankly in general.

135
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: are somewhere between

136
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: saying, I want something to eat, or I'm in a rush and want something to eat when they describe where their customer is at.

137
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and why their customer would be the right fit for them.

138
00:15:55.030 --> 00:16:03.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's not a particularly well defined and and contextualized criteria for who you should talk to, let alone who you should be selling to.

139
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and who needs you more than anyone else.

140
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:10.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So my goal with you all is to you to get you to a point where, when you're talking

141
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:16.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to your team when you are strategizing and building product, when you're dealing with your potential investors.

142
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Any stakeholder that's important for your business's progress in the coming months through techstars and beyond.

143
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I want you be able. I want you to be able to, very

144
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:32.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: granularly and precisely to find the context that your user is struggling in that makes them the perfect fit

145
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for your product or service to support them.

146
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

147
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll I'll let off on the candy bars now. But hopefully this brings the point home of what the goal is

148
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:49.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and what I want to strive towards for your the level of understanding you should have about what they're going through and why they're perfect for you right now.

149
00:16:51.558 --> 00:17:16.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we have this thing called the job Story, which we'll talk more about I think tomorrow. But I wanted to at least hint at it and explain that this notion of a job story rather than a user story or persona, that I typically hear people say, there's a lot of times where we're adding in our assumptions, our subjectivity, and this kind of categorization and clustering of people before truly understanding them

150
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:29.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with our own implementation or solution in mind that leaves out some of the important causal components, the context and the underlying motivations of the people who actually are in need of your help.

151
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:36.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So like the notions of like the demographic information and details.

152
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:52.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's what I see a lot of people talk about when I ask them who their customer is. They go. Oh, well, they're working professionals between 20 and 35, or, you know, like they'll they'll categorize them by gender or by. You know, some other, you know, seemingly irrelevant factor relative to

153
00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the actual contextual need.

154
00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:06.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So 30 seconds to buy need something that's going to save off 100 for 30 min is far more relevant to speak on than my age, sex, race, weekend habits, you know anything like that.

155
00:18:06.676 --> 00:18:10.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That isn't to say that those aren't important things to be mindful of over time.

156
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:26.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's just that it's more about the context and less about the demographics. So I'm not throwing it out the window. But I am saying that people tend to over index for those broader categories before they understand the more situational context of their consumers.

157
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Liliana.

158
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:49.449
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I would even say people over rely on personas. I've been waiting for this slide, because even in these discussions you can go back in here on the recordings. Several of you have brought up personas. So I just want to call everyone's attention to this slide. This is huge here, so I don't know everyone's background, but a lot of people have probably done case studies or studies some form of

159
00:18:49.808 --> 00:18:59.140
Lilliana Robinson: entrepreneurship or business at some point or the other, and they do teach you personas in those classes, and it's just not as efficable as

160
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:19.560
Lilliana Robinson: the situation itself. So, like, Neil is saying, it's not like we throw it out completely. But for the time being, while we're doing this customer discovery, we actually won't talk about personas at all. So when you guys are making your screening criteria, I will probably make some of you rewrite it because there will be a lot of persona in there. It will be people who live in this very specific like.

161
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:35.080
Lilliana Robinson: they live in an urban area. They live in a metropolitan area. They're 20 to 30. They're women, whatever it is that is not going to be what we're talking about here. So I kind of want to challenge you to rewire your brain a bit and see that there is a

162
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:47.290
Lilliana Robinson: completely agnostic view that has nothing to do with who a person is, and only about the situation or struggle they're going through. So this is going to be like a mental shift for a lot of people so wanted to call this out.

163
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.360
Uğur Koç: Can I ask something here? Really quick.

164
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Please let's do it.

165
00:19:52.800 --> 00:20:19.809
Uğur Koç: Yeah, like, when I hear you say that, liana, the the question comes to my mind, what if I don't know the situations or the types of situations that the person that I'm trying to get to is because of, you know, maybe I haven't worked in that area yet, or I don't know what specific situation that that person finds themselves in, or the business finds themselves in like. Do we like make up for that by just having more

166
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.410
Uğur Koç: business research done, or you know, what's the guideline? There.

167
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:48.270
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So Neil has this saying that is called aim small, Miss Small. So you're looking at a very small target, and so you'll only miss it by like a teeny bit versus like looking at the whole picture. We will be trying to find a very narrow screening criteria to start with, and probably like a 3rd of you will have to go back and rewrite it. You're going to get through like 2 interviews and realize this isn't actually the right group of people.

168
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:54.389
Lilliana Robinson: So it'll be a lot of trial and error, which is completely fine, and we'll work with you on that.

169
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.220
Lilliana Robinson: Do you want to elaborate on that now.

170
00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I just typed it in the chat. I I will say it a lot any small Miss small

171
00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:05.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and the reason being is that founders? You all have a lot of pressure

172
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:14.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: from investors like myself and many others. And you're in techsars. That's a big deal. And you're building a great big company. So therefore you got to figure it all out now, and it's got to be big.

173
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:19.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I just want to humble all of us, and also give you all the the grace of knowing that.

174
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:40.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sure, I want you to build a big business, but not right away, and not in the next 3 months. I want you to build a great business that you're proud of, and that you're excited about, and we're not in a hurry for it to be huge. We can do that over the next 5 to 10 years. So let's get it right first, st and we'll take our time to make sure that we have the right people, that we're making very happy and successful first, st rather than trying to like scale really quickly, and then fall over and trip over ourselves

175
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so hopefully that comes through as we go.

176
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:53.619
Lilliana Robinson: What would you say to the founders who are feeling apprehensive about like they don't know where to start. They don't know what to what to choose for the struggle? Do they just pick something and then start moving around.

177
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I would say.

178
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: start

179
00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:05.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with your instincts. This isn't particularly scientific, but in the beginning most startup moves aren't.

180
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and that you need to go with your gut in who you want to learn more about and help. First, st

181
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:19.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know what it is you want to build, and you have a hunch as to who you think you can help. But now you have to take a step back and have humility, and say, Well.

182
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:24.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think that this is what they want. And I think that this is a problem that's more than just my own.

183
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now, I need to experiment to figure out who it is I can actually help first.st

184
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:37.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you're gonna have to make a few bets that are aren't as like, maybe educated or sophisticated, but indicative enough for you to make that like. Take that next step.

185
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:44.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so you'll learn a lot more about why I have this perspective. When you hear my story. In a few weeks, but, like

186
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:59.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I, I could give you more precise and scientific parameters to go about making the choice of who to help, who can pay you the most money. Now, who can teach you the most about the problem? You know there's a lot of ways to fill in the details, but at the end of the day. It's truly your own personal intrinsic

187
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: instincts and motivations that are going to matter the most at this stage.

188
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Does that clarify it?

189
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.740
Lilliana Robinson: But or does that answer your question?

190
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:21.069
Uğur Koç: Ye? Yeah, maybe maybe partially, because I'm like looking at the screen right now, we have a text saying that having 30 seconds to buy and eat something which will satiate our hunger for 30 min, so on, so forth, like this is a very specific

191
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:36.040
Uğur Koç: point in time, space where this person is finding themselves in. And usually when we are working with, when we're trying to pick out who to interview, we don't have this much information on them.

192
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:47.869
Uğur Koç: If if you know what I mean, and the only way to get that information out of them in my experience and this is probably limited, is to actually go and talk to them. So in this case do we 1st

193
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.380
Uğur Koç: have a brief chat.

194
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Good.

195
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.019
Uğur Koç: Then set this thing up, or.

196
00:23:52.020 --> 00:24:05.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I like, I like that. I like that. You're asking. So the. So we're we're jumping the gun by showing you this because the interview screening criteria for getting this information is, I'm talking to people who recently bought snickers at an airport.

197
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's the screening criteria.

198
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:19.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm not looking for people who only had 30 seconds to buy something, and they were trying to stave off hunger. That's not a good criteria. I can find people who fit that profile, but I can work backwards from the point of purchase on the product itself.

199
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:33.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So people who bought a snickers, or a power bar, or a coffee or an apple. The the people in that indirect competitive set that we indicated to you. If we're evaluating people who are in a rush and ate something very quickly

200
00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:38.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at an airport gate before they got on the airport on the plane and and went to sleep

201
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and did a bunch of work.

202
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:50.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now we're talking like we're cooking with gas about who it is. We're trying to work backwards and reverse engineer. What were the inputs for them making that decision. What were the causal mechanisms there?

203
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Does that make sense.

204
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.900
Uğur Koç: Yeah, no, it's clicked perfectly. Yeah. Thanks. Good.

205
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Annie.

206
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.925
Annie Brown: Yeah, so sort of related to that. I think I

207
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:18.551
Annie Brown: we have a lot of like inbound requests to to talk to us and and introductions made of potential customers and things. And so I get a lot of these introductory calls like, I'm having one. At the end of this call for a potential customer.

208
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:26.359
Annie Brown: can you cause? What I've been doing is I've been turning kind of those introductory calls into these types of.

209
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:26.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

210
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.560
Annie Brown: Use is that sort of a way to do that? And is there a way to make that feel more.

211
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

212
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:54.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I've got a tip for you. So so you we saw when Clay gave his 4 min milkshake talk yesterday, and we watched the video together. There was something he said, that I I love revisiting. And in reminding in these situations when he was trying to figure out why people were going through the drive through on their own to buy these milkshakes.

213
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:59.059
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and he goes. They would struggle to respond, and we asked them what job. They hired this milkshake to do

214
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so. He goes in a language that they could understand. We asked them

215
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:04.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so

216
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when you were in this same situation the last time.

217
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and you didn't hire a milkshake. What did you hire.

218
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:12.680
Annie Brown: Yeah.

219
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So my advice to you, Annie, is.

220
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they're coming from some context before talking to you

221
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: where they were trying to make progress in some other way.

222
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:28.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So your job isn't to necessarily talk about reliable now, and how we can serve you now. It's more to go. Well, how did we get here

223
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:35.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to have this conversation. What have you been up to? What have you tried to do so far? What's working and what isn't?

224
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And you know, what opportunity are we facing now about what a better way might look like for you?

225
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right.

226
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.829
Annie Brown: Yeah, that's super helpful.

227
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:52.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, so it's so it's not a pure jobs to be done. Interview in the sense that, like, we do want to give you more structure and intentionality with who you're going to talk to? Precisely. And you're probably, gonna

228
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:57.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, pull them in rather than like, have them emerge on on your doorstep.

229
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:04.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But I love your instinct of parlaying these conversations of potential customers into inquiring more about

230
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:09.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what brought them to you, to even be willing to have the conversation about their interest.

231
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's really good.

232
00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:23.179
Annie Brown: And that helps kind of navigate where the discussion goes. Because then I can focus on a specific feature or things like that. If I know what is their biggest challenge and what they've tried before.

233
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And and I'll tell you from a sales standpoint, as someone who's been doing sales for majority of my life. Now

234
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:36.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it is such a delight on the consumer end or customer side. When you, as the person who has something to offer or to sell.

235
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: demonstrate true, genuine curiosity

236
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:48.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: about their needs as opposed to self promotion, and immediately speaking to what you do and how it's going to help them, and why it's worth paying for.

237
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So a lot of people really appreciate that.

238
00:27:51.710 --> 00:28:03.529
Dave Scott: It's kind of interesting, because I've worked with a lot of really stellar sales organizations. So when I was at Oracle, the really good salespeople. The very, very 1st call that they would make to discover is is all questions.

239
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:20.400
Dave Scott: It was just all like, Hey, what do you need this for? What problem are you trying to solve? Blah blah? And it would be like a 15 to 30 min meeting, and it would just be they would not sell a single thing. They would just ask questions, and then the second meeting, they come back with whatever solution

240
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.290
Dave Scott: brilliant.

241
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's right.

242
00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.120
Lilliana Robinson: Hmm!

243
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:43.680
Lilliana Robinson: And Annie, I I want to call out you said the word features. This is something that we'll get to, but we want to focus a lot more on the benefits. We're not selling features, even though we're all entrepreneurs. We love our features, we're obsessed with our product and all the cool bells and whistles on it. But I'm just putting a flag for you. We will debunk that soon.

244
00:28:43.975 --> 00:28:52.239
Lilliana Robinson: Any. I also, I also wanted to put you on the spot I saw you're gonna leave for a customer discovery call today. Is that an interview? And are you.

245
00:28:52.460 --> 00:29:09.550
Annie Brown: That's exactly. It's what I was just saying. It's somebody I was introduced to came into my inbox that said they might be interested in a partnership or or licensing our software. And yeah, so I'm kind of like taking notes from this call of what I can use in that one.

246
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:13.580
Annie Brown: but they might turn into like a formal jobs to be done. Interview.

247
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:35.969
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I wanna I wanna be clear that it's very important to maintain the integrity of the jobs to be done. Set and don't cloud it with sales. Those 2 things should be extremely bifurcated. Or else you're gonna mess with the data here of what we're collecting the quality data here. I don't know if you want to explain more, Neil, but how sales calls should be completely separate from when we're doing customer discovery.

248
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:44.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I can talk about that. And I know you need to plug in your computer. So go go do that. But you're still here, Lila, still with us. She's got to eat some juice So

249
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:53.662
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to clarify. I do get a lot of founders at this phase that you all start interviewing because we're after today, you'll you'll know enough to get get going

250
00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:58.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it's gonna be so tempting when you talk to someone who you're interviewing. And you're like, Oh, my God! Like

251
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what I built is exactly for you, and you just can't resist

252
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:11.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the opportunity to show them your product or to send them a link to try it out, or to sign up to become a customer, because, you know, you'll close them if you do.

253
00:30:12.464 --> 00:30:24.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's really important for you to maintain the integrity of the demand side focus of your conversation, and what I will give you as a, as a, as a, as a pass is, follow up with them right afterwards.

254
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:29.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or at the end of the call, you can say, Hey, we really appreciate you. Taking the time to talk to us.

255
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:39.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What we're working on is, and we think it might be really interesting to share with you. Would you be open to having another conversation about it, or for us following up with more information.

256
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:49.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's okay at the end of the call. But make sure you've gathered the information about their story and their journey and their problem. First, st before kind of

257
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:55.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: conflating your interests as a potential resource or answer for their problem.

258
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think you all appreciate that.

259
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.560
Lilliana Robinson: Can you hear me if I speak like this? Can you say yes.

260
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, it's a little. There's a little bit.

261
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.280
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

262
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:03.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Always been.

263
00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.740
Lilliana Robinson: London.

264
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, that's perfect. There you go. You're good.

265
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:32.469
Lilliana Robinson: It will sound kind of foreign to a lot of you to not bring up your product at all on these calls, but they should hear nothing about what you're building. It's actually completely sacrilegious to do that during the job speed on calls. So I want you guys to. Also, here's another mindset shift. That's why those 2 things need to be completely separate. So I'd love to answer any questions about that. But it's really important that we understand that.

266
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:42.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So what I'm gonna do now is effectively just roll through a bunch of points that I've summarized from a resource that we're going to share with you at the end of

267
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You know this weekend next week, which is the book that Bob wrote

268
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:51.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: more recent in more recent years. That kind of synthesizes a lot of the information that

269
00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: he's worked with me and others on over the past

270
00:31:54.230 --> 00:32:05.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 13 years or so. Which is in a well organized book that you can always refer back to. But we decided, rather than forcing you all to read that book. Now we'll just summarize the important points for you to get started.

271
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:10.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So one principle that we'll start with is people buy for their own reasons.

272
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:18.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we tend to project what we think people are buying for onto things, and we reason our way through what we we perceive the behavior to be.

273
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:28.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's really important for us to take a step back with that humility, and understand each person's buying for their own reasons. And it's our job to uncover. Why not? Yes, or assume that we know.

274
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:37.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 2. This reminds me of something I think Monica mentioned yesterday about the randomness of you know your customer signing up or being interested.

275
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I

276
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:49.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm less aligned on. Nothing is random like, I think there's still room for randomness, but I do think more things are caused than than we might give credit for usually in these situations.

277
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And the struggle creates demand. So the notion here is that

278
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there are people where you know what you have could be helpful to them.

279
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:03.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but if they don't understand why they need it yet, they may not be ready

280
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to say yes, or to get your help.

281
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So sure there's a large market that you can serve.

282
00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:23.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But the people who are most ready to become your customers today are the ones that are actually experiencing some sort of friction or pain. So you want to talk to them 1st and find them before you reach out to the other folks, that you may have to do a lot more work to bring over the line.

283
00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:25.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so

284
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:49.079
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as far as articulating that the buyers, timeline, and the 4 forces of progress. Understand the dominoes that have to fall into place like we talked about yesterday. You summarize this into a meaningful story with those functional, social, and emotional motivations. And then your sales process incorporates these insights. That's kind of how this all comes together. That's what we've talked about up till now.

285
00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:54.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So next phase is talking about how we define who we interview. In the 1st place.

286
00:33:54.600 --> 00:34:05.589
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So one exercise that I came up with that isn't included in Bob's book, or I think, in what's taught what jobs to be done. But it was more like a necessity for me to

287
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: developed, because I've been teaching at at the early stage

288
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a startup phase

289
00:34:11.495 --> 00:34:18.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for jobs to be done, which is different than most of the people who I've done jobs with because they're usually working with companies that have raised

290
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:33.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: series A or have more capital. They can afford to pay people like Bob 6 figures for a 2 week, consulting project and stuff like that, whereas I know none of us here have those kind of resources. So I have to kind of do it my own way. So what I tend to have people do is write a customer. Success story.

291
00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:45.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the what I mean by that is before you even have a clear idea on who it is that you're serving, or most of you have at least a semblance of who you think your customer might be.

292
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:50.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now, what I want you to do is answer these questions, of what problem are they currently facing?

293
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How does this impact their lives?

294
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Why is this a significant pain to them as opposed to a slight discomfort or nuisance.

295
00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:11.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then that's part one of the story that I want you to tell and part 2 is skipping the line on the solution like we're not like. The solution is a Pandora's box. I don't care whether you have one or not. Right now. We're not even thinking about the the how

296
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we're now jumping to the benefit.

297
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:20.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: now that you, whatever that problem was that you well defined and told the story about somehow it got solved magically.

298
00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now that it's solved.

299
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what does the customer's life look like now, after the problem is solved?

300
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I want you to drill well, beyond just the functional aspects of it.

301
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So what does success mean to them? What does this better version of themselves look like?

302
00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:53.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So in a b 2 b context, I didn't just keep my job. I got promoted or the company really highlighted. This, you know, this decision I made to get them to buy this product. And now we have a lot of success. And here's what that translates to a year later, when it comes to performance reviews or evaluations. Or you know certain kpis or okrs at the business

303
00:35:53.790 --> 00:36:05.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: on the individual side. You all know this right? Imagine, like, I don't know a gym membership or a new home. Whatever version of your life gets better with a big and significant purchase that you made.

304
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:13.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's a version of that that happened, and then how itself gets filled in afterwards. So the formula is, problem.

305
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: plus solution

306
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:20.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: leads to the opportunity. But the order is problem, opportunity, solution.

307
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:33.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So again, like Liliana was saying, don't describe features or functionalities of your products when you do this focus on the experience facing the problem before and after your solution exists.

308
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:37.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then that narrative and story can illustrate those points in an effective and powerful way.

309
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:58.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't need you all to do this. This is more advice from me if you're struggling to think about who you want to serve. So this isn't a prescribed assignment. We don't have a to do. I don't think for it, or maybe we do. You have to remind me if we do but even if we do, it's not something like I think I think most of you. I wouldn't have invested in you if I didn't believe you already had a good idea of what this might be.

310
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:06.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I know you all are already like beyond this point. But I figured I'd remind you, if you ever need to go back to the drawing board or revisit this step.

311
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:09.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay. So

312
00:37:10.077 --> 00:37:19.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: one other thing about finding who to interview. And we talked about this yesterday is to talk to people who have already hired something to make progress.

313
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:28.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you're not trying to talk to people who are potential customers yet. You're trying to talk to people who've already figured out an answer, and you have a hunch that

314
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the answer that they found is

315
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: inadequate relative to what you could offer them.

316
00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:40.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: meaning, I have a better way, but let me understand the people who hired something else, who had the same need as to who I want to start.

317
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So those success stories defined in in the previous step.

318
00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How are they currently doing that? What? What is that? Pandora's box getting filled with without you?

319
00:37:49.964 --> 00:37:56.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And if you can't find anyone who has a solution. So some of you might feel like, well, no one is solving this problem.

320
00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:02.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I have no competition. There's no one on earth that can solve this but me now

321
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I would like I I say that in a cheeky way, because it sounds almost ridiculous.

322
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I will say, though.

323
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:15.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for those of you who I mean, most of you probably don't know but my big claim to fame as a founder is. I founded the 1st coding school.

324
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:20.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I started the 1st coding boot camp many, many years ago. It was called Code Academy, and

325
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it was my little humble claim to disruptive innovation, and that

326
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the way people were solving their problem before I launched my school, and many others thereafter

327
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:35.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: was either going to grad school for computer science or being self-taught.

328
00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:54.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that was the vast majority of the options that were available. So I did fill in a gap that was seemingly non existent before in many respects, and I I felt the benefit of that. So there is a notion of 1st mover, you know, within a segment that is real that I believe in, but it's just rare

329
00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:04.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You can also refine. If you're still struggling to figure out who you should interview. You can also figure it out by doing some initial scoping interviews.

330
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:14.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so you may not have a clear idea on what the direct or indirect competitors are within your segment. So maybe you just need to find people who vaguely fit your criteria.

331
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:22.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: talk to them and like get a feel for what it is that they're trying to do to make progress. So this might be helpful for Andy with your upcoming conversation.

332
00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:27.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? So maybe you don't know where they're coming from, and maybe they don't even know how to describe to you.

333
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You know why they they think they need your help, or what they were struggling with before.

334
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:46.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But you'll start to fill in the pieces of what they were already doing. Maybe it was a person that they consulted with or hired a lot of the times instead of a product or service. It's usually like a human that someone works with to to fill in a gap for something that a product could replace instead.

335
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And sometimes you'll have to get really creative right.

336
00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:59.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it may not always be obvious what the direct or indirect hire was. So you'll have to do some digging, and you'll have to be really intentional about understanding the whole story.

337
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:20.715
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Liliana yesterday talked about the importance of the learning objective. What do you want to find out? So going into the interviews and conversations. It's not enough to just say, Well, I want to figure out who wants to buy from me instead. It's also important to like more narrowly define. You know what that objective is. It could be. I want to figure out

338
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: who

339
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:32.498
Neal Sáles-Griffin: who struggles the most with this problem at the earliest stage. I want to figure out who is willing to pay the most to make progress here. I want to figure out

340
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:40.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Why people leave so failure like studying like firing interviews. So when people let go of a product or they turn

341
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:49.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like there's plenty of jobs to be done, you know, research processes that I work with founders on where they're trying to mitigate churn now that they're getting some traction. But they have, like.

342
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:57.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, before they close their next round. Investors need them to reduce churn by a certain amount, and then we have to go do a jobs to be done journey just to understand why people leave.

343
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I did that recently, actually, with zest

344
00:41:00.745 --> 00:41:07.019
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but once you get there and you have this understanding, then we can hone in on like what the objective is. So

345
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: ask yourself, what's what's the biggest unknown that's important to you to understand right now?

346
00:41:12.323 --> 00:41:17.059
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So. And I just went through some of these examples already, which is just kind of reinforcing it.

347
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:22.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now we can talk about screening criteria. Am I going too fast, Liliana? Or am I good.

348
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.590
Lilliana Robinson: No, this is great.

349
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, cool. So

350
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:41.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the people you should try to talk to 1st are the folks who have invested the most significant energy resources into making the progress that you've identified. So the the highest energy folks.

351
00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:52.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so they care the most about the problem. They're going to give you the most interesting insights early on, and it also sets you up to not have to interview 100 people to figure something out.

352
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you can interview 10 high quality. You know.

353
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:07.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: true, struggling moment folks rather than people who are more loosely defined. And you have to sift through a lot more data and a lot more incomplete data to figure out where the demand is.

354
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.060
Dave Scott: How? How do you assess that? How do you assess.

355
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:09.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

356
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:19.310
Dave Scott: High energy like, particularly like with my case. Right? It might just to get. I'm anxious to find people who've not bought my product right. And so how do I know.

357
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:20.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Buying instead.

358
00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:28.570
Dave Scott: There a lot of stuff. There's a lot. There's a lot of great lot of good games out there. But how do I know that they're high quality or high energy.

359
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. So there's a couple of things I think about Dave. So one is

360
00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:37.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when I assess my current set of customers. I ask myself.

361
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Who among these customers.

362
00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Would I give the world to have more of?

363
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And that's probably not all.

364
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because they're not all created equal.

365
00:42:47.880 --> 00:43:03.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You have a few customers like you, said your Diehards right, the ones that are like the most fervent, the most reliable, the most dependable, and the loyal that you have. Wouldn't it be nice if you had a way to understand who they were, so that you could get more of them into the fold.

366
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.290
Dave Scott: Got it. Okay? So.

367
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:04.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Start there.

368
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.920
Dave Scott: Start there.

369
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:16.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's the high energy, right? So understand the people who are the most dedicated, the most reliable, who benefit the most from what your product is, and double down on understanding and serving them. First.st

370
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:22.779
Dave Scott: Okay, yeah, I've got 4 customers that do a 2 h podcast every week on my product. So maybe I'll start there.

371
00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:34.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There you go. So that being said like, that's where you start. That's not where you end up right, because not everyone's going to be that die hard. But it's a great starting point. To to start with that energy.

372
00:43:34.220 --> 00:44:02.319
Annie Brown: One thing that's that's worked well for us is actually just doing searches on Linkedin and searches online because you'll find a lot of companies are doing Linkedin posts about a problem or doing blog posts about a problem. That's how we actually came about Lex because they were writing about how they wanted to be leaders in the ethical AI space that they wanted, you know, a better solution to unbiased content moderation. And so that's how we

373
00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:17.240
Annie Brown: kind of stepped in because we in start engaging with that content cause. We were passionate about that, too, and then we were able to start customer conversations. So a lot of these companies are writing about the problems that they're trying to solve, too.

374
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:29.264
Dave Scott: Yeah, I think that's a great great for b 2 b, I'm B to C, so I don't have that. But I'm thinking about going on to my competitors discord channels and finding who's a really active there, and then, seeing if I can interview them.

375
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:36.360
Uğur Koç: I also have one thing very specific for you, Dave. I looked a bit into your site.

376
00:44:36.500 --> 00:45:03.409
Uğur Koç: And I saw that you guys are making games of, you know, well known titles like Rambo, so on, so forth. And I think one place to start, maybe, is to go on to steam pages, because on steam pages we have a game that we play amongst the team called Walheim and Walheim, partnered up with a game with a company similar to yours called Game Pound.

377
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:11.520
Uğur Koç: and they have created a tabletop version of the game, and it has gained, like 20,000 followers in the span of one month.

378
00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:35.959
Uğur Koç: so maybe you can scout out games and then ask them to, you know. Ask them if they're interested in a supplementary product such as this, because it seems like a really good place to start, because anyone who's interested in Walheim plus the Rpg genre seems to be very interested. And then and then they're suddenly on there then and then that's a huge place to gain traction, I guess.

379
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.040
Dave Scott: Awesome. Thank you. I appreciate it.

380
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.909
Uğur Koç: I'll send you the link afterwards.

381
00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:41.780
Dave Scott: Thank you.

382
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:51.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So as a millennial, I I tend to use memes to communicate at times. So you all might remember this one.

383
00:45:51.392 --> 00:45:58.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I just dropped the image in as we were talking. Because this is what I'm trying to get to dig. It's you want to talk to people who

384
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in your in your mind are going to basically say, Shut up and take my money.

385
00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:08.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: When they hear about what you're doing, or they're they're more likely to be in that position. That's where I would start, as far as energy.

386
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:12.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you know, it's almost like the product sells itself to the folks that you want to start.

387
00:46:14.884 --> 00:46:24.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Few more principles to keep in mind quality over quantity, like, I said, talking to 100 people, I have so many founders, and and even investors

388
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:28.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that like care about quantity when it comes to customer

389
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:30.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: research and discovery and interviews.

390
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:31.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How many?

391
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:39.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, only 10! 0, that's not impressive, I'm like, well, you know, 10 or 100. It's all about how like, how well of a job you did.

392
00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:41.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Who did you talk to, and

393
00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how much did you actually learn and understand from them?

394
00:46:44.507 --> 00:46:47.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So honing that in is is essential.

395
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:54.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I think Liliana's exercise next week the exercise that she's going to put you all through is going to force

396
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you to think about who.

397
00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when you reach out to them. To present your product.

398
00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: would undoubtedly say yes.

399
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:06.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like, who is a guaranteed yes, for what you're offering.

400
00:47:08.543 --> 00:47:14.046
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Forgive the language here. But this is another reference from Bob's book.

401
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:32.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: between 8 switching. So what this basically means is the idea is that when somebody is complaining about something or unhappy with it, that doesn't mean that they're actually going to change their behavior. It's when they've actually done the work to change or or sign up for something new or different, that something actually comes to

402
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:36.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: relevance when it comes to what you're trying to learn, and and that energy.

403
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:48.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And it's like we said, not about demographics. So we made this point earlier, but just wanted to reinforce it here. It's all about context situation, and far less about those demographic details.

404
00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:59.297
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So here are a few helpful examples and excerpts from the book that I think are worth studying and taking some time to process right now. So let me know if this is legible for all of you, because I know the text is a little small

405
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:06.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but there's the traditional criteria on the left, and then what we tend to speak to is better criteria on the right.

406
00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:09.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So college students with busy and stressful schedules that's very vague.

407
00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:20.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: whereas college students who started going to therapy within the past 6 months. That's an action that they took. That's something that they hired, and it gives you a lot more grounding energy to understand.

408
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You know, I hired something to make progress, and I can work my timeline and my forces of progress around that event itself

409
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:33.019
Neal Sáles-Griffin: rather than just fitting the broader context of being a busy, stressful. You know college student.

410
00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the clinicians who treat a specific specified condition.

411
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, you can even specify the condition

412
00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or

413
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:44.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: clinicians who have recently hired an assistant to better treat the condition

414
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:50.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? So the higher the action that they took where they had to either give something up, sacrifice something, or spend real money.

415
00:48:51.054 --> 00:48:58.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: To make progress. That's where you want to orient who you're speaking to and where you're driving. And then the last one is the crypto one

416
00:48:59.387 --> 00:49:02.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: curious about cryptocurrency, or I think

417
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:08.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: kids these days called crypto. Curious, I think. And then people who recently bought their 1st one.

418
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think you're starting to understand the point of

419
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:17.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when you can actually anchor around an an action that they took as opposed to a

420
00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.827
Neal Sáles-Griffin: category that they fit into. You're gonna get a lot more

421
00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: salient.

422
00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:29.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Starting like a very, very relevant starting point for how you can actually conduct the conversation?

423
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:31.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Does this make sense.

424
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:36.370
Filiz Yönyüksel: Yeah, I want to say something just.

425
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:36.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sure.

426
00:49:37.147 --> 00:50:01.590
Filiz Yönyüksel: Hearing about. All of this makes me feel really good, because, like previously, when since I'm in the like academic research and like product development part I normally don't go to talk with the customers and stuff in general, but, like afterwards, when we're talking with the team is always makes me like furious thinking that we have the solution. Why are not? Why are they not interested in using the solution and like

427
00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:09.690
Filiz Yönyüksel: talking about this like, it's because they are already used to their solutions they're using, or they are not, as you mentioned, are not.

428
00:50:10.274 --> 00:50:14.089
Filiz Yönyüksel: aware of the problem as we are so now

429
00:50:14.493 --> 00:50:28.399
Filiz Yönyüksel: thinking that we should actually like the 1st step, should be talking to people who tried to find the solution, or like are eager to solve. This makes me feel really good, because, like, it will make us feel more hard and stuff.

430
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:40.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Absolutely you nailed it, and I'll I'll probably have to remind some of you of this as we go. I know that just reading it once isn't gonna like, make it easy to do

431
00:50:41.057 --> 00:50:56.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I'll ask you, oh, well, what does the screening criteria mean, or or what did they buy? What? What experience are you working backwards from? And I I find myself doing that a lot, especially early on in program. So all all good, if that ends up being the case with you.

432
00:50:58.831 --> 00:51:16.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Another note for b 2 b companies. Businesses don't buy products. People do. I said this yesterday again. But again, who are the decision makers? What are the layers and the hierarchies within these organizations that you're going to have to pass through? And what are each of them, you know, defining a success. And it's usually very different at different levels.

433
00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is the person who signs off

434
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: on it. There's a person who's the champion who makes the case. There's the person.

435
00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:24.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's an ultimately feedback

436
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: just to

437
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: actually use the product, you know themselves. It matters and to Uer's point earlier.

438
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:36.513
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is not a group interview, obviously. And the other challenge is

439
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's really hard to get these people on the phone sometimes.

440
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? So there, it's hard to find everyone to talk to. So

441
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:50.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if you're only one.

442
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:54.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I hover between the decision maker

443
00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and what I refer to as the champion

444
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:16.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: deal right, because it's going to make them look good to get it done, and it makes either life better or you know their their job easier or something like that. So interviewing the champion, and how they become an advocate of a product or service being adopted within a company, and and signed up for is usually a good place to start

445
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for the P. 2 B. Folks.

446
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:21.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So how do you find these people?

447
00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:35.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's a few recruitment platforms that a lot of our founders and a lot of people tend to find success in, responded I/O userinterviewscom. And there's more that you can now search online and find out about. I will out myself

448
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and say that I've never used them

449
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:41.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: most. And many of our founders have used these tools.

450
00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:48.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But I really am a glutton for punishment in that I like the hard manual journey of having to find them

451
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: without having to.

452
00:52:50.810 --> 00:53:05.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: use a tool like I I like to do it like manual. I like to get referrals. I like to do research. I like to find out where they are, and like introduce myself to them and hunt them down and meet them wherever they might be, and introduce myself and get them to talk

453
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:07.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so Liliana looks like you have your hand up.

454
00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:34.610
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I just wanted to draw everyone's attention to this, because the number one question we'll get after everyone writes. Their screening criteria is, what do I do now? How do I find them? So these are great tools. I want to hear any sorts of ideas you guys are already thinking of, or any hesitations you might have, because this is actually where I see the most founders get stuck. This is what Neil calls the hunt, and it's actually his favorite part. But a lot of the founders find a lot of difficulty here.

455
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Liliana, you might want to speak on this next slide, because I know I think you even wrote this.

456
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:54.050
Lilliana Robinson: I don't know if I wrote this, because I'm not sure what we mean by screening survey.

457
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:58.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, so this is when you're filling out the respondent. I I dot I/O

458
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:13.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like when you're actually filling using the tool. So when you're trying to figure out like, who can fit the criteria to use one of those tools. It's really important to to not ask leading questions and to be really explicit about who you want to talk to, because, unfortunately, when you're paying

459
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:15.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to find people to interview.

460
00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:18.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: sometimes people lie.

461
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:22.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they'll say they fit the criteria, even even if they don't.

462
00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:33.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you're going to have to frame questions and screen who you want to talk to in a very like specific way. Otherwise you'll find people that you'll interview. That will be a waste of your time.

463
00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:37.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the more specific and nuanced you can get for who

464
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:44.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it is that you want to speak to what they recently purchased, and how they're struggling the better off you'll be, and the more time you'll save.

465
00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:55.469
Lilliana Robinson: And that's if you use respond at all. I highly recommend just trying to find them organically through the network of your network. So, like Neil had on another side like.

466
00:54:55.940 --> 00:55:15.550
Lilliana Robinson: Think about Facebook. Think about. I think it's on the next slide, Linkedin. Things like that, because last time we had a lot of founders use respondentio, and they had to throw out probably a quarter of their interviews. So just know that that's part of the game. If you're going to do that like. There will be a few people who are just doing it like kind of lying, and not being super honest.

467
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:20.983
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's also

468
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:25.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: very common for people to try to like find like

469
00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:40.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: friends and other folks like that to help them out with these interviews. Just be careful about like screening them for the actual behavior, right? Because a lot of folks want to helping you out. And you want to open up, you know, possibilities, and you're open to talking to anyone. And if you're even

470
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:51.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: indirectly or vaguely related to the problem you want to solve, you want to talk to, because you're just getting more data. Sometimes we find founders having to throw out certain interviews

471
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:55.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because it doesn't really fit into the right set for you to do the analysis.

472
00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just be mindful of that. Not to waste your time, Monica.

473
00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.129
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, I mean, what if

474
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:04.190
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): the people that you're targeting are

475
00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:07.440
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): not very numerous? Is it

476
00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:14.050
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): best to incentivize it? Especially if you don't know them personally like. Do you need to incentivize them in some way?

477
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:15.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.

478
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:20.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, paying paying them the the people tend to really like Amazon gift cards.

479
00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:24.575
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's like a universally appreciated thing.

480
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.080
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): $10!

481
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:46.049
Dave Scott: Starbucks, gift cards and studies are, they don't have to be. Yeah, 10 bucks is more than enough. It actually, there's actually some some studies that say that the bigger it is, the the more false positives you get, because you'll get people who are not motivated. So the smaller the number, the more qualified your respondents will be. So like 5 or 10 bucks is what I've heard is pretty awesome.

482
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:48.210
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay. Thanks.

483
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:54.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Any.

484
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:59.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You're muted.

485
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:24.179
Annie Brown: Always got to be at least one in a call. So as far as finding the type of customer like a lot of our interviews up until now have been I guess, with the well, it wasn't an interview, but like a lot of the customers we've talked to and dive dove into their problem have been like kind of startups or or small businesses. Up until now. One thing I'm trying to really learn is like what

486
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:37.160
Annie Brown: bigger enterprise companies, what their problems are? Because I you know, that's, I think our our next step. Is it worth putting in the time to try to find somebody at those enterprise companies? Or

487
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.550
Annie Brown: do you get kind of the same

488
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:45.400
Annie Brown: input same problem at a smaller company versus a a enterprise.

489
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I think to Monica's point yesterday. I think it does tend to change

490
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:58.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at at different sizes. So it would be worth creating a different set of conversations within that category.

491
00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:00.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's going to take some time.

492
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:00.780
Annie Brown: Yeah.

493
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:09.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right cause. It takes time to schedule those conversations and all that, so you won't get it all done in one fell swoop. So I think Liliana also mentioned this last time yesterday, but

494
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:13.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we, what we want to do with you now is, do your best to

495
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:18.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: fit into the parameters of when we can like, at least do this 1st rep.

496
00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:26.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So wherever you can talk to in the next few weeks that you can schedule time with great, so that we can help you, and at least demonstrate what to do and how to analyze the information.

497
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Then take all the time you need to structure your own.

498
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:36.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, process relative to those larger clients that might take a longer time to book. You know meetings with.

499
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.150
Annie Brown: Great.

500
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:41.639
Lilliana Robinson: That's true, I would say what Neil's saying.

501
00:58:41.700 --> 00:59:00.519
Lilliana Robinson: We're defining round as like a full set of jobs to be done. So like every I say, like round Neil might say, like Set, that's every 12 interviews that's like a full set. So you're going to be able to derive jobs out of that set from a specific learning objective that you made. So that'll be like a complete round or set that we're doing together.

502
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:17.069
Lilliana Robinson: like Neil is saying skew that toward what would be easier to accomplish, just so that you can stay with the group because it is a learning exercise, even if, like the thing you want to learn is actually like more high priority that you want to do later, like with enterprise. But it's really important that you separate them.

503
00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:18.930
Lilliana Robinson: So like an enterprise

504
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:32.160
Lilliana Robinson: company, should never fall into the same screening criteria for you. Annie has, like a small business, because those are completely different. I'm sure they have different struggles, and a very well tuned and narrow screening criteria would never be able to put like both of them in.

505
00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:56.169
Lilliana Robinson: And then the last thing I was going to answer. Your question is, it depends on your learning objective. So when you were saying like, Oh, should I ask enterprise? Should I include that? Well, is that what you want to know like, is your learning objective to find out if it's worth it to like, go toward that direction which is something like Agent lunar, for example. There they have that kind of learning objective like. Is this vertical worth it for me to pursue? If that's how you feel. You can do that as like your second set.

506
00:59:56.170 --> 01:00:04.120
Lilliana Robinson: And most people in program at this point, since we've been so heavily immersing everybody in jobs to be done for the past like 6 programs.

507
01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:12.840
Lilliana Robinson: I would say the majority do at least 2 rounds, so I'll do one together. And then I would say, like at least half go into another. And some people even do like 3.

508
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:17.849
Lilliana Robinson: So keep that in mind that this is just like we're learning together. But it's not going to stop after this.

509
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.409
Annie Brown: Okay, yeah, that's that's super helpful.

510
01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:26.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Great. Alright, I'm gonna keep blazing through here.

511
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:31.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So what we're we're good on time. Okay, cool. So framing the interview. So

512
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's also about timing.

513
01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:44.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's not just about finding people who fit the criteria, but they need to have fit the criteria in the right timeframe where you can actually

514
01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: help them recall what happened.

515
01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:51.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's folks that you might find who had this problem 3 years ago.

516
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:53.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and when you speak to them

517
01:00:53.610 --> 01:01:09.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's going to be really difficult to get them to recall what was going on 3 years ago, to get them to want to buy and to be ready for that every now and then, if you're good enough, you can still uncover some things. But I just gotta say it's really really hard. And and for that matter, for most of you.

518
01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:13.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that 1st interview that you do with with what we are teaching you.

519
01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:26.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's probably gonna suck like it's gonna you're not going to know what to say. You're not going to know how to start the conversation. It's going to be uncomfortable and awkward. You might stumble over your words, you'll you'll wish you could. Just it. It like, forget it ever happened.

520
01:01:27.192 --> 01:01:33.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And that's okay. That that's kind of comes with the territory. I I refer to it as the sacrificial pancake.

521
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:53.135
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I don't know if any of you all ever make pancakes, but you know that 1st one's never quite right, you know. Same with sales calls. It's it's a whole thing. Fun side note. If you I think if you Google sacrificial pancake I wrote an article about that idea many, many years ago, and I show up on the 1st page. Anyway. So

522
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:58.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: also, when you're conducting the interview some some strange things might happen.

523
01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:02.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: People will tend to plan up

524
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if they feel like they're being interrogated

525
01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:12.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? And they'll be hesitant to to give you details. So one thing you may have noticed from Bob's mattress interview

526
01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:17.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is that he was very cordial and friendly, and it felt more like

527
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:24.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like a true discussion and dialogue, and not just like a sit down formal and okay. So tell me about this time.

528
01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:31.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you all are going to have to try to develop your own style and your own relationship with your subjects and the people you're interviewing

529
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:39.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for me. I really enjoy relating to who I'm talking to and almost act like I'm having a really like just fun time with them, like I'm sitting down for coffee

530
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:47.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and chatting to get to know them better. So I I tend to take that approach. You have to develop your own, you know. Particular vibe

531
01:02:47.861 --> 01:02:52.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but at the end of the day what's really, really fun is that after 30 min.

532
01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: usually, if you did it right, they're sitting back and wondering

533
01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how you got them

534
01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:10.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to share so much about their lives. They're like sitting there like, how did you get me to say all that? But people love talking about themselves, and if you get them going. They tend to divulge way more than you ever thought that they

535
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:13.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I really enjoy doing that.

536
01:03:15.446 --> 01:03:16.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's see.

537
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:25.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I I this is a pretty aggressive word, right interrogation, but it does feel like a casual conversation like talking to a friend. Much easier said than done,

538
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:29.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and also going into the process with humility. So

539
01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:43.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: unfortunately, you all are really smart people and smart founders tend to think that they they figure out what's going on very quickly. So when you're having a conversation, one mistake that people tend to make in these interviews is that as the person's answering your question.

540
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:46.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you start to jump in and fill in what they're going to say.

541
01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:50.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, okay, I get it. I see what you're saying, or I know what you mean. Or do you mean this?

542
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Don't do that.

543
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let them speak.

544
01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:58.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And there's even a version of this that I recommend called playing dumb

545
01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:06.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like, even if you think you understand what they mean by referring to a particular thing in a particular way. Ask them to explain it further.

546
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:22.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: even if it made sense to you. No, wait. What do you mean by that? Or I'm actually not sure how much that is, or what does fast mean to you, or what does hard mean to you when is something easy. So I'll draw the contrast in whatever they're saying, and I'll ask them to elaborate or explain what the difference is.

547
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it. You're kind of trying to

548
01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:33.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: be a little bit more ignorant in in how you're interacting with them so that you can get them to articulate in their own language rather than filling in with your words.

549
01:04:35.015 --> 01:04:50.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We talked about causality already. We talked about trade offs as well, so the notion of trade offs is that it's not just all in or all out. I'm weighing certain factors to say yes or no to a given decision I need to make when I'm switching from one thing to another.

550
01:04:50.523 --> 01:04:55.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And most people don't know why they do what they do, but they think that they know.

551
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:56.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and that includes all of you.

552
01:04:57.030 --> 01:05:06.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So one great exercise is for you all to interview each other, or you know, maybe even people on your team on a recent purchase that you've made, and I'll demonstrate this. Live probably tomorrow or next week.

553
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But the whole idea is that, like.

554
01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:16.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when I ask you about some purchase you made you tend to go. Oh, well, I did it, you know, because I couldn't sleep at night. So I bought this new pillow.

555
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:36.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it turns out like that wasn't the only the whole story turns out that there was. You know, someone got upset with you the next day because you reacted bad because you had a bad night's sleep, or you know your partner was rolling around the middle of the night and really upset, you know, like there's always more detail going on than what you remember at the top of your head as to why something happened.

556
01:05:37.823 --> 01:05:49.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then here's another sad truth of people lie. They don't do it with malintent, or, you know, on purpose to mislead you. But sometimes people are lying to themselves about why they did something.

557
01:05:50.160 --> 01:06:08.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and we have to be empathetic to that, because every now and then you'll talk to someone, and they'll they'll they'll obfuscate, or they'll omit something from the story at least initially because then maybe they're not comfortable yet, or there's some other reason why they might not be divulging the whole truth about a situation, so just be ready for that

558
01:06:10.559 --> 01:06:16.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as far as the process itself. We have a few more tips. One is. This might surprise some people, but have more than one person on the call.

559
01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so ideally. The the magic number is 2.

560
01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you want one person. Oh, look at my balloons. You want one person who is driving the conversation.

561
01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:32.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and another person who is actively taking notes and trying to fill in the timeline and paying attention to what's missing.

562
01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: By the way, when I say on the call.

563
01:06:35.983 --> 01:06:38.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I mean it meaning not a video.

564
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:39.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but a phone call.

565
01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Does anyone want to guess why

566
01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm recommending, not doing a video, and instead doing a phone call.

567
01:06:50.880 --> 01:07:01.150
Talitha Abraham: Is it because when people see your face, maybe they're more likely to change their answer based on your own reactions that you naturally have? So yeah.

568
01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:02.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Exactly.

569
01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:06.840
Florence Ettlin: You build empathy with the person when you can see their expression. And

570
01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:12.370
Florence Ettlin: I don't know. Yeah, you you become very friendly when you're even in person or over a video. So.

571
01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:17.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And you also worry about what you look like and how you're re representing yourself on screen, right?

572
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:24.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They're worried about how they look and how they're coming off. You're worried about how you look when you have you and your team member.

573
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:31.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you can't always react to what they're saying, because maybe they're saying something that's really exciting for you. But you're trying to

574
01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:43.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: stay face and make sure you're maintaining your composure to drive the conversation. But on the side you want to be able to like, go, wow! That's really interesting. Let's dig in here more. So on a phone call, you're more likely to be able to do some of those dynamic

575
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: reactions and plans as opposed to

576
01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:57.589
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when more bias enters the conversation and situation. When you're conducting the interview. So by and large. We've learned that the best form of a jobs to be done interview over both in person and video

577
01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is an actual voice phone call.

578
01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:01.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Dave.

579
01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:07.769
Dave Scott: And so, yeah, so so a zoom call with a video off does not count or does count.

580
01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:09.945
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That counts. That counts.

581
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think a phone call is.

582
01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:12.890
Dave Scott: Who's better?

583
01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:16.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Even better, but that that works as well.

584
01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:32.420
Lilliana Robinson: Do you have advice for solo founders? So for everyone that didn't hear like the the very important part from this slide is 2 people on the call. So you need a note taker. One's the driver. One's the note taker, slash kind of navigator filling out the timeline.

585
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:53.840
Lilliana Robinson: and it needs to be a no video call. Now, you don't have to be in the same place, although it is helpful when the 2 of you are in the same place, because then you can hit mute, and you can discuss and say, Oh, you forgot to ask this, or we need to go down this thread if you have to be far away, you can just have a separate like chat open. So you guys are like talking on the back end. But we do have several solo founders, so I'm sure they're wondering what.

586
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You've got a few options.

587
01:08:57.956 --> 01:09:10.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One you can do it with fellow founders here. It's always good for you all to get more reps and to support each other and to gain that experience when you have. So we've actually not only had some jobs to be done.

588
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:13.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We have founders who form sales groups

589
01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:29.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: where you all like pile together, and you sell on each other's behalf because it turns out, isn't it easier to sell someone else's product than your own. Sometimes, because you don't even care. It's like the the risk is super low. I I can. I could screw up selling, you know Dave's evil genius products because it's not mine, right?

590
01:09:30.090 --> 01:09:35.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's kind of fun to do that. And I recommend that with the interviews, too, because you'll have people who will hear different things than you.

591
01:09:36.086 --> 01:09:41.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And when I have founders who get particularly stuck, meaning you've tried to do interviews. And now you're struggling.

592
01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:43.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: calling. The big guns.

593
01:09:44.090 --> 01:10:00.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Neil and Liliana are at the ready, so I won't do every interview with you, but I'll jump in there. I have a lot of fun conducting interviews, and either driving the conversation or playing the the passenger seat. I'm always happy to join you all, if if that's meaningful or helpful, especially towards the end.

594
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:29.239
Lilliana Robinson: If you are, if you're not struggling and you don't need to pull in the big guns. Other options are. We? Do have Chloe, who has helped other people. Chloe's on the call, and Chloe can join your interviews as well as George and Kevin are 2 associates. You guys haven't met Kevin yet, but he knows this well, and he can help you. And then George is on the call learning this alongside with you, so I'm sure he'd love the opportunity to not take for you guys as a learning experience. So you also have extra hands here that you can employ, especially for all of my founders going through this alone.

595
01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:36.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One other mistake I know some founders make is they outsource the responsibility of conducting these interviews.

596
01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:43.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: meaning they'll they won't as founders, or as the CEO take ownership of the process at this stage.

597
01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I'm telling you

598
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:53.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like there are much larger businesses and much later stages where the leadership are required to be in the room or the part of these interviews, and it's really important

599
01:10:53.910 --> 01:11:06.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because you, as a leader of your business and the owner of it are setting the vision in the North Star for this. So no one's going to care or understand or appreciate what's being done with your business and who you want to help more than you.

600
01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:11.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I can't emphasize enough how important it is for you not to treat this as like a side mission

601
01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:19.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that someone else needs to deal with and come back to you with their findings. And it's such something that you're taking ownership over and leading the charge on, and then maybe

602
01:11:19.570 --> 01:11:33.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: follow up interviews or or additional learning questions or more digging can be done with others that you then guide and participate in later, but at least the initial waves of this should be done by the owners. In my opinion.

603
01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:41.100
Lilliana Robinson: Also Akadena. Are you interested in being some of these founders note takers on the calls.

604
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:41.880
akadinayadegar: Since you're also.

605
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:53.489
Lilliana Robinson: Jobs to be done. Okay, cool. So we also have Acadena. You guys can employ as a notetaker as well. So we just want to make sure everybody has someone else on the call for the debrief do. Is that something that we have a slide for? Now.

606
01:11:56.830 --> 01:12:04.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think so. I think you know, I'm going through it all now. So I did the phone video thing. Making sure you record the conversations.

607
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:06.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you'll be surprised. I know it sounds awkward now.

608
01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:10.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like 99% of the time they're comfortable with you recording.

609
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:32.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And the way that you make them comfortable is you make it very clear like, Hey, we're not going to use this information for any other purpose than for our own research. We will never divulge anything personal about you. We won't identify your name. Nothing like that. Usually people are cool with it. If they're not, you'll have to take really copious notes, but it's rare that someone will reject it.

610
01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:40.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And we talked about phone being greater than video. We also talked about taking notes. So just be ready to take them in real time.

611
01:12:40.929 --> 01:12:47.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: usually having a shared place where you can both fill in the timeline, if you're doing it with 2 people, is really good.

612
01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then can't emphasize enough.

613
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Bake in time for the debrief after every scheduled interview.

614
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:56.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Do not, I repeat, do not

615
01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:00.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: stack a bunch of interviews without time for debrief in between.

616
01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:08.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Because what happens is is your head starts to conflate all of the different inputs from different conversations. And then it's hard to keep track of what you heard and from home.

617
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:24.939
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you want at least 10 to 15 min after a 20 or 30 min interview to go. What did we learn here? What did we hear? How do we map the forces and where are what questions do we still have, and what don't we agree on between the 2 of us, about what we just heard?

618
01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:27.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Really.

619
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:51.079
Lilliana Robinson: Wait. Yeah, on this, on this slide. So the things that need to happen in the debrief. 1st of all, you should have been filling out the timeline and taking notes during the call. After the call. In this we're saying 10 to 15, I think in the 1st few times it will take you guys the 15 to 30 for the debrief. You're going to finish the timeline. So if you were rushing through and finishing the call, you might have missed the last few things. So finish the timeline.

620
01:13:51.310 --> 01:14:08.969
Lilliana Robinson: Then you're going to do a diagram of forces like we talked about on the call yesterday the forces come after the call. So you're going to discuss together like felt like this was a push. This was a pull when it says Malas here. That's more about less about. So that is addressed in demand side sales the book we're going to assign, you guys.

621
01:14:09.426 --> 01:14:33.520
Lilliana Robinson: But Neil has kind of been hinting at that this whole time. And then the last thing here which is listed as Step 2 is making a preliminary jobs to be done. Statement for that one interview. So you're going to make like a hypothesis kind of like a guess. And that's just so that you can help summarize it for yourself, and we're going to use those later. I'll explain in part 4 what we're going to do with that. But those are the 3 things you want to accomplish in the debrief, and it's really important that you do that.

622
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:41.879
Lilliana Robinson: Don't stack another, even not even another interview. Don't just go into another meeting right after, I promise you you will forget the stuff when it's not fresh in your brain.

623
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:47.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right, we're almost done.

624
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we'll talk about completing your 1st interview.

625
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:54.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then we'll kind of talk through the script of what this looks like, because

626
01:14:54.910 --> 01:15:08.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we'll get it wrong. And that's okay. So you introduce yourself. You thank them effusively for taking the time to talk to you. You ask for permission to record solely for our internal purposes. Then you set the stage and expectations.

627
01:15:08.690 --> 01:15:26.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So no right or wrong answers. You've heard Bob, do this for the mattress interview, but we're revisiting it and giving you the script. We might ask really weird, detailed questions. It's all part of the process. If you can't remember something that's okay, sways your concerns there. And also, just then this becomes important.

628
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Ask for forgiveness

629
01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:32.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and permission to interrupt them politely during the conversation. Because

630
01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:39.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: people, when you interview them tend to get off track. Sometimes they tend to go down these paths, and you're running out of time, and you don't want to be rude.

631
01:15:40.034 --> 01:15:45.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So, but but they they end up kind of going long winded in a direction that isn't helpful to you anymore.

632
01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:53.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you're gonna have to jump in and go, hey? Just to respect your time. I want. I want to make sure that we, you know, get get done in time to to get you back. What you need to do?

633
01:15:53.490 --> 01:15:57.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Can we? Can we jump more in the into this next subject, or can I ask you additional question?

634
01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:04.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And having a second person with you helps a lot for that, too, because they can kind of break up that monotony. So it's not just a 1 on one

635
01:16:05.408 --> 01:16:16.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but as you're doing the interview figure out, you know where the energy is. So every now and then you're covering like the the main details of the timeline. But when you hear someone express some sort of

636
01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:22.139
Neal Sáles-Griffin: frustration, or there's a stronger emotional reaction at a point when they're telling you their story.

637
01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's when you want to slow down

638
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and dig deep and go. Okay, wait. Let's talk more about

639
01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:32.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or and then. Now you can imagine that timeline like, almost like, if anyone's done any video editing.

640
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:39.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know how like, when you're doing something, either an Imovie or something, and you zoom in. And then the space of the video bands a bit.

641
01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:47.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's what we're trying to get you all to do in some of these interviews and conversations when you have a particularly like like juicy moment that you're talking to them about.

642
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:54.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it got to the point where I'm up at 4 am. Searching online for mattresses. Ding, ding, ding, okay.

643
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:56.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what's going on at 4 am.

644
01:16:56.190 --> 01:17:01.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right now, now, this is this is pretty serious. Let's let's let's dig deeper. Let's figure out more of what's going on there.

645
01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:12.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One of my favorite phrases that I say a lot as I go through. All of this is context creates meaning and contrast creates value or contrast creates meaning. I play around with these words a lot, but I learned them all from Bob.

646
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:16.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But here's a few comparisons that kind of speak to these points.

647
01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're good with time. Okay, cool. So why do it virtually?

648
01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's a vague question.

649
01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:42.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You can clarify. Why do it virtually by saying, Why not? Just get into your car and drive to the doctor. So if you add a little bit more of a nudge about what not to do or why not to do something? It doesn't lead the witness. It activates the person you're interviewing to answer a more direct contrast to what they're doing.

650
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:52.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So when someone says it installed fast compared to it installed fast in just under 2 min the last program took 5 min to install.

651
01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:56.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you're trying to color more of what happened before and around

652
01:17:56.290 --> 01:18:06.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: something rather than just taking them at their word that something happened quickly or slowly, or easily, or in a hard way. So you hear hard, fast, quick, slow, easy.

653
01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:14.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Don't settle for the word, meaning all types of things to all types of people, or you thinking you know what they mean, get them to elaborate and expand on.

654
01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:23.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I bought this new laptop, and it's really good compared to. I bought this new laptop, and it's really good.

655
01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Or I bought this laptop. And it's good.

656
01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:36.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's different ways of, you know, emotional reactions that people have. And you want to respond to the version of it that actually, you know, triggers more, more depth and energy.

657
01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:43.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's RAM, anyway? You know what I mean versus. Why don't you know how much RAM you have?

658
01:18:43.530 --> 01:18:44.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

659
01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:50.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you're trying to relate to them as well? And as you're having these conversations

660
01:18:51.410 --> 01:19:03.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: rather than putting them on a back foot and making them either self conscious or uncertain, try to like, align with them a bit. Try to relate to them. Show that you understand, and you can empathize with what they're going through and how they're thinking about.

661
01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:07.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Why were you at the doctor.

662
01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:12.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's very invasive as an initial question or a very personal one. Ask.

663
01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:18.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: whereas if you just say, Hey, I've got a personal question and feel free not to answer it if you're not comfortable. But why are you at the doctor?

664
01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:28.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's a way to frame things so that you're being kind and and considerate to another human who you're asking very particular questions to. And I've made this mistake myself.

665
01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:49.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or I've said literally, why were you at the doctor, and someone goes. That's a little personal to ask, you know, and I'm like, Oh, I'm so sorry, like I had to walk it back. So I'm saying it, not from a position of like being better like I've made these mistakes myself. But just be mindful of the person on the other end, and how they might receive a question that could be really, really digging in. And to Uer's point yesterday

666
01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:57.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it is sometimes relevant to ask at this depth, and you will surprise yourself with what people are willing to share.

667
01:19:58.150 --> 01:20:02.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like people get really honest and vulnerable when they feel like they can trust you

668
01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:05.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in that you're having a genuine conversation with them, and that you care

669
01:20:06.047 --> 01:20:10.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so to the extent that you actually do is going to make a difference here in what data you can gather.

670
01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:16.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and this kind of goes without saying. But I do need to say it

671
01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:26.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: sometimes. There might be a disagreement where you may not agree with what they're saying, or they get a detail that's like wrong. That, you know, is factually incorrect.

672
01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:30.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is why you want to have more than one person on the call.

673
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:36.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because, instead of putting the person you're interviewing on the spot about a specific detail that may or may not be right.

674
01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:42.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You and the other person could question it to each other on the call in front of the person you're interviewing.

675
01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:46.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and go. I think that they they meant this. No, no, I, this is what I heard.

676
01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:48.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then you go. Well, what do you think?

677
01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:52.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So? There's a way to indirectly get them to weigh in, to settle

678
01:20:53.433 --> 01:20:57.096
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is there something that's confusing or in disagreement between you all?

679
01:20:57.470 --> 01:21:00.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's really helpful to have a 3rd person in there for that purpose?

680
01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How is buying a phone like buying a laptop

681
01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:17.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: rather than asking them the same question and getting them to just. But why? But why? But why can you explain that again? Can you explain in different words? Sometimes you find you hit a wall.

682
01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:26.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: even though you're trying to dig in on something important. So you have to reframe the question, or dig deeper and add more layers to the question. To get closer.

683
01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I just ran through all of these tips were these helpful.

684
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:37.389
Lilliana Robinson: Do you guys have questions? We should pause for a second cause. That was a lot of tips.

685
01:21:44.520 --> 01:22:05.799
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, remember that you can revisit this. Remember that you can revisit this recording. Once you have an interview scheduled on the calendar, you guys are going to start like panicking and want to write a script, and I'm telling you you don't need a script. See? See it as a casual conversation, and revisit this recording. Just watch these tips again, and so that you feel prepared, and you can always ask us questions. Then.

686
01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:20.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright, we're almost done here. Y'all so hypotheticals and generalizations. The would you question is so common, and it just breaks my heart when I hear you all ask it. It's like asking someone hypothetically what they would rather do.

687
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:23.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Do you think you're going to get an honest answer from them?

688
01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:29.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Probably not. So it's like asking someone what they would pay.

689
01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, well, they said they would pay $20. Oh, they said they would. Did you ask them for the money?

690
01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:37.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, but they said they would. Oh, sure. Okay.

691
01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:45.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, make them take up their checkbook, you know. Pull out your little, you know. All right, bump it. Send me the money. I'll send you a venmo right now. That's how you know it's real.

692
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: not just someone claiming that they would.

693
01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So be really careful about generalizations and hypotheticals?

694
01:22:52.327 --> 01:23:04.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Also, it's gonna feel really good when someone's like, especially when you're interviewing recent customers. And they're talking about how happy they are with what they bought from you, and how great you are and how much they want to help you. It's gonna feel great.

695
01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But you're gonna have to be.

696
01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:11.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, very, very gracious, and how you parlay that into making it back about them

697
01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:22.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: rather than centering it around your experience, and how awesome you were, and how great your product is. There's a time and place for you to get that kind of feedback and praise, but it's not in the context of a jobs interview.

698
01:23:24.394 --> 01:23:31.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Catch yourself with assumptions. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. That's a very common phrase that when you say it, and you hear yourself saying it.

699
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Take a step back, pause.

700
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:41.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Don't let it make perfect sense. Help them unlock and elaborate on. Why, that makes sense.

701
01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:44.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: whatever it is that they're saying, don't just fill in the gaps.

702
01:23:45.343 --> 01:23:48.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And when you notice, people are kind of cutting it short.

703
01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:52.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: one really cool technique

704
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is to repeat what you think. You're hearing them say incorrectly

705
01:23:58.050 --> 01:24:03.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because it will trigger them to step in and go. That's not what I said, or that's not what I meant.

706
01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:11.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it forces them to re-engage in the conversation, to elaborate and give you more detail and color the situation again. This is a really clever one.

707
01:24:12.312 --> 01:24:18.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Again, stay away from product related questioning, focus on the story of making progress the demand side, not the supply side.

708
01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:21.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Most, if not, all of you are going to be drawn

709
01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:25.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with extreme magnetism towards product feedback

710
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:30.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: feels good again. But it's not what we're going for right now.

711
01:24:30.290 --> 01:24:39.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you did that 1st interview with all these tips that we gave you. It didn't go so well. So you have to do more. But you'll naturally start to identify clusters.

712
01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:46.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you may have gone in with a very well defined screening criteria. But after 2 or 3 interviews, you realize, okay, we got to start over.

713
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:50.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I thought I was interviewing the right person. But actually, it turns out, these are the people we need to talk to.

714
01:24:51.090 --> 01:25:00.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you may have to start over again, and that's okay. But just be mindful of it, and recognize that when you're doing it right, when you know you're doing it right.

715
01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It does get to the point where, on the back end.

716
01:25:02.610 --> 01:25:17.079
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you and the person you've been doing the interviews with go. They're going to say this next, or you already know what job cluster they're fitting into, and you kind of start to place them into that bucket on the back end in real time. That's when you know you're onto something, and I get really excited whenever that happens.

717
01:25:18.299 --> 01:25:21.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So to nearly wrap up, you refine your clusters.

718
01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:27.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: one to 3 high level Jtbd. Statements which will give you the format for and explain to you what that looks like.

719
01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:41.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then it becomes your source of truth for your company. So it becomes usually a document or a resource, and we'll have you all present this right after mentor madness. And actually, I think in week 2 as well. So be 2 phases of it.

720
01:25:42.155 --> 01:25:45.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Where we'll have you all present to each other what you think

721
01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know your your jobs to be done are for each of your respective companies.

722
01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:50.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Annie.

723
01:25:53.840 --> 01:26:15.819
Annie Brown: So when when we were doing this for the application process, we broke up our 3 jobs to be done into the 3 verticals that we are focusing on. So what would you suggest? For this like since we're doing? I guess 12. Would we do 3 for one vertical or 4, for one vertical, 4 for one vertical, 4 for another, vertical.

724
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:23.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I don't have a hard number for you, because we have to find out from the conversations. So some of you might have one

725
01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:25.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: overall.

726
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:32.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: A few of you might have 2 or 3 per vertical. So there's anywhere from 6 to 7 or 8 that you're talking about.

727
01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:35.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, the number of inner. Okay? Sorry.

728
01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:42.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So they. So it sounds like from what Liliana just clarified with me that you're asking about separate

729
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:47.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: sets of interviews with different learning criteria, different segments that you're talking to.

730
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:48.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Is that right?

731
01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.199
Annie Brown: So like. If if the total number that we are supposed to do is 12,

732
01:26:53.691 --> 01:27:01.510
Annie Brown: should we? Should we do 12, all focused on one vertical, or would, should we do some verticals

733
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:03.619
Annie Brown: within that 12.

734
01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:24.709
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, so you're asking, based on the application process. So in that one, we didn't give you guys all of this specific requirements and such, because it was much more an introduction to see how you guys fared with that. Those actually all need to be different sets. So I would not put a bunch of, because there's not going to be a screening criteria that encompasses all of those different.

735
01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:25.630
Annie Brown: People.

736
01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:36.479
Lilliana Robinson: If if you are narrow enough, those people actually won't fit into your little like circle that you're going to draw of this is who I want to interview. So you're going to want to do different sets. I would start with

737
01:27:36.754 --> 01:28:04.509
Lilliana Robinson: whatever learning objective you're most burning to solve, or what? Whoever is the easiest for you to get a hold of. That's who I would start with. Another parameter, I think, is like, who is the person people most likely to give you money, because that's probably the vertical you want to learn the most about. So that's also something you can think about. But a lot of you probably did like 3 Jtbds and did like 3 different people. And they actually weren't aligned something we didn't say in this. But you can think from a data perspective.

738
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:18.909
Lilliana Robinson: A lot of times people will come back to us and say, I'm not seeing any patterns. I've done 10 interviews so far, and they just seem all over the place like, I'm not really learning anything. Seems like everyone kind of has a different issue.

739
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:37.279
Lilliana Robinson: I will challenge them. And I'll say, let me see your screening criteria. And it's usually so vague that there are multiple different, like sets of people within that. So I usually make a promise to you guys that if your screening criteria is too vast and you're interviewing like people who should be put in completely different little sets.

740
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:43.769
Lilliana Robinson: You're gonna see no patterns. It's going to seem random. Nothing's gonna emerge. You need those people to be extremely alike

741
01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:50.370
Lilliana Robinson: to be able to see like the small nuances within them, and then derive a job statement from that. So it's really important.

742
01:28:50.470 --> 01:29:03.960
Lilliana Robinson: So a lot of you are thinking about many different verticals. I think at least 3 companies on the call. I think they need to be completely separate, so that you can actually see the patterns within, like each kind of set of people's personal scenarios with that company.

743
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.990
Annie Brown: Okay. Great.

744
01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:07.619
Lilliana Robinson: Does that make sense, Annie? I'm really glad you asked.

745
01:29:07.770 --> 01:29:10.839
Annie Brown: Yeah, that that's gonna help streamline it for sure.

746
01:29:11.290 --> 01:29:17.530
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. And then, Neil, what were you saying about amount of jobs at the end? You're talking about final jobs that you come out with.

747
01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:24.099
Lilliana Robinson: So Neil was saying, some people will end up with one. Some people will end up with 2 or 3. This is per set.

748
01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:40.960
Lilliana Robinson: So like, if you're doing 3 different verticals. We're just gonna focus on the 1st set you're doing like for Agent Lunar. They're thinking about many different verticals. I think they decided to start with Etsy Sellers. So for the Etsy Sellers, they'll decide that the Etsys sellers have 2 to 3 different job statements or reasons that they want to make progress.

749
01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:55.110
Lilliana Robinson: and then they'll be able to design for that. And then another set will have a completely different set of drop statements, and then it's up to you who you want to target first.st That's when we get into the fun. And we decide on product ramifications and prototyping and implications like that

750
01:29:55.870 --> 01:29:57.460
Lilliana Robinson: that was on meal. You can.

751
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:12.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Awesome. We're about to get into questions because I'm I'm at the tail end of what we're covering today. But just to kind of bring it home. Once you have the job statements which I know is going to take some time to get to it's gonna create a North Star for you.

752
01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:22.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it's gonna be a super helpful resource. And I think it'll give you a lot of alignment with your team and with potential investors about what it is you're here to do

753
01:30:22.582 --> 01:30:28.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and remember, as people join your team, they're not going to know which office to be done means. And, by the way.

754
01:30:28.670 --> 01:30:33.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this is also important. I've been preaching about jobs to be done for the past 2 days.

755
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:35.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't recommend

756
01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: sharing it outside of this group or our circle.

757
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:40.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So has anyone ever seen the movie Fight club.

758
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:46.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know? Fight club? No, not too old. Yes. What's the 1st rule of fight? Club folks.

759
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.589
Dave Scott: You don't talk about 5 clubs.

760
01:30:49.810 --> 01:30:59.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Don't talk about Fight Club. That's jobs to be done. So it's like we don't have to talk about it like I I did. Investors don't care, they using jobs to be done like no one cares but us.

761
01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:03.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So who cares like? It's just customer discovery. It's just research.

762
01:31:03.954 --> 01:31:13.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It can be your secret sauce, for all that matters. What matters is is I'm demonstrating that I understand more about the people that I'm serving as customers than anyone else in the market.

763
01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:34.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know things that other people don't. I have secrets to share with you. So just know that, like there's no tattoo to get to represent your knowledge of this. It's more just a tool for you to. I don't care if you come up with a new name for it for your company. It's more about just you knowing how to do this than it is like us, giving you the exact explicit way to say that you understand

764
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:36.570
Lilliana Robinson: Cool.

765
01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Something. Oh, you want to add something.

766
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:53.579
Lilliana Robinson: I was just gonna say, sometimes Neil calls it the force, like in Star Wars. So it's just kind of like a tool in your tool belt. A lot of people are going to get to mentor madness, or like investor calls that they're going to say like, Oh, we did jobs to be done this time, or we've done 10 jobs to be done. Interviews. Half of the people

767
01:31:53.580 --> 01:32:17.859
Lilliana Robinson: will have no idea what you're talking about, and the other half. It's it's not as like impressive as it sounds. What's impressive are your insights and your deep knowledge of your customer. So it's demonstrating how well you understand the customer and the decisions you've made to serve them based on those insights. So like for us, it's a huge deal for you to do all of these assignments and exercises, but Neil's like putting it into perspective for you, so that you understand how the outside world will understand and and value it.

768
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:24.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I mean, honestly, it. It's actually sometimes a red flag when someone claims that they know jobs to be done

769
01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:42.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like, I'm a professor at at the business school, you know, at Northwestern, and when I hear people say, Oh, yeah. Well, I know jobs to be done, and then I hear them, I'm like, tell me, what do you think it means? And I'm like, Oh, oops like they don't really get it so. If if anything just like, keep it to yourself and do your thing with it. And don't dwell on bragging about how well you know it.

770
01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:46.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: okay. So

771
01:32:46.400 --> 01:33:01.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Ingrainian company culture. I've talked about that. We're going to help you all make a document so that when you have new employees or new team members that join they'll be able to very quickly spin up and understand what the jobs are at the company. So they know who they're helping with you with all the work that you've done?

772
01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:13.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then, lastly, this leads into product strategy. So you get to go back to the drawing board to go. Okay, well, what have we learned here just like we did with the Mcdonald's 1 yesterday?

773
01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:16.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now that we understand the job, what do we need to do

774
01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:37.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with our product or service to better address it and to answer it. So there's this activity called opportunity map mapping. I'm sure some of you are familiar with. That you can do so you can focus on those forces and I, and through those forces you can imagine ways to either remove or add or refine certain features within your product.

775
01:33:38.428 --> 01:33:54.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's the opportunity solution tree, which is outlined really well in the book which we'll refer to as well. But that helps you kind of understand and map out the sub problems and opportunities and then leading into actual features and implementations and ideas that you might have for prototypes.

776
01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:56.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then also.

777
01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:12.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you tend to get really excited about one idea, like I know, after some founders, they'll tell me. Oh, I did this job to be done interview. And it's very clear that this is the problem that they have. So we we took an all nighter and we built this feature, and we implemented into the product. And now everyone gets it.

778
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:24.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I'm like, what a mistake! Please don't do that. Do not jump the gun and over, build or over engineer, just because you had one great moment of an idea from one. Conversation

779
01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:34.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is a is a very common thing for founders to do. And you just gotta have to be patient and trust our process so that you know that you're making the right move and not just kind of shooting from the hip

780
01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:50.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And also it doesn't stop here. So it's really important that you all realize that this is a process that we're giving to you to ingrain into your organization, not as a 1, and done like I did tech stars. I did jobs to be done, and now I know my customer, and I'll never have to do it again.

781
01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:58.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: As you get more customers, you need to continuously conduct interviews, and as you conduct interviews, you gain more insights, and your organization evolves over time.

782
01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:10.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the ones who are doing the best right now, the ones who've raised money, the ones who are profitable, the ones who are on track to provide not only a return on their investment, but the founders themselves are on a path to having.

783
01:35:10.530 --> 01:35:12.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, a lot of success.

784
01:35:12.978 --> 01:35:16.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Are the ones that have a very clear

785
01:35:16.951 --> 01:35:33.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: ingrained methodology for continuously talking to their customers throughout the life cycle of their business. They do it on a monthly, sometimes quarterly, sometimes even weekly basis. They have team members or themselves that are actively talking to customers and understanding why they're buying.

786
01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:38.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's also other product prioritization frameworks that you all may have heard of from my, you know.

787
01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:45.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: technical and business nerds out there, rice, Kano model Moscow. There's a lot of ones out there that are really cool, that

788
01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: can build on top of jobs as a foundation.

789
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:51.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That'll help you with scale.

790
01:35:52.085 --> 01:36:06.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Product metrics become more meaningful. Now you're tying it back to the jobs like our our metrics. And are we? Are we defining success and setting our goals in a way that allow us to measure the progress, now that we understand what it looks like. More, there's this notion of a magic moment.

791
01:36:06.698 --> 01:36:09.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Some of you may have heard of this, but there's a time where.

792
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:14.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when the certain criteria is met with the customer.

793
01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:22.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you have them in a way that disproportionately alters their commitment and their lifetime value to you and your business.

794
01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:28.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for example, Facebook figured out early on what their magic moment was.

795
01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:31.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Does anyone know what Facebook's magic moment was

796
01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:35.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for a user when you signed up.

797
01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Anyone want to guess before I tell you.

798
01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.079
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Your Facebook, account.

799
01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Stage! Oh, sorry go ahead!

800
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:49.990
Dave Scott: Yeah. Yeah. The magic moment's pretty cool. Concept. I think it was the 1st post right.

801
01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:51.870
Dave Scott: Was there magic.

802
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:52.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Friends.

803
01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:54.160
Dave Scott: 20. Friends, okay?

804
01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Once they had 20 friends on the platform. That's like when they had you.

805
01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:03.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They like. Then then you're in like they you once they get over 20 friends in the platform

806
01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:05.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: game over now, we're.

807
01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:34.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, liking each other's posts where back in the day they had this feature called poke you're posting birthdays like it was all types of fun stuff on there. But each of you, you're gonna have this thing where, when your customer crosses a certain behavior threshold, they're much more likely to engage with you. Be your die hard customers, and not only retain, but maybe even convert other people and recommend and refer folks to the platform. And be, you know, basically your

808
01:37:34.930 --> 01:37:36.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: your organic salesforce.

809
01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:39.815
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool.

810
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:54.079
Neal Sáles-Griffin: communicating. Gtb, 3 slides left so a really good exercise here for those of you that want to test it out is once you've gotten your jobs to be done insights, and I'll have you all do this when you present your jobs in a few weeks

811
01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:57.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we're going to pull up your landing pages. We're going to pull up your home pages.

812
01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:00.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and we're going to ask ourselves, are we saying

813
01:38:00.490 --> 01:38:04.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the right thing on the homepage relative to what you're saying? The jobs are

814
01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:09.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cause I'll bet probably a lot of you if I go to your homepage right now.

815
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:13.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: A lot of you are just describing what you do and how awesome you are.

816
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:20.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and how great your product or business is, and your features, and what you offer, and how fast you offer it, and how well you do with it.

817
01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:25.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: rather than talking about the people you're here to help, and what they need, and how much better their life is going to be.

818
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:30.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I know that's true, because it's always true. And but we're going to help you with that.

819
01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:41.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then we'll help you rewrite your one liners. We'll try to summarize things and have very like succinct ways for you to describe your business and those case studies.

820
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:47.257
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 2 other exercises here. I don't think this is important. Now I can go back to it.

821
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:56.930
Lilliana Robinson: I was telling them in the chat that all of the prototyping and product tools that we just ran through really quickly in the last, like 10 min are outlined in the book.

822
01:38:57.326 --> 01:39:00.370
Lilliana Robinson: So, Neil, can I talk about the book really quick? So.

823
01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:01.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sure. Please. Yeah.

824
01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:09.790
Lilliana Robinson: You are going to receive an assignment today or tomorrow on your to do list. It is to download or buy.

825
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:14.979
Lilliana Robinson: but demand side sales 101 by Bob Mesta. So this is going to be required reading

826
01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:41.509
Lilliana Robinson: by day. One I read in like 2 days. It should be a pretty quick read. One note is that Bob puts a lot of like diagrams in there. So if you do an audio book, you're gonna want to make sure. You also buy the kindle version with it, because he's going to be talking through illustrations that like you're gonna want to see. So like, I love audio books. But this is definitely something you're gonna need to follow along and see the pictures. Because he's very engineer minded. And there are a lot of like

827
01:39:41.660 --> 01:40:05.469
Lilliana Robinson: different sort of diagrams to help. You understand systems and such demand side sales. 101 by Bob Messip, we're going to want you guys to read that by day one, it's going to really solidify a lot of the concepts that we have talked about these past 3 days, and for a lot of you you're going to see the connection with everything we're talking about to directly making profit and like getting those sales and putting money in your bank, and so it'll help a lot of you click.

828
01:40:06.006 --> 01:40:34.050
Lilliana Robinson: A lot of you were also thinking of it from a very data perspective. Bob also has that kind of perspective from his engineering background. So I think it'll help. But it's also an easy read, if that's not your jam as well, so I would love for you all to try to download that, Chloe was saying. Some of our international founders here might not be able to access it on the kindle store. So if that's the case, reach out to me directly. But I'm giving you guys that heads up so you can start reading it over the long weekend, if you're interested. And then on day one, we will

829
01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:37.169
Lilliana Robinson: have a little discussion to see how it went.

830
01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.639
Lilliana Robinson: Anything else. So.

831
01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:42.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't know. International founders get creative use a VPN figure it out.

832
01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:44.539
Lilliana Robinson: That's what I was thinking.

833
01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:53.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I have anything. Now we're questions right?

834
01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:53.820
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

835
01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:55.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This, is it? We we got done early.

836
01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:02.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so you all take your time back, or let's hang out and talk about what we just blazed through.

837
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:20.710
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, over the next, you guys are going to be writing your screening criteria. So this was our lecture on screening criteria as well as how to do the interview. So I'd love to hear any questions you guys have have about either of those, because next week you're going to start taking a stab at like deriving your own screening criteria statements and submitting them by the end of next week.

838
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:24.540
Lilliana Robinson: and then you'll start scheduling your own interviews after they're approved by Neil.

839
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:44.110
Lilliana Robinson: Also be prepared to go back to the drawing board a couple of times. I would say more than half. We have rewrite one or 2 times to make it more and more specific. You can cut that step by looking at it yourself before you submit it, and then rewriting it, and making it 2 times as narrow as what you were about to submit.

840
01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:45.639
Lilliana Robinson: I challenge you to do that.

841
01:41:55.030 --> 01:42:13.870
Florence Ettlin: So. I had a question about once you identified who you're going to reach out. Or maybe you got a referral do you have any tips on what wording to use when you basically tell them what you're planning to do or what you'd like to do. Via Linkedin by email, whatever mode you're using.

842
01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:22.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think what we can do is maybe give you. Let's let's let's commit to getting a few examples

843
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:25.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of introductory messages from some of the founders.

844
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:29.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We've done it more recently. But

845
01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in in to save you time

846
01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there's no

847
01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I would just put yourself into their shoes

848
01:42:37.450 --> 01:42:49.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and frame it in a way that you think would be most palatable, and we'll do some work on our end to try to come up with a few examples of copy and language, but don't overthink it, keep it simple and straightforward and honest, and it'll be fine.

849
01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.380
Florence Ettlin: Okay.

850
01:42:50.380 --> 01:43:06.420
Lilliana Robinson: I would say there are 2 different ways to do it. One is the way I like to do it, where you're putting out an ask so that people are coming to you. So you're like I'm looking for, you know, people who were in the airport in the past 90 days and bought and relate to a flight, and bought a snickers on the way to their to their gate.

851
01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:26.430
Lilliana Robinson: and then, like people, will like comment, be like, oh, I did that. I did that. I'd love to be interviewed. And same with B. Twob, this works the same way. If you're doing a direct reach out as a DM. I'd say, like, come from a kind of student perspective where it's like you're just looking to learn more. Make sure you don't come off salesy at all. You're just asking for 15 to 20 min, not 15, probably 20 to 25 min of their time

852
01:43:26.430 --> 01:43:39.579
Lilliana Robinson: to like quickly chat because you want to learn more because you're you're working on a project in X space. And you, think that they would fit your criteria and remember to ask. We're finding questions. If you're directly reaching out to make sure they meet your screening criteria.

853
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:41.080
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

854
01:43:41.583 --> 01:43:46.920
Lilliana Robinson: I have. I have an example that I have put in your base camp projects already.

855
01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:52.350
Lilliana Robinson: No, this is bloom filters, screening criteria. If you want to just kind of

856
01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:55.599
Lilliana Robinson: talk through how this is a good example.

857
01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Looking at it.

858
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:07.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is an okay example.

859
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:15.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They're they're they're kind of boiling the ocean a bit with all 3 different like buckets. So when you read it, you're like

860
01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:21.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you have to fit into, you know, 3 very broad categories. It's still they they did a good job. So I know, this ended up

861
01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:25.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and what they wanted. But still I would refine this even more.

862
01:44:25.682 --> 01:44:35.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So hired agile consultants or software auditors adopted a new digital software project management tool or recently organized in order to gain more insight into their operations. That's a lot.

863
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:39.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's biting off a little bit more than I think I would be interested in chewing.

864
01:44:39.690 --> 01:44:50.200
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I'll look for another example on this call. I will call out a couple of key things for your screening criteria. You usually want them to have purchased 1st of all, you want to center it around a switch moment.

865
01:44:50.200 --> 01:45:10.049
Lilliana Robinson: So I don't think we said that before. But a switch moment is either you're hiring or you're firing. So for those who are pre customers, and you don't have any customers of your own who have paid you, you're going to do competitors who either hired a competitor or fired a competitor. Remember, competitor can be direct or indirect. So that's an option. And then for your current customers

866
01:45:10.050 --> 01:45:35.159
Lilliana Robinson: people who have fired you. I remember Dave said he was very interested in that. We hired you and fired you, or they just hired you. And so all of those things are extremely good switch points. You want to anchor the entire conversation around that switch point just like the mattress interview. It was all about that purchase that he made. It wasn't just like people who are looking for a mattress, or had this struggle. And you're talking about the struggle you're talking about how that struggle ended up in this switch. Moment.

867
01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:51.140
Lilliana Robinson: Another thing is recency that's really important. You saw bloom filter. There had one to 2 years. I do agree with Neil. It's not a perfect example, because I would not have gone back that much. People don't remember the specifics of where they were sitting when they purchased something 2 years ago.

868
01:45:51.160 --> 01:46:00.149
Lilliana Robinson: So, Max, I would say 6 months for some b 2 b people. You might have to expand there for anyone that can do it. 90 days is the sweet spot.

869
01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:24.100
Lilliana Robinson: 90 days is where it's the most fresh. You want that switch moment to be in the last 90 days. I I would say you can go up to 6 months if it's like a very, very major thing, maybe a year, but that is going to be stretching people's memory. So that's what you want to look at. So you want to do this switch moment, hiring or firing, and then you want to be very narrow about the situation that the person was under when they made that moment. And that's how you're going to craft your screening criteria.

870
01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:35.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright have we worn worn you all out yet

871
01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:38.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: our brains full.

872
01:46:40.410 --> 01:46:41.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It seems like it.

873
01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:57.810
Lilliana Robinson: I was just gonna say everything I just said is listed in your to do so in your to do this is noetic. You go to your pre program, prep to do list, submit your screening criteria assignment, and then I have all of these things of what I just said, so you choose a group hired, fired

874
01:46:58.010 --> 01:47:02.750
Lilliana Robinson: mix of people. I give some specific examples for B, 2 B,

875
01:47:03.042 --> 01:47:07.280
Lilliana Robinson: so make sure you read all of this. These are your instructions. They're pretty comprehensive.

876
01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:36.089
Lilliana Robinson: all right. Well, we'll stay on for individual questions in case you guys have any. Again. I'm sure your brains are like flooded. So make sure that you just take some time. Go on a walk or something today to marinate on all of this and really let it digest. I'd love to hear again tomorrow any sort of thoughts or questions you guys have after you have some time to think about this. But tomorrow's really fun, because we're going to demonstrate. Live what it's like to do a job speed on interview.

877
01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:41.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, we'll do it in real time. And my slides. For the 3rd phase of this I have like

878
01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:42.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: pictures.

879
01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:49.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so they'll be more entertaining. It's not just plain black and white text anymore. We're we're we made it through it.

880
01:47:50.800 --> 01:48:17.680
