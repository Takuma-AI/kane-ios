1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.689
Lilliana Robinson: So this is their 1st time meeting you. So this is Bob Mesta. We've talked a lot about him. They've all read your book. We've gone through

2
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:31.810
Lilliana Robinson: 4 or 5 lecture series on jobs to be done on all your work. And they've been so excited to meet you. So for the founders. The way this is gonna work we've done this several times with Bob is we've chosen 4 companies to go 1st and kind of kick us off, and I'll tell you what those 4 are gonna do. And then after that, we're gonna open it up, and anyone who wants to volunteer can do the same thing.

3
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:43.180
Lilliana Robinson: and or just ask general questions. So the thing that I would like these 4 to do is introduce yourself and your company really briefly so, for like 30 seconds. What do you do?

4
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.740
Lilliana Robinson: What are the clusters you found in your? Why, before the why and which one are you going after. And why?

5
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:58.239
Lilliana Robinson: And then any problems that you have or like issues that Bob can help you with. Thinking through your final analysis of your jobs to be done.

6
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.889
Lilliana Robinson: So the 1st one that I'd like to go is Opal Morgan.

7
00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:19.810
Lilliana Robinson: So just introduce yourself and your business. Tell Bob about your clusters, which one you're going after, any issues that you're having, that he can help you with. Everyone else should be listening. After these 1st 4. Go we'll open it up. Anyone can go, or you can just ask general questions about the framework or anything you want to know from Bob.

8
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 1 1 point of order before Morgan starts bob. Jake joined us last week in person.

9
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.080
Bob Moesta: Yep.

10
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And each of the companies presented their insights on their process for applying jobs to date.

11
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.440
Bob Moesta: Yep.

12
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And we tore into them

13
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:45.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: good. And Jake specifically did that. So, Jake, I don't know if you want to give Bob any context from what you learned. But if you want to do that, this is your time, and then we're going to get in.

14
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.080
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

15
00:01:49.410 --> 00:02:18.789
Bob Moesta: The the one. The one thing I'll add is the fact. This is, you really actually want to pay attention. One of the reasons why I insist that everybody's here is that when we start talking about one problem, you're gonna go like, Oh, my God, I have that problem. And then we're talking about another problem. You're like, Oh, my, gosh, I have that problem, too. And so you start, gonna realize that that everybody's conversation is gonna actually help you. So so I would tell you not to tune out, but to more like try to try to assimilate and and have some empathy towards kind of what their problem is, because you'll start to realize you. You might have this problem as well, but you didn't even know it.

16
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Just so. Just so, you know, like this class has stood out to us out of all 12 that we've run so far

17
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like they actually understand the assignment.

18
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So they show up. They're attentive. They're not multitasking on their devices. They're not passively listening until it's their turn.

19
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They're all engaged, right. Everybody. We all in. Okay. Good. Alright.

20
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.130
Bob Moesta: So so, Neil, I just have to ask, like, you look 10 years younger, what the fuck just happened.

21
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I just shaved, that's all. Just chopped it off, that's all you know. Remember.

22
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.359
Bob Moesta: You look like a little kid, my friend.

23
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know. Yeah, thank you. That's awesome. That's a great one. Thanks, man.

24
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.560
Bob Moesta: Sorry I just I couldn't. I couldn't.

25
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.723
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I know I know you can let it go.

26
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.360
Bob Moesta: That's great. That's great. All right, Opal, you're up. Let's go game on.

27
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:27.279
Morgan Stanton: Hi, Bob, nice to meet you. I'm Morgan Stanton. I'm the CEO of opal therapeutics. So our company is working in women's health. Specifically, we are a uterus in a dish biotech startup. So we are developing a novel therapeutics and platform to understand female biology for R&D.

28
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:51.300
Morgan Stanton: So the screening criteria that we had was looking for Cxos at biotech or pharma companies with a focus women's reproductive health that have hired a contract research organization. So this is just an organization that does scientific experiments for you if you don't have a lab, and they're not using animal models. So no, no rats or monkeys, or anything like that.

29
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.950
Bob Moesta: Okay.

30
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.580
Morgan Stanton: So I got through 14 interviews, and the I have 4 clusters

31
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:23.590
Morgan Stanton: and the 1st one the cluster. I said the quote I got was, people don't think I'm shady. They were hiring Cros not really to validate the science, but essentially to get the the brand name of the Cro on their company, like the biggest one in the space, is Charles Rivers Laboratory, like they wanted Charles Rivers on their deck to make people feel better.

32
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:33.870
Bob Moesta: So I so it's I don't have enough credibility. If I actually have this, other people know can recognize what it is, and it's giving me credibility. And and ultimately it's it's it's making me legitimate.

33
00:04:33.870 --> 00:05:03.860
Morgan Stanton: Yes, exactly. That was the 1st one cluster number 2. The quote was none of it. Could the work could be outsourced. No one worked with menstrual blood. Essentially, especially these groups in women's health. They're doing some kind of new technology with menstrual, effluent. They couldn't find a Cro to do the work, or like the Cro didn't want to do it, they'd never done it before. They were unsure. So a lot of these labs have actually done the work internally decided not to go with the Cro. They couldn't find it do it on their own.

34
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.925
Morgan Stanton: Yep,

35
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.600
Morgan Stanton: questions.

36
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.170
Bob Moesta: So wait. I just want to make sure. So this one is literally like we do it. We only do it because we have to do it. We didn't know there was anybody else who would do it.

37
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:23.081
Morgan Stanton: Yes, and actually part of it isn't true. I actually found some cros that do do it, but they're they're hard to find. They don't advertise much about it. So you have to put in a lot of work.

38
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.765
Morgan Stanton: cluster 3 was,

39
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:38.340
Morgan Stanton: Do you know, a good model for endometriosis like the specific disease. And this was kind of a larger problem. With understanding the regulations of the FDA.

40
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:54.195
Morgan Stanton: They were trying to study a disease, but like couldn't understand the FDA's guidelines or the FDA's regulations, and like they were, they were trying to ask me. They were just trying to like desperately find information for making sure their product went through the FDA cleanly.

41
00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:23.550
Morgan Stanton: number 4 was, I want convenience and validation for my customers. So they are building a product that's going directly to consumers. And they want some kind of thing on their Amazon ad or their website ad, that makes customers feel safe about using their product that's been tested in a lab clinically validated, so forth. So they were working with a Cro to like help with their marketing and storytelling of their product.

42
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:39.219
Bob Moesta: So the so the difference between one and 4 is, I need credibility from others in the industry versus 4 is, I need credibility for the customers they need. So it's so. They're very different, because they're different. Different notion notions of bring me credibility.

43
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.299
Morgan Stanton: Yes, yes.

44
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:49.300
Bob Moesta: That's that. By the way, that that's a that's a master's degree in jobs. Just that subtlety and knowing how to separate that awesome, awesome.

45
00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:52.299
Bob Moesta: So so

46
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.269
Bob Moesta: where? Where do you think you're gonna start.

47
00:06:57.355 --> 00:07:02.114
Morgan Stanton: So the the kind of insights I gained from this

48
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:25.310
Morgan Stanton: was that we were going to start offering some new services geared towards, I would say, the wellness category. So even though these were in the biotech women's health space, some of these products were not like traditional science or biotech, they were falling more into like menstrual products, and so offering services geared towards

49
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:34.110
Morgan Stanton: this kind of sector, this wellness category more than traditional biotech, and they would actually be a faster turnaround time like a traditional biotech.

50
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.369
Morgan Stanton: You're doing a project for a couple months something like that.

51
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:51.180
Morgan Stanton: This category you need less. So it could be a turnaround time in a couple of weeks it'd be a little bit cheaper, and we don't have to change much about our platform. It's more of just marketing it towards them. These these quick experiments we can do.

52
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.199
Bob Moesta: So that's a combination of Job 2 and Job Job 3.

53
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.250
Morgan Stanton: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

54
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:19.970
Bob Moesta: I I would I would agree with that. I think jobs one and 4, you you can build over time. But you need. You need to build credibility and make sure you have a high standard to to actually earn it. So it's it takes time to do that where 2 and 3 are both. They're almost immediately immediate struggle, struggling moments where they don't want to do it. They didn't even know they could outsource it, and it might be simply just making them aware that it is outsourceable in this way.

55
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:20.810
Bob Moesta: Yes.

56
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:26.249
Morgan Stanton: Yeah. Yeah. Cause yeah, I don't. I'm not gonna be Charles Rivers lab at like overnight. So that that's something I can't do.

57
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:41.119
Bob Moesta: Right and and 3 is really about. I I have a patient, or I have this thing. I want to know more about it deeper, faster, so save me the time of having to navigate all the FDA stuff like. Give me the cliff notes, help me understand? And this and where's your boundaries of expertise?

58
00:08:41.120 --> 00:09:01.970
Morgan Stanton: Exactly. And so that was the other point. Was knowing the FDA, like, I know, some of the FDA regulations relative to my company, but knowing even more like, really almost have like a booklet of FDA, and really reducing the pain point for the client in that sense, even if it doesn't mean like I get their work like immediately. They'll remember us as like, oh, they they knew their stuff about government regulations.

59
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:26.309
Bob Moesta: And and what I would say is that at some point in time, as and this is very similar in in banks and other industries where it's like like, there's just certain things they don't need to be in, and certain things they have to be in. And ultimately, that that they're they're choosing to focus. Which means that then this is actually a way, bigger opportunity. Because if they're not focusing on this, then they need a place to have this lab work done, or this knowledge to to sit as a as a supplement to what they're doing.

60
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:38.229
Bob Moesta: And so you find that that these, the 2 and 3 are kind of the places that I would double down on, and with the goal of basically getting one and and 4 as kind of as we get scale.

61
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.090
Morgan Stanton: Okay, right?

62
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.940
Bob Moesta: Cause. I think I think the yeah, that's that's how I would look at it.

63
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.679
Bob Moesta: And and is this is this customer facing? Or is this professional facing, or both.

64
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.679
Morgan Stanton: It. It's mostly professional facing. I don't.

65
00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:09.439
Bob Moesta: Felt like, okay, because I think, like having done a lot of work in the space. To be honest, there's a very so there's a couple of things I'll tell you about. So I worked on adult female incontinence. Right? And and the aspect is, is

66
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:32.050
Bob Moesta: this is a problem that nobody talks about. Nobody even shares with their sister that there have these problems. And so they go almost through this entire process of this alone, because they don't. 1 want to tell anybody and 2 is, they don't know what to do or how to do it. And so there is a very large consumer piece to this, especially when they, because they don't know much about it, and they want to learn more about it.

67
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.070
Bob Moesta: and they don't know how to talk about it.

68
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:44.120
Morgan Stanton: And so would you say, in that sense, it's more of like kind of like thought leadership, like even like sources of info on our website.

69
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:54.569
Bob Moesta: I don't know if it's thought leadership. It's more like, because again, you could say, the FDA is on the thought leadership side of putting together. What's there? It's more like, give me a place to go so I can understand what the hell they're even saying.

70
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.040
Morgan Stanton: Okay. Okay.

71
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:04.699
Bob Moesta: I think it's more about translation from the consumer, from the from the technical high risk, you know, like doctors talk to you like they're they're lawyers.

72
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.710
Morgan Stanton: Yeah.

73
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.609
Bob Moesta: Right. And how do you actually try to talk to them as just normal human beings.

74
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.279
Morgan Stanton: Got it. That makes sense.

75
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:24.810
Bob Moesta: Right. And I and I do like the vertical focus on on women's health and and the uterus, because I just feel like it's it's a very unique positioning. And like nobody, nobody has kind of

76
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:31.170
Bob Moesta: claim that space per se. And it's really a space that needs to be really focused on. So it's it's I think it's a great.

77
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.940
Bob Moesta: it's it's a good start, for sure.

78
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:33.910
Morgan Stanton: Thank you.

79
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.089
Bob Moesta: So what? But do you have any questions?

80
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:39.940
Morgan Stanton: I mean.

81
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.029
Morgan Stanton: if I'm going down this like offering.

82
00:11:46.340 --> 00:12:06.140
Morgan Stanton: One of the other things I wanted to do was basically doing jobs to be done for these research groups. Again, the space is kind of new, like. In a sense, this woman's health, like people, are doing new things right. So I can't. It's hard for me to offer a standardized set of experiments for everyone. I can't have a couple, but a lot of people are going to want some flexibility.

83
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.530
Bob Moesta: Yes.

84
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.370
Morgan Stanton: So

85
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:14.059
Morgan Stanton: knowing how to use jobs to be done to kind of like, make sure we don't do do too much, really kind of like.

86
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:29.272
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, so so I think this is a case of like, I think you actually want to have standard products, because having done work in the research realm. They actually don't know what they want. And they're gonna actually make it as complicated and as as biased as possible to their data.

87
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.280
Morgan Stanton: Okay.

88
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:38.229
Bob Moesta: Right. And so my thing is is that at some point you'll end up being a customized shop as opposed to like. Look, we can take this stuff off your plate

89
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:50.290
Bob Moesta: right? And ultimately, what they'll do is they they? And and then you can start to say, Well, if you want this and this and this that's extra, so you can at least start to charge for those things that are absurd or or out of the box.

90
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.669
Morgan Stanton: Okay. But I would.

91
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:58.089
Bob Moesta: Tell you to scale is you're better off trying to get rid of the stuff that they don't want to do than do the stuff that they can't do.

92
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.980
Morgan Stanton: Do the stuff they don't want to do.

93
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:13.290
Bob Moesta: Not the stuff they can't do so like like, I can't do these tests. Could you do these tests? It's kind of like they're they're the anomaly of it. But it's more like, no, I'm doing these tests. I don't want to do these tests anymore. Can you do them for me?

94
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.770
Morgan Stanton: Okay, that makes sense.

95
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:21.379
Bob Moesta: Because because if you go into the into the doing the test they can't do, it's gonna become a long tail of a lot of stuff.

96
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.280
Morgan Stanton: Agree.

97
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:42.180
Bob Moesta: And so I think, especially early on you being able to focus as close as possible to like a set of 4 or 5 different things, knowing that there might be 10 or 20 of them. But to realize, like these are the essential 4 or 5 that we have, that that almost anybody anybody could buy that one if they wanted it.

98
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.090
Morgan Stanton: Okay. Okay.

99
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:58.180
Bob Moesta: Because they're gonna the market, will push you to customize and to be like, think of my examples like Warby Parker. When Warby Parker started. They didn't do anything complicated in glasses. They did single vision, $95, and they grew like crazy.

100
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:15.319
Bob Moesta: And then what they did is they built equipment to help you actually do progressive lenses and some of these other things, and after that, then they started to get sunglasses and and multifocal and other things. And they did it by actually technology innovation that then helped them actually learn how to measure people's eyes better.

101
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:16.840
Morgan Stanton: Okay.

102
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.440
Bob Moesta: So I would say, stay, simple as as long as you can.

103
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.669
Morgan Stanton: Yeah, that was my biggest question. This is incredibly helpful. Thank you.

104
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.320
Bob Moesta: Cool.

105
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.250
Bob Moesta: alright.

106
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.099
Lilliana Robinson: It's Morgan.

107
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:37.590
Bob Moesta: You're on the right track. I give. I give you a a an 8 or a 9 out of 10 on jobs. But like, that's that's a very high.

108
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's huge.

109
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:45.640
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you. Alright, Morgan, I'm glad we started with you. That was really great, really solid. Thank you for sharing.

110
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.559
Bob Moesta: So can I. Can. I just tell people why she was so? One is.

111
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.320
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, please.

112
00:14:49.320 --> 00:15:10.979
Bob Moesta: Talk about the clusters in a very, very succinct way, and then I could understand them, and that there were subtleties between kind of like that one in one and 4. That kind of can look similar, but they actually feel really different. And so that the the high score is because you're able to kind of separate one and 4 where most people might like. If they're more junior, they would probably keep one and 4 together

113
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.599
Bob Moesta: because they feel similar. But they're actually not.

114
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:22.300
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, a lot of nuance. And I let I agree, Morgan, you were very succinct with how you could explain which demonstrated a very deep knowledge.

115
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:22.819
Morgan Stanton: Yeah.

116
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.790
Lilliana Robinson: Great job. Okay, cool. I'm gonna take you off this spotlight.

117
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.050
Lilliana Robinson: Next is Annie. This is Annie. From reliable.

118
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.769
Annie Brown: Hello! Can you hear me? Okay, there's a lot.

119
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.230
Bob Moesta: You're muted. I can't hear you.

120
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.360
Lilliana Robinson: Really faint. Do you have?

121
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.189
Lilliana Robinson: Do you have the right mic on.

122
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.540
Annie Brown: Going on, so maybe somebody might want to go first.st

123
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.910
Bob Moesta: There you go.

124
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.779
Bob Moesta: We can hear you now. We can hear you now. It just it had to warm up.

125
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.020
Bob Moesta: Okay.

126
00:15:49.530 --> 00:16:13.610
Annie Brown: Alright if it gets weird, just let me know. So so yeah. So I'm the CEO at reliable. I am. We are doing data annotation as a software or as a service. And we help to improve algorithmic outputs by bringing users into the data annotation pipeline. So typically

127
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:31.152
Annie Brown: data annotation is sent overseas to done to be done by people who are oftentimes overworked, underpaid, or done by in-house data. Scientists who also don't have a lot of context about the data that they're labeling. So users were basically

128
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:40.079
Annie Brown: handling them as subject matter experts. So our jobs to be done. We've done a total of 12.

129
00:16:40.080 --> 00:17:04.419
Annie Brown: But caveat to that is the 1st 5 we actually scrape, because once we got past the 5th interview, we realized that we wanted to pivot our screening criteria quite significantly. That was a couple of our jobs to be done was actually to identify our go to market vertical. So the screening criteria that we landed on

130
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:21.910
Annie Brown: was senior decision makers such as Ceos Ctos, heads of heads of engineering. That who have hired or developed in house solutions for data, annotation or content recommendation in the past 6 months. And then the.

131
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.209
Bob Moesta: What? What would be some of the other products that they would be using, or or services they would be using.

132
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:40.130
Annie Brown: Yes, so commercial pro products may include hive scale AI, spectrum labs, aws, mechanical Turk or Samosaurs. So those were ones that were oftentimes named in the interview.

133
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:40.784
Annie Brown: Yep.

134
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:41.895
Bob Moesta: Perfect

135
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.460
Bob Moesta: alright. And so how did those interviews turn out.

136
00:17:46.020 --> 00:18:03.280
Annie Brown: They turned out really well. So I think the key cluster that we want to dive further into. But a key cluster that allowed us to kind of create this pivot was that content? Recommendation? Accuracy is key to my company's success. So

137
00:18:03.703 --> 00:18:22.296
Annie Brown: that was huge. Because before we weren't really sure, like, what type of algorithm we would help with for these consumer tech companies, we were actually leaning more towards content moderation. But we found that content recommendation was on the roadmap for almost every

138
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:37.759
Annie Brown: company we talked about, and it was top priority, because that was a key metric that they had to deliver was user engagement keeping users on the platform. So so yeah, so that was a a big one for us. And we wanna dive more into the subtleties of that.

139
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:49.369
Bob Moesta: And this and this is more of a almost a fundamental process they have to have in place in order to deliver on all that stuff. And so if they don't have a good system for it, despite what they're putting in, it's actually garbage in garbage out.

140
00:18:49.750 --> 00:19:04.440
Annie Brown: Yes, exactly. And so they all. So most of them. Some of them were just developing a content recommendation system, but a lot of them had pre-existing content recommendation systems, but weren't satisfied with them. And we're looking for ways to improve it.

141
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:14.270
Bob Moesta: Got it. And and they were. They were using everything from a range of hiring mechanical Turk to basically buying a tool that would make it easier for them to kind of do this.

142
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:34.530
Annie Brown: Yeah. And actually, a lot of them, because, the next cluster is that tagging is difficult and costly, and context is needed to do it well. So we found that actually a lot of the firms didn't trust outsourcing it to a lot of those firms. So a lot of them had just turned to doing it in house.

143
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:42.870
Bob Moesta: So the big, struggling moment is like, I don't know. Like mechanical Turk. I just don't know half of its garbage that comes in comes like I gotta clean it up again, anyway. So.

144
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:43.410
Annie Brown: Right.

145
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.750
Bob Moesta: Doing it ourselves, because we don't want to do it twice.

146
00:19:46.190 --> 00:20:05.739
Annie Brown: Right. And I think for us, that's that's key feedback we got during our presentation of this is that in in our next, you know, as we continue these interviews, really diving into some of the subtleties of what those struggling moments are. But yeah, it was that like. So, for one example, one on Cluster 2. 1 group.

147
00:20:06.017 --> 00:20:19.320
Annie Brown: Said that they had a ton of posts about Taylor Swift on their platform, but mechanical Turk just labeled them all as woman. And so if you looked up, woman, you just got a bunch of Taylor swift posts, and it just didn't work for their their platform.

148
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.829
Annie Brown: So it's like the vagueness and the lack of nuance in in.

149
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:28.410
Bob Moesta: Yeah. So so this is where I would be. I'd almost try to segment this work

150
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:29.550
Bob Moesta: till I

151
00:20:29.867 --> 00:20:54.860
Bob Moesta: what's the what's the work? That's just almost like they they need. But the fact is, it's like, it's so basic that they like it's almost like, try to find the things that they're willing to like offload 50% of the load because they can trust you to get that 50% done. And then over time, you can kind of migrate up to doing a hundred percent of it. Because think of it this way is like, these are a bunch of people who don't really want to do it themselves, can't find anybody else to do it. Well.

152
00:20:54.860 --> 00:21:08.300
Bob Moesta: I'm willing to outsource it if I can actually get assurances that it works. But they're not going to start with all of their data at once. They're gonna start with like, Give me some, you know. Show me you can do this, and some people are going to want to start on the on the tough end. And some people are going to want to start on the easy end.

153
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:23.049
Bob Moesta: And I'm gonna tell you to start on the easy end because they're just they would rather get rid of all that extra stuff that they don't have to do so. They can do the customized stuff, and then you can learn from them how to actually do it more better and better for them, but trying to be perfect out of the hat will be a disaster.

154
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:43.210
Annie Brown: Yes, and and that's actually one comment, and I wasn't quite sure if it was a cluster. We kind of like put it into this cluster, too, but I think, like some of the feedback you were giving to Morgan. I could see how we could break it into a separate cluster. There were people that said specifically for socially complex data. So data around

155
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:55.579
Annie Brown: Lgbtq race gender sexuality, they didn't want to do that like they just didn't want to label it and that's where our expertise lies. So yeah, for one of our 1st customers.

156
00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:03.130
Annie Brown: we're labeling month by month, and then each month we're focusing on a very specific set of data like, so

157
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.660
Annie Brown: we're focusing on like women's health data.

158
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:28.399
Bob Moesta: Yeah. Yeah. So that's where I think this is like, you have to realize that that people are gonna have to get comfortable with you. So you're gonna have to design an onboarding process to kind of get comfortable with the data and to show your limits. But over time they're just gonna literally, just wanna they're they're almost gonna push you too hard to take more than you can handle. And you wanna make sure that you at least have some.

159
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:51.989
Bob Moesta: because again, they're gonna wanna. As soon as they know you can take it. They're gonna want you to take it as fast as possible. But there's some stuff that's more complicated than others. And so being able to have, like almost categories of data to say like, Well, we can take this and do it for this amount. But at this amount we have to do it. We need more context. Blah, blah, it's more expensive. But I would actually make sure you're pricing it, based on kind of the complexity of of the context that has to be wrapped around the.

160
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.939
Annie Brown: Oh, I love that.

161
00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.750
Bob Moesta: College.

162
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.090
Annie Brown: Yes.

163
00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:10.009
Bob Moesta: Right because some people are going to want you to basically do like, just basic stuff that you can do. And it's like, it's really not value added, but it to them it's extremely value added. So even though it's not hard, it's the fact that that you can do it better than anybody else like you have to realize like.

164
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.179
Bob Moesta: that's where you're gonna have to start.

165
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.440
Annie Brown: Okay.

166
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:25.199
Bob Moesta: That's that's my suggestion. Because I think, starting at the higher end, you're gonna have to jump through so many other hoops to show you can do it where, if you can just take 50% of the work off the plate right now on the simpler stuff, they'll go like, please take it.

167
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.214
Annie Brown: Okay, I like that. So maybe

168
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.920
Annie Brown: you know, a combination of.

169
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:37.289
Annie Brown: So you're saying like, for the more complex tasks like work our way up to that.

170
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:54.703
Bob Moesta: That's right, that's right. But but I I like the separation also. Between look I I need. I need it to be more accurate. And so there's like like, think of it as what are the accuracy features you can talk about versus the notion of you can actually do this better than we can, which is a different set of features.

171
00:23:55.597 --> 00:24:12.920
Bob Moesta: whereas each job you gotta kind of look at it and say what feature like. You might have 20 features. But what features are you? Gonna what are the 5 features? You're gonna talk about? A job to one versus Job 2. And then in the sales process as you're talking to them, try to make sure you can actually put them in which job they're in. So then you know what features to talk about.

172
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.480
Annie Brown: Okay, yes.

173
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:26.800
Annie Brown: And is, those are those jobs things that we can actually determine through the interviews. If we really dive into some of these things so like, what, specifically, are you hiring aws to do? What specifically.

174
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.350
Bob Moesta: Why, why aws and not mechanical Turk or web? Why mechanical Turk and not hive like? And it might be no

175
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:44.659
Bob Moesta: right like like so one of the things I might recruit on is that you looked at several, 2 or more alternatives to basically outsource this. And you pick and you picked and chose one.

176
00:24:44.770 --> 00:25:00.110
Bob Moesta: So ultimately, you can get how they made the decision to and what they cause it. This is a very much an emotional decision to make. This is not a, it's a functional decision around accuracy. But ultimately, when it's wrong, it's really emotional to say, like, now, our data is all kind of compromised.

177
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.060
Annie Brown: Yeah.

178
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:24.760
Annie Brown: yeah, that's such a good point. Because that was, that was, I think, my struggle. And what I want to get better at on the future interviews was to figure out where that emotional piece came in. And it really was the the results. I think. Actually, we did an interview with cogniscope, who's in our thing? And they said it was a horrible feeling when I realized this was all wrong, and I had to redo it. So okay.

179
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:34.539
Bob Moesta: Yeah. Yeah. And so, by the way, that's the thing that's the thing you want to actually start advertising about is like, so how many times have you actually put all the data in and realize you need to do it over.

180
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:45.229
Bob Moesta: Like, let's let's stop like cause. You gotta start with the struggling moment, because if you just say, Hey, we can make your data better like they might not even relate to the data that they actually had to redo as a problem

181
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.420
Bob Moesta: right?

182
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.009
Annie Brown: Right? Yes.

183
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.709
Bob Moesta: Talk through their struggling moments of like you know, how many times did you have to redo the data this month?

184
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:54.940
Annie Brown: Hmm.

185
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.100
Annie Brown: yeah. And and the.

186
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:04.099
Bob Moesta: Don't, don't answer. But, like the this is where I say, questions create spaces in the brain for solutions to fall into.

187
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:13.719
Bob Moesta: So if we can actually ask them a question and not answer it. They're gonna go like God. How many times did it did I have to redo the data that that was 4 times God, that's a lot we should do be better right.

188
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.729
Annie Brown: Right? Yeah. And we also have some. Some.

189
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:34.099
Annie Brown: like some of our customers, have been motivated by like bias as well like, you know, so like their users have been affected by bias, or they've left the platform because of bias. So I think there's emotional moment on both like the buyer side, and maybe the user side that we could tap into.

190
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:35.630
Annie Brown: Yep.

191
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:36.590
Bob Moesta: I think that's right.

192
00:26:37.278 --> 00:26:45.280
Bob Moesta: but it's understanding kind of what? What are the emotional triggers through it, and and what are the things they have to see, to give them confidence that it's more accurate.

193
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.860
Annie Brown: Yeah.

194
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.738
Bob Moesta: Say you're more accurate, but that doesn't mean they believe you.

195
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:59.410
Annie Brown: Yes, yeah, that's actually saying we're working on for Demo Day is like a quantifiable with our 1st customers like, How much of the accuracy? Are we able to improve?

196
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:06.099
Bob Moesta: So yeah, so I I would be. I would be careful with that, because so the the way Clay

197
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.699
Bob Moesta: Clay would talk about this, I'm going to Channel Clay for a minute. Clay Christensen, who's 1 of my mentors, he would say that you know

198
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.689
Bob Moesta: he would tell me that you know when, when when he dies.

199
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:35.189
Bob Moesta: he's going to go to heaven. But the fact is, there'll be no data in heaven. And I and I had to ask, why did he say this? And he basically would say, he's like, Well, no one piece of data can tell you the entire truth of what's going on. And so by all fact, then data is actually not telling the truth, which is a lie, and all lies go to hell. So all data will be in hell when I die.

200
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:47.960
Bob Moesta: I'm like, Wait, what? And so this is where you had just have to be very conscious about. I know you want to try to find one metric, but it might have to be 2 metrics. But what I would tell you find the things are meaningful to measure, not easy to measure.

201
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:52.529
Bob Moesta: Usually the meaningful things are hard to measure, but they actually make a big difference.

202
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.215
Annie Brown: Okay, that's a that's

203
00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.829
Bob Moesta: So watch out. That's a red. That's yeah.

204
00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:58.810
Bob Moesta: That's all.

205
00:27:58.810 --> 00:27:59.450
Annie Brown: Awesome.

206
00:28:00.086 --> 00:28:03.520
Annie Brown: And do I have a little bit more time, lilliana, or for.

207
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.980
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, but you can ask one more question. I would say.

208
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:10.640
Annie Brown: Okay, cool. I think our last, our last cluster

209
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:28.350
Annie Brown: was that they were talking about. I want my data labels to reflect my user interest, but I don't want to burden my users. So that gave us that was kind of something that gave us some insight on our product moving forward. That basically.

210
00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:43.199
Annie Brown: they don't want the users to have to feel like they're doing something extra to get this additional insight. And so I was just kind of wondering, like, how you is that a cluster, or is that more like a feedback.

211
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.126
Bob Moesta: So this is this is actually like, what I would say is, is

212
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:54.849
Bob Moesta: It's a conflict between the the buyer and the user. So think of the customer and the consumer.

213
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.690
Annie Brown: Yeah.

214
00:28:55.690 --> 00:29:06.669
Bob Moesta: Right, and and they they don't want a burden. But what I will tell you is that for it to be meaningful to the customers. It's about asking the right set of questions in the right time in the right sequence to make it valuable to them.

215
00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:07.480
Annie Brown: Right.

216
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:15.279
Bob Moesta: And so my aspect is as though they might want less friction. The reality is, is sometimes friction actually builds, builds interest.

217
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.799
Annie Brown: I love that.

218
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.689
Bob Moesta: So. So this is where I would say that this is the. The. The customer is actually wrong.

219
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:37.229
Bob Moesta: and they want they want it to be less friction, and what I'll tell you is that if we create a speed bump on the on the process of onboarding, people are way more likely to convert than if I actually just make it so easy to sign up, and they don't remember why they signed up.

220
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.300
Annie Brown: Hmm.

221
00:29:38.300 --> 00:30:07.140
Bob Moesta: So this is where the the so again, one of my mentors would say, is, every problem has 2 sides, and so, it being too easy or or too hard is, is the opposite is being too easy. So the the simple example is one of the things I did very early in the nineties or mid nineties was are, we'd have a program that would install so fast that people would install it 4 or 5 times because they didn't know it was installing. So we just literally created a gif that literally ran for 10 seconds. So people knew it was actually installing.

222
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:09.850
Annie Brown: Right? That's right.

223
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:26.350
Bob Moesta: That notion of of creating a little friction that basically actually creates value. So this is where the subtlety is. They don't want to burden their customers, but at the same time our consumers. But the same time is the consumers. If they're really trying to make progress, they do want to be burdened a little bit, because that that's how it adds value.

224
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:38.899
Annie Brown: Yeah. And we've seen that in the research that actually, when users participate in the machine learning pipeline, they trust AI. More. They stay on the platform more. Okay, that's a huge. That's a huge insight for us. So thank you.

225
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.725
Annie Brown: This is awesome.

226
00:30:41.840 --> 00:31:02.610
Bob Moesta: So I I'm available Linkedin as well. So everybody should. Just, you know, connect with me on Linkedin, and all you do is you text. Me got them in, and I'll like, because I'll I'll remember everybody's project, and then I can just, and I can give you 5 min here or there as you have you, if you have questions, but you gotta be very diligent about the 5 like 2 min for what? The question is. 1 min for what you're thinking about, and then 2 min for me to respond.

227
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.230
Annie Brown: All right. Yes.

228
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.070
Bob Moesta: For everybody on the on the call here.

229
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:08.489
Bob Moesta: Thank you so much.

230
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.459
Annie Brown: Yeah, we'll take you up on that. Yep.

231
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.080
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you.

232
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:12.830
Bob Moesta: Hey! Adam!

233
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:17.859
Lilliana Robinson: Next is Dave from evil genius. Games, Dave, are you on the line.

234
00:31:19.585 --> 00:31:20.560
Dave Scott: Yeah, I'm here.

235
00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.400
Lilliana Robinson: Alright. Are you ready.

236
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.119
Bob Moesta: I hope you're enjoying this because I I literally look forward to this every single time I do this I'd love to do this.

237
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:36.409
Lilliana Robinson: This is great. These are such rich insights. I hope you guys see how it's applicable to everybody like the past 2. A lot of you can relate that to your own businesses. Too

238
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.549
Lilliana Robinson: cool. Alright, Dave, kick us off.

239
00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.809
Bob Moesta: Hey, Dave, what's up, man?

240
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:40.929
Dave Scott: Hey! How are you?

241
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.565
Bob Moesta: Good.

242
00:31:42.545 --> 00:31:49.849
Dave Scott: So I'm with evil genius games. We actually make a tabletop role playing game similar to dungeons and dragons.

243
00:31:50.274 --> 00:31:56.289
Dave Scott: Except for 2 fundamental differences. One is, we have a modern day platform which allows you to play

244
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.479
Dave Scott: games like

245
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:05.260
Dave Scott: you know, play John Wicker Rambo instead of like a an elf wizard or or a gnome barbarian.

246
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:18.079
Dave Scott: And we use technology to be able to bring people together right? So if you don't, if you can't get around the dinner table to play. We have technology which allows anyone to play, no matter where they are.

247
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:19.010
Bob Moesta: Yep.

248
00:32:19.906 --> 00:32:22.359
Dave Scott: So we had a couple of interesting observations.

249
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:33.159
Bob Moesta: Just making sure I get this. I can do it remotely like, if if my kids are in different cities or countries, or wherever we could literally have a game and do a board game. We could have game night, though everybody's not in the same place.

250
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.649
Dave Scott: And that, and that. That's that's the huge value proposition. A lot of our customers use it to stay in touch with family.

251
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.220
Bob Moesta: Yup got it?

252
00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.119
Dave Scott: Have a family game night.

253
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:46.009
Dave Scott: but but to do it virtually. Yup.

254
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.730
Bob Moesta: I love it.

255
00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:47.550
Dave Scott: Yeah.

256
00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:53.029
Dave Scott: So our screening criteria was, we're looking for people who purchased our game.

257
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:55.430
Dave Scott: which is called everyday heroes

258
00:32:56.038 --> 00:33:03.479
Dave Scott: and are currently playing it. So they purchased it. They found 5 friends to play it, and they were actually playing it.

259
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.040
Dave Scott: We had 20 interviews. They lasted about an hour each

260
00:33:08.852 --> 00:33:12.860
Dave Scott: and across us Uk and Australia.

261
00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:15.705
Bob Moesta: Okay.

262
00:33:16.879 --> 00:33:23.779
Dave Scott: We had a couple of interesting commonalities that I just think are interesting is that almost everyone had the exact same origin story.

263
00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:28.900
Dave Scott: meaning that they discovered dungeons and dragons when they were 9 to 11 years old.

264
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.340
Dave Scott: and that's how they got into the hobby.

265
00:33:32.494 --> 00:33:34.905
Dave Scott: And then they branched off from there.

266
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:43.450
Bob Moesta: So. So so I gotta pause you for a second, because the this is this, this is where it gets complicated, because there's there's the people who initiate it.

267
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.050
Bob Moesta: And then there's the people who got invited to it.

268
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.490
Dave Scott: Yes.

269
00:33:47.490 --> 00:34:09.970
Bob Moesta: Right. And so you actually have to know. One is who are the people who are actually taking the political risk to actually introduce this notion of getting everybody together, because it's not. That's a unique breed of people, because it's kind of like. Think of it as vacations. Vacations are the same way, 20% of the people plan the vacations. The other 80% just go on the vacation that the 20% have planned

270
00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:17.832
Bob Moesta: right. And so you can't talk to the people who just went on vacation because they thought it was easy, because somebody else did all the work to plan it.

271
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:24.840
Dave Scott: So. Bob, I guess this is why you're a rock star. Because that was my second observation.

272
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.440
Dave Scott: My second observation is, I'm a micro influencer within my friends. Group.

273
00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:55.126
Bob Moesta: That's right. That that's 1 of the jobs is is that I I miss. It's either I miss people and want to spend time with them, and it's a way for me to spend time with them because I miss them, or it's like I wanna I wanna I wanna be the catalyst to keep us together, because that's what keeping us together is the most important thing. And so you start to realize there's several different kind of reasons why people are trying to do these games. And it's and it it sounds like it's about the game, but it usually has nothing to do with the game.

274
00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:11.749
Dave Scott: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And so what we found across all of our interviews is that every single one of them was a micro influencer. They were the ones who saw themselves as the the person who introduced new games into the into the part, into the group they found themselves usually selling.

275
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.650
Dave Scott: selling into the group like, Hey, do this play this game. Don't! Don't play that game

276
00:35:17.175 --> 00:35:32.820
Dave Scott: and oftentimes they would actually run the game in order to play it. So they would actually take that leadership role which is called the game master to actually run it because they want they wanted that game to actually what we call fire. They want the game to fire, or to happen.

277
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:40.600
Bob Moesta: Yeah. And so they're adding, they're adding, kind of all that. They're they're the ones they need. Control. Control is the other part of this thing right?

278
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.040
Bob Moesta: So so there, there.

279
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.480
Dave Scott: Control.

280
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.890
Bob Moesta: There's 2 parts. This one is is what I would call loneliness. How much of this is about being lonely

281
00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.430
Bob Moesta: and missing people, and how much of this is about me having a sense of control.

282
00:35:56.302 --> 00:36:01.140
Bob Moesta: Do like like again. Think of it as they're taking the risk to pull everybody together.

283
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:05.120
Bob Moesta: They don't want to put. They don't want that to fall apart because somebody ran it wrong.

284
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:12.300
Bob Moesta: And so their notion of of being able to get everybody together. They want that control piece usually is tied together with it.

285
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:21.169
Dave Scott: Yeah, that's interesting a lot. A lot of people. What we realized was was that a lot of them had very specific criteria about who they wanted to play with.

286
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.910
Bob Moesta: That's right.

287
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.099
Dave Scott: So when when they moved away.

288
00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:32.199
Dave Scott: there would be decades where they didn't play the game until that they reunited with that person or that group of people through this process.

289
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:37.560
Bob Moesta: Yep. And so part of this is, it's it's almost like a reunion ish in nature

290
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:46.940
Bob Moesta: like. So this is the struggling moment is like. Remember, when you used to play with your friends, the games. And and now life has gotten away from you like, how do we actually build up, you know, at some point like.

291
00:36:47.290 --> 00:37:01.229
Bob Moesta: you know, when you're in your twenties you have a lot of time, but when you're in your thirties you usually don't have as much time. And it's kind of like, okay, I want to get back to those other days. And so it's this notion they would call it nostalgic. But it's really about the fact of being able to actually have control to break away

292
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.290
Bob Moesta: the day-to-day stuff

293
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:11.730
Bob Moesta: right? But you need to interview the people who joined the game and the people who led the game separately. They're 2 completely different markets.

294
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.290
Dave Scott: Okay.

295
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:25.260
Bob Moesta: And and you can end up realizing that there are people who will join the game who can ruin it. That's why everybody is so like the the person who's setting up the game is really picky because they don't, they want it to work.

296
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:44.909
Bob Moesta: And if somebody is too hard, or to whatever they're gonna they're actually gonna have criteria by how they do the 1st game. And my belief is over time they'll probably bring in harder people that they can do, but they want to get it down before. Let's say we're not gonna ask John this time, because John will just bitch the entire time about this. So we're gonna we're gonna do this a couple of times. And then we're gonna ask John in.

297
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.450
Dave Scott: Yeah, it's interesting. We also did fired interviews.

298
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.189
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

299
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:54.370
Dave Scott: And what we found was the primary reason why a game did not happen.

300
00:37:54.420 --> 00:38:00.289
Dave Scott: So these are people who bought the game but never played it was that they couldn't convince their friends to play it.

301
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.225
Dave Scott: Yep.

302
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:25.129
Bob Moesta: And so my belief is they're using the wrong words, and they're using they. They don't actually know why they're trying to get people together. And if you can actually build the marketing pitch for them to say to the friends like, Hey, remember, when we used to do this, hey? When we did that like, how about this is like, so you actually need to give them almost a sales kit to help them sell other other learners or other users or players.

303
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.079
Dave Scott: It was funny because I come from.

304
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.340
Bob Moesta: Have some guilt guilt to it right.

305
00:38:33.035 --> 00:38:34.140
Dave Scott: Marketing.

306
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.600
Bob Moesta: Fine. But realize like that, like it's it's like, it's like, when we were kids. If you're not in, you're out.

307
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:56.920
Dave Scott: Yeah. So I was gonna ask you. So I come from b 2 b marketing. And where we talk about selling to the buying center, and so, like you'll have like a collateral for the Cso. Or the Siso or the cat collateral for the Cfo. When it comes to consumer. What does that sales Kit look like? That's where I'm stuck.

308
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.860
Bob Moesta: I. That's what I'm saying is, I think I think that there's 2. There's 2 2 buyers

309
00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:11.939
Bob Moesta: right. There's the buyer who who wants to initiate the entire thing. And then there's then there's they have to go recruit a set of people to come. And so we actually have to think about them as the buyer and the user.

310
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:34.159
Bob Moesta: Right? So I would actually say, like, what are the jobs of the of the buyer of the game, and what are the jobs of the because the other users are doing it to like, reconnect, to spend some time together, to to figure out about their lives right? It's like most people are looking at people through Instagram. It's kind of like, how do we actually, you know, start a conversation again instead of just seeing other people's lives through Instagram.

311
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.450
Dave Scott: Yeah.

312
00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:43.730
Bob Moesta: Right? And so so the thing is is like this competes with things like fantasy football.

313
00:39:44.730 --> 00:40:09.650
Bob Moesta: Right? This like like there's times where, like, you know, who organizes the League and who actually run, is in the League like I. I want nothing to do with running a league. I might play in a league, but I don't want anything to do with running a league. For God's sakes! Do you know what I mean? So like that? That's the kind of separation you want to think about. And and again, I think you're competing with people who aren't necessarily interested in sports, or they might be getting bored with sports and want to do something else. This is a really good alternative for that.

314
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:16.839
Bob Moesta: So the the one reason why I think this is actually big is this is how many people want to play a game

315
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.929
Bob Moesta: with their friends. But can't

316
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:30.230
Bob Moesta: that that to me is when I can answer that question say, like, Oh, that's probably a pretty big market of people who would love to play. And I think they do it through video games. But I think when you start to lose your video game skills.

317
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.920
Bob Moesta: play anymore.

318
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.769
Dave Scott: All right. Yeah.

319
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.699
Bob Moesta: So so all of a sudden you're left with something else, and a little more intellectual, which is a little bit more mature.

320
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.670
Dave Scott: And we have a lot of multigenerational people, too. They're playing with their father. They're playing with their their son.

321
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:56.519
Bob Moesta: Or brothers or sisters are playing because they're now farther apart, and they can actually play. It's it's the equivalent, let's say, when I was a kid. It would be like playing chess with a friend. Who who's you know.

322
00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:07.158
Bob Moesta: you know, you know. I'll say letters away where you we used to write letters and play chess. Yes, I did that. I'm sorry I was a geek, but yes, that's true.

323
00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:10.110
Dave Scott: That's impressive.

324
00:41:10.497 --> 00:41:17.650
Dave Scott: So so okay, so then, so your recommendation is, I do jobs to be done on play on players.

325
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.929
Dave Scott: on users.

326
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:24.189
Bob Moesta: I would think about the right name for basically the person who's leading it. And then the people who join it.

327
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.140
Dave Scott: Yeah.

328
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:36.230
Bob Moesta: And I would name it by how they name themselves. I'm the organizer, or I'm the I'm the I'm the I'm the game master, or whatever. And so what's the jobs of the game? Masters versus the jobs of the participants?

329
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:45.463
Dave Scott: Yeah, we have this term in the industry called forever. GM, they're the people who always are running the game because no one else will will do it.

330
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:56.630
Bob Moesta: Well, and and that might be part of the burnout is that you actually have to teach them how to actually pass the baton to somebody else, because then they get sick of running it, but nobody else knows how to run it, because he does such a good, or he or she does a great job.

331
00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:05.650
Dave Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's that's actually one of the insights we found. The jobs to be done was when people so you could play a dungeons and dragons game for years.

332
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.870
Dave Scott: and the GM. Gets burnt out.

333
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:20.150
Dave Scott: and then what they'll do is someone else will come in and go. Let me run a game of everyday heroes. It's a you know. It's a palate cleanser, and that's that we think is our natural insertion. Point

334
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:27.560
Dave Scott: to an organization, to to a. A, a party, an entity, that is.

335
00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.380
Dave Scott: you know, 100% sold on our competition.

336
00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.909
Bob Moesta: Yeah. So so

337
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:38.219
Bob Moesta: one of the things that I would think about. And again, this is might be a side par, but it's kind of like.

338
00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:56.240
Bob Moesta: when do people get together? And when could they play the game together? That then it like seeds it so they can do it apart. And so what I'm thinking is like everybody's getting together for Thanksgiving. Let's do it. At Thanksgiving dinner. We actually play it together. We see what it's like, and then, all of a sudden, it's like, now we can actually play it separately, because we all know how the game works

339
00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:15.669
Bob Moesta: right? And so it's like, like. And I'm thinking, like a reunion, I'm thinking, like a golf outing, I'm thinking, like a a work retreat. I'm thinking about like places where you could kind of get people together and say like, How do you? Because I think introducing it in person will actually be easier than introducing it remotely, but maybe not.

340
00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:22.410
Dave Scott: So so you're it's funny, you say, that there are over 500 weekend gaming conventions in the Us. Alone.

341
00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.320
Dave Scott: and it is one of our primary

342
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:34.410
Dave Scott: primary ways we adopt customers is that they try the game at a weekend convention. They love it, they take home, and then they convince their family to go play it.

343
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:43.969
Bob Moesta: Yep, I think that's exactly right. I think that that sounds like a very cause. I just think the notion of learning it new, and being able to get confident with it and Ca, and and knowing they can do it

344
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:52.982
Bob Moesta: like they need a almost like a place to try it without actually consequences. They don't want to be honest. You don't want the 1st time you play it, to actually be with your friends.

345
00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:56.440
Dave Scott: Interesting.

346
00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:03.350
Bob Moesta: Right cause they're they're they're taking a big enough risk trying to get them back together to do something that they haven't done before.

347
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:11.300
Dave Scott: Yeah. So the more confidence they've got that they can actually introduce it to their friends and enjoy. Have a good time with it.

348
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:11.730
Bob Moesta: That's right.

349
00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:12.879
Dave Scott: The better they are.

350
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:38.189
Bob Moesta: Because you you might. You might build up tips and tricks for basically the the game masters. And here's some things you can do. Start it when you get advanced like, help them understand? They're getting better and and make sure that they're feeling the progress of every time they get together. It's another hour they spent with all their friends like you need to remind them of the progress they're making, because at some point it's gonna seem like it's a lot of work.

351
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:48.770
Dave Scott: So one of the things that we were thinking about is reorienting our messaging around that game master. And then also, we're gonna hire a professional game master. This guy named Troy Lavalley.

352
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:57.010
Dave Scott: He's got a Youtube following of millions of people to actually do a masterclass on creating an exciting and enter engaging game

353
00:44:57.592 --> 00:45:14.720
Dave Scott: as the game master, and really sort of covet that game, master, that micro influencer, because they're the ones that actually do bring in the 5 other players that are required hadn't thought about the idea of actually doing that plus also focusing on the user.

354
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.990
Dave Scott: So that's interesting. That's an interesting insight.

355
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:27.029
Bob Moesta: So so there's another. There's another angle to all this which gets back to is, can you start to get the game, masters to be hired like I can hire a game master to run my event.

356
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:44.189
Bob Moesta: And so, all of a sudden, now it becomes a place where it's like I don't even have to worry about it. But I have. I've hired this guy. It's it's almost like we're we're gonna do a you know, a a dinner night. We're gonna actually everybody order from wherever the dinner is, we're gonna talk through this. And then then the the game master comes in and runs the game, so I can play just like everybody else.

357
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:55.440
Dave Scott: Yeah, we actually have a hundred 10 professional volunteer game masters that are at our disposal that can be hired through an app that we created, called dispatch.

358
00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.900
Bob Moesta: So. So one of the questions I might start asking people is.

359
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.049
Bob Moesta: who do they miss the most

360
00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.680
Bob Moesta: today?

361
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:12.450
Bob Moesta: Because that's the signal. That's the that's almost the thing of like God. What can I do to get closer to that person

362
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:20.869
Bob Moesta: right? And so, all of a sudden, this becomes, then the the again the question creates the space in the brain for the solution to fall into is like.

363
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:22.440
Bob Moesta: who do you miss the most?

364
00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.010
Bob Moesta: And what are you going to do about it.

365
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:26.939
Bob Moesta: and just let it lie.

366
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.949
Dave Scott: Yeah, we also found we also found is, this is a really good tool for finding new friends. So we had a lot of interviews.

367
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:35.099
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.379
Dave Scott: We're coming and going, hey? I just moved to Austin, don't know anyone.

369
00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.999
Dave Scott: And then I found my gaming group, and then I had a set of friends in this new area.

370
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.799
Bob Moesta: That's right. I think I think so. So again. The the good angle on that is is by a list of people who just moved to a certain area.

371
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:52.980
Bob Moesta: right

372
00:46:53.460 --> 00:47:02.419
Bob Moesta: like, because again, it's it's the. It's the moving club, like, Go find the moving club for Austin, and say, all right, who I just moved here. What am I gonna do? And you basically get on their registry.

373
00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.165
Dave Scott: There you go!

374
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.110
Dave Scott: That's cool.

375
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:16.402
Bob Moesta: 1. 1 of the reasons why we decided not to move is because it's so hard to make new friends. I don't want to move to Salt Lake City or Phoenix, and go like I. I got no friends

376
00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:17.970
Bob Moesta: right.

377
00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:23.620
Lilliana Robinson: That's so true, Dave. We have 1 1 more question before you have to wrap.

378
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:26.020
Dave Scott: No, I think this is great. Thank you very much.

379
00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.030
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, perfect.

380
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.059
Bob Moesta: I love it, Bob. Thank you.

381
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.750
Lilliana Robinson: Thanks, Dave. Next is Collab.

382
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.729
Lilliana Robinson: I'm gonna put them up here.

383
00:47:35.760 --> 00:48:05.190
Florence Ettlin: Hi, Bob! Hi, Bob! Hi! My name is Talitha, and I'm the CEO of Collab, and this is my co-founder, Flo. Nice to meet you. And what we're doing is basically for the small teams that manage short term rental properties. They're overburdened with responding to repetitive guest inquiries and being on call 24, 7 to handle all of their guests. And so we've developed an AI powered pocket concierge called Anna, and what she does is that she supports both the small teams as well as the guests, as well

384
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:21.850
Florence Ettlin: by providing them with property information. Local recommendations, executes on service requests, and also basically reroutes the complaint straight to the team for them to handle it. So the purpose is that she's really trying to provide operational efficiency to the team, and a delightful experience.

385
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:37.929
Bob Moesta: It's mostly for for Airbnb and Vrbo places like that, and it's I might own a few of them. So it's it's me it's somebody might own a couple of these different properties. And it's just balancing like the workflow between trying to basically rent these properties all the time.

386
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:42.010
Florence Ettlin: Exactly. Yes, and taking care of all those guests that are coming and staying. Yeah.

387
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.390
Bob Moesta: Got it. So. Have you talked to customers.

388
00:48:44.890 --> 00:49:09.340
Florence Ettlin: Yes, so we've conducted quite a few done interviews, and we came up with 4 clusters. So the 1st one is, my team's expertise is being wasted. So this is primarily for property management companies that have quite large portfolios, and they feel like their team should be reallocating their time towards more impactful work so they can be utilizing their skill set better. 1st one.

389
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:29.720
Florence Ettlin: the second one is, the Newbies are encroaching, and I don't want to lose out to them. So this is a different set. This is for individual hosts and family or micro businesses that only have, like a few properties that they manage. And they're feeling the pressure of seeing, like a whole new set of amateur hosts that are entering the marketplace, and they feel the pressure of setting themselves apart

390
00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:31.909
Florence Ettlin: from the competition that's rising.

391
00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.320
Bob Moesta: Got it.

392
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.529
Florence Ettlin: 3rd one. It's.

393
00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:51.620
Bob Moesta: Is is 2. Also the case where they're they're seeing less rentals. They've got less performance. They see more competition. It's it's like, okay. What else do I have to do? And they can't seem to find an edge to kind of figure out how to get it back to the level they had, or or they just feel the competition. But they haven't seen any real differences yet.

394
00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:55.259
Florence Ettlin: Yeah. So they haven't really seen the differences or like impact on their actual business.

395
00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:59.640
Bob Moesta: It's more feeling that that like this is getting tougher. I better step up my game so.

396
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:06.979
Florence Ettlin: Exactly that's good. And they really they really want to set themselves apart as being more professional than all those Newbies that just.

397
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:13.029
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So the so the other part is to help legitimize me and make me seem more professional than everybody else.

398
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:26.709
Florence Ettlin: Exactly because you have to remember these individual hosts and micro businesses. They're competing against other amateurs. But also they're competing against the large Otas like booking.com and stuff. So they're trying to drive more direct bookings make themselves seem more professional like you, said.

399
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:30.589
Bob Moesta: Yep, yep, they're trying to legitimize themselves. Okay, that's 2. Alright 3.

400
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:54.150
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, number 3 is, I'm glued to my phone 24, 7. So this is actually across the board from property management companies to also the micro businesses. Essentially, it's not the volume of questions. That's the issue here. It's that they're constantly being disrupted, and their day is just broken up all the time. So they feel like the pressure of being on 24, 7, because of all the ad hoc questions that come their way from morning to night.

401
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.150
Bob Moesta: Got it.

402
00:50:55.730 --> 00:51:00.120
Florence Ettlin: Last one is, my small team feels overwhelmed. But I don't want to hire more.

403
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:16.839
Florence Ettlin: This group is once again property management companies, and the key thing here is that they're trying to drive more cost, efficient operations, and that can come from 2 places, either one. They're having financial constraints as a business, or they're trying to like scale their operations. But they don't want to hire more people. They just want to keep.

404
00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.870
Bob Moesta: This is where they want to do more with the same.

405
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.740
Florence Ettlin: That's it. Yes, exactly. That's the statement. Yeah, yeah.

406
00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:42.209
Bob Moesta: So one is is like this is, but my team is doing a bunch of stuff below what they should be doing. Somebody's got to do it, but it's like, if we could get this off their plate because they're they should be out selling, they should be out doing other things. They shouldn't be answering some of these basic questions. So help me get my team to work it. The the way I see is the top of their profession as opposed to having them to do all, everything, from soup to nuts.

407
00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:42.870
Florence Ettlin: Yes.

408
00:51:42.870 --> 00:52:10.199
Bob Moesta: 2 is literally I'm a newbie, but like I feel, I feel pressure. But I want to actually see more professional than the other Newbies and help me legitimize my practice. So I actually will differentiate myself by being seen as more of a professional than just a just, an amateur doing this 3 is, I'm stuck to my phone, and I just can't like like there's just so much going on. I I don't have a breath like, Give me give me a way to like, break away from my phone, or at least give me some breaks. So I don't have to be on the phone 24, 7,

409
00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:16.859
Bob Moesta: and the last one is, help me do do more with less, or with this, help me do more with the same or less.

410
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:26.009
Florence Ettlin: Yes. One thing I just want to add about number 3 is it's once again not the amount, but rather, I want to be able to spend time with my family, go to a wedding.

411
00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:32.540
Bob Moesta: I wanna be able to unplug, unplug and and and kind of just like spend time, spend quality time right?

412
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.150
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, with other things in my life. Get back.

413
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:38.819
Bob Moesta: So I don't. So I don't have. It's really so. I don't have to worry so much. So I can actually go do these other things.

414
00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:39.340
Florence Ettlin: Yes.

415
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:43.150
Bob Moesta: Not really about what they're gonna do. It's like, just make sure you free time for me.

416
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:46.839
Florence Ettlin: That's it. I want to work out. I want to spend time with my family. All these other things. Yeah.

417
00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:47.580
Bob Moesta: Spend there.

418
00:52:47.580 --> 00:53:05.040
Florence Ettlin: On cluster 2, the people that were in that cluster. They're actually not Newbies themselves. So they are actually already established in in the market, and then they see all the new people that come in, and they want to now set themselves apart and legitimize themselves compared to the Newbies.

419
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.700
Bob Moesta: Yep.

420
00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.090
Bob Moesta: alright.

421
00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:10.589
Bob Moesta: Where do you want? Where do you think you should focus.

422
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:17.449
Florence Ettlin: Yeah. So we did quite a deep dive analysis in the past days, because we wanted to really weigh the positives, negatives.

423
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:18.220
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, it's.

424
00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:22.499
Florence Ettlin: Like we have access. So what we decided actually is

425
00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.989
Florence Ettlin: number one would be the one that we would go after.

426
00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:44.019
Florence Ettlin: And the primary reason there is that these people are really really having the strongest, one of the stronger, struggling moments. So they want to progress their business. But they can't, because the people are not being utilized, they should be number 2 and 3. The reason why we kind of

427
00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:51.700
Florence Ettlin: thought maybe not. But we'd love to hear your thoughts is that actually we felt this. The pulls were way stronger than the pushes.

428
00:53:52.565 --> 00:54:02.310
Florence Ettlin: So the want to be perceived. Professional, that was like a really strong. Pull but not such a strong push. Because competition is there all the time. So it wasn't like.

429
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:09.550
Bob Moesta: That's that's what that's why I don't like to. I don't like 2 is 2 is kind of a it's a realization, and it's not. There's no big trigger event to it.

430
00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:26.500
Bob Moesta: It kind of seeps in. And finally, like, Okay, I got it. And they're just gonna reach for like a whole bunch of different things. And they're not gonna really they're not gonna know which one's which. But like, if you actually help with one and 3 like they'll they'll they'll find 2 will find you, but not. I wouldn't design for 2.

431
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:50.140
Florence Ettlin: Yeah. Yeah. And then number 3, the hesitations we have there once again. Actually, yes, there is a push. But there is quite a lot of inertia there. So people are like, Yeah, but it's okay. They're willing to almost accept the fact that this is part of their job. And yes, a guest might call them at 9 Pm. So they are almost like, let's not fix what's not what's not broken.

432
00:54:50.475 --> 00:55:00.549
Florence Ettlin: So that's why we were a bit hesitant with number 3, or wanting to hone in on number 3. Once again, the pull actually outweighs the push. That's yeah.

433
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:27.209
Bob Moesta: I think I think there's a big push in 3. You might not, but the one of the big pushes here is like I don't have. I don't have enough time to spend with my family. I feel like I'm alone all the time. There's there's there's a lot of big emotional push around 3, in my opinion, but it might not be exactly the same. But I I feel like I've seen this job in other places, and it's it's they don't want to tell you about the push. They only talk about the pull, but there's actually a lot of push when you really digest it.

434
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:47.970
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, yeah, I feel like, with some of the conversations we definitely felt it. I think Jake just put it in the chat. One person said, you know I went to my Yoga workout class on a Saturday and had 9 missed calls from the guest, and I can't even work out for 1 h, so there's definitely some where we felt stronger pushes, but others where we felt the pull was way stronger.

435
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:48.690
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

436
00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:49.140
Florence Ettlin: I want to.

437
00:55:49.140 --> 00:56:08.660
Bob Moesta: And I would tell you that the the ones I want to go after is, I want the ones where there's a lot of push, and there might be a little pull, but you can actually shape the pull. But if there's a lot of pull and there's no push, it's 1 of those things where you end up into having trouble. Because, like they, they, it's all aspirational, and they can't compare it against something that you do today.

438
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:13.000
Bob Moesta: And so that's why like 2 is hard to sell to, because it's all aspirational.

439
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.360
Florence Ettlin: Yeah.

440
00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:23.570
Bob Moesta: And it's not really like, they don't know what better is. But like, 3 is like, Yeah, I. I'm on my phone all the time. Now I'm not on my phone all the time. This is great, clear?

441
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:25.840
Bob Moesta: So

442
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:28.090
Bob Moesta: I think one is.

443
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.000
Bob Moesta: how do I say this?

444
00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:36.799
Bob Moesta: So one is where the person who's running the rental business is is literally buying this for their team

445
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:50.479
Bob Moesta: right? And and typically they they. This is where you have to position it against like, what's holding you back? Why, why aren't you growing? How can how can you do more with like, I think one in 4 are actually very similar in that sense.

446
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.310
Florence Ettlin: Gonna be a question of ours whether you think they belong together? Is it one class.

447
00:56:54.310 --> 00:57:13.450
Bob Moesta: No, I I think I think there, there! So think of! Think of one is I'm buying this for my team, and I'm pushing it on my team 4 is like, I meaning I. I want them to figure out what to do with it. Where 4 is like. It's very simple. I want to be able to add 3 more rental properties and not have to add any more people. It's very simple, and it's very different to me.

448
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.810
Bob Moesta: Right.

449
00:57:16.075 --> 00:57:18.869
Bob Moesta: I, personally would start with 3.

450
00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:19.810
Florence Ettlin: Okay.

451
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:24.909
Bob Moesta: Because here's the thing is in. The one of the main reasons is, if I can design it

452
00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:31.130
Bob Moesta: to understand how to get people to get off the phone. It will feed all the other jobs.

453
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:42.760
Bob Moesta: And if you don't have that intimacy of understanding, what are the little day to day things that they're answering, that they don't really need to answer anymore, that you can automate. It will then feed to one in 4 as well.

454
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:49.409
Bob Moesta: It will feed to feed to 2. But like, if I can't solve 3, I'm not sure I can help anybody else.

455
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:53.260
Florence Ettlin: Right. That's the commonality across.

456
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:58.960
Bob Moesta: It's the commonality about it. And it's like. And and here's the thing is, it's the easiest sell, because they're buying it for themselves.

457
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:04.690
Florence Ettlin: Funny enough. Our 1st customers are in 3, but we thought that was just like a fluke chance.

458
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:13.279
Bob Moesta: Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, it's it's typically, because again, in one and 4, it's somebody buying it for somebody else. Where in 3 they're buying it for themselves

459
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:18.320
Bob Moesta: and making it work, and once they make it work they'll then either push it to one, or they'll push it to 4.

460
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.460
Florence Ettlin: But.

461
00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:28.719
Bob Moesta: My belief is most of these people so like. So here's the, here's the ad I basically came up with, which is going to break 1st your rental business, your family, or your health.

462
00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.270
Florence Ettlin: Oh!

463
00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:31.390
Bob Moesta: Right.

464
00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:33.909
Bob Moesta: and they they can relate to that.

465
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:46.640
Bob Moesta: And the thing is is, how do we give you time to work out? How do we get time to spend quality time with your family. This isn't about. This isn't about being covered. This is about getting getting back to some form of balance.

466
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:52.440
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, yeah. People there. Generally said, I want my life back. That was like.

467
00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:52.940
Bob Moesta: Yup!

468
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.180
Florence Ettlin: Improvements that we heard.

469
00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:57.849
Bob Moesta: By the way, what will people pay to have their life back

470
00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.669
Bob Moesta: a lot more than basically.

471
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.190
Florence Ettlin: Just.

472
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:06.249
Bob Moesta: Sure I'm I'm I'm like in Job 2. It's a nice to have, and 3. It's an essential.

473
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:07.270
Florence Ettlin: Yeah.

474
00:59:09.152 --> 00:59:30.177
Florence Ettlin: question about cluster one. So reason why we felt like there was a really strong push as well is because these people, basically they go through solutions, they actively look for it. They really are also tend to be a bit more tech forward, go after it, whereas in Cluster 3. It's still very

475
00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.920
Florence Ettlin: mostly very analog. So they haven't digitized yet. So there is a bit of.

476
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.040
Bob Moesta: You're you're you're competing with excel.

477
00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:37.790
Florence Ettlin: That's.

478
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:41.419
Bob Moesta: The the thing is, you're competing with Excel. To be honest, you're competing with the intern.

479
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.690
Florence Ettlin: Hmm.

480
00:59:42.690 --> 01:00:09.389
Bob Moesta: Right. And so this is where you have to realize that that 3 is in a case where it's not an intern or it's not. It's like, it's not excel. It's like, I need to actually get something to help me get off of these things. And one is kind of like they're doing this. It's not great, but like, I don't know of any better alternatives. And so you still have to prove yourself more in one where I think 3. You're gonna actually, if you can just literally save them 5 min a day, they'll be happier than any like. If you get to an hour. They're going to be a static.

481
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:41.160
Bob Moesta: And so, like again, if I'm starting, I would start in 3, because I can know what to build and what to what to really focus on, because I have the buyer and user in the same moment. And then I can figure out. And it might be 3 months later. Then you can launch one, and then you launch 4 like, and you might think about it. Having to be different. Products like this is 3 might be, you know, personal and basically 1 1. When you go to Job one, it becomes like, you know, kind of the team side. And then 4 is about the corporate side, or something like that.

482
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:49.330
Bob Moesta: So you have the same basic product. But it now has different names, so they can actually understand how which situation they're in. So they buy by product.

483
01:00:49.770 --> 01:01:03.730
Bob Moesta: So you actually, for like intercom, basically ended up forming 4 products around each job, and then basically then said, Which which product do you need? Based on these struggling moments? And then they could actually figure out which what they wanted, because it was very different products.

484
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:06.440
Florence Ettlin: Interesting.

485
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:16.320
Bob Moesta: Right. But I know most people want to build one product to fit all. But my belief is is, if you build 3, you'll know how to build it all. If you build one, you'll still have a trouble trying to get to 3,

486
01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.870
Bob Moesta: because because

487
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:25.149
Bob Moesta: think of one. The reason why I don't like one. And this bad way to say it is like.

488
01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:45.919
Bob Moesta: I've built enough product here where people just force it onto the team. Because, like, you guys aren't doing what you should be doing. Here's what it is, and they just throw it to them. And so the implementation on the other side is usually way harder than than Job 3. Where it's it's somebody who really wants to make them. They're internally motivated where one is. They're externally motivated by their boss.

489
01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.760
Lilliana Robinson: Collab. We have time for one more question from you guys.

490
01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.520
Florence Ettlin: Do we have any other question? I think you've answered everything already. Is there? Do.

491
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.370
Lilliana Robinson: That's amazing.

492
01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:10.599
Florence Ettlin: I was just gonna ask, like, do you think we should put into our mind the fact that number 3, they're a little harder to access. So these are individual hosts and micro businesses, and it's quite hard to find them as well as to actually get to them

493
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:14.130
Florence Ettlin: versus number one where the discoverability is.

494
01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:23.949
Bob Moesta: That's a great point. That is a great point. And to be honest, if you can't crack the way to get access to them. Then the fact is is that it's really not even available to you.

495
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:24.790
Florence Ettlin: No.

496
01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:50.710
Bob Moesta: So. So here's the way I would think about it then is is, I would design it for 3, and maybe try to sell in one and 3 simultaneously, and see how that goes, because at some point they they might be more again. A lot of people aren't open to changing their ways when they until they're ready to break where they're willing to actually inject things into their team. And so, if anything, I would think about them one and 3 together, because 3 might be where you get traction. But

497
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:57.789
Bob Moesta: or one is where you might get traction. But 3 is where the where the most money is, they're gonna pay you way more money if you can save them time.

498
01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:00.190
Florence Ettlin: yeah, right?

499
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.219
Florence Ettlin: Good, yeah, that makes sense.

500
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:05.810
Florence Ettlin: Okay, thank you so much. Bob that was super helpful, thank you.

501
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.420
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome good job. Clam

502
01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:12.779
Lilliana Robinson: alright. Last one that I am like volunteering before we open it up to the group.

503
01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.270
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

504
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:14.090
Lilliana Robinson: Lunar.

505
01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:21.940
Lilliana Robinson: And then we're gonna open up to the group. So Agent Luna, I'm gonna give you guys like 8 min, just so that we still have time for everybody else.

506
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.219
Lilliana Robinson: so take it away.

507
01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:31.689
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I'll pop my time so I can be respectful of everyone's time. Awesome. It's great to meet you, Bob. Thank you so much for

508
01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:55.470
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: taking the time. So I'm Dominique. I'm CEO of Agent Luna, and I'm William the Coo and agent, Luna. We're closing the gap between outdated financial practices and the needs of a next Gen. Investor. And we do this by equipping financial firms with the tools they need to guide a new generation of investors on the wealth journey. How do we do that? Well, as a financial digital marketing expert, we're starting there.

509
01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:02.009
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: So I will briefly explain to you our jobs to be done journey which we have had

510
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:11.699
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: a lot of fun. I should add, Bob, we're very recent into a financial industry pivot, so I hope my 1st time doing that pitch, landed well.

511
01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:19.230
Bob Moesta: We can. We can talk about that. Where? Where was it? Where was it before? Or is this your first? st This is like your 1st foray into financial the financial space.

512
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:28.989
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: So when we joined techstars, we initially were targeting B to C serving Etsy sellers. So very, very different.

513
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.880
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

514
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:50.029
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, we learned very quickly that this is more of a vitamin, not a painkiller, and they don't have the willingness to pay. We started jobs to be done. Initially, we had real estate on one side, because Will's background is real estate. Wealth management started the process with real estate very quickly realized that

515
01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:59.420
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: the energy wasn't there. And we're not the right people to solve it. So we thought, let's try out wealth management energy was there. So that's where we're at now.

516
01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:04.350
Bob Moesta: Got it. And I and I I think that's like to be honest. This this is a very

517
01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:12.479
Bob Moesta: common thing where you start to. You've got to find a group, 2 things, a group of people that struggle and a group of people you care about.

518
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:28.979
Bob Moesta: because if you don't care about them. You're not really going to build the best product, and the fact is, they have to be struggling, and though though Etsy Etsy Sellers are struggling, they're not willing to pay. They're willing to Macgyver their whole way through everything. And so the fact is not not as well where most people

519
01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:41.310
Bob Moesta: like when they make money. They don't know what to do with it, and then they feel like they have to pay somebody to actually figure that out. And so ultimately they have to get, and they're not getting any financial education in college or or high school at all, or very little.

520
01:05:41.635 --> 01:05:41.960
Dave Scott: So.

521
01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:53.519
Bob Moesta: But most people are ill prepared for all that. So I think that's a it's a reasonable, though it might seem like they're way off. They seem really really close and buying a house. Most people buy 2 or 3 houses in their lifetime, so it's just not

522
01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:54.560
Bob Moesta: frequent enough.

523
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.270
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, absolutely

524
01:05:58.361 --> 01:06:20.170
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: jobs to be done. Process. So to give you the overview. We've now completed 13 in total. We also ran 14 discovery calls where we spoke to the investor just to because we're creating a digital tool where we help reach them. We wanted to just test that space. But I'm gonna focus specifically on the jobs to be done.

525
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:39.750
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: The screening criteria. So specifically, wealth managers and boutique private bankers who within the past 6 months have either hired or changed their social media marketing agency or freelance social media manager, or they recently subscribed or switched their paid Saas platform.

526
01:06:40.809 --> 01:06:48.589
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: We also have some additional criteria that they have to be active at least 3 times per week to promote their brand or company.

527
01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:58.449
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: So there was 4 clusters in total. I'll quickly explain to you what those statements are. And then we can dive into which one we've chosen, and whether you think that's the right.

528
01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:08.110
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: So 1st statement, was, we're wasting time and missing revenue targets with efficient execution. So

529
01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:37.330
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: really, the struggling moment here was that manual processes are slowing down marketing and sales which resulted in missed revenue targets. And what we learned from this process as well is that really that moment to purchase was that leadership was demanding an immediate action to streamline those Kpis. So forcing the team to invest. And I think around the motivation side, this was quite interesting because they don't socially, they don't want to be perceived as though they're failing to meet

530
01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:49.573
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: stressed about missing those targets as well. There's a lot of cuts in banks. A lot of change over every year. Specific quotes as well. We're around, you know. We just need to be faster. We're too slow to market.

531
01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:58.689
Bob Moesta: Yeah. So so part of it is is so again, it's not that. It's just too hard. It's the fact. This is their ability to actually try to plan and execute

532
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.680
Bob Moesta: is too slow that they can't, even if they say, Oh, we God, we gotta do something. By the end of next month. They're like, Yeah, we can't do that.

533
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:16.349
Bob Moesta: And so it's it's it's the aspect of they can't. They just don't have the capability to execute as fast on these things. And the things are they're not. They're not. They're not bigger. They're actually getting smaller and faster. And we can't cope.

534
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.899
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Absolutely spot on

535
01:08:19.315 --> 01:08:44.344
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: number 2 is we can't keep operating with outdated marketing systems. So you know, there's a lot of legacy systems that are hindering the marketing performance and integration with modern tools. Usually what you know, the struggling moment and the purchasing moment was really a failed campaign. There's a lot of leadership pressure. There's moments where they realize they've got to upgrade those systems.

536
01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:58.250
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: manual processes, resource intensive. And they're just very frustrated, you know quotes around our outdated systems of the bottleneck. Our systems don't talk to that. Not sophisticated.

537
01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:02.068
Bob Moesta: So so this one, this one, I just would say,

538
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:09.600
Bob Moesta: you might want to go a little deeper, because one of the things that I find is like, like most people, it's kind of like putting gutters on your house.

539
01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:18.799
Bob Moesta: Nobody really wants to do it. But like, when you actually find out. It's 1 of 3 reasons why people put gutters on their houses like they're looking to sell the house.

540
01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:48.849
Bob Moesta: They're actually refinancing the house, or the fact is, they got water in the basement, and it's like one of those 3. And you start to realize, like, it's the aspect of if they had to replace them anyways, and they'll get more for the house. They'll do it. And so this is is when they say it's outdated. I think that there might be several different subsets of where it's outdated, because I'm looking to sell it, or I'm looking to buy, or I'm looking to, basically, you know, make it look better than it is, and it's that's fine. Because, again, most of these systems are 10 to 15 years old, and they don't even know

541
01:09:48.920 --> 01:10:03.919
Bob Moesta: like they're finally looking at it, going like, if I own the firm I like, this is where you see in law firms where they only upgrade the software right before they're gonna buy, or right before they're gonna sell their their thing, because the only way to make it marketable was to upgrade it.

542
01:10:04.728 --> 01:10:06.120
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, no. It's an.

543
01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:20.910
Bob Moesta: So I don't know if that's the case into here, but I've I would just see if you could probe a little to see if there was some intent, because nobody just randomly fixes these things, there's got to be something that's happening that's really causing them to say, like, Okay, like, am I gonna lose my job.

544
01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.600
Bob Moesta: They're so they're so outdated that I'm gonna lose my job. That's that's a legitimate reason.

545
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.120
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, it's.

546
01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.948
Bob Moesta: Changing it, because oh, it's it's old. It's time like, yeah, everything's old in time.

547
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:46.359
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: It's an excellent point, I think largely, it's it's that fear of the falling behind, and they don't have the right tools to execute correctly. So it's limited on what they can do with marketing. This they see.

548
01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:52.350
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: you know the fear of what's happening in the market very quickly, because I I know I only have 8 min.

549
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:52.800
Bob Moesta: Go ahead!

550
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.290
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: And.

551
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:53.809
Bob Moesta: Sorry.

552
01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:59.930
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: 2 more. 3rd one was I'm losing out on personalized marketing opportunities.

553
01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:29.070
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: They felt that the marketing campaigns aren't really resonating with with the clients. They're struggling to generate qualified leads. As a result of that, they see that the competitors are taking more of those clients from them. So really, they're motivated by the challenge of securing those high quality leads, but more in a functional perspective. They want to create more personalized campaigns to reach a younger audience and attract that new generation of high net worth clients.

554
01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:42.368
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Just for times. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Overall of number 4 was. Our sales and marketing teams aren't aligned. There was some funny quotes here that have some naughty words, so I won't share them.

555
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.359
Bob Moesta: I'm from Detroit. I know I know the dirty words. Don't worry.

556
01:11:45.360 --> 01:12:05.380
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, there was this connect between the sales and marketing teams. I know this too well as well from from my time in banking, but ultimately it miss, it leads to misleads, and failing to close deals. Efficiency and time is everything. When you're trying to close these deals and poor collaboration, and leadership are not happy with it.

557
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:17.290
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: So we have made the decision to go with cluster one the reason for that is, if we work backwards. Number 4, we feel that sales and marketing teams aren't aligned. That's not something that we can

558
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:19.681
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: change today or tomorrow.

559
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:30.050
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: that it's very messy marketing and sales from a compliance perspective. The data is not talk to each other. So that's not something we can solve losing out on personalized marketing

560
01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:51.629
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: personalization that lends us more into a paid ad space again, very difficult. In banking from a compliance perspective, we can change number 2. You've made a good point. We feel that this we want to go deeper to find out exactly what this means by outdated and archaic. But again, this is something that we're thinking longer term to scale to.

561
01:12:51.730 --> 01:13:02.030
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: So number one, we feel that we can have the most immediate impact in in the sense of working on the things that they just don't want to do, because they're inefficient, so we can help

562
01:13:02.659 --> 01:13:09.789
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: increase that and take that from them, lilliana said. 1 min left, so I'll pause there, Bob, because we'd love to.

563
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:16.809
Bob Moesta: Yup, I I so I'm i i'll say I'm on the same page. I think one is is going to be the easiest place to start.

564
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:35.999
Bob Moesta: At some point that they feel like they're wasting time, and they can be very articulated. And and the value proposition is going to be very straightforward. It's like we can do this for you, and twice the time for half the cost, and so that that kind of aspect will be very easy to be able to understand and be able to design, because at some point these are

565
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:47.919
Bob Moesta: again, you're competing with excel. You're competing with the intern you're competing with temp agency. You're competing with A, with A, with a contractor of some sort. And ultimately the the real thing is is.

566
01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:55.709
Bob Moesta: if they can, the the thing you'll need, though, is a diagnostic of some sort to help them understand. What like? Why are they wasting so much time.

567
01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:13.889
Bob Moesta: so actually ask them a set of questions around, kind of like like, where are the real opportunities? So once they kind of lean in, you should be prepared to ask them a bunch of questions of where they think the where, where do you think the waste exists? Because this is this is a simple value proposition on reducing waste right

568
01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:21.539
Bob Moesta: and and increasing speed, because that's the other thing is, they might be able to re reduce the waste, but they don't know how to actually increase the speed.

569
01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:31.210
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: This is super super helpful, because our new websites live tomorrow. And I'm certainly gonna take what you've said.

570
01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:35.100
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Work on a few copywriting edits there, Bob, which are really helpful.

571
01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:40.210
Bob Moesta: So again, I I always start with a question. It's like, What do you need to get off your plate? But you can't.

572
01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:41.760
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Hmm.

573
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:46.160
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: yeah, I'm frantically writing this down.

574
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.070
Bob Moesta: It's recorded. It's recorded.

575
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.049
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. That's why we recorded it.

576
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:50.960
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Thank you. Guys.

577
01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:56.369
Bob Moesta: That's why we do it at some point. Every time you every time we talk you're gonna want to record, because it goes fast.

578
01:14:57.630 --> 01:14:58.110
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

579
01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:03.069
Bob Moesta: I don't really remember what I say. It's pretty much just all stream of consciousness for me.

580
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:08.300
Lilliana Robinson: Watch this back. Okay, Agent Leonard. Great job. I'm going to take you guys off the spot.

581
01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:09.259
Bob Moesta: One more question, wait.

582
01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:10.409
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, sorry! Will. Go ahead.

583
01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:12.069
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Give me slide one more in. I'm so sorry.

584
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:13.000
Bob Moesta: Please, please.

585
01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:25.110
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Oh, it! It came from Annie, and also flow, and Talitha's conversation with you, too, around credibility and legitimacy, particularly with these boutique banks. And these new digital

586
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:32.920
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: funds that are popping up where they're they're up against big name brands like the Ubs's Jp. Morgan's of the

587
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:35.640
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: and a lot of them are wanting to get

588
01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:40.290
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: thought leadership or things out to to give that legitimacy.

589
01:15:40.789 --> 01:15:52.870
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Is this something you you've mentioned to the other guys that it's not really. It's more of a realization, not a trigger event per se, more of a pull, not a push. Would you suggest in terms of

590
01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.490
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: for us as well.

591
01:15:54.590 --> 01:16:03.387
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: just starting with this sort of audit or this diagnosed diagnosis of sorts, to begin with, and then figure out what type of

592
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:10.709
Bob Moesta: Yeah, because I think that's that's that's a a that's a very good cohesive thought, because I think the notion of falling behind

593
01:16:10.730 --> 01:16:33.470
Bob Moesta: is in Job 2 like you can start to talk to people about. Well, here's what the leaders are doing. Are you falling behind? Right? And so that aspect of having some thought leadership, but I would I would. I would wait till you have some really insightful data and not be able to have stuff that, like everybody else, can kind of push out. And so it's these notion of. It's the intimacy of the of these corrections you're making, because

594
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:43.940
Bob Moesta: big banks have their own ways, and small banks have their own ways, and they're not really compatible. So like, if you talk to somebody who went from, you know, a Jp. Morgan or a Bank of America to like, you know.

595
01:16:43.940 --> 01:17:09.069
Bob Moesta: you know, Michigan Credit Union, like, you're like, completely different kind of resources, completely different kinds of ways of thinking about it. And and ultimately, you know, the small boutique places are trying to actually figure out. And they they'll have, for example, Wells Fargo as an endorsement. But there's still a small shop, and so, providing that insights that that are going to be different will, I think, will come. But I think of that as a secondary or tertiary product that would come afterwards.

596
01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:15.589
Bob Moesta: I think you really gotta. You really gotta help them stop wasting time and be more more effective.

597
01:17:17.162 --> 01:17:21.609
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Thank you so much. Thank you for giving us some time. Thank you.

598
01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:22.250
Bob Moesta: Thank you.

599
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:46.200
Lilliana Robinson: Now we're now we're gonna jump into volunteers. So Monica volunteered. First, st I'm gonna do like, probably like 5 min each at 5 min. I'll let you ask a final question. Then we'll move on that way. We can do rapid fire to get through as many people who have questions or want help. So go ahead and raise your hand in the zoom room here just like cogniscope did if you want to be added to the queue. But we're gonna start with Monica.

600
01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:56.079
Lilliana Robinson: And you can also ask Bob like anything. This is a kind of an ask me anything. You don't have to go through your clusters. It's a great opportunity to ask about the book or anything you guys want to know.

601
01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:05.080
Bob Moesta: I've had people ask, how do I raise children and do startups so like there's just like, and there's no easy answer to any of those questions, by the way, but happy to happy to just share whatever I can.

602
01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:06.240
Bob Moesta: Hi, Monica!

603
01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:32.769
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Hi, Bob Nice to meet you. So my company is seascape clinical, and we have developed a Sas platform that helps Pharma companies run their clinical trials more efficiently through automating manual and repetitive tests. And so I wanted to dive deeper into one of my clusters. So our screening criteria was that was decision makers who purchased a clinical trial management system or Ctms within the past one to 2 years

604
01:18:33.102 --> 01:18:51.030
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): and so cluster one job statement is when my clinical trial portfolio expands and my Cro can't keep up with my reporting needs. I want to address this with a solution that gives me a single line of sight across my trial portfolio and allows me to manage up to senior leadership effectively.

605
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.365
Bob Moesta: Yep.

606
01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.480
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): So

607
01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:57.610
Bob Moesta: Surprise surprisingly whether you know it or not. I've actually done business in the space. I know the space.

608
01:18:57.610 --> 01:18:58.679
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Oh, that's great!

609
01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.460
Bob Moesta: Well.

610
01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:00.180
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I was like.

611
01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:04.010
Bob Moesta: Yes, that's that is Job number one. And I know that job.

612
01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:12.009
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): That's great, and I only had an Nf. 2 here. I did a total of 6 interviews, but I was a consultant in Pharma. And so I've seen this firsthand. So.

613
01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:12.929
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, right.

614
01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:14.189
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah. So we know it's.

615
01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:36.849
Bob Moesta: But this the but these people are worried about the portfolio. The fact is, is, they they've they've been doing it one off for a while, but now it's gotten a little bit out of hand. They need to actually kind of roll things together. They're not necessarily organized to do that. It's a very cumbersome process at the end of every quarter to roll it up and kind of say where it's at. They don't really have good status report on it. And ultimately the fact is, like we need to get a handle for the portfolio.

616
01:19:37.200 --> 01:20:02.049
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yep, you totally get it. So the problem is, the Ctms category is very saturated. And so from the beginning, my, you know, I had a blue ocean vision strategy of like, instead of calling ourselves Ctms, we call ourselves clinical trial Operations Automation Platform. Because in our case we're not just providing the transparency. We're also providing automation to lower the

617
01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:14.290
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): workload. The problem is, when I did these jobs to be done, no one mentioned automation. No. One mentioned. They mentioned efficiency, but not lowering workload. So you know, I'm kind of at an impasse like

618
01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:29.190
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I don't wanna categorize myself as Ctms. But that's what they're searching for right? So I wanted to ask you, like, strategically like, how should we position ourselves? How should we communicate in our marketing collateral? And it's a very big question, but I just wanted to open that up.

619
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:34.130
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah. So the the so to me, I I have to go back to the to the real. So

620
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:46.849
Bob Moesta: so I've worked with the really, really big guys in this space, right? And so they're the they're the ones who are kind of really at the portfolio level. But there's a lot of struggling moments at the individual

621
01:20:47.810 --> 01:21:04.440
Bob Moesta: trial level, like like the notion of of How do we like we? We need to add, like the fact is, is, they have certain standards for everything, and the reality is, there's some that can have exceptions, but they don't know what they are, and they don't know how to fast track anything. And so to me, I would think about the notion of

622
01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:16.440
Bob Moesta: helping them, with the exceptions to the rule, as opposed to basically trying to manage. I think that the idea of try you trying to go in and help people manage their whole portfolio is A is is like.

623
01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:21.559
Bob Moesta: typically they're gonna be big Pharma, if they've got a big portfolio. And they've that like

624
01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:33.320
Bob Moesta: they've got big people aimed at them to help do that. It's the smaller farmer people that that really you want to be able to get to who don't have a big portfolio. But they they don't can't afford the big portfolio piece right.

625
01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:46.970
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah. So that's exactly who we interviewed and what my background is in. It's mostly in small medium pharma however, they still do wanna look over, even if they have 5 trials in their portfolio as opposed to a hundred like they still wanna look across all those trials.

626
01:21:47.615 --> 01:21:48.100
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): And.

627
01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:53.969
Bob Moesta: And so the real question gets back to is, what's the struggling moment that they really have when? Because they can't see across it?

628
01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:54.980
Bob Moesta: It's.

629
01:21:54.980 --> 01:22:09.500
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Scaling. It's like going from, you know. You have like 2 trials or 3 trials, and they're run by different cros, giving different formats of Reports to having 5 Trials, and just not having enough people and too much variation in Cros to look across.

630
01:22:09.865 --> 01:22:19.740
Bob Moesta: So so this is really, actually so the the parallel here is I'm starting to scale, and the wheels are starting to come off the wagon.

631
01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:20.340
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yep.

632
01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:39.650
Bob Moesta: And so so this is where you got to be able to say it's like, and and what they're trying to say is like we want to get bigger. But if we can't handle 5, we I can't get 3 more trials going, because at some point we got, we've got to get serious about this, but we're not big enough for, let's say, metadata. But we're we need something in between, because we can't afford metadata.

633
01:22:39.650 --> 01:22:48.389
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, so okay, metadata and viva and salesforce and stuff like, yeah, they're probably not looking there. But there are a lot of smaller players is still saturated at the smaller level.

634
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:49.080
Bob Moesta: Yep. Yep.

635
01:22:49.080 --> 01:23:00.939
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): They're not good like a lot of them are not good, but like you don't know that from the marketing collateral it always says single source of truth. It always says efficiency. So it's hard to even differentiate among you know in in your words as well.

636
01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:13.020
Bob Moesta: Yeah. So so this is where they're gonna ask. Like, you said, they're not gonna ask for automation. They're gonna ask for efficiency because they actually don't. They're I'm gonna say this poorly, but they're just not smart enough to know what they need.

637
01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:14.340
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, Nope, that's true.

638
01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:21.849
Bob Moesta: Right. And so and so part of this is, you have to give the. You actually have to introduce them the language and make the bridge between efficiency and automation.

639
01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:22.920
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yep. Yep.

640
01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:35.070
Bob Moesta: You have to start to actually unpack some of those things, and and, to be honest, the the company I would look at that's very similar to this is intercom. Did this basically back in 2,000, 12,012,

641
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:56.179
Bob Moesta: where they were like the the simpler version of of Salesforce. They were a simple version of Hubspot. They were the simpler version of Zendesk. And so what happened is is they basically said, You know you all. You all want the big guys. But the big guys don't really care about you. This is the place you can start and we'll help you migrate to the to the bigger guys, and they ended up just keeping them forever.

642
01:23:56.770 --> 01:24:02.590
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, so do you think, Ctms like, should we even call ourselves that we have never associated ourselves with that.

643
01:24:02.850 --> 01:24:07.020
Bob Moesta: I I would stay away from it because it's got so much, so much. It.

644
01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:07.780
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Baggage.

645
01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:11.949
Bob Moesta: They're gonna they're you're they're gonna try to prove that you're not one.

646
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:19.029
Bob Moesta: And so my thing would be is to say is like, no, we're we're almost the. We're the half step before you go to Metadata.

647
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:20.930
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay.

648
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:40.809
Bob Moesta: And so think of it as like again. You might be ready for metadata. But you're not ready for the price, and then what you do is you price yourself 80 60 to 80% of what metadata is, and they'll buy you as the 1st thing. And then what you do is you assure that they can transition to metadata very easily, though most people won't do it, because once it gets in, it's hard to get out.

649
01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:43.910
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yup, it's true. Okay, thank you. That validates.

650
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:44.240
Bob Moesta: As well.

651
01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.479
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): We've been doing. Yep.

652
01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:49.940
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. Thanks, Monica. We're gonna go to Cognisco.

653
01:24:51.440 --> 01:25:04.929
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: Hey, Bob, thank you very much for the insights. I'm finding this very helpful. Thank you for sparing the time. Coding scope is basically a psychometric data analysis platform for video games. And my question is, I have 2 really quick questions. The question number one is.

654
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:18.229
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: we are at this position where the struggling moment and the buying decision power is not shared between the people that will interact with the buying decision of the thing.

655
01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.570
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: What do you think about that. How do we navigate.

656
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:27.150
Bob Moesta: So so, so this is, and and what I what my my stupid example is, if what I I worked for Mattel.

657
01:25:27.370 --> 01:25:31.750
Bob Moesta: and if I designed the toy, the toys that parents wanted. Kids would never play with it.

658
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:49.759
Bob Moesta: and if I design the toys that I wanted like a flamethrower, my parents would never buy it. So somehow you have to find like you. In this case, sometimes you have to actually be the the interpreter between the 2 and kind of go like, look, you want this, and you want that. Here's where your common space is. This is how we could help

659
01:25:50.270 --> 01:26:13.949
Bob Moesta: right? My mistake was as I started design for the users, and then I got nobody to buy it, and then I designed it for the buyers, and then the users just had a hard time using it. And so you gotta actually think about both the buyer and the user as separate jobs, separate sets of jobs and be able to align them where or show where they're misaligned. Right? Like the parents want something that the kids gonna learn

660
01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:17.249
Bob Moesta: right? The kids could give a shit if they learn anything or not.

661
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:29.920
Bob Moesta: Right. And so part of it is, how do we actually talk about the right set of features of oh, this is this is emerging. This is this, that we we actually have the same product. But we talk about it completely, differently, to the kid and to the to the parent.

662
01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:31.710
Bob Moesta: Does that help.

663
01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:42.049
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: Yes, very much. And then the follow up to that would be. I saw when you were talking about collabs clusters. We were talking about

664
01:26:42.050 --> 01:27:04.879
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: the imbalance between the amount of push and the pull that there was in one of their clusters. So we're looking at it from our perspective. When we have 2 different segments or 2 different screening criterias where we have to do separate jobs in interviews for, and then find some alignment between the clusters. How do we incorporate

665
01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:15.839
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: the forces into that? Do we put all of the forces into a single thing, and then try to work? Oh, my God! You did some magic.

666
01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:19.230
Bob Moesta: Yeah, I'm gonna do this. And then we're gonna do this. And there we go. Hi.

667
01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:20.139
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: And then the same.

668
01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It took this long to get him to do.

669
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:29.779
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: Yeah. And then the same question goes along for the energies as well, like the social, functional, and emotional energy side of things.

670
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:45.340
Bob Moesta: And it it. I'm just say, there's, let's say, job, a job, B, job, C and Job D, right.

671
01:27:46.260 --> 01:28:03.009
Bob Moesta: And this is where and I didn't say on user job, I have job or one job 2 job 3, just so we know that these are different user jobs than they are buyer jobs, and it might be 3 and 4, 4 and 3 whatever. But ultimately you start to realize, like people who are buying this way don't have users here or here.

672
01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:12.280
Bob Moesta: And so you know that this buyer has these skewed towards this job where Job A might actually do album. But they might not do job 3.

673
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:26.939
Bob Moesta: And so you start to realize, like, at some point, there is an alignment between the people who are buying the people who are using and that you need to figure out kind of almost like what are what are out of bounds. And then where's the place to start? And so to me it'd be like, I want to start at this one. And I'm going to start at this one

674
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:39.480
Bob Moesta: and the rest of them. I'm gonna figure out. But if I do these 2, this will help me basically get this will help me get this thing this way, and it will help me get this one, maybe that way. And so it's being able to understand where is the most?

675
01:28:39.850 --> 01:28:45.310
Bob Moesta: And I think about as where's the most push, so like you could think of pushes and pulls in here.

676
01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.569
Bob Moesta: and and basically think of

677
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:59.914
Bob Moesta: pushes and pulls of the other, and kind of say, like, what does this really look at from a buying situation because it turns out like, even though there's 16 possible ways, it happens in reality, it only happens 3 or 4 different ways.

678
01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:10.149
Bob Moesta: right? And so that's where we have to look at, not permutations and combinations, but more like the patterns of how did people actually buy it? And how did they end up using it?

679
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.720
Bob Moesta: And then you can actually kind of match that up.

680
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:18.949
Bob Moesta: This is why b 2 b is so much harder than B to C, because B to C is the buyer and the user are the same person.

681
01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:35.000
Bob Moesta: So like, it's more, it's more work. But like this will be insightful to realize like, we're gonna start here. And we're gonna start here. And then basically from that, we're gonna see whether we wanna like really dominate job one over all of these

682
01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:40.420
Bob Moesta: user jobs? Or do we want a job, you know, take buyer user a and basically dominate this way.

683
01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:45.009
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: And then a really quick question. I guess we have time right.

684
01:29:45.010 --> 01:29:48.920
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah. Keep asking until lilliana tells you. No, you just keep asking.

685
01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.130
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I'll give you a minute a minute warning in a second.

686
01:29:51.130 --> 01:30:13.259
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: Cool, cool a question that's solely not related to this. Do you think that there is a time for like jobs to be done is basically trying to find the demand side of things right? Do you think that in an entrepreneurial journey there's a point where it's too early for someone to do jobs. This is not something that we feel for.

687
01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:13.590
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

688
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:18.220
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: My team. But this is something that popped into my mind when I read the demand side settings.

689
01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:27.339
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah. So so the the thing is, is that what I would tell you is the reality is is I. I believe, that the jobs are actually more static through space and time.

690
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:33.099
Bob Moesta: So like, if I look at a job I saw today, I saw it 20 years ago, and I can see it 20 years from now.

691
01:30:33.130 --> 01:30:56.099
Bob Moesta: And so most jobs actually have have longevity to it of like Help me be more efficient. Help me help me be help me help me do more with less right? It's been around forever, right? It's it's the underlying context around it that changes. And ultimately as an entrepreneur. It could be too early because you don't have a product yet, but the way I would end up doing it is talking to people

692
01:30:56.170 --> 01:30:59.590
Bob Moesta: who would fight. What would they if your product comes out?

693
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.429
Bob Moesta: What would people fire

694
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:04.280
Bob Moesta: if if you were there already?

695
01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:12.079
Bob Moesta: And so, for example, I worked on at at Facebook, at the time it was Facebook. It was a Facebook marketplace.

696
01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:38.359
Bob Moesta: and we found people on messenger selling shit like somebody selling their drums on on Facebook, on Facebook messenger, like they did a post. And then you could see the message. And you're like, Wait, what's going on here. And so what we end up doing is going well. Maybe we could turn this into a a platform to do transactions. So we went and literally interviewed 3 different types of people. Well, 3 people who basically set up accounts on Etsy.

697
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:40.930
Bob Moesta: Ebay and Craigslist.

698
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:59.049
Bob Moesta: So what job does this are you setting this up for? And what are you trying to do for the sellers? And then we did the same thing for the buyers, and out of it we figured out everything we needed to do, and all the struggling moments, and literally built Facebook marketplace without. And one shot. It was 4 billion dollars out of the hat in the 1st year.

699
01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:08.379
Bob Moesta: Right? And so. And what we did is we just said, if we're doing this really well, people won't go to ebay, they won't go to Craigslist. They won't go to Etsy. They'll come to Facebook.

700
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:27.220
Bob Moesta: and it's turned into being more like a a Craigslist competitor than anything else. But it's still. It's a way in which to learn about what you need to build. So you could say you were too early to do jobs. But what I would tell you, you're too early to do jobs on your product. But you can do, you can do jobs around the analogous products that people are gonna stop using.

701
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:31.020
Bob Moesta: Thanks, a lot.

702
01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.450
Filiz Yönyüksel | CogniScope: It was great. Thanks.

703
01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:34.670
Lilliana Robinson: Great. That's perfect. Okay.

704
01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:36.240
Jake Gutstein: Follow up question there.

705
01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:45.170
Bob Moesta: I I need to see Neil. There, Neil, Neil, keep your camera on like I I like, I just I feel like you're 10 years younger man like like, who's this young Neil man.

706
01:32:45.170 --> 01:32:46.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Wait! What would I do?

707
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:54.249
Bob Moesta: You're motivating me to shave my beard. For God's sakes, I can't believe my wife hates it when I shave my beard, but we're gonna I'm gonna.

708
01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:54.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Together.

709
01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.729
Bob Moesta: So I get to do it.

710
01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:59.779
Bob Moesta: Look at that! Wow!

711
01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:01.691
Lilliana Robinson: Go ahead, Jake, I'll add you to the

712
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:02.949
Lilliana Robinson: you've got.

713
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:13.720
Jake Gutstein: I don't need to be up here. But, Bob, I have a question there. So if you're interviewing people who have used a product that's analogous to yours. Do you recommend interviewing success journeys or fire journeys?

714
01:33:14.508 --> 01:33:26.199
Bob Moesta: I would. The thing is is, if you get a fire journey like people who fired at sea right? It's the it's the notion of I'm gonna get the reason why they hired and the reason why they fired it. So I'll get 2 stories so.

715
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.489
Jake Gutstein: Where would you start, though? So like, if you're very early stage.

716
01:33:28.794 --> 01:33:34.269
Bob Moesta: I'd start with. Why, people hired face Etsy, I would I would start with the hires first.st

717
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:35.820
Jake Gutstein: Happy with the outcome.

718
01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:45.606
Bob Moesta: That's right, and then and then find out the fights like the way the way I think about growth is is it's a 2 sided coin. I gotta get more people to stay. And I got to get less people to leave

719
01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:51.729
Bob Moesta: right. And so I gotta. And I usually start by how to get more people in, and then I started to work on the leaky bucket.

720
01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.640
Bob Moesta: cool.

721
01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.800
Lilliana Robinson: Alright. Newark.

722
01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:57.510
Lilliana Robinson: 5 min.

723
01:33:58.110 --> 01:33:58.545
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

724
01:33:59.274 --> 01:34:06.635
Nirat Attri: So thank you so much for all of this like all all of these questions that I had I've already gotten answered. So that's

725
01:34:06.930 --> 01:34:07.380
Bob Moesta: That's nice.

726
01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:09.800
Nirat Attri: So about

727
01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:30.852
Nirat Attri: about us. So we're health blocks. We're trying to build a platform that allows healthcare stakeholders to build solutions easily. And we do it by allowing them to build it around the patient's health record and make it actionable. So data and healthcare is siloed. We're trying to bridge that gap by allowing people to build journeys that are centered around it.

728
01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:31.980
Nirat Attri: I think.

729
01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:39.189
Bob Moesta: Right, based on what you said. I'm in like, I have so much data health data that I I have to integrate it myself right now.

730
01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:40.536
Bob Moesta: So please.

731
01:34:41.770 --> 01:35:04.332
Nirat Attri: The yeah, that's the that's the that's the ask. That's the challenge that we've taken on. So primarily, we have traction right now with telehealth companies that are trying to monetize their business around the health record. And we have traction with service companies that provide services to doctors, and they want to use the data that they already have for the patient within. The electronic health record.

732
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:31.390
Nirat Attri: my question is primarily to do with doing jobs properly when it comes to stakeholders that are meant to champion your product. And you need to get into their emotional cues a little bit. So what tends to happen is what we have encountered is people tend to box up a little bit, because I mean, when it comes to the emotional energies that you have to get into on the b 2 b side. So they're like.

733
01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:59.039
Nirat Attri: I'm not really comfortable talking that way about my boss or the person that's going to make that decision for me. So we've gotten some key insights where, like one of the people that is leading operations was like, Hey, you know what me? I'm 62 years old. I want to retire. So I just want a solution that's convenient. But whenever it comes to somebody that has to champion it because they're the user. So they they can talk about it. But a champion I don't really get into the motivations really. Well, so how do you navigate that.

734
01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:18.110
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So so the way that I try to navigate it. And and again, I start by talking to people who recently bought something similar, right? And and ultimately, what I want to do is I actually, I I do a I was talking with Ryan Singer about this this morning is, we need to do like a stakeholder map

735
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:32.629
Bob Moesta: to understand who are the people that are involved in the decision making. And ultimately you want to find there's usually only one, maybe sometimes 2. But think about the person who's willing to take the the political risk. To put something new in

736
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:36.380
Bob Moesta: everybody else is literally there to say no.

737
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:39.849
Bob Moesta: and there's usually only one person there to say yes.

738
01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:50.540
Bob Moesta: And so what you want to do is start to like, think of it as being you're you want to extract the real story of how that new product got into that place, because

739
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:54.869
Bob Moesta: the reality is is 9 9 out of 10 people did not want it.

740
01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:55.780
Bob Moesta: Hello!

741
01:36:56.450 --> 01:37:12.480
Bob Moesta: And so what you have to do is realize I have to talk to the person who actually is the fuel. They're the push and the pull of why they want it. And then you need to actually ask about what are the anxieties that the rest of the team had, because it's not that the team has to say yes, the team just has to say, not no

742
01:37:14.050 --> 01:37:40.549
Bob Moesta: right. And so when you start to look at it from a perspective of like, how do I get everybody to say? Yes, you're screwed because not everybody's gonna say yes, but not everybody's gonna say no, either. So this is where you have to understand. Where are the thresholds, where people are? Gonna say, no, and that's all you really need to learn about, because at some point the the most of the people will never take the risk to put it in. But they're they're more about the anxiety forces of why we shouldn't do it, and why we shouldn't do it now.

743
01:37:40.890 --> 01:37:47.310
Bob Moesta: And so ultimately hearing. So this is where I would start the the conversation, to hear, to say, like, All right, look!

744
01:37:47.530 --> 01:38:15.600
Bob Moesta: I don't want to know names. I don't want to know products. I just want to hear the story, like in all its all its glory, of what? What happened? Because at some point I need to know the social, emotional pieces. Because if I just talk to you about the functional pieces of what has to happen for you to buy the product. We're gonna get some of it. But but we all know, hospitals are very emotional, right? This is all a very emotional thing. And so ultimately, what what in the world were you putting at risk to put this in.

745
01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:22.764
Bob Moesta: and they'll tell you. But you gotta start the story from the emotional and social perspective as opposed to tell me how you bought this product

746
01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:24.020
Bob Moesta: right.

747
01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:31.130
Bob Moesta: And they they. And if you can build that rapport fast enough, they'll tell you way more than you think they will

748
01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:35.130
Bob Moesta: about the emotional stuff. And and again.

749
01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:47.869
Bob Moesta: the the way I kind of set it up is to say, like, I don't really need to know names of Who's Who was against it? Who was for it. It's more. I just want to know that there was a person in a department that basically had these objections that you had to overcome.

750
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:58.909
Nirat Attri: I think one question like just to follow up on like like, what cogniscope also mentioned? Then

751
01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:06.179
Nirat Attri: how do we find our way to the person that said, Yes, because if I'm if I'm talking to the wrong person who was

752
01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:09.389
Nirat Attri: part of the journey, but wasn't the decision maker?

753
01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:10.910
Nirat Attri: Yes, they'll have.

754
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:13.850
Bob Moesta: Tied to it. They're like I signed the check.

755
01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:18.410
Bob Moesta: Like. Well, who told you? Who told you to sign a check? Oh, you know.

756
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:20.900
Bob Moesta: you know Julie told me to sign the check.

757
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:23.480
Bob Moesta: Well, what did Julie say? Okay, we got to get to Julie

758
01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:32.070
Bob Moesta: because there's somebody making the case. You're trying to find out who's the person making that like. So the the way I would really look at this is

759
01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.355
Bob Moesta: no product ends up randomly in anybody's company.

760
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:53.880
Bob Moesta: It's just like it's it doesn't like magically appear, there's shit that has to happen. And so if we can actually figure out like, how did this product end up in your company and start with that conversation. That might be what the it might be that you're starting to formally. And you need to start more informally like, how did this get here?

761
01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:03.949
Bob Moesta: Like, I'm I'm gonna play Sherlock Holmes. And I'm gonna go like, what in the heck, how does this get into your system? When literally 90% of the stuff that you try to buy. You can't even buy.

762
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:09.050
Nirat Attri: That's so true. That's so true.

763
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:20.110
Bob Moesta: So here's the thing is, there's a couple of reasons why I hate the medical field. It's a very hard field, because at some point in time. It's actually run more by the legal than the medicine people.

764
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:41.360
Bob Moesta: in my opinion, that's my opinion. And so what you realize is that like going to the doctor like I take care of my mother-in-law, and one of the things is like going to the my mother-in-law can't understand one word the doctor says, and then I have to actually understand and interpret it for. And it's all of these different things. But yet I can't get the doctor to say anything in practical terms, because they're they're too afraid of the risk.

765
01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:53.160
Bob Moesta: And so this is where again you you have to. You might have to have the conversations literally off the record, or in some way being able to get, because they don't want to get caught in complaining about something.

766
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:59.349
Bob Moesta: So this is where you go. You know what I'm going to turn off the recorder. Let's talk about this and don't record it.

767
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:08.530
Bob Moesta: It's in that sign of not recording helps you basically build the trust to say, like, you can tell me, because I just want to hear. I need to hear the truth, because

768
01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:17.350
Bob Moesta: the the thing that most of these people will tell you is if we don't learn the truth, we can't figure out how to help you. And so they're gonna want to tell you the truth, so you can actually build something for them.

769
01:41:18.330 --> 01:41:19.839
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that's our time here.

770
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:28.639
Nirat Attri: That's golden. Yeah, thanks. Bob, like, just wanted to say that like the the book changed my life like I was just so afraid of sales and technical in nature.

771
01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:30.510
Nirat Attri: But I just wanted to thank you for.

772
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:45.329
Bob Moesta: Yeah, when you, when you reframe it as helping people, it's just so, it's so much fun to do. The the problem is that the management pushes us to have a quota on it, and the reality is like I could always beat my quota because all I end up doing is helping people. It's it's way easier than you think it is. So that's great. I'm glad it was helpful.

773
01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:47.339
Bob Moesta: That's really nice to hear it.

774
01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:48.430
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, George, you're next.

775
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:49.150
Bob Moesta: George.

776
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:58.683
George Reed - Noetic: Thanks. Hey, Bob, this is fantastic. Thank you so much. I agree with what Nira was saying. All the the books, and all the extra content that we've got here is

777
01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:00.713
George Reed - Noetic: incredible stuff. So

778
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:06.139
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sorry to interrupt. George is also he lives in Japan.

779
01:42:06.690 --> 01:42:07.270
George Reed - Noetic: He's pretty familiar.

780
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:08.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You're out there.

781
01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:11.690
Bob Moesta: I'm I'm I'm headed to Japan in December, so maybe.

782
01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:12.489
George Reed - Noetic: When are you leaving.

783
01:42:12.490 --> 01:42:14.030
Bob Moesta: For a beer in Tokyo.

784
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:16.289
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah. Yeah. When when are you leaving Japan coming back?

785
01:42:16.538 --> 01:42:27.980
Bob Moesta: I I leave I think I get there like the 6th or the 7.th I don't know. Whatever the demo day is. I'm gonna do it the day after that, and then I'll be there that entire week, and then I come home the 13.th

786
01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:30.028
George Reed - Noetic: Oh, okay. I might

787
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:31.110
Bob Moesta: You might not be here.

788
01:42:31.110 --> 01:42:31.910
George Reed - Noetic: Crossed.

789
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:32.439
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

790
01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:33.340
George Reed - Noetic: In New York, at that.

791
01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:38.209
Bob Moesta: That's right. I'll be. I'll be. I get back to Japan at least once a quarter now, so I'll be there quite often.

792
01:42:38.210 --> 01:43:05.934
George Reed - Noetic: Oh, amazing! Please, please, I'll I'll definitely keep in touch and ask you, because that'd be so cool. Yeah, so yeah. So, George, founder of Noetic, and we're building an AI agent that bridges your company and market and enables, or by enabling an ongoing conversation with your customers with your market. So what I've got is a kind of more of a tactical question. So I've had a really really hard time.

793
01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:11.269
George Reed - Noetic: finding my meeting my screening criteria and finding the

794
01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:20.049
George Reed - Noetic: people who've this is the thing because George has been helping me. And we were on a call yesterday together, and he's been really helpful with them, helping with the message yesterday. But

795
01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.359
George Reed - Noetic: I find it.

796
01:43:22.690 --> 01:43:29.719
George Reed - Noetic: What I'm thinking now tactically, is to find these people who have purchased a competing or a similar product, and.

797
01:43:29.730 --> 01:43:32.601
George Reed - Noetic: as George said, either stopped using or started using.

798
01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:33.500
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

799
01:43:34.110 --> 01:43:42.360
George Reed - Noetic: Because it's so difficult, like the hunt, as Neil calls it. Maybe going through like review sites or something. Would you recommend that to try and find people who definitely purchase.

800
01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.680
Bob Moesta: The thing with reviews is like.

801
01:43:45.370 --> 01:44:00.699
Bob Moesta: I feel like when you look at reviews like on Amazon. They they give it a 2 star, because you know it arrived late, had nothing to do with the product. Right? So you have to be careful about reviews. So one of the things I'll tell you is is.

802
01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:05.189
Bob Moesta: think about it almost in a larger like. So who are you selling to.

803
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:16.230
George Reed - Noetic: So right now, my screen criteria is consumer insight. Managers within larger organizations. Who within the last 6 months have purchased a qualitative

804
01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.040
George Reed - Noetic: research automation tool.

805
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:25.000
George Reed - Noetic: and there's no extra. I've removed the extra like they should have faced business impacts. I'm I'm.

806
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:25.570
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

807
01:44:25.570 --> 01:44:27.429
George Reed - Noetic: Trying to be a bit more broad.

808
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:29.270
Bob Moesta: So when when I so

809
01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:34.229
Bob Moesta: it almost feels too granular, like, like qualitative research automation kind of thing.

810
01:44:34.230 --> 01:44:34.700
George Reed - Noetic: Hmm.

811
01:44:34.944 --> 01:44:42.760
Bob Moesta: Like. The one of the places I might start is just talk to consumer insights, managers, and say, what are the top 3 tools you've bought recently. And why'd you buy them?

812
01:44:43.021 --> 01:45:03.639
Bob Moesta: My belief is you'll learn a way more from understanding, because it's almost like they're buying process for all of it is gonna be the same. But it might be. One is about speed, and one is more about, you know, growth and another one's about something else, and then you can start to look at how you can position your product to fit in one of those categories. But almost take it a little bit higher, because so like, for example.

813
01:45:04.081 --> 01:45:18.948
Bob Moesta: when we started at salesforce, one of the things we did is we just started to interview people. We'd say Crm. And people would like they they were sie Bowl like a. But ultimately what we did is we talked to big organizations, and when they bought any new multi

814
01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:28.840
Bob Moesta: multifunctioned piece of software, an Erp, a cr, any of that stuff. And once we actually found out kind of like how they bought it. Then we could actually then figure out the way to sell it

815
01:45:29.230 --> 01:45:41.499
Bob Moesta: because it bought. They bought all these big systems in a very similar way, and it didn't really matter whether it was a Crm. Or whether it was accounting or whether it was strategy. They were all cross functional tools, and they bought in a very similar way.

816
01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:45.359
George Reed - Noetic: That makes a lot of sense that really maps onto what I was starting to feel.

817
01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:57.160
Bob Moesta: So it's not. It's not wrong. It's not wrong to think about it. But the fact is, one signal, I'd say is qualitative research. Automation is like. That's your words, not theirs, because if they're not resonating with it, they don't know what that means.

818
01:45:58.230 --> 01:46:05.379
George Reed - Noetic: Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think consumer insight managers. They they market researchers essentially so they wouldn't know. And I mean, you're a market researcher, too.

819
01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:06.290
Bob Moesta: And so.

820
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:11.149
George Reed - Noetic: You, you could probably glean what I'm talking about from that. But yeah, it's too, as you say, too granular. So.

821
01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:34.210
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, it's it's not wrong. It's not wrong to start there because you want to be there. But like, you have to realize, like what this is. The the facts that it's telling you is the the language you're using isn't resonating. And and let's start. Let's start with it. Because again. I think consumer insight managers need. They have, in my belief they have too many tools, and they don't know which ones to buy. They don't know how to get rid of them like they need almost like the

822
01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:41.530
Bob Moesta: the app would say, what do you subscribe to? So we can stop the subscription, because my belief is they have subscriptions to 20 things they don't use right.

823
01:46:41.530 --> 01:46:50.180
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, I like that. That's cool. Yeah. You know, you definitely know, that is a problem. They buy things. They're spending all this money every year, and no one uses them, and it's like a huge headache they hate saying.

824
01:46:50.180 --> 01:47:10.850
Bob Moesta: Well, they gotta learn it, and they got turnover. And it's like all those kind of things. So my thing is is like, I would actually just I I'd actually start a little higher and go like, what are the struggling moments that consumer insight manager have? And what? And then, if we can understand the the like 2 or 3 tools that they bought recently, that that you could say what the and why they bought them. You can then kind of figure out how you would actually kind of slot yours in there.

825
01:47:11.230 --> 01:47:18.394
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, this is brilliant. Thank you so much. Yeah, I think that's a great answer. So I'll leave the time for other people. So cheers.

826
01:47:18.670 --> 01:47:19.520
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you.

827
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:26.119
Lilliana Robinson: Alright, Annie, and then, if anyone else has a question, we'll still have time for one or 2 more, so go ahead and raise your hand. If

828
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:28.880
Lilliana Robinson: if you have a burning question, go ahead, Annie.

829
01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:35.535
Annie Brown: Yes, so something that you said to Monica triggered a question to me because

830
01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:58.060
Annie Brown: we hadn't really thought about bringing into our marketing. But our a lot of our 1st customers are smaller companies, so small to medium size social media platforms that are looking to grow to, you know a a bigger. And I think one of the reasons why they work with us. And I want to dig more into this on jobs to be done is because

831
01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:07.150
Annie Brown: they are smaller. And they feel like these bigger data annotation companies just don't care about them at all. And don't focus in on like their needs.

832
01:48:07.150 --> 01:48:07.700
Bob Moesta: So.

833
01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:16.849
Annie Brown: Would you advise bringing like leaning into that, and bringing that into the the marketing? Or is that or cause? I know that some sites like

834
01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:29.809
Annie Brown: have, like different verticals for small businesses for big businesses. But as our go to market strategy should we just lean into, you know the fact that we serve these medium sized platforms.

835
01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:30.800
Annie Brown: Yeah.

836
01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:58.990
Bob Moesta: I I think I would lean, I would lean into that, and, to be honest, I would. So in this is gonna sound a little strange. But in in the early stages I just wanna eliminate more than I include. So it's like, who am I gonna eliminate? And it's like, all right, we're not gonna talk to them. Okay, let's let's see, like, let's go investigate. These are these people in or out. And it's like being able to kind of. But I I think it's really important in the beginning. We have way, way, better language to talk about what's out than what's in

837
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:07.900
Bob Moesta: right. And as you get closer and closer and you get clearer and clearer, then you can talk about what's in and and what's what, how good it has to be.

838
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:18.050
Annie Brown: Okay? So by what? When you mean by language, you talk about what's in that would be the we serve vm, size, because we do. Xx and X.

839
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:27.599
Bob Moesta: That's right, because, yeah, exactly. And and then ultimately, the fact is, is like, we don't serve these people because they have this and that they, they have these needs that we're not going to basically be able to get to.

840
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:28.630
Annie Brown: Okay.

841
01:49:28.630 --> 01:49:46.230
Bob Moesta: Because the thing is is what's gonna happen is somebody's gonna come that's gonna be outside the scope, and then you're gonna bend over backwards, and then it really screws up your entire roadmap, and if you can eliminate them now and say like, it's not no forever. But for the next 24 months. We're focused on this. And if somebody comes along, here's what we're gonna do, because

842
01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:49.689
Bob Moesta: it will happen. And you you want to make sure that you're not distracted.

843
01:49:50.340 --> 01:50:01.660
Annie Brown: Yes, yeah, I think that's that's happened before. So it's kind of cool to know like that. There's a framework to kind of push those to the side, or just say not not now.

844
01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:04.389
Annie Brown: Okay, cool.

845
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:05.040
Bob Moesta: Thanks.

846
01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:06.670
Annie Brown: Super helpful. Thank you.

847
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:13.950
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. Does anyone else have any final questions? Otherwise we can turn the time to bob for some final thoughts.

848
01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:19.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Based on everything you heard, Bob. Any general read or feedback for the group.

849
01:50:20.494 --> 01:50:23.320
Bob Moesta: Well, 1st I have a question for the team.

850
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:27.210
Bob Moesta: I wanna I want to get some feedback on George.

851
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:29.489
Bob Moesta: Has George been helpful for you guys?

852
01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:31.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It will ask the founders, how's George doing.

853
01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:32.629
Bob Moesta: That's what I'm saying.

854
01:50:32.630 --> 01:50:33.349
George Reed - Noetic: He is a.

855
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He doesn't.

856
01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:34.530
George Reed - Noetic: Bulb.

857
01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:37.939
George Reed - Noetic: George is so good. Is he here? Where is George?

858
01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:39.299
Lilliana Robinson: He's on the call right now.

859
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:39.670
George Reed - Noetic: Agent.

860
01:50:39.670 --> 01:50:40.430
Bob Moesta: All right. I just wanted.

861
01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:41.479
George: Hairy white.

862
01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:44.770
Bob Moesta: Sorry I gotta. I'm gonna I'm gonna embarrass him, but I don't care.

863
01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.179
Bob Moesta: What do you mean? He's so good. What is he good at?

864
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:54.750
George Reed - Noetic: So on point like he understands jobs. And he's like so helpful, so sincere like yesterday. Honestly.

865
01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:03.549
George Reed - Noetic: Well, more than me, George. Other George. Yeah. And just like, yeah, brings good energy. So professional.

866
01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:06.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm not gonna settle with that. He wants specifics. He wants.

867
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.800
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, okay.

868
01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:10.370
Bob Moesta: I need a specific. Those are. So that's what I call pablum language. It's all nice.

869
01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:11.040
George Reed - Noetic: Problem okay.

870
01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:12.369
Bob Moesta: What the fuck does that mean?

871
01:51:12.370 --> 01:51:15.980
George Reed - Noetic: Sorry problem leads into. So yesterday, like George and I were

872
01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:19.849
George Reed - Noetic: on the jobs to be done. Call, I've done, let's say

873
01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:24.039
George Reed - Noetic: 5 of them before completely wrong. I knew it. I didn't know why

874
01:51:24.370 --> 01:51:32.160
George Reed - Noetic: George was able to basically sit there with me and guide. We sat together in the room, guide back and forth and like it finally started to click. Also Jake.

875
01:51:32.170 --> 01:51:56.729
George Reed - Noetic: Jake and Neil, like you guys as well. Some of the things you said really made sense, too. But yeah, like, it's finally starting to click. And now I've got more info. But it's been so hard to overcome the inertia of the kind of old ways. Yeah. And George is like, very good at sort of gently saying, guiding me back in the right direction, because I mean he wouldn't say it, but

876
01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:59.160
George Reed - Noetic: you could probably tell I was not on point with it.

877
01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:08.059
Bob Moesta: So. 1 1 of the reasons why I bring this up is, I think you should do this as a group more often is. The fact is, everybody has imposter syndrome. I have imposter syndrome.

878
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:28.310
Bob Moesta: and the fact is, is, at some point George knows these things, but he doesn't need like he needs to hear that he knows these things, and he's been helpful. At the same time. We all need that feedback. We all need to know that we're doing the right things. We're breaking the best decisions we can. And and ultimately, it's like, I. I'm I'm pulling George out because I know him. But I would say, anytime, you guys have an all hands. You need to pick somebody and just celebrate them

879
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:33.629
Bob Moesta: because it's it's like everybody here doesn't feel like they should be here. But everybody should be here.

880
01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:35.235
Bob Moesta: That makes sense.

881
01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:37.370
Bob Moesta: Thank you, George.

882
01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:43.320
Bob Moesta: George. Can you tell? Yeah, George Henkel, can you tell me what it's been like to be there.

883
01:52:45.040 --> 01:53:03.959
George: Yeah, thanks, Bob. And thanks, George. It's been amazing a culture shock. At 1st I was in a completely different industry, and, you know, quit my job and made a few moves, but the learning the way everything is taught, and then being able to see it applied at 12 different businesses with 20 different types of people is

884
01:53:04.650 --> 01:53:07.440
George: invaluable, invaluable. For sure, it's been great.

885
01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:12.739
Bob Moesta: So I just wanna I'm gonna do this. You guys can't see this. This is my next book called Job Moves.

886
01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:18.810
Bob Moesta: And what I've been doing is, I've been studying what what like think about is what causes people to quit your company.

887
01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:23.710
Bob Moesta: or what causes people to quit any company, and how do they choose when they're going to go somewhere else?

888
01:53:23.770 --> 01:53:32.389
Bob Moesta: And so, George, the reason why George is here is George and I sat down about a year ago and started going through this process about what is George good at? What does George suck at?

889
01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:43.970
Bob Moesta: What is what? Where does he really want to go. What does he want to do? What gives him energy? What sucks is energy? And we took all almost a whole year to inventory all these things, while he's literally at the shittiest job in the world.

890
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:51.319
Bob Moesta: But the reality is, is trying to actually figure out kind of like. And, to be honest, I wanted to stay as long as possible, because I want them to have

891
01:53:51.430 --> 01:54:20.039
Bob Moesta: almost like to feel the pain of like. This is what it's like when you don't make good decisions. And so ultimately he was able to kind of frame it out. And, to be honest, he, he! He went and said, like, I'm gonna quit this job. I'm gonna get a side job. But I'm gonna actually go here to tech stars because this is where I want to be. And ultimately he had to talk to lilliana. He had to talk to Neil. He had to talk to everybody else to get in, but the notion is is like at some point. He's somebody who's exactly where he should be, and doing exactly what he should do. And that's why he's so good at this.

892
01:54:20.050 --> 01:54:22.840
Bob Moesta: This is actually not work for him is my belief

893
01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:36.520
Bob Moesta: right? And so this is the way I want you to start to think about as you start to scale up. The fact is, is, you need to think of employees as your job as the employer is to help them make progress while they help you make progress.

894
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:38.929
Bob Moesta: and you need to reflect on that.

895
01:54:39.240 --> 01:55:00.709
Bob Moesta: And so this book, when this book comes out, I'll make sure I'm gonna ship I'll ship a set of books to to you Neil, so everybody will get a copy of it. But I want you to read it. Not only like my belief is, you became an entrepreneur for a reason. It's important to know why. And that's part of what this is, but it's also to know why people would join your startup, so you can understand how to help them.

896
01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:12.509
Bob Moesta: Right? Because I think George will eventually will be a founder. But the reality is, he's not ready to be a founder now. And so this is actually a really good half step for him to learn how to be a founder and help and do what he loves to do already.

897
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:20.359
Bob Moesta: That's why is, it's like it. It feels natural for him to be there. But the reality is like it was a lot of design decisions we did to get there.

898
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:32.960
Bob Moesta: So I just wanted to make sure you shared like you. You need to understand, Neil, or I'm sorry. George is a very special person, but at the same time the reality is like everybody's special. But you need to take the time to figure out what motivates you.

899
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:36.364
Bob Moesta: That's my! That's my closing talk.

900
01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:37.870
Bob Moesta: And again.

901
01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:41.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Out here dropping 3. He's like, Steve Kerr. Yeah.

902
01:55:41.210 --> 01:55:41.540
George: Gee!

903
01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:44.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, I got one more question for you. So

904
01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:47.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that was awesome, Bob. 1st of all, man, you're.

905
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:48.030
Bob Moesta: I love.

906
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:48.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One my friend.

907
01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:49.209
Bob Moesta: Don't have to.

908
01:55:49.210 --> 01:55:49.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I know.

909
01:55:49.650 --> 01:55:50.089
Bob Moesta: By the way.

910
01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:50.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know.

911
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:56.000
Bob Moesta: Did anybody want to do this one on one, or did you all enjoy yourself watching this for 2 h.

912
01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You gotta be careful, Bob. They're all gonna take you up on that.

913
01:55:59.650 --> 01:56:08.980
Bob Moesta: That's what I'm saying. Like I'm I was looking forward to this, and being in person that it was like, Oh, my God! And then, when I couldn't do it, I'm like I'm only gonna get cause I know I'd get another 4 h with everybody right.

914
01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:09.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, this.

915
01:56:09.970 --> 01:56:10.809
Bob Moesta: We might have to fill.

916
01:56:10.810 --> 01:56:12.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We'll we'll rope you in.

917
01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:23.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Yeah. And and by the way, Bob, I I know you probably know this. But this is our 1st ever San Francisco program. So this is the 1st time we've ever done San Francisco. So this is the inaugural group here. Really special.

918
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:30.179
Bob Moesta: Tell you that, based on the previous ones, we've done this, this, this group has jobs down.

919
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:32.140
Bob Moesta: probably at least

920
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:42.320
Bob Moesta: 50% better than the other ones. You've you've doubled down on it in some way, and I don't know really what it is. But I can tell that these people understand jobs in a very different way than the previous cohorts.

921
01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:44.010
Bob Moesta: And we're we're trying to get better.

922
01:56:44.010 --> 01:56:44.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Every time.

923
01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:45.770
Bob Moesta: Yep, that's right.

924
01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:51.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yup. So my last question for you with 3 min left is, you have seen

925
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:52.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: literally

926
01:56:52.580 --> 01:57:01.019
Neal Sáles-Griffin: thousands of companies both fail and succeed. So what the patterns at the earliest stage right now, given what you've seen with this group.

927
01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what do you think they need to hear

928
01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:07.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that will separate the successes from the failures. Yep.

929
01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:13.859
Bob Moesta: I'll I'll say this. The 1st thing is, you need to fall in love with your customer and their problem.

930
01:57:14.670 --> 01:57:17.790
Bob Moesta: and and and literally be prepared like

931
01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:19.590
Bob Moesta: to abandon your product.

932
01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:27.200
Bob Moesta: because I think the notion is is that the more you can actually, because what I'll tell you is sometimes the products are just so simple.

933
01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:41.660
Bob Moesta: and we want to make them more complicated. And when we look at the simplest solution for the customer, it'll come out. And so the thing is is we're we're pivoting a lot. But the reality is is the more you can be constant on. What's the problem you're trying to solve for whom?

934
01:57:41.880 --> 01:58:02.070
Bob Moesta: Right? I think. The fact is, it becomes easier to then learn how to pivot. Most people have big pivots because they they can't make it work, and they're so locked in on the on the technology that they can't then find the place to make it work. And my thing is is, I think it's more important to find a place to work first, st and what to work on than what we should be doing.

935
01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:07.119
Bob Moesta: So that's that's my big, that's my big 2 cents on that one.

936
01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:12.041

937
01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:17.490
Bob Moesta: And and, to be honest, if you really don't like your clients, I'm gonna tell you you should change

938
01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:18.859
Bob Moesta: like my my son.

939
01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:19.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.

940
01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:40.429
Bob Moesta: I have a great idea. I want to do automation for medical device, or for for physicians to do their. You know, this is like 3 years ago. I'm like, Okay, do you? Do you care for doctors? He goes. Not really, I said at some point in time you're going to be selling to office managers. Do you like office managers? No, I don't. I'm like, okay, though it's a great idea. The fact is, if you don't like these people. You're never gonna succeed at it.

941
01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:44.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Name on.

942
01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:45.900
Bob Moesta: Came on.

943
01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:47.650
Bob Moesta: so.

944
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:52.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Anything this this group can do for you, Bob, how can we support you other than buy your book.

945
01:58:54.690 --> 01:58:55.430
Bob Moesta: Just because.

946
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:57.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm gonna send everybody a book as soon as it comes out.

947
01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:07.420
Bob Moesta: So one of the things that was very interesting is, I went on a trip recently, and I started to look at the coaching tree, which is, who are my students, and what are they doing now?

948
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:14.320
Bob Moesta: And, to be honest, all I ask is that you pay it forward, for, like Jake is. Jake is here because he's paying it forward.

949
01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:31.910
Bob Moesta: George is here because he's paying it forward like I told him, like he can't pay me back, but he needs to help 10 people with this book like. So he's out there helping people that Jake is doing the same. And so my thing is is. All I ask is that you pay it forward, and you help as many, at least 10 more people for every person that's helped you. You help 10.

950
01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:33.219
Bob Moesta: That's my goal.

951
