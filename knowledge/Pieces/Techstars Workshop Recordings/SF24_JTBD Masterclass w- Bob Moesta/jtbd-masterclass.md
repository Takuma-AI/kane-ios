# JTBD Masterclass with Bob Moesta - Real-Time Coaching

**Workshop:** Jobs to Be Done Masterclass  
**Cohort:** SF24 (San Francisco 2024)  
**Speaker:** Bob Moesta - Co-architect of Jobs to Be Done Theory  
**Type:** Interactive Coaching Session  
**Tags:** #jtbd #customer-research #product-market-fit #clustering #go-to-market

## Core Philosophy

Bob Moesta's approach to Jobs to Be Done focuses on understanding the emotional and functional progress customers are trying to make in their lives. This masterclass demonstrates real-time application of JTBD principles through live coaching of startup founders.

**Key Insight:** "Questions create spaces in the brain for solutions to fall into. If we can actually ask them a question and not answer it, they're gonna go like 'God, how many times did I have to redo the data? That was 4 times, God that's a lot, we should do better.'"

## The Master's Degree in JTBD

### Recognizing Subtle Distinctions
When discussing credibility needs, Bob identifies a crucial nuance:
- **Job 1:** "I need credibility from others in the industry" (B2B credibility)
- **Job 4:** "I need credibility for the customers" (B2C credibility)

"That's a master's degree in jobs. Just that subtlety and knowing how to separate that. Awesome, awesome."

## Framework: The Four-Company Live Coaching Format

Lilliana Robinson introduces the session structure:
1. **30-second company introduction**
2. **Present clusters from "Why Before the Why" research**
3. **Identify which cluster to pursue and why**
4. **Present specific problems for Bob's guidance**

## Case Study 1: Opal Therapeutics (Women's Health Biotech)

### The Four Clusters
Morgan Stanton identified four distinct jobs through 14 interviews:

1. **Industry Credibility:** "People don't think I'm shady"
   - Hiring CROs for brand name recognition (e.g., Charles Rivers Laboratory)
   - Need legitimacy in the industry
   
2. **Capability Gap:** "None of the work could be outsourced"
   - Working with menstrual blood - CROs won't/can't do it
   - Forced to build internal capabilities
   
3. **Regulatory Navigation:** "Do you know a good model for endometriosis?"
   - Struggling with FDA guidelines comprehension
   - Desperately seeking regulatory clarity
   
4. **Consumer Trust:** "I want convenience and validation for my customers"
   - Direct-to-consumer products need clinical validation
   - Marketing story requires lab credibility

### Bob's Strategic Guidance
"I would double down on Jobs 2 and 3, with the goal of getting 1 and 4 as you get scale."

**Rationale:**
- Jobs 2 & 3 represent immediate struggling moments
- Jobs 1 & 4 require time to build credibility
- Start where the pain is acute and underserved

### The Hidden Consumer Angle
Bob reveals insight from adult female incontinence work:
"This is a problem that nobody talks about. Nobody even shares with their sister... They go through this entire process alone."

**Translation Opportunity:** "Give me a place to go so I can understand what the hell they're even saying... Doctors talk to you like they're lawyers."

## Case Study 2: Reliable (Data Annotation Platform)

### The Evolution Through Interviews
Annie Brown's journey:
- First 5 interviews: Scrapped after realizing need to pivot
- New screening criteria: Senior decision makers who've hired data annotation
- Key discovery: Content recommendation > content moderation

### Critical Clusters Identified

1. **Business Critical:** "Content recommendation accuracy is key to my company's success"
   - User engagement = platform survival
   - Top priority on every roadmap
   
2. **Quality Crisis:** "Tagging is difficult and costly, and context is needed"
   - Mechanical Turk labeled all Taylor Swift posts as "woman"
   - Lack of nuance destroys utility
   
3. **Sensitive Data Avoidance:** "For socially complex data... they didn't want to do that"
   - LGBTQ, race, gender, sexuality data
   - Companies want to outsource the risk

### Bob's Phased Approach Strategy

**Start Simple, Build Trust:**
"Try to find the things that they're willing to offload 50% of the load because they can trust you to get that 50% done."

**The Psychology:**
- "These are people who don't want to do it themselves"
- "Can't find anybody else to do it well"
- "They're not going to start with all their data at once"

**Pricing Strategy:**
"Make sure you're pricing based on the complexity of the context that has to be wrapped around the data."

### The Emotional Core
"It was a horrible feeling when I realized this was all wrong and I had to redo it."

Bob's advertising insight: "How many times have you actually put all the data in and realize you need to do it over? Let's stop... You gotta start with the struggling moment."

## Key Teaching Moments

### 1. The Power of Shared Learning
"When we start talking about one problem, you're gonna go like, 'Oh, my God, I have that problem.' ... Everybody's conversation is gonna actually help you."

### 2. Feature Mapping to Jobs
"You might have 20 features. But what features are you gonna talk about? Job 1 versus Job 2. And then in the sales process... try to make sure you can actually put them in which job they're in."

### 3. The Data Paradox (Clay Christensen's Wisdom)
"No one piece of data can tell you the entire truth of what's going on. And so by all fact, then data is actually not telling the truth, which is a lie, and all lies go to hell. So all data will be in hell when I die."

## Strategic Decision Framework

### For Market Entry:
1. **Identify immediate struggling moments** (not future aspirations)
2. **Start where you can deliver value quickly** (build credibility over time)
3. **Design an onboarding process** for customer comfort
4. **Prepare for rapid scaling demand** ("They're gonna push you too hard")

### For Product Positioning:
1. **Lead with the struggle**, not the solution
2. **Ask questions that create mental space** for realization
3. **Map features to specific jobs** (not all features for all jobs)
4. **Price based on complexity**, not just effort

## Practical Applications

### For B2B Startups:
- Distinguish between industry credibility and customer credibility
- Start with the work others won't or can't do
- Build expertise in navigation/translation services
- Create clear categories of service complexity

### For Platform/Marketplace Startups:
- Focus on accuracy as business-critical metric
- Address both buyer-side and user-side emotional triggers
- Start with 50% of the easy work to build trust
- Prepare for rapid scaling once trust is established

### For Customer Research:
- Recruit people who evaluated 2+ alternatives
- Focus on emotional moments ("horrible feeling")
- Ask about frequency of problems ("How many times...?")
- Understand the decision-making criteria deeply

## Memorable Quotes

- "Questions create spaces in the brain for solutions to fall into."
- "If your first connection with an investor is asking for money, you failed." (callback to earlier teaching)
- "They're gonna want you to take it as fast as possible... They're almost gonna push you too hard."
- "Even though it's not hard, it's the fact that you can do it better than anybody else."
- "This is a very much an emotional decision to make... When it's wrong, it's really emotional."

## The Meta-Lesson

This masterclass demonstrates that JTBD isn't just about categorizing customer needsâ€”it's about understanding the emotional journey, recognizing subtle distinctions, and designing go-to-market strategies that start where the pain is most acute. The best practitioners can identify not just what job needs to be done, but the sequence in which to address multiple jobs to build a sustainable business.
