So if you went on and you couldn't order it.

19
00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:10.330
Lilliana Robinson: it's either because the deadline has passed and they ran out of stock, or because our cohort is extra large, we actually hit the maximum, and I've extended it now. So you guys can go back in this week. It's just not guaranteed that you'll get it A before program starts and B

20
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:35.229
Lilliana Robinson: get it at all right now, because I got a message this morning that we're out of stock with some things. So every single person here is going to get a welcome kit. I just have those updates for right now, so it may take a couple of weeks to get some of the things back in stock specifically venture deals. The book is out of stock right now, and I think the T-shirts so we'll see. Just message me directly if you need help with that, and I can get you in touch with our

Lilliana Robinson: so class roster forms are due this Wednesday. Those are extremely important. I've seen some messages asking like, did we only send the invite to Ceos? What's that about? So that's correct. So every time that we give offers, we just communicate only with the CEO until the class roster form is complete. That way. We know who from your team is actually going to be a full time program participant to receive all of the notifications, invitations, things like that.

31

298
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:41.269

302
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.630

303
00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.890

304
00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:05.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think it will be because every single time we've done this we've done a better job at something.

305
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:18.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and we've maintained quality or increased quality on every other aspect of the program. So just know, I'll I'll just like remind you all of a few things that may have said when we had our offer call conversations.

306
00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're not perfect, and we don't know everything, so we're not here to tell y'all what to do.

307
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:25.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're here to learn with you.

308
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:33.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're here to, you know. Leave Ego at the door, and be as humble as we can be to support you all. There's so many things that I think we bring to the table that will

309
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:40.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: positively impact the outcome and success of your businesses and your personal journeys as founders, but at the same time, like

310
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: y'all are here to help each other.

311
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:48.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's so much that we're going to collectively take advantage of. And I'm just. I'm so excited and game on

312
00:47:48.960 --> 00:48:04.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there's a lot going on in the world. There's a lot going on and tech stars. There's a lot going on, and all of you all's personal lives, and that whole just wild world of chaos that is the founder journey is something that I just love more than anything.

313
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:10.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So thank you all for giving us the privilege and the opportunity to work with you and to hopefully serve you in this experience.

314
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:17.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You'll learn more about me, like some said in Tahoe, for those of you who are coming. If you're not coming to Tahoe, let me just say

315
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:28.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you might want to reconsider that decision because we, because of the founders, the the ones who came before you, the Oakland and San Francisco founders. We did in the last program.

316
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They said, you have to do 3 nights

317
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because it was 2 nights.

318
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:52.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then they were like, no, it needs to be longer. You need to spend more money. You need to give them more time, because this was too much fun, and it's too important. So the reason we double down and invest it again, and more time for you all to meet each other is because every single time we've done it the founders feel like it's just like a game changer, for how connected they get to each other.

319
00:48:53.070 --> 00:49:18.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if you all wanna truly get to know each other and become friends having an off site where you get to look at each other. Cook E, hang out, go for walks, go for talks, get work done, do whatever you need to do like. It's a really really nice experience. So that being said, if any of you all need support from us in some way to make that work. Let me know. But I will emphasize that as something that will fundamentally

320
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:29.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: impact in a positive way, your program experience, because you're gonna get to know each other better than ever before. But it's always a way to make it work, even if you can't make it like we'll find other ways to to cool you in

321
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:32.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so great.

322
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:59.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's see, I think I covered it. I introduced myself and gave other. Yeah. And for anyone wondering about like news about tech stars or just the tech ecosystem. Since we have announced the new changes we're going to get into all of that on the retreat, where we have a kind of confidential tell all. Yeah, no, I'm just ask us anything. Just so, you know, like I think founders are surprised by how raw we're willing to get. But like I'll tell you all anything.

323
00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but it has to be in the right context.

324
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:08.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just know that, like I will, I will. I share more with the founders, and I'm comfortable sharing with any other

325
00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:17.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: humans in the world. With respect to you know all these things because you all deserve the the raw's version of truth that we can afford to give you.

326
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:37.159
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly. So maybe that'll convince someone you to come on their treat if you're not already. Maybe all of you will have already signed up to go. I haven't checked yet, so alright, so we have, we're gonna do an activity at 1130. Pst, so we have about 40 min now to go through some of our expectations. Yeah. So that was our team.

327
00:50:37.620 --> 00:51:07.339
Lilliana Robinson: So we're gonna run through every single section of this deck. And we're recording. So we'll send this to you. Every single section of this. Everything we're saying is led completely out late, completely out in our program handbook. So that is something that you're gonna get tomorrow. He is finishing the final details, putting in some beautiful stylistic choices for you guys, and then you'll get it. So it's really important to go ahead and read through that program handbook when you get it tomorrow, because it'll lay out every single expectation in more detail than we're gonna cover right now.

328
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:11.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I can't count how many times we get a question from someone.

329
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:22.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And when we ask, Hey, did you? Did you read the program handbook? And they're like, Oh, no. And we're like, Well, it goes into a lot of detail there. But here's here's the short answer. So just know that, like

330
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:29.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a lot of questions that you might have will likely be addressed in a lot of the documentation that we put in a lot of work to provide.

331
00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:44.310
Lilliana Robinson: So yeah, and it's not super long, either. It's a quick green. So we'll start out with our mission. So yeah, I'll let you go. We've been around for 17 years. I've been a mentor for techstars for.

332
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, let's see, it's 2024, 14 years. So 2010 is when I first got formally involved with tech stars

333
00:51:51.760 --> 00:52:11.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 2,008, 2,009. II knew about tech stars, because, some students in a class that I was helping teach ended up going into one of the very first classes. It was a company called Next Big Sound. They're actually featured in one of the the Startup books and stories that got acquired by Pandora. But so I just so. You know, I've been watching this accelerator thing

334
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:21.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: happen throughout most of its life cycle. So text Rs and Y combinator are known as the pioneers of the accelerator model. But there's so many other ones all over the world so

335
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:22.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: just know that like

336
00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:23.960
the

337
00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:30.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: while we've seen it kind of go up and down with respect to the venture world and the future of startups, I think

338
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at the end of the day. if you are part of the right group.

339
00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:43.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: meaning each program, has its own identity, its own DNA. So the Md program team, the mentors, the composition, all have their own kind of variance.

340
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:51.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But if you choose the right one that fits for you and your style. that program and experience will be unique. and it will be beneficial.

341
00:52:51.220 --> 00:53:07.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we're our. Our commitment is to make sure that we do that for you. But at the end of the day our mission is to help founders succeed in whatever way makes sense. So some of you that means hands off. That means that we need to get out of your way. Be helpful to you when you need us to be and let you do the rest. Some of you. That means the total opposite.

342
00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:14.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or we're getting super hands on. We're getting into the nitty-gritty. We're getting into the weeds and helping you figure out really complex problems.

343
00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:21.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And we're we're designed and down to do all of that in the spectrum. So just know that it's not a one. Size fits all thing.

344
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:34.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The curriculum, if you will, isn't just, everyone needs to do the same thing and be on the same page. There's a lot of diversity and variety to your respective needs that we're aware of. So our mission is to figure out the right formula and mix for you.

345
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.300
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

346
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:50.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so what is their role in? So yeah, your role as founders is, first and foremost, to just be good stewards of of community in this program. So we expect everyone's full participation.

347
00:53:50.460 --> 00:54:13.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We are iterating with feedback that we get. So there are things that we asked everyone to participate in in the past that we're either making adjustments to or you know we'll and we'll point out these changes. But at the end of the day. We need you all to respect each other. We need you all to be open minded. I always ask for curiosity before judgment.

348
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:28.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because people will disagree, you'll you're all coming from different places in the world. Different life experiences different perspectives. So that's a value. Add, but at the same time, with so many different values and cultures clashing, you're going to experience.

349
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:43.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, significant variance in different points of view. So and then the last thing is just like this can over be overwhelming. It can be all consuming. It can be a drag on your sleep and your energy.

350
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:51.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or it could be the exact opposite to all of that. It could give you more time. It could be empowering. It could be one of the best decisions you've ever made in your life.

351
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But a lot of that is up to you.

352
00:54:54.820 --> 00:55:11.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know, when I was going through programs like this and experiences, or even at university. And you would hear people basically say, Oh, I don't like that. They do this, or I'm not satisfied with that, and always was perplexed with that like mindset, because any experience is what you decide to make it.

353
00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:29.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So. Texas can suck if you want it to. It can be like not meaningful. It could be a waste of time. It could be a bad use of it, for whoever decides that it's not a you know, priority for them. But if you lean in, you take it seriously, and you trust us, and you give us feedback as we go on anything that you want it to be that it isn't.

354
00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:36.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're down like we just want y'all to be successful beyond your wildest imaginations, because we're

355
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: equally incentivize for that to happen.

356
00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:45.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So help us figure out what that is, and just be honest and enjoy the journey. That's what I would expect the founders

357
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:53.269
Lilliana Robinson: awesome. And if you guys have any questions, you can pop them in the chat, and we'll answer them all at the end.

358
00:55:53.860 --> 00:56:07.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So entrepreneurs in recipe. Yeah, this is cool. So this was a new Inc. Like thing that happened in the past 3 years or so at tech stars, where programs. And I think I'll give credit to Austin. That's the one that I'm familiar with.

359
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:24.589
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Amos Schwartz farb the outgoing Mds. No longer the Md. There he left the company. He retired after 10 programs, but he taught me this. And it's now widely adopted across many programs where we basically hire people part time

360
00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:32.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: who are just as good, if not better than us as Mds. Meaning people who could otherwise be their own, and be an Md. Themselves.

361
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:39.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and we pay them a little bit, not not enough to afford them, but we pay them enough to make their commitment to you real.

362
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:43.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they back me up in supporting you actively throughout the program.

363
00:56:43.850 --> 00:57:00.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that is very, very cool. It's a way for you all to get perspectives from multiple masters, if you will. With respect to entrepreneurs and people who've achieved some level of either mastery or or success as an entrepreneur or as an investor. But typically an entrepreneur.

364
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:08.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And one example of that that I'm really proud to share is last program.

365
00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:23.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The former managing director for Techstar, Chicago, the person who invited me to join techstars, Troy Hinnikov, served as an entrepreneur in residence for my program, which is like that's unheard of. First of all, no one's gotten Troy to do that. But me. But

366
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:37.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there's people out here who are just super awesome. But they have other things going on. They're running their own venture firms, or they're starting other companies, and they're doing other things, and we can pull in these awesome people to come in and help you on top of myself.

367
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that is a

368
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:41.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that is what to expect.

369
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:44.210
Lilliana Robinson: That's awesome.

370
00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:49.849
Lilliana Robinson: And I believe we're trying to get Troy back for you guys. So

371
00:57:50.440 --> 00:58:05.439
Lilliana Robinson: you know, put a PIN in that. You'll hear more later. But having former Mds. Is pretty much unheard of as entrepreneurs and residents, and we've been able to have not one but 2 in the past like if I'm base, when do? He's Yoda. You know what I'm saying.

372
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:13.899
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, communication protocol. So I can run through this, Neil. And then, if there's anything I miss, since you're looking at the Handbook. Just let me know.

373
00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:37.170
Lilliana Robinson: Communication protocol is kind of different for us. It's very specific to how Neil and I have crafted the program. You'll hear different things from different programs. They kind of allow us to run it. How we see fit. Some people run it on slack notion. Different things like that. We run it all in one tool. It's called basecamp. It is a Chicago Tech company.

374
00:58:37.220 --> 00:59:06.229
Lilliana Robinson: and you'll hear their story a lot in the things that we teach, because we think that the way they built their company is a model for some sorts of things that we go into during the program. But their product is awesome. So you'll see we run the entire program on this tool. I will on board you all on Friday. You have an invite for that, and you'll have a an Hq. Where all of you can chat with each other and receive announcements from us, and you'll also have an individual company project where you'll work on things like the assignments you've already done.

375
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:34.960
Lilliana Robinson: all the other things that we work on with you directly we'll get hands on, and the main key for this is that it's completely asynchronous. So this is why we're able to have so many international founders, so many founders who are parents or have other life circumstances. This is not a completely synchronous program, while we will have lots and lots of workshops on zoom and see each other all the time a lot of the work happens in the background, asynchronously talking with our team, completing assignments and working on the business.

376
00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:44.960
Lilliana Robinson: So in base camp, it allows us to do all of those things as well as just have our team constantly be able to in contact with you without having stand ups or anything of that sort.

377
00:59:45.060 --> 01:00:07.929
Lilliana Robinson: There is one exception. We have a direct stream to be able to talk to me, Neil, or any other team member almost synchronously and specifically reserved for founders. As you can imagine, our emails are completely flooded by other people. We have lots of people trying to get into textiles. We don't want you guys to get muddled with that. So we've reserved.

378
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.310
Lilliana Robinson: Sorry about that. We've reserved

379
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:29.619
Lilliana Robinson: one stream of communication specifically for our founders, and that is called voxer. This is an iphone android app that any of you can download today on the app store, and it is essentially an asynchronous walkie talking, Neil, do you want to talk about voxer? Yeah, I love it. So I learned this trick

380
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:45.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: from David Cohen himself. David Cohen is the co-founder of techs. He's the chairman of the board. So he and I raised a fund together that I got help with Aliana and Sophia. On rising Sars, we raise 8 million dollars during Covid, and I'm raised that from investors who I'd never met before.

381
01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:56.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And the way Cohen and I work together while we raise those funds is we didn't have any meetings like we didn't have any meetings on the calendar where he and I spent any time together. We did it all on Boxer.

382
01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:10.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I was like, Bro. How did we do this like this is so cool like I get to talk to one of the most successful investors on Earth like he was like an angel investor in Uber for for perspective. And then, you know, techsars and all this other stuff. He's really cool. You'll meet him. But

383
01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:21.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm like, How did you? Very, very like cleverly finesse me into raising 8 million dollars with you without having to spend any time with me like that is brilliant. So that being said, I love that playbook

384
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:28.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the amount of time that we get to spend together talking to each other because of the systems that Liliana just outlined.

385
01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:47.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think, is magnitude, orders of magnitude greater than how a lot of other people and programs operate because we trust these asynchronous tools to make progress. So now we're not playing Tetris with you. All's calendars are ours, and instead, we're always we have a unique

386
01:01:47.460 --> 01:02:02.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: direct line of communication that you all had access to that no one else in the world does. So. I think that's a really powerful and important factor here for how we're able to build such strong connections with everybody from all over the world, even if we're not always together in the same physical space.

387
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.260
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly.

388
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:16.589
Lilliana Robinson: So we will have you all go ahead and add us on, Boxer. Maybe so soon, for one of you guys can pop our handles in the chat. But you guys will have all this information in the Handbook if you want to download it later.

389
01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.630
Lilliana Robinson: Is that everything for communication? Now?

390
01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:25.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I mean, I guess the other thing to say is like, I think we're also the only program that uses base camp to operate.

391
01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:32.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So yeah, so I know not. Everyone has their opinion about software tools. So I respect all of you. And what you prefer.

392
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:49.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The reason we're using these tools is because we know them so well, and we can make your experience better than any other place by utilizing them. And we've seen so many other people struggle because they're juggling 4 or 5 different apps that everyone has to use to find information.

393
01:02:49.920 --> 01:03:01.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You gotta check your email for this, and you gotta check your slack for that you gotta go to notion for this, and then you gotta go to Asana for that, like. No, that's cool, like we just want one app that has everything. So you go in there. It's all there simple.

394
01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:23.159
Lilliana Robinson: So after these pre program prep weeks, we will cease to use email. So you won't get any emails from us. We do use email for external intros. So Naji will use email a lot with you. Neil, will anytime that you're trying to have an intro to someone outside of this little group. Everyone on this call will use email. But for everything here, internally within our program base camp

395
01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:40.380
Lilliana Robinson: Textar Central does not count for that. So every time they need something from you guys, they will be emailing you. So if you are one of the people who have been having Techstar's emails go to spam. You should definitely try and get that sorted because they will email you for specific and important asks that are outside of this program.

396
01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:44.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah? And then I guess the last thing to say on the communication side here is

397
01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:57.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what is also beneficial, and the founders at the end of the program right before demo day tend to freak out about is, wait what happens? All this information like we just did all this stuff we wrote all these things. We had all these ideas. We had all these workshops, all these sessions.

398
01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:02.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You can go back and see it all. because it's available to you forever.

399
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:11.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So what's great is that now you have breadcrumbs of your entire program experience, all documented in one place that you can always go back to and revisit.

400
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's the other benefit of all of that documentation

401
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:38.929
Lilliana Robinson: perfect. And if you have more questions about our kind of project management ideologies, things like that. Like I said, I'm really interested in it. We're actually gonna have a workshop about it next week, so you'll be able to hear a lot more about the in depth kind of ways we think about asynchronous communication and the power of having flow in your work and uninterrupted work, and all of that. So we will save that for now

402
01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.320
Lilliana Robinson: weekly expectations.

403
01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.210
Lilliana Robinson: So on, the regular weeks will be a little bit

404
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.269
Lilliana Robinson: unorthodox. For the first couple of weeks. Traditionally week. One is

405
01:04:51.820 --> 01:05:13.219
Lilliana Robinson: its own sort of section where you just have the whole book thrown at you. You're gonna have a lot, a lot of workshops. I think I've told some of you on the offer calls just kind of clear out your entire week. One. So when you're gonna be there in person with us. You will have some moments to work, but a lot of it is gonna be put in workshops, and the purpose of that is we wanna give you all of the knowledge upfront, so that you can start applying it for the rest of the weeks

406
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:27.129
Lilliana Robinson: week. 2 half of that will be on the retreat, and then the other half will be spent in some presentations. You'll hear more about this later, and then weeks 3 and 4 are mentor madness. So after we get past that first month, things start becoming regulated

407
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:34.629
Lilliana Robinson: and pretty orthodox. So you'll expect a certain flow of the weeks once we get to like weeks 5 through 13.

408
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:57.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What you can expect. We'll have roundtables together sometimes it's CEO Round Table, sometimes it's the full program round table, like everyone on this call. We'll hear about our week. Reflect on it. Set goals for the week. If it's at the beginning of the week, you'll have a weekly sorry to interrupt. We did get feedback about those round tables in the past program we ran, and the feedback that we got was the frequency was a bit high.

409
01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:11.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we're making an adjustment to space them out every other week instead of having them weekly, so that you all have more free time. So that's one thing that we did learn from directly from this past program that we wanted to iterate on. So

410
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:22.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if for some reason we need to dial it up or make more accessible. We'll do that. But from the clear feedback we got, we decided to reduce the amount of time we were asking you all to spend in those sessions.

411
01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:50.429
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly so. Always iterating when we get direct feedback, will also iterate in the middle of the program as well. We see it as our own little startup so definitely feel free to give us feedback and whatever works for you. So sometimes people do have things come up, and as long as you communicate it's completely okay to have to miss a session. Stop going to a certain thing. If it's not serving you, it's just all about communication. So right now, we're starting with the overall expectation that everyone will be at everything, and then we'll work our way from there.

412
01:06:50.570 --> 01:07:03.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, you'll get into the habit of just giving us a heads up like letting our team know. Hey, I'm not going to be at this thing. I've got this going on, or I've got a customer call, or I've got an investor like it's all good so long as we're just being adults and communicating about it.

413
01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:04.810
Lilliana Robinson: Yep.

414
01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:13.069
Lilliana Robinson: and we want you guys to get the most out of it, too. So if there's something we do really feel like you should be at. We'll let you know. If you plan to miss it.

415
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:38.709
Lilliana Robinson: Other things weekly that you can expect from weeks like 5 on, are weekly Kpi meetings with your eir. We find tracking metrics extremely important at techstars, and this is one of the main pillars of things. We'll teach you and then, of course, workshops, so you'll hear from a variety of our network as well as each of our team members. Lead workshops. So that'll be the remainder of your curriculum, and then going into pitch practice and demo day prep, and the end.

416
01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:51.779
Lilliana Robinson: So that's what you can expect on a week to week basis. Was there anything else to hit here? Yeah, I just think, reminding everyone of the overall structure. The first month is lay of the land mentorship, you know, making sure that you all know all the the basics that we

417
01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alluded to during the application process that we take to a whole nother level.

418
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:59.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You know, during this the kickoff of the program.

419
01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:11.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then month 2 is like, all right. We take all those insights and everything that you learned, and we execute so that could be sales that could be building product. That could be. Both could be a bunch of other things. But we're going to get it all done and get you a humming.

420
01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:22.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then in month 3. That's when things get real about what the horizon beyond looks like is, are you raising money, are we? You know, bootstrapping, are we

421
01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:41.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: focused on, you know, customer development in a new way. Are you hiring? Each of you are going to be in a different state of what you realize you need after 2 months of this immersion. So once we know what that looks like, we get to work with you to figure that out. And then you kind of storm out of our program doing. You know, it's your company. So

422
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's it's it's go time.

423
01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:46.649
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly. Okay.

424
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.170
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, and there, that was program structure. Yeah.

425
01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:52.760
Lilliana Robinson: perfect. Okay?

426
01:08:53.510 --> 01:09:16.729
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, it's also very important to note, this is a hybrid program. So I mentioned this to a lot of you already, but weeks, one and weeks 12 will be in person. Everybody who has not yet seen the pre-program update email number one. It's super important. Demo day is going to be during week 12 to allow for the maximum attendance of investors, because New York tech week is the following week.

427
01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:30.019
Lilliana Robinson: So we do encourage a lot of you to go to New York tech week during week 13. But we'll also be around during week 13 to help you with Post Demo Day. Follow up just writing all of that influence from your big event and just helping you take advantage of it.

428
01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:36.280
Lilliana Robinson: So just to maximize all of the investors so that they're not all at the conference we're going to do demo day during week 12.

429
01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:59.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We have shifted back the demo day prep, so you'll still have exactly the amount of demo day prep, that we always have. Yeah couple more things on that. So one that was new to us. Just so, you know, like a few weeks ago, we found out, oh, Snap like New York tech week is gonna be big. And we need to let the founders know, Asap, that this is a huge opportunity for them, not and especially for you all as techstars, founders.

430
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:05.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because a lot of people are going to want to get to know y'all, because you all are in the Bay Area

431
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:18.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: unlike any other tech stars program on earth. So you all are gonna be connected to in proc have proximity to more investors than any other program in that respect. So when you go to New York.

432
01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:20.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you decide to go, which I think you should.

433
01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:35.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That means that you are creating like plugs and access on, like 2 of the largest markets that you can from an investment standpoint. Right? So that's a great opportunity for you all. And

434
01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I guess the other part is.

435
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we just announced that Texar's headquarters is moving to New York.

436
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:55.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it kind of already has been there for the Us. Insiders like the past couple years, like our CEO, lives there and has basically opened an office and hired a lot of people there. So what's cool is like, we're the Bay area. We represent the Bay area this group.

437
01:10:56.010 --> 01:11:07.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then we've got headquarters in New York. So I think giving you all that inroads and access and connectivity is going to be a net benefit for those of you interested in building up. You're both founder and investor. Now

438
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.300
Lilliana Robinson: we've got a couple questions here. So Vincent, is your question answered.

439
01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:37.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So, Neil Vince desk and given the move of Texas 2 point Nyc. Is it mandatory to go to Nyc. Do you have a bit more context? Yeah, sure, it's not mandatory at all. It's an opportunity so not mandatory, not expected. But we suggested highly suggested, because it's it's just going to be a massive concentration of both founders and investors. And it's our home court as far as tech Sars is concerned.

440
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:47.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think that's to you all's benefit to to be a part of, if you can, if you can manage that and swing it. But that's also why we move Demo Day a week ahead.

441
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:51.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because we needed to make sure that you all had room to take advantage of that.

442
01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:58.890
Lilliana Robinson: Will we be able to pitch at Nyc tech week? So

443
01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:08.610
Lilliana Robinson: exactly, I was. Gonna say, this is a completely like outside of tech stars events. So there's nothing that we're putting on there specifically, or any specific like

444
01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:31.440
Lilliana Robinson: in that we have. It's just a lot more that we think you guys should go, and we know you will not have the investor turnout that we want you to have if we have Demo day during that week. So it's a lot more being aware of the event rather than it being something we're putting on, or we have spots for anything. Naji will probably be there. Naji, I'll let you unmute if you'd like to speak on New York tech week. If there's any viewpoint that we're not getting at.

445
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:41.849
Naji B. | Techstars: No, I don't have any particular viewpoints right now. But yeah, I it is likely I will be there. For sure.

446
01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:51.720
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect. So that's New York, and we'll get more info as program progresses. But this is just something to be aware of right now, as we start thinking about looking ahead

447
01:12:52.640 --> 01:13:10.440
Lilliana Robinson: perfect. So that's the hybrid program. There's one more week that we are optionally in person, and that is week 5. So weeks one and 12 are mandatory to be out in Oakland with us. Week 5. A lot of international funders opt not to come in the middle of program. It's just very expensive. So we completely understand. But if you are able to join

448
01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:31.690
Lilliana Robinson: will be streaming for all virtual participants. If you are able to join. Week 5 is kind of a reset after mentor. Madness finishes and we come back together. We regroup. We analyze all of the feedback that you got from mentor madness. And then we figure out action item steps of how to move forward. It's also a very sensitive time, because mentor madness can be a little bit

449
01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:40.909
Lilliana Robinson: shaking for a lot of people. So it's really nice to have that time together, as everybody just went through a similar experience.

450
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:43.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Diplomatically worded.

451
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:49.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'll I'll I'll add more color to it, cause I think that was well said by the liana

452
01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: menger man is.

453
01:13:51.300 --> 01:14:20.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: things can get a little real, so you'll hear from a lot of smart people, and some of them are gonna hit you at the core. They're gonna be like, oh, man, I guess, like you're gonna question a lot of things. And some of you come out with full confidence that the strategy you went in with is the strategy you need to continue doing. But some of you are gonna get feedback or have people involved, or you're gonna learn things or be questioned in certain ways that'll make you have to like, do some real thinking about what the next move should be.

454
01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:28.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and because of that, we have learned that it's super important to give you all an opportunity to reconnect

455
01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:52.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in person, if you'd like with each other with us to get that kind of support, and to just make sense of everything that you learned because it is overwhelming. It is all. It is a true information fire hose to meet with dozens and dozens of brilliant people, and get questioned about every aspect of you and your business. So it's a fundamental aspect of every tech program. But

456
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:58.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think the the difference is that the what you do with the information afterwards, and that's why we facilitate that

457
01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:03.390
Lilliana Robinson: awesome and our commitment to you.

458
01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:09.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so as far as our commitment to you.

459
01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we're not here to waste your time.

460
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:28.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There are so many different versions of the story about whether an accelerator is a good bet for founders. Good use of your time. Good to give up the equity. You know all of those things, but what I told you when I offered each of you a spot in this class

461
01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:34.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is that those formalities, the money, the deal, whatever that's all well and good. But at the end of the day.

462
01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:38.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What everyone says consistently at the end of our programs

463
01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is the connection that they have with each other

464
01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:48.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: makes this more than worth it. So our commitment to you is first and foremost, to make sure that that happens.

465
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:53.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: your allegiance and connection to each other is what we will prioritize, facilitating above everything else.

466
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:58.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then, on top of that, each of you all have your own unique, respective deals.

467
01:15:58.810 --> 01:16:04.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just making sure that we are lifelong friends and partners to you, no matter what happens with your business.

468
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:06.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Is what you can expect from me.

469
01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:09.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then on top of that, hopefully.

470
01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:16.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a bunch of y'all end up getting fantastic outcomes and exits, and then we all get paid. That'd be great. I would love that

471
01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:30.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I guess the last anecdote I'll share, and this is the Texar Chicago. Lower story. You'll hear me reference text our Chicago a lot since that's the program I came from. But Techstar, Chicago

472
01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: has the top

473
01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:36.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: company of all time out of texts ours from a return standpoint.

474
01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:41.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's a company that came went through the program 11 years ago called Trading View.

475
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:49.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And one thing that was really cool that happened with that class of companies is that as that company was succeeding

476
01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they made room

477
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for the founders in their class to invest.

478
01:16:56.010 --> 01:17:03.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so everybody won. Everyone in the class got to participate in the most valuable company to go through techstars ever.

479
01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:15.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think that's really meaningful, because those founders, because they all knew where that was going, and they saw, and the founder was a part of the class, and they were all helping each other, and they still meet every month or every quarter to this day.

480
01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Whoever here wins ends up helping everybody win.

481
01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:28.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think that's a pretty cool thing to be a part of that. You won't read about online. But I'm telling you here confidentially that that happened, and that can't happen.

482
01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:30.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just saying it

483
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:54.140
Lilliana Robinson: so true, if anyone from our team wants to give any advice, I think this is a great time for it, so feel free to just unmute. But that is my big piece of of that advice. Every single time we do this expectations orientation session. It's to get really close with everybody that's on this call. Specifically, your class members. Your class members make your experience

484
01:17:54.250 --> 01:18:11.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: also people. They they? They hire each other, too. So like, let's just say, like a few years from now, things don't work out, or you know, you change strategies, or whatever, like some of you all want to work with the other person or the other company, or the other team like, there's all types of cross pollination that happens when you have a tight knit group.

485
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:17.869
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly. Did any other team members want to give any advice before we move on.

486
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:38.499
Ferrona Lie, Techstars: jump in really quickly is to. If there are workshops that you feel like you already know, for instance, there will be topics that some of you might have learned in the past, for instance, like financial modeling or kpis and whatnot, I would highly highly encourage to still go, because, in addition to

487
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:42.959
Ferrona Lie, Techstars: for 2 reasons, one is that I appreciate. Always walk away with something new.

488
01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:58.659
Ferrona Lie, Techstars: Whether or not it's from the other co-founders in the room or from the workshop presenter. I always walk away with something new. Then, second is that there's always value. They can also add to the room as well, because everyone's gonna be starting at very different points. Somebody might have

489
01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:04.840
Ferrona Lie, Techstars: built a financial model in the past. Some people, this is gonna be the first time. And so you you guys are here

490
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:08.890
Ferrona Lie, Techstars: for each other as well. And I feel this. I feel like this is pretty special. That you're

491
01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:19.170
Ferrona Lie, Techstars: you have 23 Co founders is one way of thinking about it, in addition to your own Co. Founders as well, that are going through everything

492
01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:42.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: simultaneously, which I don't know, Nel, has this happened before, because we had to progress before. But it wasn't the same, you know, same program. So I feel like this is the first I don't know. This is the first of ours like we've never. We've never had so much consistency across the size of a class before. So I think the network effect here is going to be even stronger.

493
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:49.049
Lilliana Robinson: Hey? Anybody else, before we move forward?

494
01:19:51.630 --> 01:20:05.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I mean. Well, you know what, Liliana. There is one other thing, and I think usually you are the one who says it, so I'll I'll try to tee you up for it, but it's kinda like we have a certain reputation. I think, as as tech stars folk

495
01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:11.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like with our with our program specific. Yeah, our program has a rep like like

496
01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:24.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: our founders show up to things like they engage in like they make an impression wherever they go, in a way that people go you. There's some value all your founders. So II forgot what you exactly say, but I know you've taken

497
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: pride in this. Well.

498
01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:48.040
Lilliana Robinson: I mean we're recording. But if you guys just keep it on the keep it on the deal. Our programs are known amongst tech stars to be something special, and the founders that come out of it are also known to be something special, and you'll be able to tell as we bring back some of our alumni. It's just each of you were chosen for a very specific reason

499
01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:57.439
Lilliana Robinson: many of you were chosen specifically for the types of people that you are regardless of what company you're building. We've chosen based on founders, and

500
01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:03.419
Lilliana Robinson: I'm not sure every program does so, and it shows because our founders are always

501
01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:22.190
Lilliana Robinson: on it, always camera on always engaging in the chat when we do workshops with other programs which you'll see. We have some global workshops from David Cohen and other super stars like that. There's a very clear distinction on who comes from our program and who doesn't? And that's something that Neil and I and our whole team takes very seriously.

502
01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:35.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We really appreciate the standard that we've made, and we've chosen all of you because we believe you uphold that standard. That's perfect. Thank you. And what I'll add is, I think it's a very simple reason.

503
01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:41.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  we're just encouraging you to develop habits and presence

504
01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:48.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that should be reflected in the companies that you all are building and scaling. You're gonna hire dozens, if not hundreds, of people one day.

505
01:21:48.560 --> 01:22:05.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And you're gonna have expectations of how they show up in the calls and the company sessions and the meetings that you have with them the work you do with them, the way you operate. So it only makes sense for us to reflect that same energy. Now, while you're in the process of building these great businesses.

506
01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think that's like the fundamental, like

507
01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:12.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: nature of of that approach of just respect and presence.

508
01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:31.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And it's a that's a hard thing for me to PIN down, because I it's more feedback we get, unless something that we're actively in like asking of you. But there is something about this group that is always special. And this this group in particular, will have its own unique characteristics on how to make that so

509
01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:51.950
Lilliana Robinson: it's a mix of respect and thoughtfulness, and we've already recognized that and the things that you have done so far, and all the assignments and the way you communicate, and just it will continue. So when we introduce you to someone from our network, they will just know that because it's one of our founders. There's a level of thoughtfulness that will come through with that, and that'll open so many more doors for you all.

510
01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:59.409
Lilliana Robinson: Because it's usually people just wanna work with our founders, which is awesome. So we'll go through some announces. Then we'll take questions

511
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:29.030
Lilliana Robinson: to do so this week you are awaiting the pre program update number 2, which is coming tomorrow. That will include the program handbook going over everything and more of what we talked about today. A class. Look book we're putting together, or Naji already put together. For you guys, it is confidential because you guys have not been announced to the world. So that's just for you all to understand who your classmates are. So keep that confidential, and then pre program prep. Week to schedule for next week will also come out tomorrow.

512
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:36.710
Lilliana Robinson: Remember, to complete your class roster by Wednesday and complete your pre work packets by next Wednesday, March sixth.

513
01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:49.249
Lilliana Robinson: So this week you'll get the program handbook. You'll get the class roster in by Wednesday, and you'll also receive base camp access on Friday, and I'll train you on how to use it. And then coming next week again the Pre work packet.

514
01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:53.939
Lilliana Robinson: So with that, let's go through some questions, and then we have an activity to do together.

515
01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.460
Lilliana Robinson: feel free to unmute or pop them in the chat.

516
01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:23.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's no way we answered everyone's questions without hosting and playing poker.

517
01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:30.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Be careful. Sophie's really good.  Chloe is is learning

518
01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:39.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: killer, Kate, for a reason. Yeah, there, there's some. There's some ringers on the squat that like playing poker.

519
01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:55.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, perfect looking forward to that in a huh! And and then not even into we'll do. We can play poker whenever I play poker and VR with founders. We've hosted sessions in Google. I'll do it, man.

520
01:24:56.050 --> 01:25:07.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We ran programs in Covid, VR headsets. Not a joke. I bought every founder of VR headset. And we like did movie nights, and like played poker and hung out with each other. It was fun.

521
01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:09.520
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: thanks.

522
01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:14.360
Lilliana Robinson: great question. Any other questions.

523
01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:46.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what the only question was about really quick, tactical question. There we go. Where is the campus itself? I've been like trying to book our area, you know. So just trying to get the proximity. Yup, yup, so we'll we'll drop the address in the chat right now and then. We'll make sure you all have it. But it's right off of Lake Merritt and downtown Oakland. It's really really beautiful, like it's a really nice like. There's an outdoor patio you get to see the lake like, it's a pretty nice situation. So I'm looking forward to y'all seeing it.

524
01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:54.880
Valeria Brenner: And I also have, like a not so tactful, more like travel questions. So obviously, we're right across from San Francisco. Is there a

525
01:25:55.060 --> 01:26:01.230
Valeria Brenner: a Food Recommendation service that we can subscribe to? I don't know if anybody here has, like a belly account.

526
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:06.500
Valeria Brenner: I'm really big into like food. So so food. All right, Naji.

527
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:10.019
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you better on mute. Bro, so Nazi is the food expert.

528
01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:40.059
Naji B. | Techstars: II like food. Food is good, good food is better. The so yeah, if you want, like, Rex and stuff, I have like a bunch of flags I gave some of them in that guide mostly focus on like things that are relatively walkable or accessible from the office. But if you want more far out things I'm happy to share and give Zoom alright.

529
01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:51.939
Lilliana Robinson: Another question for you, Naji. Parking situation at the office. That's not something I've experienced before. Is it free? Do you recommend parking? It's open.

530
01:26:52.640 --> 01:27:03.150
Ferrona Lie, Techstars: Yeah, there within. II think I mentioned on the chat. It depends on what you consider near within one to 2 blocks. No, but within 10 min walk. Yes.

531
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:31.840
Ferrona Lie, Techstars: but we'll talk more about that. I can. I'm happy to just kind of take a screenshot and circle around just big caveat, though it's Oakland at the end of the day. So please be careful about how you take care of your car. Don't leave anything behind and stuff like that. So yeah, I'm happy to send more information on that. That's legit in the Bay Area in general, too. Just so like people don't leave stuff in their cars around here because, including us as well, I'll do that but that being said

532
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:43.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if it's just for the week, if you're coming into the office. There's indoor parking, and there's outdoor parking nearby that you can pay for. That's not overly expensive, so I would recommend that.

533
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:52.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If it's for the week, if you're planning to be in the office more frequently, you might want to figure out a more reliable like situation.

534
01:27:53.470 --> 01:28:00.059
Art Fields -ClubReq: Neil, you mind if I add on that until that is our 100. Yeah. So being from Oakland,

535
01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:07.259
Art Fields -ClubReq: your cars don't get baked in the hood, but it does get big downtown areas, so like in in

536
01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:26.629
Art Fields -ClubReq: and like parking lots open parking lots that are not like secure it, will. They will break into your car so like at the end of the day, if you have to just roll down your window, leave a note. Say like, Please don't break my windows like it's it's that real. So not trying to scare anybody off, but like what Neil say, like Park in the parking lot, please. That's secure.

537
01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.640
Lilliana Robinson: Nope.

538
01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:49.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so yeah, I'm from the south side of Chicago. So I'm very familiar with a lot of things. And to be clear. I like it out here like I mean, I'm I'm in. OI live in Oakland, and it's very, very nice and comfortable and legit

539
01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:57.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: people just can't leave stuff in their car. That's like the main issue that II see cause. If you do, then somebody gonna take it cause they want it or need it.

540
01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:03.289
Lilliana Robinson:  it's just real. We just want you guys to be safe, so it's helpful.

541
01:29:03.450 --> 01:29:04.470
Lilliana Robinson: bob

542
01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:08.629
there's a, Bart station, nearby. Right.

543
01:29:08.690 --> 01:29:09.700
Lilliana Robinson: Yes.

544
01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:20.890
Bob Van Dell II - DubPrime: II would recommend parking further away, and then maybe, like end of the line, if it works for your commute and then enjoy that parking, and then just red bar on the way. In

545
01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:29.680
Bob Van Dell II - DubPrime: Dublin. The best part was, you're the first on the on the train. You usually get a seat. get some work done on the way in

546
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:32.710
Bob Van Dell II - DubPrime: nice, bigger parking lots.

547
01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:34.400
Lilliana Robinson: That's perfect.

548
01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:47.760
Lilliana Robinson: A lot of our founders have done that in the past. And I see Jayla talking about not leaving things in the car. That's not a joke. So a lot of people think that we're just being like super stringent or something like actually do not leave anything in your car.

549
01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.070
Lilliana Robinson: Melanie?

550
01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:55.989
Melanie, Positive Finance: Yes, thank you. I just have a question about the in-person session. Do you guys know when

551
01:29:56.030 --> 01:30:02.710
Melanie, Positive Finance: does it start like early morning, or when around?

552
01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:10.220
Lilliana Robinson: Great question. So right away, 9 Am. Tuesday morning, March twelfth. Like you should be at the office.

553
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:21.980
Lilliana Robinson: So we are giving you Monday as a travel day, so that we can start right on time on Tuesday, so definitely take advantage of Monday as a travel day. You guys are all becoming in on Monday, so that you're there to start on Tuesday morning.

554
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:26.049
Melanie, Positive Finance: so would be 9 Am. To

555
01:30:26.150 --> 01:30:40.930
Lilliana Robinson: like pretty pretty much. You should block the whole day, so our workshops are gonna be sparse throughout the day. You'll have off to do lunch. You'll have an hour or so to work in the afternoon, and then we usually have evening activities, dinners, etc. So that's why I recommend just blocking the whole week.

556
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:46.089
Lilliana Robinson: But you will have time in between to grab a phone booth. Take a call. Things like that.

557
01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:49.719
Lilliana Robinson: And you'll see a lot more of the schedule in the coming days.

558
01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.199
Melanie, Positive Finance: Okay, cool. Thank you.

559
01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:54.090
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. Antonio.

560
01:30:54.800 --> 01:31:03.590
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: yeah, is, is it okay to bring other team members to the office other than our co-founders say to a brainstorm. So stuff like that work to them.

561
01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:07.269
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Okay, you can bring guests. You can bring guests in with you.

562
01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:17.979
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect. But only the full time program. Members will have key cards, so you can bring whoever you'd like, and then you just have to make sure you can let them in.

563
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:19.470
Lilliana Robinson: Lisa.

564
01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:31.090
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: I was curious. If it's if there's any other weeks where you feel like it would be beneficial to be there in person. Or is that really all up to us because it's all. It's all online. And

565
01:31:31.630 --> 01:31:47.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, that's a great question. Lisa. It is very variable, because some of you may have a high concentration of like. You may decide that you want to have a series of investor conversations or or something like that. Right? So you have to choose that my instinct

566
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:54.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: would be maybe a little bit earlier like the week before Demo Day.

567
01:31:54.450 --> 01:32:13.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you decide to come in like a week prior to get the lay of the land, maybe make some new connections get situated. So you're more comfortable because Demo Day tends to get pretty intense and everyone kind of gets stressed out, and they're practicing pitches and meeting people and all stuff. So there's a lot going on there. So I would say the week before Demo Day probably would make sense.

568
01:32:14.190 --> 01:32:15.320
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: Oh, thank you.

569
01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:40.940
Lilliana Robinson: Let's jump to a question from the chat. Are the travel dates included in the dates given for April and May, or should we add a day before and after as well? So for April I included travel. So I gave you the dates Tuesday through Thursday, so you can travel on Monday and Friday. You'll have that Monday off after mentor madness, so that can be a travel day Tuesday through Thursday will be in person in April, and the dates are in that email

570
01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:56.580
Lilliana Robinson: for May. That entire week is in person, so you'll have to fly in on Sunday, and then Monday through Friday. We're in person because it's Demo day prep. So we can't give an extra day off there, because all those things are crucial to get ready for Demo Day, so you'll have to come in the weekend before.

571
01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:22.289
Lilliana Robinson: That was a great question, Valeria. And then, really quick. One more from the chat. What time do the evening activities finish on the first week? Whenever you want? You typically around like 8, 8, 30 for some dinners, if we have dinners with the partners and things, but you're never required to stay. So if you are tired or you need to go because you have other responsibilities. You do not have to stay in the evening. All of our mandatory sessions will end by 5

572
01:33:23.210 --> 01:33:24.070
Lilliana Robinson: snow.

573
01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:39.480
Snow Lee / Runbear: Hi, I'd like to manage my schedule. Can I schedule next week you mentioned about the the second week of the pre pre week? Do I need to expect this kind of that that that

574
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:42.940
Snow Lee / Runbear: time like this week or yeah.

575
01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:48.690
Lilliana Robinson: that's a great question. So everything will be between 10 Am. And noon. Pst.

576
01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:57.139
Lilliana Robinson: so if you just block that time, just those 2 h, everything will be locked in there, and then you can make sure that you can schedule the rest of the time for next week.

577
01:33:58.020 --> 01:33:59.369
Snow Lee / Runbear: Great question.

578
01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:05.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If there's something you can't make, it's okay, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate a record.

579
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:07.580
Lilliana Robinson: Absolutely.

580
01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.520
Lilliana Robinson: Alan. in the cart.

581
01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:22.169
Allan: Yes, so this actually a question for Neil, and totally off topic. But we're road tripping to Cali right now, and we're stopping by Chicago today.

582
01:34:22.570 --> 01:34:33.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which one's better Judy knows or P. Quads all day. Peak quads, no no doubt. Go get that pizza. Best pizza. Let's go. You're asking the right question out of you.

583
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:45.039
Lilliana Robinson: That was awesome. We have. We have other things for you, too. If you have a lot of time. Just send us a box here. Yeah, we got people in Chicago that's like, Home Court.

584
01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:54.710
Allan: Yeah. Oh, we're we're going to be here from like 4 till tomorrow morning at 7 Am. 4 pm. To 7 am. Tomorrow. So if you have any recommendations, send it over

585
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:56.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright. Awesome.

586
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:58.630
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. Is it, Mercedes.

587
01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:18.530
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): Yeah, don't worry about it. It's mere chat, but I don't expect to actually know how to pronounce Romanian words. So Hi! I have a question my co-founder and I are planning to relocate to Oakland for the entire period. I actually live in California already. And he doesn't. But we were wondering for those hybrid weeks that are in between.

588
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:42.100
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): Is there a place for us to work out of the text? There's office? Yeah. Great question. Yeah. I wanted to add that earlier. Thank you for asking and this is also for whoever was asking. I think Lisa was asking about in between. So the office will be open to all of you who are full time program participants. 24, 7.

589
01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:47.759
Lilliana Robinson: So you have your key card that you'll get in week one, and you can get in there even when we're virtual.

590
01:35:47.830 --> 01:36:12.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now, that doesn't mean that the staff will all be there. So we had a lot of founders that just wanted to work out of there even during the virtual weeks. A lot of our staff likes to work from home. So when we're virtual. We won't always be in the office, but it's open to you guys as much as you'd like to use it, and a lot of your fellow founders are planning to be there as well like press. Just so, you know, like

591
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:20.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we're still working on like furniture and accommodations and like details. There's a whole story about like

592
01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:28.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how we got this office and what's going on in it. We need new chairs, like, you know, this is, it's like a startup office like total, just like

593
01:36:28.230 --> 01:36:49.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: figuring itself out type of things. So just so, you know, it's not like some fancy we work or something like that. It's literally like we're in startup mode trying to figure out. You know, I spent the Sunday before program kicked off last time we ran our last Oakland program, putting together Ikea lamps so like it's just like super raw in real and and fun. So just so you all know that

594
01:36:50.000 --> 01:37:04.860
Lilliana Robinson: that being said it isn't a Co working space. So even though our office isn't complete, yeah, there are a lot of things that are available in the Co working space like phone booths, tables, other things. Great view on the top floor. That. You guys can also access outside of our office.

595
01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.000
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, tree treat.

596
01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:13.689
Triet Leminh - LexIQ: So are are you all gonna be there during the the in between

597
01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.649
Triet Leminh - LexIQ: times, like the schedule, I will.

598
01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:20.980
Triet Leminh - LexIQ: So I will. Naji will. Ferona will.

599
01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:24.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  yeah, we'll we'll physically be around.

600
01:37:24.450 --> 01:37:25.490
Triet Leminh - LexIQ: Okay.

601
01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:36.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Morgan sponsorship.

602
01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:43.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They invested in like 12 classes at a time. But we have 2 classes to run in Oakland.

603
01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:52.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So basically, we have a super class of 24 companies. But, functionally speaking, there will be a technical bifurcation

604
01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:54.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of founder classes.

605
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.730
Okay?

606
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:02.049
Lilliana Robinson: Great questions. Okay? Sohail.

607
01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:31.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Thanks. So II think I saw this question in the chat from Melanie. But I'm just kinda curious about the difference in kind of what happens in the in between weeks, like, if we, we don't have a place to stay in San Francisco yet. So just curious about like the benefit of being there in person stuff that happens outside of the program is there networking events like that kind of yeah, there's always networking events like the Bay area is the top is the capital end of the world when it comes to venture capital investment activity. So

608
01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:43.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's it's up to you to decide to make that more worthwhile. Some founders value the ability to get back to work and just focus on what they want to execute on others are trying

609
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:57.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: their hardest to build the strongest network that they possibly can from an investment, standpoint or otherwise. So for those of you that want to take advantage of the Bay area, we encourage you to stick around and and do that. But we're not going to require it, because not everyone needs it.

610
01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.879
Sahil Patel: That makes a lot of sense. Yeah, thank you.

611
01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.310
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect.

612
01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:26.799
Lilliana Robinson: I think we got through all the questions for the in between weeks. Not she on. Our team goes to a lot of events and things. So if you are local, we'll be sure to send all of you the different events that are going on, that if you're local, you can attend, so there will be nothing put on by us. But there are always things going on like Neil said.

613
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:37.880
Lilliana Robinson: So right now let's switch gears and get to know each other for the last 20 min. So so who's gonna pop a link in the chat? And we will see you all in there.

614
01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:17.970
Lilliana Robinson: So to be clearly, Anna, they should leave the zoom and join that one. Okay, yeah, I'll stay here till everyone's gone.

615
01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:42.859
Lilliana Robinson: Does everybody see the link.

616
01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:45.530
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. See you in there.

617
01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:47.040
Lilliana Robinson: Hi, everybody.
