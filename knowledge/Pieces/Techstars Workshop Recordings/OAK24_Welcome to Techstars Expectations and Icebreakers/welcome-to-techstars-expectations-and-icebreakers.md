### Key Insights

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: anybody done that? No? Yup, okay, yeah. You're on it. Somebody does it? Don't worry, Vince. Everybody. Let's do some sales. This is always fun."

> "Felipe Acevedo - Goohaus: It's always fun. Hey? Hey? Hey!"

> "Lilliana Robinson: so class roster forms are due this Wednesday. Those are extremely important. I've seen some messages asking like, did we only send the invite to Ceos? What's that about? So that's correct. So every time that we give offers, we just communicate only with the CEO until the class roster form is complete. That way. We know who from your team is actually going to be a full time program participant to receive all of the notifications, invitations, things like that."

> "Lilliana Robinson: So if you have members of your team other than yourself, the CEO that are going to participate, please make sure that they fill out the class roster form by the end of the day on Wednesday. Super important?"

> "Lilliana Robinson: So for now until the class roster form just for this week, please send the pre program. Update number one to your team members. If you haven't already. It contains the full schedule with all the zoom links at the bottom. It contains key information that they need to know. So please don't just send your team like the class roster form link things like that. Just send them the full email so they can read through all that important info as well."
