00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Yep. Alright.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Okay, everybody. Neil, you can see.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I am here. Yes, I can see.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Perfect. Well, welcome. We've been looking forward to this so much, so it's so great to have all of you here.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm Lilianna. Neil and I will be driving this and we'll introduce our full team in just a second.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
First, I want to start with some announcements. So while welcome kits were due last Friday. Those are your swag kits.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So for those of you who may not have completed it yet or have hit the maximum. So if you went on and you couldn't order it.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It's either because the deadline has passed and they ran out of stock or because our cohort it's extra large we actually hit the maximum and I've extended it now.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So you guys can go back in this week. It's just not guaranteed that you'll get it A before program starts and be Get it at all right now because I got a message this morning that we're out of stock with some things so every single person here is going to get a welcome kit.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I just have those updates for right now, so it may take a couple of weeks to get some of the things back and stock, specifically venture deals.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The book is out of stock right now and I think the t-shirts. So we'll see just message me directly if you need help with that and I can get you in touch with our accelerator operations.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And yeah.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
What a cool problem to have. That's the first time I've ever heard of that.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I know.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Okay.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So I think what's happening is is that we're at a peak. This is like the most classes and programs that have ever started simultaneously than ever before in the history of tech stars.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And we unlike I think most if not all other programs. Like you all know, start 2 weeks early.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Cause everyone else is gonna have this conversation and call 2 weeks from now. But we're having it now and we have some reasons for that.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Sorry to interrupt, Willie. It's when to clarify that.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Exactly. Yeah, so if you need help getting that swag every person here is going to get their swad kit if you're if you're going to be a full-time program participant, it just matter when.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So class roster forms are due this Wednesday. Those are extremely important. I've seen some messages asking like did we only send the invite to CEOs?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000
What's that about? So that's correct. So every time that we give offers, we just communicate only with the CEO until the class roster form is complete.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
That way we know who from your team is actually going to be a full-time program participant to receive all of the notifications, invitations, things like that.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So if you have members of your team other than yourself, the CEO that are going to participate, please make sure that they fill out the cluster form by the end of the day on Wednesday.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Super important. No, are you gonna say something?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Well, yeah, I'm gonna say something, but it's not actually related what you were just saying.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It's more just like I can't contain my excitement for seeing everybody's faces all at once on this screen.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Like it's actually really exciting. Like I know that all of you all are going to become friends and then I'm going to become closer in friends with all of you.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So I just I'm kind of giddy about that. It feels nice to be back at it and ready to get to know you.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So I'm looking forward to these introductions.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It is so great to see you guys. And there are so many of you, which is awesome.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Yeah, yeah, let's go. Like this is the squad now. Let's get it.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So for now, until the class raster form, just for this week, please send the pre program up date number one to your team members if you haven't already.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It contains the full schedule with all the Zoom links at the bottom. It contains key information that they need to know.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So please don't just send your team like the class roster form link, things like that. Just send them the full email so they can read through all that important info as well.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Any questions here before we move forward?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
There's a few in the chat. Let's take a look. Or maybe you already responded.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Yeah, the So, Valeria, have you seen the pre program update number one email?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Okay.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I have not. And so I got all the calendar invites, obviously for the meetings, but then I didn't get like a pre update email and so I'm just kind of scouring right now to see like what could have happened to it but I'll give you an update if it's somehow ended up in spam or something, but.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Okay, cool. I will double check that you are in there. Veronica just put the swag link in the chat, but the link is in that email and there's also really important stuff in there.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:41.000

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Company name and if you're the first person from your company saying this name you can give like a one-liner on what you what it is you guys do and then what are you most looking forward to in the program?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:26.000
So like Li graduated from Western and after I worked at a venture studio where I was building startups across healthcare and sales working in product strategy and customer discovery.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:14.000
I am sadly not going to be like fully involved in this program because my visa is expiring and I need to leave the country, but I'll be here through the end of the retreat.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.000
It's going to be the best time and I'll also continue to be available for any kind of support, especially in jobs.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
So. Hi.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Kate will be available as a mentor though to a select few even though she'll be out of the country.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Yeah.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
So if you know you guys are diving you'll still get to see some of Kate.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Oh, be in Europe and Asia and everywhere. And I'll popcorn into Chloe.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Hey, I am an associate. This is my fourth and fifth program. I'm a student at the University of Edinburgh.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
So this is my fourth and fifth program. I'm a student at the University of Edinburgh.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
So if anyone is outside of the US and needs questions answered, I'm here on the wacky time zones.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:00.000
I am always happy to, answer any questions. I'm working on a lot of back-end ops stuff.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:09.000
If you have Visa questions, I can also help with that. But I really, really love product testing, project management, any sort of like brain dump stuff.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
I'm there.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
And, Just Neil, right?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Yeah, I guess it's me. And just to be clear, like, well, no, naji, right?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Naji's on the call. I think he's on

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
I'm so sorry!

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
At least if you get it about NAZI. That's all good.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Naji, yeah, he's here.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Okay. Hey guys, Nash here. So a lot of you already know me, investment associate lead up more of the sourcing and selecting.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Here to support with connections, different stuff if you want to chat business. Have a breath of experience in a wide variety of areas more specifically like business development type stuff.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000
But the, yeah, I will be here if you need me. Just let me know.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And I'll pass it to Neil.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Right. Well, thank you. Naji for. Constructing this class.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
A lot of the work up to this point was him. So let's all give kudos to Najee for making this happen.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:17.000
He does a great job at it. So. Couple of things one everyone you just heard from on my side with my team Not only do they bring their own experience.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:26.000
But they have connections to dozens if not hundreds of other founders. That have gone through this experience that can help you.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.000
So just look at this team is not just the people who have the answers but the people who are connected to the people who could really really help.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
So each of us have enough familiarity with dope CEOs and founders that have been through the program.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:46.000
So I'm Neil. I can't believe it, but this is.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
I'm now passing what programs. Is this program 10 and 11?

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Yeah, he was double stacked, so we're hitting 10 and 11.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:06.000
That's unbelievable. Yeah, I hope this is our best yet. I think it will be because every single time we've done this we've done a better job at something.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:20.000
And we've maintained quality or increased quality on every other aspect of the program. So. Just know I'll just like remind you all of a few things that may have said when we had our offer call conversations.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
We're not perfect and we don't know everything. So we're not here to tell you all what to do.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:31.000
We're here to learn with you. We're here to, you know, leave ego at the door and be as humble as we can be to support you all.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.000
There's so many things that I think we bring to the table that will Positively impact the outcome and success of your businesses and your personal journeys as founders.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:50.000
But at the same time, like. Y'all are here to help each other. So there's so much that we're going to collectively take advantage of and I'm just I'm so excited and game on.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
There's a lot going on in the world. There's a lot going on and tech stars.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:05.000
There's a lot going on and all of you all's personal lives and that whole just wild world of chaos that is the founder journey is something that I just love more than anything.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
So thank you all for giving us the privilege and the opportunity to work with you. And to hopefully serve you in this experience.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
You'll learn more about me like some said in Tahoe for those of you who are coming.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
If you're not coming to Tahoe, let me just say. You might wanna reconsider that decision.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Because we because of the founders, the ones who came before you, the Oakland and San Francisco founders we did in the last program.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
They said you have to do 3 nights. Cause it was 2 nights. And then they were like, no, it needs to be longer. You need to spend more money.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:54.000
You need to give them more time because this was too much fun. And it's too important. So the reason we double down and invest it again in more time for you all to meet each other because every single time we've done it, the founders feel like it's just like a game changer for how connected they get to each other.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:02.000
So if you all want to truly get to know each other and become friends, having an off-site where you get to look at each other, cook, eat, hang out, go for walks, go for talks, get work done, do whatever you need to do.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Like it's a really, really nice experience. So that being said, if any of you all need support from us in some way to make that work, let me know.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:25.000
But I will emphasize that as something that will fundamentally, impact in a positive way your program experience because you're gonna get to know each other better than ever before.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
But it's always a way to make it work even if you can't make it, like we'll find other ways to clue you in.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:38.000
So, great. Let's see, I think I covered it. I introduced myself and gave other things, right?

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Okay, cool.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Yeah, yeah, and for anyone wondering about like news about tech stars or just the tech ecosystem since we have announced the new changes.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.000
We're going to get into all of that on the retreat. Where we have a kind of confidential tell-all.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Yeah.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Real like, yeah, no, I'm just this ask us anything just so you know like I think founders are surprised by how raw we're willing to get but like I'll tell you all anything.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:09.000
But it happens it has to be in the right context. So just know that like I will. I will, I share more with the founders and I'm comfortable sharing with any other.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Humans in the world with respect to you know all these things because you all deserve the raw's version of truth that we can afford to give you.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Exactly. So maybe that'll convince some of you to come on and retreat if you're not already.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Maybe all of you have already signed up to go. I haven't checked yet, so.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Alright, so we have, we're gonna do an activity at 1130 PST.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
So we have about 40 min now. To go through some of our expectations. Yeah, so that was our team.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
We'll make it quick. Yeah.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
So we're gonna run through every single section of this deck and we're recording. So we'll send this to you every single section of this.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Everything we're saying is led, completely out, late, completely out in our program handbook.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:59.000
So that is something that you're gonna get tomorrow. He is finishing the final details putting in some beautiful stylistic choices for you guys and then you'll get it.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:08.000
So it's really important to go ahead and read through that program handbook when you get it tomorrow because it'll lay out every single expectation in more detail than we're gonna cover right now.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000
I can't count how many times we get a question from someone. And when we ask, hey, did, did you read the program handbook?

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
And they're like, oh no. And we're like, well, it goes into a lot of detail there, but here's the short answer.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:31.000
So just know that like A lot of questions that you might have will likely be addressed in a lot of the documentation that we put in a lot of work to provide.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
So.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Yeah. And it's not super long either. It's a quick green. So we'll start out with our mission.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
So, Neil, I'll let you go.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Yeah, so the simple version of it, it texts are you all know we've been around for 17 years.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:51.000
I've been a mentor for tech stars for let's see, it's 2024, 14 years, so 2010.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Is when I first got formally involved with tech stars. 2,008 2,009. Knew about tech stars because, some students in a class that I was helping teach.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Ended up going into one of the very first classes. It was a company called Next Big Sound. They're actually featured in one of the startup books and stories that got acquired by Pandora.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.000
But so I Just so you know, I've been watching this accelerator thing. Happened throughout most of its life cycle.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:22.000
So, TECH SARS and Y Combinator are known as the pioneers of the accelerator model, but there's so many other ones all over the world.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Just know that like While we've seen it kinda go up and down with respect to the venture world and the future of startups, I think.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000
At the end of the day, if you are part of the right group. Meaning each program has its own identity, its own DNA.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.000
So the MD program team, the mentors, the composition, all have their own kind of variance.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:50.000
But if you choose the right one that fits for you and your style. That program and experience will be unique.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
And it will be beneficial. So we're our our commitment is to make sure that we do that for you.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
But at the end of the day, our mission is to help founders succeed in whatever way makes sense.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000
So some of you that means hands off, that means that we need to get out of your way, be helpful to you when you need us to be and let you do the rest.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Some of you that means the total opposite. Well, we're getting super hands on. We're getting into the nitty gritty.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:18.000
We're getting into the weeds and helping you figure out really complex problems. And we're we're designed and down to do.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000
All of that in the spectrum. So just know that it's not a one size fits all thing.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
The curriculum, if you will, isn't just everyone needs to do the same thing and be on the same page.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:38.000
There's a lot of diversity and variety to your respective needs that we're aware of. So our mission is to figure out the right formula and mix for you.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Okay, so what is their role in this?

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000
So yeah, your role as founders is, first and foremost to just be good stewards of, community in this program.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:54:02.000
So we expect everyone's full participation. We are iterating with feedback that we get so there are things that we asked everyone to participate in in the past that we're either making adjustments to or you know and we'll point out these changes.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:11.000
But at the end of the day, we need you all to respect each other. We need you all to, be open minded.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:21.000
I always ask for curiosity before judgment because people will disagree. You're all coming from different places in the world, different life experiences, different perspectives.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000
So that's a value-ad, but at the same time with so many different values and cultures clashing.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:36.000
You're going to experience, you know, a significant variance in different points of view. So, and then the last thing is just like, This can over be overwhelming.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:43.000
It can be all consuming. It can be a drag on your sleep. And your energy or it could be the exact opposite to all of that.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:53.000
It could give you more time, it could be empowering, it could be one of the best decisions you've ever made in your life.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:06.000
But a lot of that is up to you. I know when I was going through programs like this and experiences or even at university and you would hear people basically say Oh, I don't like that they do this or I'm not satisfied with that.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:13.000
And I always was perplexed with that like mindset because Any experience is what you decide to make it.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000
So tech stars can suck if you wanted to. It can be like not meaningful. It could be a waste of time.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
It could be a bad use of it for whoever decides that it's not a you know, priority for them.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:30.000
But if you lean in and you take it seriously and you trust us and you give us feedback as we go on anything that you want it to be that it isn't.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:39.000
We're down. Like we just want y'all to be successful beyond your wildest imaginations because we're equally incentivized for that to happen.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:48.000
So help us figure out what that is and just be honest and enjoy the journey. That's what I would expect of the founders.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Awesome. And if you guys have any questions, you can pop them in the chat and we'll answer them all at the end.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
So entrepreneurs in residents.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Yeah, this is cool. So this was a new like thing that happened in the past 3 years or so at Techstars where programs and I think I'll give credit to Austin.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
That's the one that I'm familiar with. Amos Schwartz far the outgoing MD.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Is no longer the MD there he left the company he retired after 10 programs but He taught me this and it's now widely adopted across many programs.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Where we basically hire people part time. Who are just as good, if not better than us, as MDs, meaning people who could otherwise be their own at B and MD themselves.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:40.000
And we pay them a little bit, not enough to afford them, but we pay them enough to make their commitment to you real.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:57:01.000
And they back me up in supporting you actively throughout the program. So that is very, very cool. It's a way for you all to get perspectives from multiple masters, if you will, with respect to entrepreneurs and people who have achieved some level of either mastery or or success as an entrepreneur or as an investor but typically an entrepreneur.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:19.000
And one example of that that I'm really proud to share is last program. The former managing director for Texar Chicago, the person who invited me to join tech stars Trojanakov served as an entrepreneur in residence for my program.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Which is like that's unheard of first of all, no one's gotten try to do that.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:29.000
But me, but There's people out here who are just super awesome, but they have other things going on.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:39.000
They're running their own venture firms or they're starting other companies and they're doing other things and we can pull in these awesome people to come in and help you on top of myself.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000
So that is a That is what to expect.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:53.000
That's awesome. And I believe We're trying to get Troy back for you guys.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Yeah, it's cool.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:01.000
So. You know, put a PIN in that you'll hear more later but. Having former MD is pretty much unheard of as entrepreneurs and residents and we've been able to have not one but 2 in the past.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Like if I'm Mace Windu, he's Yoda, you know what I'm saying?

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Yeah.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Like that's kind of dynamic for those who know.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Sure.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Okay, communication protocol. So I can run through this nil and then if there's anything I miss since you're looking at the him book, just let me know.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Communication protocol is kind of different for us. It's very specific to how Neil and I have crafted the program.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000
You'll hear different things from different programs. They kind of allow us to run it. How we see fit.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Some people run it on Slack, notion, different things like that. We run it all in one tool.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:47.000
It's called a base camp. It is a Chicago tech company. And you'll hear their story a lot in the things that we teach because we think that the way they built their company is a model for some sorts of things that we go into during the program.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
But their product is awesome. So you'll see we run the entire program on this tool. I will onboard you all on Friday.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:59:07.000
You have an invite for that and you'll have a an HQ where all of you can chat with each other and receive announcements from us and you also have an individual company project where you'll work on things like the assignments you've already done.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:14.000
All the other things that we work on with you directly, we'll get hands on. And the main key for this is that it's completely asynchronous.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
So this is why we're able to have so many international founders, so many founders who are parents or have other life circumstances.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:25.000
This is not a completely synchronous program. While we will have lots and lots of workshops on Zoom and see each other all the time.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:36.000
A lot of the work happens in the background asynchronously talking with our team, completing assignments and working on the business.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:46.000
So in base camp, it allows us to do all of those things as well as just have our team constantly be able to be in contact with you without having stand ups or anything of that sort.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:54.000
There is one exception. We have a direct stream to be able to talk to me, Neil, or any other team member.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Almost synchronously and specifically reserved for founders. As you can imagine, our emails are completely flooded by other people.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Yeah.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
We have lots of people trying to get into tech stars. We don't want you guys to get muddled with that.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
So we have reserved

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Goodish.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Oh, Hey, Eric.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Sorry about that. We have reserved. One stream of communication specifically for our founders and that is called Voxer.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:25.000
This is an iPhone Android app that any of you can download today on the App Store and it is essentially an asynchronous walking talking.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Neil, do you want to talk about Vox there a little more?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Yeah, yeah, I love it. So I learned this trick from David Cohen himself. David Cohen is the co-founder of Texars.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000
He's the chairman of the board. So he and I raised the fund together that I got help with the Lianna and Sophie on rising stars.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
We raised 8 million dollars during COVID. And I'm raised that from investors who I'd never met before.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.000
The way Cohen and I work together while we raise those funds. Is we didn't have any meetings.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Like we didn't have any meetings on the calendar where he and I spent any time together? We did it all on Boxer.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So I was like, bro, how do we do this? Like this is so cool. Like I get to talk to one of the most successful investors on Earth.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Like he was like an angel investor in Uber. For, perspective and then, you know, techsars and all this other stuff.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
He's really cool. You'll meet him. But I'm like, how did you very, very like cleverly finesse me into raising 8 million dollars with you without having to spend any time with me.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Like that is brilliant. So that being said, I love that playbook. The amount of time that we get to spend together talking to each other because of the systems that Liliana just outlined.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I think is magnitude, orders of magnitude greater than how a lot of other people and programs operate because We trust these asynchronous tools to make progress.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So now we're not playing Tetris with you all's calendars or ours. And instead we're always, we have a unique direct line of communication that you all had access to that no one else in the world does.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:01.000
So I think that's a really powerful and important factor here for how we're able to build such strong connections with everybody from all over the world.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Even if we're not always together in the same physical space.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Exactly. So we will have you all go ahead and add us on boxer maybe so far in front of you guys can pop our handles in the chat.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:20.000
But you guys will have all of this information in the handbook if you want to download it later. Is that everything for communication though?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah, I mean, I guess the other thing to say is like, I think we're also the only program that uses base camp.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Yeah.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Operate. So, so I know not everyone has their opinion about software tools. So I respect all of you and what you prefer.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:42.000
The reason we're using these tools is because we know them so well and we can make your experience better than any other place by utilizing them.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And we've seen so many other people struggle because they're juggling 4 or 5 different apps that everyone has to use to find information.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000
You gotta check your email for this and you gotta check your slack for that. You gotta go to notion for this and then you gotta go to Asana for that like, no, that's cool.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Like we just want one app where has everything. So you go in there, it's all there.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Simple.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
So after these pre-programmed prep weeks, we will cease to use email. So you won't get any emails from us.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:24.000
We do use email for external intros. So Nanji will use email a lot with you, Neil will, anytime that you're trying to have an intro to someone outside of this little group, everyone on this call, will use email, but for everything here internally within our program, base camp.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Text our central does not count for that. So every time they need something from you guys, they will be emailing you.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:41.000
So if you are one of the people who have been having tech stars, emails go to spam. You should definitely try and get that sorted because they will email you first specific and important asks that are outside of this program.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Yeah. And then I guess the last thing we say on the communication side here is what is also beneficial and the founders at the end of the program right before demo they tend to freak out about is wait what happens all this information like we just did all this stuff we wrote all these things we had all these ideas we had all these workshops all these sessions.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:08.000
You can go back and see it all. Cause it's available to you forever. So what's great is that now you have breadcrumbs of your entire program experience.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Documented in one place that you can always go back to and revisit. So that's the other benefit of all of that documentation.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Perfect. And if you have more questions about our kind of project management. Ideologies, things like that.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Like I said, I'm really interested in it. We're actually gonna have a workshop about it next week, so you'll be able to care a lot more about the in depth kind of ways we think about asynchronous communication and the power of having flow in your work and uninterrupted work and all of that.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:48.000
So we will save that. Weekly Expectations. So on the regular, weeks will be a little bit.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Unorthodox for the first couple of weeks. Traditionally, week one is its own sort of section where you just have the whole book thrown at you.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
You're gonna have a lot, a lot of workshops. I think I've told some of you on the offer calls.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Just kind of clear out your entire week one. So when you're going to be there in person with us, you will have some moments to work, but a lot of it is going to be put in workshops.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And the purpose of that is we want to give you all of the knowledge upfront so that you can start applying it for the rest of the weeks.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Week 2, half of that will be on the retreat and then the other half will be spent in some presentations.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:28.000
You'll hear more about this later and then weeks 3 and for a mentor madness. So after we get past that first month, things start becoming regulated.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Pretty orthodox so you'll expect a certain flow of the weeks once we get to like weeks 5 through 13.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
What you can expect will have round tables together, sometimes at CEO round table, sometimes it's the full program round table like everyone on this call.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:48.000
We'll hear about our week reflect on it, set goals for the week if it's at the beginning of the week.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
You'll have a weekly.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Quick comment there. Sorry to interrupt. We did get feedback about those roundtables in the past program we ran.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And the feedback that we got was the frequency was a bit high. So we're making an adjustment to space them out every other week instead of having them weekly.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
So that you all have more free time. So that's one thing that we did learn from directly from this past program that we wanted to iterate on.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So. If for some reason we need to dial it up or make more accessible, we'll do that.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:24.000
But from the clear feedback we got, we decided to reduce the amount of time we were asking you all to spend in those sessions.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Exactly. So always integrating when we get direct feedback, we'll also iterate in the middle of the program as well.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000
We see it as our own little startup. So definitely. Feel free to give us feedback and whatever works for you.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:45.000
So sometimes people do have things come up and as long as you communicate, it's completely okay to have to miss a session, stop going to a certain thing if it's not serving you, it's just all about communication.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So right now we're starting with the overall expectation that everyone will be at everything and then we'll work our way from there.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Yeah, you get into the habit of just giving us a heads up. Like letting our team know, hey, I'm not gonna be at this thing.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I've got this going on or I've got a customer call or I've got an investor.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Like it's all good so long as we're just being adults and communicating about it.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Yep. And we want you guys to get the most out of it too. So if there's something we do really feel like you should be at, we'll let you know if you plan to miss it.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Other things weekly that you can expect from weeks like 5 on our weekly KPI meetings with your EIR.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
We find tracking metrics extremely important at tech stars and this is one of the main pillars of things.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:34.000
We'll teach you. And then of course workshop. So you'll hear from a variety of our network as well as each of our team members lead workshops.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.000
So that'll be the remainder of your curriculum and then going into pitch practice and demo day prep in the end.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So that's what you can expect on a week to week basis. Was there anything else to hear?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yeah, I just think reminding everyone of the overall structure the first month is lay of the land mentorship you know, making sure that you all know all the basics that we alluded to during the application process that we take to a whole another level.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.000
You know during this kickoff of the program and then month 2 is like all right we take all those insights and everything that you learned and we execute.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So that could be sales, that could be building product, it could be both, it could be a bunch of other things, but we're gonna get it all done and get you a humming.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And then in month 3, that's when things get real about what the horizon beyond looks like.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Are you raising money? Are we? You know, boostrapping, are we?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Focused on, you know, customer development in a new way. Are you hiring? Each of you are going to be in a different state of what you realize you need after 2 months of this immersion.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:43.000
So once we know what that looks like, we get to work with you to figure that out. And then you kind of storm out of our program doing, you know, it's your company, so.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
It's go time.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Exactly. Okay. Oh, and that was program structure. Yeah, perfect.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Oh, I just gave it. Okay, cool. That was great.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Okay. Oh, it's also very important to note this is a hybrid program. So I mentioned this to a lot of you already.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:10.000
But weeks one and weeks 12 will be in person. Everybody who has not yet seen the pre-program update email number one, it's super important.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Demo day is going to be during week 12 to allow for the maximum attendance of investors because New York Tech Week is the following week.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:31.000
So we do encourage a lot of you to go to New York Tech week during week 13, but we'll also be around during week 13 to help you with post demo day follow-up just writing all of that influence from your big event and just helping you take advantage of it.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
So just to maximize all of the investors so that they're not all at the conference, we're gonna do demo day during week 12.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000
We have shifted back the demo day prep so you'll still have exactly the amount of demo day prep that we always had.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Yeah, couple more things on that. So one, that was new to us, just so you know, like a few weeks ago we found out, oh, snap, like New York Tech Week is gonna be big.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And we need to let the founders know ASAP that this is a huge opportunity for them. Not and especially for you all as tech stars founders.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Cause a lot of people are gonna want to get to know y'all because you all are in the Bay Area.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Unlike any other tech stars program on Earth. So you all are gonna be connected to in proximity.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:27.000
To more investors than any other program. In that respect. So when you go to New York, If you decide to go, which I think you should, That means that you are creating like plugs and access.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:40.000
On like 2 of the largest markets that you can from an investment standpoint, right? So that's a great opportunity for you all and I guess the other part is.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:52.000
We just announced that Texar's headquarters is moving to New York. And it kind of already has been there for us insiders like the past couple of years like our CEO lives there and basically opened it office and hired a lot of people there.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
So what's cool is like we're the Bay Area. We represent the Bay Area, this group.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:08.000
And then we've got headquarters in New York. So I think giving you all that inroads and access and connectivity is going to be a net benefit for those of you interested in building up your both founder and investor now.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
We've got a couple of questions here. So. Vincent, is your question answered.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
So, Neil, Vincent's, can't give in the move of tech stars to point out to NYC, is it mandatory to go to NYC?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Do you have a bit more context?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Yeah, sure. It's not mandatory at all. It's an opportunity. So not mandatory.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Not expected, but we suggest it. Highly suggest it because. It's just gonna be a massive concentration of both founders and investors and it's our home court as far as and investors and it's our home court as far as tech stars is concerned.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:45.000
So I think that's, to you all benefit to be a part of if you can, if you can manage that and swing it.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:55.000
But that's also why we move demo day a week ahead. Because we needed to make sure that you all had room to take advantage of that.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Will we be able to pitch at NYC Techweek? So that, yeah.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I don't know how that works.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Exactly. I was gonna say this is a completely like outside of Techstars event. So there's nothing that we're putting on there specifically or any specific like.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:18.000
In that we have, it's just a lot more that we think you guys should go. And we know you will not have the investor turnout that we want you to have if we have demo day during that week.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
So it's a lot more being aware of the event rather than it being something we're putting on or we have spots for anything.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Naji will probably be there. Nazi, I'll let you unmute if you'd like to speak on New York Techweek if there's any viewpoint that we're not getting at.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And nope, I don't have any particular viewpoints right now. But yeah, I, it is likely that I will be there.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Yeah.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Perfect. So that's New York and we'll get more info as program progresses, but this is just something to be aware of right now as we started thinking about looking ahead.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Perfect. So that's a hybrid program. There's one more week that we are optionally in person and that is week 5.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So weeks one and 12 are mandatory to be out in Oakland with us. Week 5, a lot of international vendors opt not to come in the middle of program.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:28.000
It's just very expensive. So we completely understand. But if you are able to join. We'll be streaming for all virtual participants if you are able to join week 5 is kind of a reset after mentor madness finishes and we can come back together we regroup we analyze all of the feedback that you got from Mentor Madness and then we figure out action item steps of how to move forward.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000
It's also a very sensitive time because mentor manners can be a little bit shaking for a lot of people.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000
So it's really nice to have that time together as everybody just went through a similar experience.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:50.000
That was that was very diplomatically worded. So I'll add more color to it because I think that was well said by the Leanna.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Mentor Man is things can get a little, real. So you'll hear from a lot of smart people and some of them are going to hit you at the core.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
They're gonna be like, oh man, I guess like you're gonna question a lot of things.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And some of you come out with full confidence that the strategy you went in with is the strategy you need to continue doing.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:22.000
But some of you are gonna get feedback or have people involved or you're gonna learn things or be questioned in certain ways that'll make you have to like do some real thinking about what the next move should be.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Because of that we have learned that it's super important to give you all an opportunity to reconnect.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.000
In person if you'd like. With each other with us to get that kind of support and to just make sense of everything that you learn because it is overwhelming.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:48.000
It is on it is a true information fire hose to meet with dozens and dozens of brilliant people and get questioned about every aspect of you and your business.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So it's a funeral aspect of every tech stars program. But I think the the difference is that the what you do with the information afterwards and that's why we facilitate that.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Awesome. And our commitment to you.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000
So as far as our commitment to you,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
We're not here to waste your time. There are so many different versions of the story about whether an accelerator is a good bet for founders.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Good use of your time. Good to give up the equity, you know, all of those things. But what I told you when I offered each of you a spot in this class.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Is that those formalities, the money, the deal, whatever, that's all well and good.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000
But at the end of the day, what everyone says. Consistently at the end of our programs.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Is the connection that they have with each other? Makes this more than worth it. So our commitment to you is first and foremost to make sure that that happens.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Your legions and connection to each other is what we will prioritize facilitating above everything else.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And then on top of that, each of you will have your own unique respective dates. So just making sure that we are lifelong friends and partners to you, no matter what happens with your business.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Is what you can expect from me. And then on top of that, hopefully. A bunch of y'all end up getting fantastic outcomes and exits and then we all get paid.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.000
That'd be great. I would love that. And I guess the last anecdote I'll share and this is the Techstar Chicago Laura story.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:31.000
You'll hear me reference to Chicago a lot since that's the program I came from. But, Techstar Chicago.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Has the top company of all time out of techsars from a return standpoint. It's a company that came went through the program 11 years ago called Trading View.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And one thing that was really cool. That happened with that class of companies is that as that company was succeeding They made room.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:01.000
For the founders in their class. To invest. So everybody won. Everyone in the class got to participate.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:10.000
In the most valuable company to go through tech stars ever. So I think that's really meaningful because those founders because they all knew where that was going and they saw.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And the founder was a part of the class and they were all helping each other and they still meet every month or every quarter to this day.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Whoever here wins ends up helping everybody win So I think that's a pretty cool thing to be a part of that you won't read about online, but I'm telling you here confidentially that that happened and that can't happen.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Just saying.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
So true. If anyone from our team wants to give any advice, I think this is a great time for it.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Sure.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
So feel free to just unmute but that is my big piece of advice every single time we do this expectations orientation session it's to get really close.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:55.000
With everybody that's on this call. Specifically your class members. Your class members make your experience.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Yeah, Neil? Where you gonna sit?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Also people, they hire each other too. So like let's just say like a few years from now things don't work out or you know you change strategies or whatever like some of you all want to work with the other person or the other company or the other team like there's all types of cross-pollination that happens when you have a tight, knit group.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Exactly. Did any other team members want to give an advice before they move on?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Jump in really quickly is to if there are workshops that you feel like you already know for instance they will be topics that some of you might have learned in the password since like financial modeling or KPIs and whatnot.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I would highly, highly encourage to still go. Because in addition to for 2 reasons. One is that I appreciate always walk away with something new.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Whether or not it's from the other co-founders in the room or from the workshop presenter.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I always walk away with something new. Then second is that there's always valid they can also add to the room as well because everyone's gonna be starting at very different points, some people might have.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Built financial model in the past. Some people, this is gonna be the first time. And so you guys are here.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:15.000
For each other as well. And I feel this, I feel like this is pretty special that you're you have 23 co-founders is one way of thinking about it.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:26.000
In addition to your own co-founders as well that are going through everything. I will simultaneously which I don't know, has this happened before because we had 2 programs before but it wasn't you know, same programs.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
The same.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I feel like this is. Is this the first? I don't know.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:39.000
This is the first of ours. Like we've never, we've never had. So much consistency across this size of the class before.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:47.000
So I think the network effect here is going to be even stronger.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Hey, anybody else before we move forward?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I mean, well, you know what, Leon, there is one other thing. And I think usually you are the one who says it.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Awesome.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:08.000
So I'll try to tee you up for it but it's kind of like We have a certain reputation, I think, as tech stars folk.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Like our program specifically.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Yeah, I do usually say that.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Like with our with our Yeah, our program has a rep like like Our founders show up to things and like they engage and like they make an impression wherever they go and a way that people go, you there's something about you all your founders.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So I forgot what you exactly say, but I know you've taken. Pride in this.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Okay.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Yeah. Well, I mean, we're recording, but if you guys just keep it on the, keep it on the deal.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Our programs are known amongst tech stars to be something special. And the founders that come out of it are also known to be something special.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And you will be able to tell as we bring back some of our alumni. It's just each of you were chosen for a very specific reason.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Many of you were chosen specifically for the types of people that you are, regardless of what company you're building, we chose you based on founders.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Yep.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And I'm not sure every program does so and it shows because our founders are always on it.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Always camera on, always engaging in the chat when we do work shops with other programs which you'll see we have some global workshops from David Cohen and other superstars like that.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:23.000
There's a very clear distinction on who comes from our program and who doesn't. And that's something that Neil and I and our whole team takes very seriously.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Yes.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
We really appreciate the standard that we've made. And we've chosen all of you because we believe you uphold that standard.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
So.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Well, and that's perfect. Thank you. And what I'll add is I think it's a very simple reason.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:46.000
We're just encouraging you to develop habits. And presence that should be reflected in the companies that you all are building and scaling.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:59.000
You're gonna hire dozens if not hundreds of people one day. And you're gonna have expectations of how they show up in the calls and the company sessions and the meetings that you have with them, the work you do with them, the way you operate.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:13.000
So it only makes sense for us to reflect that same energy now while you're in the process of building these great businesses.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Exactly.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Yeah.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
So I think that's like the fundamental like nature of that approach of just respect and presence. And it's a that's a hard thing for me to PIN down because I it's more feedback we get unless something that we're actively in like.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Asking of you, but there is something about this group that is always special. And this this group in particular will have its own unique characteristics on how to make that so.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Yeah.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:43.000
It's a mix of respect and thoughtfulness and we've already recognized that in the things that you have done so far and all the assignments and the way you communicate and just it'll continue.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:53.000
So when we introduce you to someone from our network, they will just know that because it's one of our founders, there's a level of dolphin that will come through with that and that will open so many more doors for you all.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Because it's usually people just wanna work with our founders which is awesome. So we'll go through some announces then we'll take questions.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
To do. So this week you are awaiting the pre-program update number 2, which is coming tomorrow.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:24.000
That will include the program handbook going over everything and more of what we talked about today. A class lookbook we're putting together or not you already put together for you guys it is confidential because you guys have not been announced to the world so that's just for you all to understand who your classmates are.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So keep that confidential and then pre-programmed prep week to schedule for next week will also come out tomorrow.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Remember to complete your class roster by Wednesday and complete your pre-work packets by next Wednesday. March, the sixth.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
So this week you'll get the program handbook, you'll get the class ruster in by one site and you'll also receive base camp access on Friday.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And I'll train you on how to use it. And then coming next week, again, the pre-work packet.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:57.000
So with that, let's go through some questions. And then we have an activity to do together.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Feel free to unmute or pop them in the chat.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
There's no way we answered everyone's questions without getting them. Yeah, there we go. There we go.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Vincent, let's go.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yeah. There we go.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Hey, Neil, Neil, I heard that you guys do poker. Is that true that you host poker?

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Yeah.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Around.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Where how are you all hearing about all these things? No, yeah, you're right. I, I actually do, like, hosting and playing poker.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Be careful. Sophie's really good. Chloe is learning. Killer Kate is kill a cake for a reason.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And Kate. Yeah, killer K will take it.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Yeah, there's some, there's some ringers on the squad that like playing poker.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Yeah.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Perfect. Looking forward to that in a Tahoe.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:51.000
And then not even Intel will do. We can play poker whenever I play poker and VR with founders.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
It's not a joke.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
We've hosted sessions in Google like, you meet like I'll do it man. Yeah.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Okay. Do you? Do it. Cool.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Okay.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I bought every founder of ER headset and we like did movie nights and like played poker and hung out with each other.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
It was fun.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Thanks.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Great question. Any other questions?

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000
What the only question was about poker? Where did I get? There we go.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Okay. Really quick, technical question. Where is the campus itself? I've been like trying to book our, you know, so just trying to get the proximity.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
You know, so just trying to get the proximity.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Sure. Yep, yep, so we'll drop the address in the chat right now and then we'll make sure you all have it.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:39.000
But it's right off of Lake Merritt in downtown Oakland. It's really, really beautiful.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Like it's a really nice like there's an outdoor patio. You could see the lake.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Like it's a pretty nice situation. So I'm looking forward to y'all seeing it.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Sure.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
And I also have like a not so tactical, more like travel question. So he's obviously right across from San Francisco.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Is there a food recommendation service that we can subscribe to. I don't know if anybody here has like a belly account.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I'm really big into like food, so.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000
So food? All right, Nazi. You better on mute, bro. So Naji is the food expert.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Yeah. I like food. Food is good. Good food is better.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
The, so yeah, if you want like Rex and stuff, I have like a bunch of flags.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I gave some of them in that guide mostly focused on like things that are relatively walkable or accessible from the office but if you want more far out things I'm happy to share and give some wrecks on what I've seen.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Yeah, you will hear from me.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Alright.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Another question for you, Naji. Parking situation at the office. That's not something I've experienced before.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Is it free? Do you recommend parking? It's Oakland. So

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Oh. For Ferona knows.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Yeah, they're within, I think I mentioned on the chat, it depends on what you consider near within one to 2 blocks, no, but within 10 min walk.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Yes. But we'll talk more about that. I can, I'm happy to just kind of take a screenshot and circle around.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Just big caveat though it's Oakland at the end of the day so Please be careful about how you take care of your card or leave anything behind and stuff like that.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.000
So. Yeah, I'm happy to send more information on that.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
That's right, yes.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
That's legit in the Bay Area in general too to see on no like you don't you people don't leave stuff in their cars around here because But yeah, folks will take what's in your cars.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Yes, including SF as well, including.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Let's see.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:43.000
I'll do that. But that being said, If it's just for the week, if you're coming into the office, there's indoor parking and there's outdoor parking nearby that you can pay for that's not overly expensive.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:57.000
So I would recommend that. If it's for the week if you're planning to be in the office more frequently you might want to figure out a more reliable like situation.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
100%.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Okay.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000
No, you mind if I add on that? Yeah, so being from Oakland. Your car don't get big in the hood, but it does get big downtown areas.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Yep.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
So like in And like parking lots, open parking lots that are not like secure, it will, they will break into your car.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:17.000
So like, within a day, if you have just road on your window, leave a note and say like, please don't break my windows.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Like it's that real. So, not trying to scare anybody off but like what Neil said like park in the parking lot please that's secure.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
So yeah.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Have a question.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
There.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Yeah, and what's cool is like, and just to be clear that he's wrong, like I'm from the South Side of Chicago, so I'm very familiar with a lot of things and To be clear, like, I like it out here.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Like, I mean, I'm, in Oakland and it's very, very nice and comfortable and legit.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
People just can't leave up in their car. That's like the main issue that I see.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Because you do, then someone's gonna take it because they want it or need it.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
It's just real. We just want you guys to be safe. So it's helpful.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Yeah.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Bob.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Yes.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Yeah.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Is there a BART station nearby, right? I know I would recommend parking further away and then Maybe like end of the line if it works for your commute and then enjoy that parking and then just ride bart on the way.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
You got options.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Like I used to live in Dublin. The best part was you're the first on the train.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000
You usually get a seat. Get some work done on the way in.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Nice.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Bigger parking lots.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:41.000
That's perfect. A lot of our founders have done that in the past. And I say Jala talking about not leaving things in the car.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:49.000
That's not a joke. So a lot of people think that we're just being like super stringent or something like actually do not leave anything in your car.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Melanie?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Yes, thank you. I just have a question about the in person session. Do you guys know when does it start like early morning or when does it stop so that we can organize around?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Yeah, we'll kick off right away. Great question. So right away, 9 am Tuesday morning, March twelfth, like you should be at the office.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.000
So we are giving you Monday as a travel date so that we can start right on time on Tuesday. So definitely take advantage of Monday as a travel day.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000
You guys are all be coming in on Monday so that you're there to start on Tuesday morning.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Okay, so we'd be 9 a. M. To like what in the afternoon.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Okay.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Pretty much you should block the whole day so our workshops are gonna be sparse throughout the day.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.000
You'll have off to do lunch. You'll have an hour or so to work in the afternoon and then we usually have evening activities, dinners, etc.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:47.000
So that's why I recommend just blocking the whole week. But you will have time in between to grab a phone booth, take a call, things like that.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And you'll see a lot more of the schedule in the coming days.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Yeah, Antonia?

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Okay, cool. Thank you.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Yeah, is it okay to bring other team members to the office other than our co-founder?

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
They say to have brainstorms, stuff like that. Work there. Okay. Thank you.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Yes. You can bring guests. You can bring guests in with you.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Excellent. Thank you.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Perfect. But only the full time program members will have key cards. So you can bring however you'd like and then you just have to make sure you can let them in.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Lisa?

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I was curious if it's if there's any other weeks where you feel like it would be beneficial to be there in person or is that really all up to us because it's all It's all online and We pick.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Yeah, that's a great question, Lisa. It is very variable because some of you may have a high concentration of like you may decide that you want to have a series of investor conversations or something like that, right?

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:55.000
So you have to choose that. My instinct? Would be maybe a little bit earlier, like the week before demo day.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:10.000
If you decide to come in like a week prior to get the lay of the land, maybe make some new connections, get situated so you're more comfortable because demo day tends to get pretty intense and everyone kind of gets stressed out and they're practicing pitches and meeting people and all stuff.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
So there's a lot going on there. So I would say the week before demo day probably would make sense.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Oh, thank you.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Let's jump to a question from the chat. Are the travel dates included in the dates given for April and May, or should we add a day before and after as well?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:42.000
So for April, I included travel. So I gave you the dates Tuesday through Thursday so you can travel on Monday and Friday.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:50.000
For May, that entire week is in person. So you will have to fly in on Sunday and then Monday through Friday we're in person because it's demo day prep.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000
So we can't give an extra day off there because all of those things are crucial to get ready for demo days.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:00.000
So you'll have to come in the weekend before. That was a great question, Belaria.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And then really quick one more from the chat. What time did the evening activities finish on the first week?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Whenever you want, you typically around like 8, 8 30 for some dinners if we have dinners with the partners and things but you're never required to stay so if you are tired or you need to go because you have other responsibilities you can not have to stay in the evening.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.000
All of our mandatory sessions will end by 5. No.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Hi, I'd like to, manage my schedule. Can I schedule next week?

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Yeah.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:43.000
You mentioned about the second week of the free week. Do I need to expect this kind of, the, time like this week or

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Yeah, that's a great question. So everything will be between 10 am and noon PST.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:59.000
So if you just block that time, just those 2 h, everything will be locked in there and then you can make sure that you can schedule the rest of the time for next week.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Great question. Alan?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Good. Thank you.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And if there's something you can't make, it's okay. Just let us know and we'll do our best to accommodate or record.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Absolutely.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Alan in the car.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Yeah, so, this question for deal and totally off topic. Well, we're road tripping to Cali right now and we're stopping by Chicago today.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Which one's better? Judy knows or P quots? Cause we're gonna try deep dush.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Peacocks all day pea clots. No, no doubt. Go get that pizza.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Best pizza. Let's go. You're asking the right questions. Proud of you.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Sounds good. Alrighty.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000
That was awesome. We have other things for you too if you have a lot of time. Just send us a box here.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Yeah, we got people in Chicago. That's like home court.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Yeah.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Oh, we're gonna be here from like 4 till 4 morning at 7 am, 4 pm to 7 am tomorrow so if you have any recommendation, for pm to 7 am tomorrow so if you have any recommendation send it over

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Alright.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Awesome. Okay, is it Mercedes?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Mucha.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Yeah, don't worry about it. It's mere chap, but I don't expect anybody to actually know how to pronounce Romanian words.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:12.000
So hi, I have a question. My co-founder and I are planning to relocate to Oakland for the entire period.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I actually live in California already and he doesn't but we were wondering for those hybrid weeks that are in between is, but we were wondering for those hybrid weeks that are in between, is there a place for us to work out of the textbooks that are in between.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Is there a place for us to work out of the textures that are in between. Is there a place for us to work out of the textures office or are we just gonna be at home or okay I see you're not in your head I'll let you speak

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Yeah, great question. Yeah, I wanted to add that earlier. Thank you for asking. And this is also for whoever was asking, I think Lisa was asking about in between.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:43.000
So the office will be open to all of you who are full-time program participants. 24 7.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:49.000
So you have your key card that you'll get in week one and you can get in there even when we're virtual.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Now that doesn't mean that the staff will all be there. So we had a lot of founders that just wanted to work out of there even during the virtual weeks.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:02.000
A lot of our staff likes to work from home. So when we're virtual, we won't always be in the office, but it's open to you guys as much as you'd like to use it.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And a lot of your fellow founders are planning to be there as well.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Another important expectation center for everybody here is the office is a continuous working product like press just so you know like We're still working on like furniture and accommodations and like details.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
There's a whole story about like how we got this office and what's going on in it.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000
We need new chairs. Like, you know, this is, it's like a startup office, like total just like.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Figuring itself out type of thing. So just so you know, it's not like some fancy we work or something like that.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000
It's literally like we're startup mode. Trying to figure out, you know, I spent the Sunday before program kicked off last time we ran our last Oakland program putting together Ikea lamps.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:54.000
So like it's just this is like super raw and real and fun. So just so you all know that.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
It's a lot of space.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:05.000
That being said, it is in a co-working space. So even though our office isn't complete, yeah, there are a lot of things that are available in the co working space like phone booths, tables, other things.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Yep.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Great view on the top floor that you guys can also access outside of our office. Okay, treat.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.000
So, are you all gonna be there during the, in between? Times like the schedule weeks.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:23.000
I will. So I will naji will, Ferrona will.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Yeah, we'll physically be around. All time.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
But you're

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
There is.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Okay. And why do you split the 2 cohorts? I was kinda wondering.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Yeah, yeah, sure. So that's a functional thing on the tech stars front. So for the JP Morgan sponsorship.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:54.000
They invested in like 12 classes at a time but we have 2 classes to run in oakland So basically we have a super class of 24 companies but functionally speaking there will be a technical bifurcation.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Of founder classes.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Great question. Okay, Sahil.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Yeah, thanks. So I, I think I saw this question in the chat from Melanie.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
But I'm just kind of curious about the difference in kind of what happens in the in between weeks.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Sure.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Like if we don't have a place to stay in San Francisco yet, so just curious about like the benefit of being there in person is there stuff that happens outside of the program?

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Is there networking events like that kind of stuff?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Yeah. Yep. There is. Yeah, there's always networking events like the Bay Area is the top is the capital of the world when it comes to future capital investment activity.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So it's up to you to decide to make that more worthwhile. Some founders value the ability to get back to work and just focus on what they want to execute on.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Are trying their hardest to build the strongest network that they possibly can from an investment standpoint or otherwise. So for those of you that want to take advantage of the Bay Area, we encourage you to stick around and do that, but we're not gonna require it because not everyone needs it.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Yeah.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
That makes a lot of sense. Yeah, thank you.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Perfect. I think we got through all the questions. For the in between weeks. Not she on our team goes to a lot of events and things.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:23.000
So if you are local, we'll be sure to send all of you the different events that are going on that if you're local you can attend.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
So there will be nothing put on by us but there are always things going on like Neil said. So right now, let's switch gears and get to know each other for the last 20 min.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:58.000
So Sophie's gonna pop a link in the chat. And, we will see you all in there.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
So to be clear, Leanna, they should leave this Zoom and join that one. Okay.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Yeah, I'll stay here till everyone's gone.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Does everybody see the link? Okay, see you in there. Hi everybody.
