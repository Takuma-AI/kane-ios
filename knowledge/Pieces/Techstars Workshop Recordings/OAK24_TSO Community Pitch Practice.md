### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: very good at giving their classmates pitch feedback, which is why I always think of them. Well, this is Andrew's first time coming back as an alum. But, James, we've had back multiple times. Because he was like Nelson in your group where giving feedback to the classmates that was really helpful"

> "Thomas Cirone: Thanks, Leon. Always a pleasure and honor to be here. Cyber hugs everybody love I have 40 year tech veteran. I'll spare you the I'll spare you the details. But I've been. I've been a mentor and occasional angel investor since 2,014. I've been involved with techstar since 2,017,"

> "James at Somnea: Ha happy to kick things off great job Valeria, and always fun to go first you set the benchmark. Yeah, I think immediately caught my attention with the 200 million. So that was great, I think great way to kind of pull me into the pitch. And I I think you did a great job of explaining the problem. On the user side, I think, where you lost me a little bit, was on the second half of the pitch. You kind of started talking about the competition a little bit"
