# Power of the Network - Building Strategic Relationships

**Workshop:** Power of the Network with John Hill  
**Cohort:** OAK23 (Oakland 2023)  
**Speaker:** John Hill - Techstars Evangelist  
**Type:** Network Building & Relationship Strategy  
**Tags:** #networking #relationships #fundraising #linkedin #mentorship

## Core Philosophy

John Hill's framework centers on a fundamental principle: **"Build your network before you need it, so it's there when you do."**

The most critical insight: "If your first connection with an investor is asking for money, you failed." This workshop teaches founders how to build quality relational networks that create warm introductions rather than cold outreach.

## The Techstars Network Advantage

### Network Scale
- **9,000+ founders** who have gone through Techstars programs
- **12,000 mentors** (7,000 active in the last year) - unpaid volunteers
- **23,000 investors** who have invested in Techstars companies
- Direct founder-to-founder connections are expected and encouraged

### The Open Network Principle
"All of you can directly connect with any Techstars founder in the network. You don't have to worry about authentication through anybody else... Every one of those founders have gone through a talk like this."

## Why Mentors Engage (In Priority Order)

Understanding mentor motivations helps you message appropriately:

1. **Altruism** - They want to give back
2. **Technological trends** - You show them what the world looks like 2-5 years from now
3. **Personal opportunities** - Board work, advisory roles, jobs at your company
4. **Qualified deal flow** - They want to evaluate investment opportunities

**Key Insight:** "Bucket mentors based on why they're doing what they're doing, and message appropriately based on that."

## The Four Affiliations Framework

Based on Reid Hoffman's research at LinkedIn, these affiliations move messages from first-degree to second-degree connections:

1. **Friends & Family** - 75% response rate (but limited networks)
2. **University Affiliation** - 33% response rate (1 in 3)
3. **Shared Work Experience** - 25% response rate (1 in 4)
4. **Professional Groups/Associations** - Variable based on involvement

### The Techstars Affiliation Power
"Founder to founder interaction seems to be complete for every 3 times, which means roughly 66%... just shy of friends and family. It is an absolutely amazing network."

## LinkedIn Navigation Strategy

### Quality Over Quantity Network
"I have 11,000 first-level connections... 7,500-8,000 are founders, which means I only have about 3,000 connections outside. Those are high velocity people who open doors."

### The Hidden Second-Degree Power
"85% of job opportunities through relational networking come from... who they know - connection of a connection."

### Three Lead Lists for Investors

**Lead List 1: Industry-Specific Search**
1. Filter by "Venture Capital and Private Equity" industry
2. Add location filter (e.g., "Greater Melbourne Area")
3. Search within results for your vertical (e.g., "e-commerce")
4. Identify warm connections through mutual contacts

**Lead List 2: Angel Investor Boolean Search**
1. Search for "angel investor" OR "angel investing"
2. Filter by 1st and 2nd degree connections
3. Add vertical keywords (e.g., "cyber security")
4. Add location filters as needed

**Lead List 3: Techstars Affiliation Search**
1. Search for "techstars" (finds ~31,000 profiles)
2. Filter by your city
3. Add your vertical/industry
4. Add specific needs (e.g., "investor", "marketing expert")

## The Give-First Email Framework

### Example Outreach Structure:
"Jack, building a company in e-commerce, originally from Melbourne, just happened to be at Techstars San Francisco right now. I asked Christian if he would connect me with you. It looks like you're doing something within e-commerce. I have some interesting insights based on the build of my company so far [THE GIVE]. My ask is for advice building this early seed stage company. We're trying to figure out how to navigate X. Believe your insight might be helpful. Would you be open for a conversation? [THE ASK]"

### Key Components:
- **The Give**: Insights into technological trends from your startup
- **The Ask**: Advice, not money
- **The Result**: Emotional investment that leads to qualified deal flow

## Four Ways to Build Your Techstars Network

1. **Cross-connect with cohort members**
   - "This should be a tree of trust"
   - Share what's working and what's not
   
2. **Connect within your geography**
   - Find Techstars alumni in your city
   - "Get coffee and commiserate"
   
3. **Connect within your vertical**
   - Find companies further along in your space
   - "They can help you navigate issues they've already faced"
   
4. **Connect with subject matter experts**
   - Identify your weaknesses (GTM, product, HR, marketing)
   - Find thought leaders in those spaces

## Communication Hierarchy

Most to least effective:
1. Face-to-face
2. Phone/Zoom/video calls
3. Email/text/DMs (11th place)

**Action Item:** "Your most important relationships - figure out how to get phone-to-phone, Zoom-to-Zoom, face-to-face."

## Memorable Quotes

- "I'm like Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption. I'm the guy who can get you things. Techstars is my prison yard."
