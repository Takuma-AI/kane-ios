**Facilitators:** Neal SÃ¡les-Griffin (Managing Director), Lilliana Robinson  
**Type:** Customer Discovery & JTBD  
**Tags:** #customer-research #jtbd #job-statements #interview-questions #basecamp-case-study #live-interview #screening-criteria

## Overview

This final workshop in the Understanding Your Customers series demonstrates job statement crafting in action through a detailed Basecamp case study and concludes with a live JTBD interview. Neal presents the four key jobs discovered through 15 customer interviews, shows how insights translate into marketing and product decisions, and provides practical interview questions for founders to use in their own customer research.

## Key Themes

1. **Working Backwards from Outcomes**: Start with the desired customer outcome and work backward to understand motivation
2. **Job Statement Precision**: Specific circumstances drive meaningful insights, not broad generalizations
3. **Marketing Language from Customer Language**: Use actual customer words to describe problems and solutions
4. **Product Features as Benefits**: Frame features around what customers want to stop doing, not what the tool does
5. **Narrowing for Insights**: Specific, narrow screening criteria yields more valuable patterns than broad research

## The Basecamp Case Study: From Interviews to Insights

Neal introduces the real-world application of JTBD through his work with Jason Fried and the Basecamp team, establishing credibility through their deep relationship:

> "He made the product that we're forcing you all to use for the program called Base Camp. He's done a bunch of other cool things and but he's been running that business for 25 years... He is the reason I got introduced to Bob Mesta, because at his office is where they were hosting these jobs to be done, switch workshops in Chicago. And that was my initial exposure back in like 2013."

### The Four Jobs Discovered

From 15 interviews with recent Basecamp customers paying $30-200/month, four distinct job statements emerged:

#### 1. "We can't keep working like this"
- **Hair on fire challenges**: Information being lost, overwhelmed by notifications
- **Emotional state**: Frustration, distraction
- **Trigger moment**: "There was a moment where they all realized that something has to change"
- **Most common job** among the 15 interviews

#### 2. "We can't mess up like that again"
- **Reactive response**: After screwing up with a client or making a mistake
- **Emotional driver**: Need to demonstrate structure and competence
- **Goal**: "I need to demonstrate to my client and to others that I'm not going to make the same mistake"
- **Social proof**: Show more organization to external stakeholders

#### 3. "This project isn't getting off the ground"
- **Momentum problem**: Something missing from their forward progress
- **Emotional need**: "They needed wind in their sales"
- **Action trigger**: "Need to get real or get serious about a project"
- **Basecamp as enabler**: Tool to create structure and accountability

#### 4. "How am I going to pull this off?"
- **Overwhelm scenario**: Looking at an enormous task like climbing a mountain
- **Emotional state**: Overwhelmed by the enormity
- **Desired outcome**: "You want something that's gonna help propel you to to progress"
- **Metaphor**: "It's kinda like putting on the ironman suit"

### From Insights to Implementation

Neal emphasizes the work required to reach this level of clarity:

> "The amount of work that's required to get to this level of clarity and distilling where your customer segments are, and how they stand is much more than meets the eye... and it's better and easier said than done."

#### Marketing Application

**Original positioning**: "Basecamp solves the critical problems that every growing business deals with."

**Language strategy**: Neal explains how customer language directly informed messaging:
- Used actual words from interviews to describe struggling moments
- Focused on what customers wanted to stop doing rather than what Basecamp did
- Created emotional resonance by addressing real pain points

#### Product Application

**Feature framing as benefits**:
- **To-dos**: Not "manage your to-dos" but "forget micromanaging"
- **Message boards**: Not "discussion forums" but "messy email threads being replaced"
- **Documents**: Not "file storage" but avoiding "documents and files scattered all over the place"
- **Always-on notifications**: Directly addressing "being overwhelmed with slack and hipchat"

Neal's insight: "What are we replacing with each of these components? And it's still true to this day... most of our company. For that matter, text ours manages information in a variety of places and struggles with that information management."

## Job Statement Crafting: The Working Backwards Method

Neal demonstrates the technical approach to creating job statements:

### Start with the Desired Outcome
> "One helpful way to approach this framework and this formula is to start backwards. So work your way from the expected outcome back towards the motivational drivers in the circumstance."

### Alternative Framework
> "Another way of thinking about this formula is problem, solution, opportunity and or desired outcome. There's a lot of ways to slice it."

### The Validation Process
Lilliana explains the upcoming W3 workshop application:
> "She's going to have you make an attempt at essentially doing this in a different way. and once you come up with what you think. The job statement is. you're gonna compare that to the data that you actually gather when you're conducting your interviews just to like basically test against it."

## Neal's Classroom Management Example

Neal shares his personal application of JTBD to building "Lantern 2" - a classroom management tool:

### Three Job Statements for University Professors:

#### 1. Pre-Class Preparation
**Job**: "I've got a week before class starts, and it's time to update the curriculum and syllabus."
**Insight**: "When I'm prepping for my next class... I wanna make changes based on what I've learned the last time. So I can have a plan. Stick to it going in each class."
**Metaphor**: "Like mise en place. So the notion is that, like I have all my ducks in a row"

#### 2. In-Class Adjustment
**Job**: "This part of class didn't go as planned. I need to adjust what we're doing."
**Challenge**: "When I'm teaching, and something doesn't go according to plan, I want to make an adjustment to the class in real time"
**Cascading effects**: "This will disrupt the syllabus. This will disrupt your course. Plan what homework you assign what the follow up needs to be"

#### 3. Post-Class Reflection
**Job**: "Did I teach a successful class today."
**Process**: "When I'm done with class for the day. I want to know what will well and what could be better. So I can make adjustments for next class and next time."
**Meta-learning**: Even Neal admits they haven't effectively implemented this feedback loop in the Techstars workshops

## Essential Interview Questions

Neal provides the practical framework for conducting JTBD interviews:

### Context Questions
- **"Who was with you?"** - Understanding social dynamics
- **"Was anyone else involved in the purchasing decision?"** - Identifying all stakeholders
- **"What were the alternatives you considered?"** - Competitive landscape understanding
- **"Why didn't you choose them?"** - Specific decision criteria

### Temporal Questions
- **"What was going around them that day?"** - Environmental factors
- **"What they were doing, recapping their day"** - Daily context
- **"Where did they start it? Where did they end it?"** - Full timeline mapping

### Contrast Questions
- **"What were its shortcomings before?"** - Previous solution failures
- **"How do you normally approach using or choosing a new product?"** - Decision-making patterns

### The Power of "When" vs "Why"
Neal emphasizes: "Those win questions that we had a good encore conversation... talking about the power of when, as opposed to why."

## Advanced Q&A: Real Founder Challenges

### The Business Model Challenge (Dotan)
**Question**: How do you approach JTBD when you already have existing customers and patterns?

**Neal's balanced approach**:
> "What we would traditionally say... is, don't go in with any preconceived notions and assumptions... However... my compromise is go in with what you think the job is... and if we are pleasantly surprised that you are spot on... All I'm asking for is a couple of weeks of effort to validate that you are spot on."

**Reality check**: "There has, and almost never. I don't think there's ever been a case where someone has done that and been exactly right... has never happened in in the history of my existence."

### The Founder Interview Challenge (Christy)
**Challenge**: Customers become complimentary when the founder is present, potentially biasing responses.

**Neal's solution**:
> "You can still get them to talk to you... Yes, there's there's a moment of ceremony where there's gratitude... But then eventually, you start to ask real questions and you start to get into what's going on in their life, and you realize that if so long as you don't talk about you yourself too much, or your business or your product, and you get back to them in their story. The situation becomes real."

**Ferrona's reinforcement**: "If you're doing it right, they won't even talk about you, or things related to the company at all. They're just gonna talk about their experience."

### B2B vs B2C Application (Doug)
**Challenge**: Different dynamics in B2B environments, especially B2B2C situations.

**Neal's framework**:
1. **Look for subset with acute need**: "Is there a sub group of people in that B to B situation where it does happen to be an extreme need?"
2. **Find the shining example**: "As soon as you find the people who... have a more acute need become the case studies and examples and the evidence to guide everyone else"
3. **Case study strategy**: "You're gonna basically share that story far and wide in in a deep in depth case study like way"

**Critical warning**: "Be careful, because the reason that a lot of founders end up not getting funded... is because you fall into the very simple status of a solution looking for a problem."

### Pre-Product Customer Discovery (Ale)
**Challenge**: Choosing between multiple adjacent competitors for research.

**Neal's guidance**:
> "Start from the desired outcome. What desired outcome are you trying to afford which ones of those competitors could teach you the most, because the their customers are in pursuit of the outcome that you want to also provide, but perhaps in a slightly different way."

## The Seven-Step JTBD Process

Lilliana clarifies the complete framework progression:

1. **Frame learning questions** (with Techstars team support)
2. **Create screening criteria** (narrow and specific)
3. **Find interviewees** (based on criteria)
4. **Conduct individual interviews** (with debrief after each)
5. **Analyze patterns** (taught in future workshop)
6. **Present full JTBD analysis** (synthesis and insights)
7. **Implications and prototyping** (testing and iteration)

### Critical Insight on Screening Criteria

Lilliana's engineering background brings analytical rigor:
> "When Neil initially told me... we're only gonna do 10 to 15 interviews. I was very concerned about the data set... But the reason that it works is because of this screening criteria. So you're making this very, very narrow set, so much so that the interviewee should be relatively the same person like theoretically."

**Common failure pattern**: "I've had some founders come to me and say I'm not seeing many trends, because all these interviews, their stories are like coming from all different ways... that shows me that their screening criteria was much too vague."

## The Fundraising Mindset Shift

Neal provides crucial context for how JTBD insights translate to investor conversations:

### Two Types of Founders
> "There's the founders who are like trying to convince us of something. And then there's the founders who are just sharing what they're doing, and they're giving investors an opportunity to potentially participate. My job is to teach y'all how to be in bucket 2 and not bucket one."

### The Positioning Strategy
**Not**: Reframing jobs to fit investor expectations
**But**: "Very deliberately sharing your actual business strategy in a way that alludes to deeper insights than what most people have available to them."

**The message**: "We understand something that most people don't... We're serving a very specific and deliberate group of customers right now, for this reason. But there's a much larger group of customers... that we know over time. We're going to appeal to as well, and we have a strategy to get there."

## Moving Beyond Personas to Situations

### The Fundamental Shift (Samarth's Question)
**Old approach**: "Should we kind of pigeonhole our persona into just cr lawyers... Or should we kind of target the broader generalist contract tech lawyer."

**Neal's reframe**: "I want to remove the notion of a persona from your vocabulary. First of all... instead, what we're trying to do is... rather than a category of a bucket that someone fits. It's a situation that they struggled through recently, or an action that they took to make progress."

**Lilliana's challenge**: "It sounds like you have a product that you know could be helpful. And you're searching for an audience to serve it, to which is absolutely the opposite of what we want you to get at."

### The Power of Narrowing (Snow's Multi-Vertical Challenge)
**Challenge**: Serving multiple industries with varied needs.

**Neal's Basecamp analogy**: "Do you think that's how they started?... They were web designers... when they originally launched base camp, it was for people like them... very slowly but surely went beyond that focused niche to broader segments."

**Practical advice**: "Those 100 customers that you're gonna get next aren't all gonna fit into 100 different industries or situations... you would benefit from directing your energy and focus to a subset of people who fit a more specific situation."

**The key question**: "Among the customers that you already have are users. Who do you want more of? And why?"

## The Struggling Moment Philosophy

Neal closes with Bob Moesta's fundamental insight:

> "The struggling moment is the seed for all innovation. Find where people struggle. If they're not struggling, they're not buying."

**Application to pitching**: "When you talk to people in the elevator, or very quickly... Try to focus on the struggling moment of the individual you're supporting. And once you identify that... these mentor conversations. You're going to have the investor conversations you're gonna have being a part of our program are gonna go a lot better."

**The contrast principle**: "Contrast creates meaning" - Another Bob Moesta insight that Neal repurposes for understanding customer situations.

## Live Interview Demonstration

The workshop concludes with Neal conducting a live JTBD interview with a founder who recently purchased flight tickets, demonstrating the questioning techniques and natural flow of customer discovery in real-time.

## Key Takeaways for Implementation

1. **Start with customer outcome, work backwards** to understand motivation
2. **Use customer language directly** in marketing and product descriptions
3. **Frame features as benefits** - what customers want to stop doing
4. **Narrow screening criteria** creates more valuable insights than broad research
5. **Situation over persona** - focus on circumstances, not demographics
6. **Validate assumptions** through structured interview process
7. **Build from struggling moments** - find where people are already taking action
8. **Present insights strategically** to investors as deeper understanding, not limitation

The workshop establishes JTBD as a foundational skill for Techstars companies, emphasizing that mastery comes through practice and that even established companies continue to apply these principles for growth and product development.
