## Overview

This introductory workshop establishes expectations and explains the Techstars "secret sauce" Demo Day format for the SF24 cohort. Lilliana and Neal cover venue details (Google Headquarters), timing changes, success metrics, and provide detailed analysis of exemplary Demo Day performances. The session emphasizes Demo Day as a springboard rather than a direct fundraising event, with success measured by meaningful follow-up conversations.

## Key Themes

1. **Demo Day Evolution**: From traditional 10-minute pitches to engaging 6-minute format that maintains audience attention
2. **Success Redefinition**: Winning means most follow-up calls that advance company goals, not direct investment
3. **Secret Sauce Format**: 1-minute pitch + 1-minute video + 4-minute scripted Q&A maintains engagement
4. **Expectation Management**: Demo Day is community graduation and networking, not fundraising guarantee
5. **CEO Evaluation Focus**: Investors assess leadership capacity and adaptability over specific business details

## Expectation Setting and Reality Check

### Modern Demo Day Context

Lilliana's clear expectation management:

> "The general expectations for Demo Day are that this is just a single day. It's not how it used to be in the 2,010 s. Where it was just the end. All be all. Honestly, it's seen as a lot more as like you're coming out into the community. You're graduating from techstars, and you do get this nicely recorded artifact that then you can use for fundraising customer acquisition all different things coming out of it."

**Market reality**: "But just the the days of just having Demo Day, and there being all these investors that are throwing checks at you is far gone... It's extremely saturated. So I'm sure these investors will have been to like multiple demo days the same month as ours."

### Value Proposition Shift

> "It's a lot more about the things that happen as a result of Demo Day than it is the actual day, and any sort of like amazing conversation you might have in the room at that day... however, we do have different ways that we make it special and engaging for the audience, so it'll still be an amazing time."

**The artifacts approach**: Professional recording creates lasting business development tool beyond the single day event.

Neal's reinforcement:
> "Just reinforcing that it's like, I think some people freak out about this and spend way too much time obsessing over it and worrying about it and think it's gonna make some like big difference in your business. And it isn't. So I just really want that to be abundantly clear. It's gonna help you, and it's worth investing time in. But it is not the answer to your problems, and it is not a proxy for your progress."

## Winning Demo Day Redefined

### Anti-Competitive Framework

Lilliana's cultural shift from previous toxic approach:

> "If you're a competitive person you are going to think about like, Oh, how do I basically optimize Demo Day? Maybe not in a competitive mindset, but just like for yourself. And I have an answer for you. Actually, it's different than what winning Demo Day would have meant when Eric was in the class that was kind of a toxic culture."

Neal's clarification: "The way it used to be was pretty intense, like they would stack people up against each other. They would compare each other in a way that was kind of like this person's better than this. Per, you know, like that kind of stuff... I don't know that, like we have better things to do than to try to pit you all against each other, to perform well at an event."

### Strategic Order Creation

> "First of all, the order that we make is has no ramification or or indication of what you guys are are like, like. Basically there's no stack rank, there's no best and last and worst. And then all of these different things. We design the order very thoughtfully. The week before demo day to maximize audience engagement."

**Engagement optimization factors**:
- Mix B2B and B2C companies
- Spread female CEOs throughout
- Vary industry verticals
- Balance pitch styles (humorous vs. serious)
- Rotate EIRs to prevent back-to-back appearances

> "So there are like a lot of different parameters. Neil and I take into consideration. We sit and we whiteboard it, and we like really think it out, and I promise you can analyze the list all day long. You're never gonna find like any sort of pattern of oh, this person's the best. This person's the worst. It's all about these different parameters of what will maximize audience engagement."

### Success Metrics Framework

**The new definition**: "What does winning Demo Day look like is the person who has the most follow up calls that contribute to their demo day goal after demo Day."

**Goal diversity recognition**:
> "Each of you will have a different goal. A lot of you are interested in boost trapping. That means that a lot of your goals are going to be about customer acquisition, maybe getting key advisement. Key mentors getting your name out there. It could just be about getting your presence known. In general. Everyone will have a different goal, and maybe your goal is fundraising, whatever that goal is."

**The networking multiplier**: "Having. Follow up calls from people, from meeting people, from getting introductions from the people you meet to other people that might be relevant. Because, remember, even if someone can't help you, they probably know someone who can help you."

## Venue and Logistics

### Google Headquarters Announcement

> "Venue. So where is Demo Day happening? I'm very happy to say. Thanks to Chloe's hard work, it's going to be at the Google Headquarters, which is really cool. We've actually never had a demo day at a partner space."

**Venue features**:
- Auditorium space for 200 people
- Reception space with "giant car in the middle" (DeLorean)
- Built-in tech infrastructure with dual screens
- Professional setup for high-quality recording

### Date Change Impact

**Major announcement**: "It's gonna be on Friday, December 6.th This is the major announcement I wanted to make here. It's not going to be on Thursday, December 5, th as I sent you guys when you got your offers, so change it in your calendars."

**Schedule compression**: "Well, one thing you didn't mention, Lily, I think, is important is like we always celebrate afterwards, and usually it's Thursday night. Y'all recover, and then we hang out Friday and like, do a bunch of stuff and like whatever. But now we're just gonna do it all in one night."

### Personal Invitations

> "You guys will be able to invite one to 2 people personally per founder. So if you have family or friends, you were hoping to invite, you can have one to 2, and you can also kind of like trade trade that within your team. So if a team member doesn't want to bring any, then you could bring 3 or 4 things it'll work like that."

## The Secret Sauce Format Innovation

### Genesis Story

> "I would say we call it our secret sauce, because it's something that Neil and I came up with. As we were brainstorming post Covid, how to do Demo Day, because we had only done virtual demo days due to the pandemic. And then in 2022, we were able to have our 1st in person Demo Day. But the old method was so tired."

**The engagement problem**: "People had been they didn't want to come anymore. If we were just going to do 10 min long pitches 12 people get on stage. They pitch for 10 min with a deck, and then they get off stage, and it's just boring. People didn't want to do that anymore."

### Neal's Strategic Innovation

> "I asked myself, like, why are we doing it? What is the point? And what do founders want? And one of the big things was either want to close customers or they wanna have conversations with investors. Those were the 2 main jobs. So I was like, Okay, well, why don't we just cut the like? The the mess of the pageantry of a of a fancy pitch that looks really good and just have that 1st conversation live on stage."

**The conversation acceleration**: "So the idea was, let's save everyone some time and have that 1st investor conversation, or that 1st customer call introducing yourself in your business and your why? In a meaningful way that gives you even more progress when you have that initial interaction with somebody that you actually want to talk to or share this with."

### Format Components

**3-Part Structure (6 minutes total)**:
1. **1-minute product video** 
2. **1-minute elevator pitch** (no slides, spotlight on CEO)
3. **4-minute Q&A with EIR** (with one enhancement slide)

**Flexible ordering**: "You can choose the order of these 1st 2. So some people do their product. Video. First, st some people do their pitch first, st I would say the majority of people do their pitch first, st"

**Exception cases**: "Only has the exception of if your product is kind of hard to explain, or if it would be distracting to hear the pitch without seeing the product like if people would be wondering. For example, we had a company making batteries for drones."

### The Scripted Q&A Reality

> "To be clear. This QA. Is scripted, it will not seem scripted. A lot of people are surprised to learn it's scripted because you will practice being supernatural, but it is scripted. So you guys are not being asked anything on the spot. You will memorize your answers."

**The Oprah style**: "Then your Eir comes on stage and you sit down and have what I call like an Oprah style. QA. Where we have like 2 talk show chairs, and they'll ask you questions."

### Industry Adoption

> "And now I would say, 6 or 7 different techstars programs have consistently done our format for the past couple of years, which is really cool."

**Validation results**: "It was a huge success. So not not only did an increase audience, participation or audience engagement, people were not on their phones. They're paying attention. They're staying till the end. They're asking amazing questions to the founders in the post networking hour. All of those things were fixed that were kind of issues with Demo Day before."

## Strategic Philosophy Behind Format

### Confidence Building Approach

> "This is kind of what Neil was saying. The whole idea before, both behind the format is, we want to arm you with confidence. clarity, and real skills on articulating your business by answering questions. So a lot of you are kind of uncomfortable talking about your business."

**Skill development focus**: "This is going to get you extremely comfortable with it, articulating your business, answering the hard questions because we're not just gonna let you have softballs. They're gonna be difficult questions. You're gonna practice how to answer them. And you're gonna have the confidence to do so."

### Not a Fundraising Event

> "So I think we've been pretty clear on this. But Demo Day is not a fundraising event, so a lot of people might launch their rounds at Demo Day. But I would say, if you are planning on fundraising, you should not consider Demo Day as a factor at all."

**Mentor Madness comparison**: "If anything, you should see it as like a second mentor madness where you may make some connections that may lead to funding."

## Example Analysis: Cicada (B2B Music Platform)

### Opening Energy Excellence

**Audience engagement strategy**: Mircea opened by getting the entire room to sing, creating immediate connection and demonstrating his product's core value proposition.

**Key strengths identified**:
- **Energy and confidence**: Used full stage space, power pose presence
- **No filler words**: Clean, practiced delivery
- **Product embodiment**: Actually used his platform during Demo Day setup
- **Authentic personality**: Suited his bombastic, musical founder persona

**Lessons for founders**:
> "Yeah, it showed a lot of confidence, right? He wasn't trying to like shrive into himself. So that's something you guys should all be thinking about is like a power pose."

### Strategic Integration

> "He was actually playing live music as people were walking in before Demo Day started. So he was like. He was really thoughtful about how he wanted the entire experience of Demo Day to be for him and his business, and we ended up using his platform actually facilitate Demo Day, too."

## Example Analysis: Stigma (B2C Mental Health)

### Emotional Storytelling Mastery

**Background context**: Ariana's film school background enabled sophisticated storytelling for mental health platform.

**Opening impact**: Direct quote from community member about suicidal ideation, immediately establishing emotional stakes and product necessity.

**Key success elements**:
- **Balance of emotion and business metrics**: Google award, community doubling
- **Real-world comparison**: NerdWallet analogy for business model validation
- **Customer testimonial inclusion**: Authentic community member voice
- **Proper pacing**: Controlled delivery allowing information to land

**Areas for improvement**:
- **Nervous energy**: Voice shakiness, clutching jacket
- **Stage presence**: Physical tells of anxiety despite content mastery

**Learning for cohort**: 
> "I challenge each of you to find an emotional pull that can get the same kind of essence that is in this pitch... there is actually emotion in most of your businesses. But what she's saying is that it's less apparent or overt."

## Example Analysis: Zest (B2C Cooking Education)

### Combat Q&A Excellence

Neal's analysis of the most confrontational Q&A session:

> "That is by far probably one of the more combative eir conversations that we've ever had as a QA. Most of them are a lot more playful and complimentary in a way. But I like that one the most. And the reason I like that one the most is, it sounds most like what those tough investor calls sound like."

### Strategic Skepticism Handling

**Virality challenge addressed**: EIR questioned reliance on viral content as unsustainable business model.

**Jake's response strategy**: "Yeah. So virality is not our strategy... We now know that 20 posts a week across platforms with a proprietary blend of trending and unique content will yield 1,200 organic downloads. Now there is viral upside there. We do outperform that. But it's certainly not what we've modeled our business around."

**Competition differentiation**: Rather than viewing food influencers as competitors, positioned them as demand generators for Zest's educational approach.

**Monetization defense**: Compared to successful education apps (Duolingo, Headspace) and positioned cooking as wellness category where people pay premium.

### Performance Excellence Factors

**Natural conversation flow**: Despite being scripted, Jake paused and appeared to think through responses, creating authentic interaction.

**Audience targeting precision**: Content designed specifically for investors who understand education app metrics and business models.

**Strategic redundancy**: Repeated key metrics across pitch and Q&A to ensure investor retention of core data points.

## Video Production Guidelines

### Tier Structure

**Tier 1 - $0 DIY**: "You can go completely handmade like you can just make it for $0 on canva. A lot of people do that. It's totally fine some people have, like their sister or their roommate, do the voice over."

**Tier 2 - $250-500 Fiverr**: "You make all the assets you want, but, like someone puts it together on fiber, I would be careful. Don't have any sort of like AI voice. It's super annoying. Have an actual voice over as much as you can."

**Tier 3 - $500-1000 Professional**: "That would be only if you want to invest a few $100 in it, because you might want to use it on your website, or you might want to use it for customer acquisition you. This video has other uses than just using it for Demo Day."

**Quality control promise**: "I will say we will tell you if it's bad, so don't worry about that like there have been times that we go... sometimes in the approval session, someone will show their video and maybe they didn't want to invest too much time in it, and I just tell them this isn't going to be acceptable for Demo Day."

## EIR Selection and Collaboration

### Selection Process

> "How? How is it selected which Eir interviews us." - "They pick you."

**Mutual investment benefit**: "That way. Every single person is with an Eir who wants to invest their time into that pitch. Then being excited about helping you is the most important."

### Relationship Management

> "So all the more reason to have really good decorum. And and and you know, bedside manner with your eirs like you gotta be cordial with them. You gotta be timely. You gotta communicate. Well, you gotta be respectful. You gotta follow through on your commitments with them, because it will matter on stage."

### Preparation Timeline

**Storyboard sessions**: Week 9-10 for product demo walkthrough with Lilliana
**Practice intensification**: Multiple pitch practice sessions with Troy, Kevin, alumni mentors
**Q&A crafting**: EIRs and Neal collaborate on question development
**Approval deadline**: Monday before Demo Day for final approval

## Investor Invitation Strategy

### Pipeline Building Requirement

> "So the one thing you do need to do you don't have to start crafting your pitch yet until Troy and I talk to you next week. But start building your investor pipelines now so that we can invite them."

**Invite timing**: "We will do invites to your list of investors... We'll start sending invites in a 2 to 3 weeks."

### Goal-Oriented Invitation Lists

> "We will do invites to your list of investors, and it doesn't have to be investors. It's whatever will contribute to your goal... If you're interested in b 2 b customers, a lot of people invite potential customers to demo day people from those companies to come and see what they're all about."

**Automatic invitations included**:
- All Mentor Madness participants
- Week 1 mentor event attendees  
- Alumni network connections
- Techstars community members

## Streaming vs In-Person Strategy

### Anti-Streaming Philosophy

> "We. We've always decided against streaming because it makes people not show up. So the people at Techsars who do a demo day that's also streamed. We realized, like 30 to 50%, just opt for the virtual. But then they don't get the numbers on their actual stream."

**Attendance optimization**: "But then, when each of you get your individual 6 min video to send, that's really helpful to send afterwards to people who missed it. So that helps, but it also forces people to show up."

Neal's attendance philosophy: "You had to be there."

## The CEO Evaluation Meta-Game

### Beyond Business Details

Neal's critical insight about what investors actually assess:

> "There's 1 other underlying really important factor with everything you've seen so far. which is, it's not actually all the details of the business. And what's being said? It's how we feel about the CEO and their capacity to lead and pivot and run this business."

**Adaptability assessment**: "Do we think that this person is gonna figure it out because what they're saying now is probably gonna change next year? I'm saying that as an investor. Right? I know better than to think that what I'm seeing now is what it's going to be forever."

**The fundamental question**: "So I'm going to my I'm asking myself. Is this the kind of CEO that I'd be willing to place a bet on because they seem like they demonstrated that they're able to adapt and figure things out. It's ultimately a CEO evaluation. For 6 min."

## Traction Reality Check

### The Non-Negotiable Foundation

Lilliana's direct message about business fundamentals:

> "You're realizing. Fabio is like, there's a reason that we're in week 7 showing this to you guys like, oh, it's really important to have traction to show like we always keep saying like, it's probably like a broken record with the 2 of us saying it. You need to build a good business."

**No storytelling substitute**: "You either have good traction that you can share or you don't, and having minimal traction that you want us to help you like storytell. That's okay. But when you have nothing, we can't really make it something."

### Sizzle vs. Steak Framework

Neal's balance guidance:

> "So sizzle versus steak. So the idea is that when you have sizzle, that's like presentation. that's like, Oh, wow! Look at that like it looks really cool, but where's the meat? So so there's there's steak pitches which like to have the substance, and then there's sizzle pitches which don't have any substance, but like have a lot of presentation."

**Bay Area warning**: "There's a nice little happy medium that will try to help you strike. But some a lot of companies, especially out here in the bay are all sizzle."

## Performance Psychology and Authenticity

### Monday Morning Quarterbacking Warning

Neal's humility reminder:

> "Just empathize for a second and realize like it's gonna be so easy for you to watch and judge someone else's pitch and go. Oh, I wouldn't do that, or that was not good, or they were nervous about this... But then I'm gonna put it back on you, and then when we see you get up there and do it, that's when the real work comes out."

### Authentic Conversation Technique

Lilliana's guidance on scripted naturalness:

> "The real. The reason everyone thought that was real was because he actually took time, and he was almost thinking about his answers, which, even if they're memorized, you guys can still do. You can think about what you're saying, so that it's coming off extremely naturally."

**Avoiding middle school play syndrome**: "It should be actual thought that goes into it. Real emotion like you're really telling these people your answers. You're not just rattling off something that you prepared. This is the time to actually say it. So take your time."

## Movie Trailer Philosophy

### Information Management Strategy

> "You guys are gonna want to put the whole kitchen sink into these 6 min, the 1 1 and 4. And you just can't. You need to think of it like a movie trailer. The whole 6 min should be a movie trailer where you're just wetting the appetite of the audience so that they can then dig in more."

**The breadcrumb approach**: "You're like Hansel and Gretel, dropping breadcrumbs."

Neal's clarity: "The job is to get the right people that you want to reach with this, to talk to you and be curious, and to get to know you better."

## Key Takeaways for Implementation

1. **Reframe expectations** - Demo Day is springboard for relationships, not funding guarantee
2. **Focus on follow-up goals** - Success measured by meaningful conversations that advance objectives  
3. **Master the secret sauce format** - 6-minute structure maintains audience engagement better than traditional pitches
4. **Build real business fundamentals** - No amount of presentation can substitute for genuine traction
5. **Prepare for CEO evaluation** - Investors assess leadership adaptability over specific business details
6. **Embrace scripted authenticity** - Rehearsed Q&A should feel like natural conversation through practice
7. **Target specific audiences** - Design content for investors, not general entertainment
8. **Use movie trailer approach** - Tease compelling elements without revealing everything
9. **Start pipeline building early** - Strategic invitation lists aligned with company goals
10. **Practice until natural** - Intensive preparation enables authentic performance under pressure

The SF24 format walkthrough establishes clear expectations while providing concrete examples of excellence, preparing founders for the intensive preparation period ahead while managing expectations about Demo Day's role in their broader business journey.
