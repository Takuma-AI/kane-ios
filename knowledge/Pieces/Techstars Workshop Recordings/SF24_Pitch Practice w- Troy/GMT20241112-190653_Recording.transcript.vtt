1
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:09.349
Lilliana Robinson: Monica, why don't you go first? st Since you have a hard stop, everyone else. You can drop your names in the chat, and we'll just do a volunteer queue.

2
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.951
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, can you hear me?

3
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.800
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay.

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:39.879
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): it takes 10 years and 1 billion dollars to get a new drug approved by the FDA. However, once the drug is approved, it starts creating revenue for small pre-revenue pharma companies. The 1st drug approval is existential for large pharma companies. One drug approval can lead to the addition of 250 billion dollars of market cap, as happened with Eli Lilly recently, the longest and most expensive component of drug

5
00:00:39.880 --> 00:01:02.969
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): is a multi-stage clinical trial process. As we increasingly test drugs in complex rare diseases and specific patient populations. The clinical trials themselves are only getting longer and pricier. I'm Monica Roy, founder of Seascape clinical. I worked in Pharma for 20 years, so know the space well. My company's Sas platform automates, the entire clinical trial

6
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:17.859
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): from workflows to reporting. To compliance. This leads to faster trials and yes, faster drug approvals. Global trial spend was 80 billion dollars last year. If you'd like to help make the spend more impactful. We invite you to invest in us.

7
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:28.600
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that was 1, 0 1. I loved your pace. I forgot to say Troy. At this point. We do have objectives for Demo day as a whole. Would you like them to share it with you?

8
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So what would be great would be, and are we just doing the 60Â min pitch? The 60 second pitch

9
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): today?

10
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.000
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, but they do have ideas for the others.

11
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:51.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So it would be great if, before you started. Say the objective of my pitch of the order in which you're going, and what the objective of each section is would be helpful. But, Monica, I thought that was very good. The the piece that

12
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.489
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the only piece that I'd question about

13
00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:02.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it was interesting. So let me just go through my thought process. It felt a little long in the middle, like, yeah, I get it. Drug. This is expensive and time consuming.

14
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But then you.

15
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:17.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): when you said we have the Sas platform that makes it less expensive and less time consuming. That was sort of the payoff like, oh, that thing that I got hit over the head with 10 times. That's what you're doing.

16
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I thought that was good.

17
00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:25.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Your lab. What was your last sentence? There was a word in there that was a little awkward for me.

18
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.960
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Oh, if you'd like to help make the spend more impactful, we invite you to invest in us.

19
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:42.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, that that didn't hit for me like I feel like you just did. You know a a gymnastics routine on the uneven bars? And then you went to hit the landing, and you kind of just blew

20
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like that wasn't a punchy landing. I want you to have a punchy landing make the spend more impactful.

21
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't think that's the job to be done right. Isn't the job to be done that

22
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him): your

23
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him): software? I'm picturing

24
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that your Sas software

25
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): reduces the time to market, reduces the expense of managing the process so we can get

26
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): drugs faster

27
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): at a lower cost.

28
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Is that right?

29
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.689
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, that was often for investors like, Hey, do you want to be part of changing drug development for the better kind of.

30
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So imagine if you closed with something like, if you want to help

31
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him): better drugs come to market faster at a lower cost. Come, see me.

32
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.510
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay.

33
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right cause. That's really what you're doing. You're helping drugs come to market

34
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): better at a lower cost. And, by the way, if they believe that they're like, oh, all the big companies are gonna want this thing.

35
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because if they can do it faster to lower cost, they're gonna want this thing. So you're kind of reinforcing the value proposition.

36
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.230
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, thanks.

37
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.490
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I'll change that.

38
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him): No, I thought that was good. Think about. Listen to the recording, and think about like was the beginning a little too long.

39
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like. Where cause you repeated how long and costly and long and costly. But maybe you know what? That's the pain. Here's the payoff.

40
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We're solving that problem. Maybe it's worth it.

41
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.010
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay. Thanks. Yep.

42
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.779
Lilliana Robinson: Do you want to share what the purpose of each of your sections are, Monica, to give some context?

43
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.410
Lilliana Robinson: I want each of you to serve. So what's the objective of 3? And which one's going? 1st picture video.

44
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:36.270
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, I think pitch will go first.st Video gets into more technicalities of the product. But the purpose of this was just to attract investors, not trying to approach clients or anything like that.

45
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:46.550
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): So just to appeal to investors, show them the size of the market. Show them that this is a real pain point, and that our solution solves something, a problem that's a gating revenue.

46
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay?

47
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then what are you doing with the debt? With the

48
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): video.

49
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.199
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): But the video, it goes like one level video.

50
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:08.870
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, so it's like one level below to show a little bit more of the specific benefits that the client can experience without getting too technical. But exactly how we make things faster, like at a higher level.

51
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So

52
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:22.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him): let me try to say this differently, we're gonna do the video first, st then the sorry we're gonna do the pitch first, st then the video, then the QA in the video, we're trying to

53
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): communicate to investors that this is a really big problem with a lot of money behind it.

54
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and that we have a solution that makes it

55
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him): faster and less expensive to come to market

56
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): with the video, we want to show them 3 reasons that this actually helps them

57
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him): come to market faster and less expensively.

58
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.450
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): It'd be really concrete. Yeah.

59
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And in the Q&A,

60
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:55.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we have a series of common objections that we get that we're gonna sell into so that they walk away, thinking, wow, this is someone I want to talk to.

61
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.940
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yup, exactly. That's a plan.

62
00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Great.

63
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him): all right. Who's next?

64
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.289
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, let's move on to Dave. Evil genius.

65
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.770
Dave Scott: Oh, hello! Hello! Hello!

66
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.420
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, Dave, start by answering the questions I put in the chat.

67
00:06:13.147 --> 00:06:14.610
Dave Scott: Yeah, hey, joy?

68
00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:29.439
Dave Scott: So I'm gonna start with the script then head to the video and then go to the Q&A the script is really sort of an overview focusing primarily on the the pain points and the size of the industry. And so.

69
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm gonna ask you guys to say this differently. So I don't want to know what it is.

70
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I want to know what you want to achieve with it.

71
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So the objective of the

72
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): pitch is to

73
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right. I want to understand the objective of each section.

74
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And I want you thinking about that, because I think that will help you do a better job if you understand what the outcome you're trying to drive is

75
00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:03.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right. So, as an example, people say, I want to use the video to show people my, how easy my product, I want to show pro my product like, no, that's not an objective show. Your product.

76
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:15.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like the objective, may be to show that it's an easier product to use than the competition and objective may be to show that it has deeper like. There has to be a success objective that the audience will be like, oh, I get it light bulb.

77
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:24.600
Dave Scott: Well, I want them to walk away obviously enthusiastic about my business, but I think the 3 things I want them to take away are the size of the industry.

78
00:07:25.152 --> 00:07:28.260
Dave Scott: the pain that we're solving, and the traction that we've had.

79
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Awesome. So your pitch is size of industry, pain that you're solving and traction. You have.

80
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

81
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.659
Dave Scott: And then what do you.

82
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Doing with the video.

83
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:48.830
Dave Scott: Yeah, the 1Â min video is really focused around the customer journey. Because I want to really show a day in the life of how a customer is actually using the product because I want them to walk away and understand how

84
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.989
Dave Scott: intense my community is.

85
00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:55.810
Dave Scott: And how important the community is to the whole success of the business.

86
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:08.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So the second part was more important to me than the first.st So the video is gonna showcase how intense this community is and how they will get behind a product like this and drive it forward.

87
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.332
Dave Scott: Yeah, and also sort of prove how this is gonna become a viral

88
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:21.119
Dave Scott: a viral growth business. By by the way, that this business interacts. And by the way, my customers interact with my product.

89
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay. And then what are you doing with the QA. What's the biggest thing you need to accomplish in the QA.

90
00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:26.986
Dave Scott: So

91
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:33.039
Dave Scott: one is, I'm double downing on the intensity of the community.

92
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.880
Dave Scott: I'm really focusing on venture sized returns, because that's a big

93
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:44.730
Dave Scott: issue that I've had with a lot of my pitches so far. Is is this a hobby business, or can it get to picture size? Returns

94
00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:57.030
Dave Scott: and then my, my ask is going to be focused around, obviously for fundraising. But then, also, really just like recruiting for the community. I'd love to hear people's personal stories about how they've interacted with this hobby

95
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.130
Dave Scott: themselves or someone they know.

96
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Got it

97
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): all right. Let's hear it.

98
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.490
Dave Scott: Okay.

99
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:14.059
Dave Scott: Thanks to shows like stranger things, tabletop role-playing games like dungeons and dragons, are as popular as ever.

100
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:23.699
Dave Scott: Over a hundred 50 million gamers in an industry growing faster than video games. Sit down each week with friends and family to throw dice.

101
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.179
Dave Scott: But then Covid changed the way. This 50 year old game was played

102
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.240
Dave Scott: forcing people to play it online.

103
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.069
Dave Scott: Running an online game can be painful.

104
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.740
Dave Scott: That takes 4 more technologies just to pull off.

105
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.000
Dave Scott: I'm Dave Scott, founder of evil genius games

106
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:46.300
Dave Scott: a single platform for building and playing tabletop Rpgs with your friends.

107
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.609
Dave Scott: family, and fellow gamers.

108
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:58.529
Dave Scott: Our platform allows players and their friends to build online adventures or play professionally made adventures based on popular movie franchises.

109
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.119
Dave Scott: Today we have over 35,000 customers

110
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.180
Dave Scott: who have left over 100, over 1,005 star reviews for our games.

111
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.769
Dave Scott: and we're a path on a path to generate 2 million dollars in sales.

112
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:18.230
Dave Scott: We believe that we've created the perfect solution to make stranger things feel more familiar than ever.

113
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.150
Lilliana Robinson: 5, 1 0, 5.

114
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:32.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, I think it's good. I think you have the opportunity to clarify some things. So let me give you a concrete example. You said on the path to 2 million dollars in sales.

115
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:40.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Do you mean 2 million dollars in arr? Do you mean 2 million dollars in sales for a year. What do you mean by that.

116
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.850
Dave Scott: I mean for 2024.

117
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So then, let's add.

118
00:10:45.870 --> 00:11:08.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, we're on track for 20. And you're gonna we're on track to end the year with 2 million dollars in sales, like. The reason, I say this is that some entrepreneurs will do things like we've had a total of $500,000 in sales, and it turns out it's over the last 6 years. Right? You might also, if your sales are increasing, are you? Do you have recurring revenue? Are these subscriptions.

119
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:08.950
Dave Scott: No, no.

120
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him): One time, but they're increasing month over month.

121
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.860
Dave Scott: No, not necessarily.

122
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Not necessarily okay. What do you think your run rate is? Gonna be in December?

123
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.340
Dave Scott: Yeah, I mean, we make 50% of our revenue in 4th quarter because of the holidays.

124
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So.

125
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, is it? Is there a way to talk about it where you know.

126
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and we're gonna end December with

127
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:46.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a run rate of. Anyway, I just want you to have clarity around it. You decide what you're comfortable, but let's have clarity around it. In the in the other. In the beginning you talked about the 150 million people you said 150 million people once and then later on.

128
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But I don't know 2 paragraphs in you said something about

129
00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:55.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you said a lot of people have to have to use all these technologies.

130
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Read the second paragraph for me again.

131
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Were you talking about it?

132
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:08.100
Dave Scott: I said that running an online game can be, Ca, can be painful. Taking 4 more technologies to.

133
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Keep going.

134
00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:13.129
Dave Scott: I'm Dave Scott, the founder of eagle genius.

135
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, next.

136
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.859
Dave Scott: Single platform. Our platform allows players

137
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.369
Dave Scott: and their friends to build online adventures or play professionally made adventures.

138
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:31.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's where, literally, I would sit drop in the 150 million number. Again, our platform allows those 150 million people

139
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:39.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): reinforcing how big the market is those 150 million people to create their online game platform? Blah! Blah! All the stuff you said.

140
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:45.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then when you come back to it again. And you say we have 35,000 paying, you know, paying users who've

141
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:57.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): who, you know, and we will end the year with over 2 million dollars in revenue like those are. You're trying to hit those numbers again and again, because you want people to walk away, being like damn! This is a big market.

142
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now I hope that in your Q. And A, you're gonna address some of the questions like.

143
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:17.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Well, wait. 35,000 player people 2 million revenue. How much does this cost? Is this recurring revenue? Is it not? Is it transactional? How do I get paid? What are the margins? What are the like? There's a whole bunch of questions there. You don't have to answer all of them.

144
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:25.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You want to answer enough of them that people have confidence that like, damn, I got some more questions. I want to go talk to this guy. I gotta talk to Dave

145
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right.

146
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.950
Dave Scott: Okay, so.

147
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it's coming along. I would fine tune places where you have

148
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the opportunity to add a word or 2 that will clarify something.

149
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So

150
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I but I think you're headed in the right direction for sure.

151
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.710
Dave Scott: Thank you.

152
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. And every time I see your name I think of the triathlete, you know there was a famous triathlete, Dave Scott, right.

153
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.640
Dave Scott: Yeah, or the Astronaut or the Senator. There's few of us.

154
00:13:56.017 --> 00:13:58.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I just think of the triathlete.

155
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So we'll go cycling one of these days.

156
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:11.559
Lilliana Robinson: That's awesome. We do have quite a few cyclers in this group, you know Daniel Lopez, one of Neil's employees from Code Academy.

157
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.620
Lilliana Robinson: Did you ever know him.

158
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know.

159
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, we can.

160
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.800
Lilliana Robinson: He is one of our eirs right now, and they all just went mountain biking like a few of the.

161
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Awesome.

162
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.383
Lilliana Robinson: Cool, alright.

163
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Saturday after Demo Day. We could do that.

164
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.709
Lilliana Robinson: There you go. If everyone you know is feeling, feeling.

165
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm gonna be there.

166
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.410
Lilliana Robinson: Current, so.

167
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:34.825
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Hi

168
00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:44.759
Kirimgeray Kirimli: so what I want to achieve is that I want to go with pitch 1st and then in the pitch. I want to show them that we are the right people to solve this problem.

169
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.810
Kirimgeray Kirimli: and then.

170
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:46.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's to stop

171
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him): stop. So I just want, I'm gonna take your words.

172
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I want to show them that we are the right people to solve this problem.

173
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What problem?

174
00:14:57.237 --> 00:15:00.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right? Let's be precise in our use of language.

175
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:01.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Go ahead.

176
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:10.159
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I want them to understand the problem. Then I want them to understand that we're the right people to solve the problem during the pitch.

177
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.489
Kirimgeray Kirimli: And then during the video.

178
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.669
Kirimgeray Kirimli: we want them to see a little bit of the product.

179
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:35.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I'd like again, I'm gonna I'm sorry with each one of you. I'm trying to pick on something different, so that hopefully everybody will see. Oh, here's what I have. Here's how I should be approaching this. You still didn't tell me anything of use, you said. I want them to see the problem. And I want to tell. I want to show them that we're the right people to solve the problem. What I'd like to hear you say is.

180
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I want them to understand that

181
00:15:40.316 --> 00:15:59.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Rpg gaming is a huge market with 150 million players today, growing a 10% month a year over year, and that we are the right people to solve it because of our experience building XY, and Z, like, I want it more tangible, so that it's easier for you to hit the hit. The mark.

182
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:16.019
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I want our audience to understand that executives have a difficult time. Having in oversight on their organizations. And I want them to understand that we are the right people to

183
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.809
Kirimgeray Kirimli: address this issue as I've been an executive myself.

184
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.499
Kirimgeray Kirimli: then I want them to see.

185
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, that is way. Better. Do you? Does that feel better to you?

186
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.986
Kirimgeray Kirimli: It does. It's it's way more clear.

187
00:16:29.668 --> 00:16:35.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right. This is an exercise in communication. That's why I'm being such a pain in the ass about it. Sorry.

188
00:16:35.967 --> 00:16:37.652
Kirimgeray Kirimli: No, no, not at all,

189
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.429
Kirimgeray Kirimli: And then I want them to see that there are many other tools.

190
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.484
Kirimgeray Kirimli: But snapshot reviews. Does it differently and better.

191
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.790
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Then, during the Q. And a.

192
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:57.230
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I want them to see that the way we apply the AI the way we are approaching the problem

193
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.840
Kirimgeray Kirimli: rather than

194
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.520
Kirimgeray Kirimli: just showing random numbers and graphs.

195
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.709
Kirimgeray Kirimli: We have a better shot at actually meeting

196
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.410
Kirimgeray Kirimli: executives, technical executives needs

197
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:23.010
Kirimgeray Kirimli: than every other tool out there. There are about 10 to 15 tools that are more established trying to solve the same problem, competing for the same market, and have a lot more money than we do.

198
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, let's hear it.

199
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:40.139
Kirimgeray Kirimli: As an engineering executive. It's your job to have full visibility across your team, but if you ask any executive they will admit it feels like they're flying blind. I've been there, too.

200
00:17:40.260 --> 00:18:01.879
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Having worked my way up to managing over 300 engineers. I know that with each new roll up the ladder comes bigger decisions, but fewer answers. I found that to be a good leader you need both the numbers and the story behind them, especially when reviewing performance, reporting up or answering tough questions on the spot. It's not just about who's hitting target.

201
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:08.119
Kirimgeray Kirimli: It's about knowing who's really delivering, who needs help. And when key projects will actually get done.

202
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:28.260
Kirimgeray Kirimli: My name is Karim, and that's why I build snapshot reviews. Unlike other tools that just serve up raw numbers, snapshot dives deeper. Using AI to add clarity and context. We pull data from Github, Jira, and standups to show you who is performing who might need support. And when key projects will be completed.

203
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:36.129
Kirimgeray Kirimli: snapshot reviews, cuts through the noise to give you real answers, helping you make the right calls and keep your team moving forward.

204
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.290
Lilliana Robinson: Alright!

205
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I.

206
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.300
Lilliana Robinson: 55 seconds.

207
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I like it. I feel like you have an opportunity to stick the landing better.

208
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.009
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and what I'm looking for when I say stick the landing is, have something in the end

209
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that says something along the lines of

210
00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:05.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the executives who use snapshot reviews are gonna deliver their projects, have a higher chance of delivering their project on time on budget

211
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:16.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): making their year. I don't know what the 3rd thing is, but like boom, boom! Like, I want you to stick that landing like. If you're not using snapshot reviews, you are missing out, and you are going to be failing

212
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:21.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? So I I don't know quite what the language is, but I like on time on budget.

213
00:19:21.903 --> 00:19:26.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You know. Maybe it is. If you want to deliver your projects on time and on Budget.

214
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Come, see me. We'll talk about snapshot reviews

215
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like that's the value prop, right?

216
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.310
Kirimgeray Kirimli: that's

217
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.711
Kirimgeray Kirimli: yes, but also

218
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.189
Kirimgeray Kirimli: That's where we have a bit of confusion ourselves as well. That's

219
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.723
Kirimgeray Kirimli: one of the value props.

220
00:19:47.565 --> 00:19:51.699
Kirimgeray Kirimli: but not necessarily key value. Keep delivering key projects, is not

221
00:19:53.250 --> 00:20:03.909
Kirimgeray Kirimli: it? It might also just be who's performing, who might need support so like understanding your organization. So the real value prop is actually understanding your organization

222
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.649
Kirimgeray Kirimli: almost being aware.

223
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:12.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So how do I make more money by understanding my organization? I thought I make more money by delivering projects on time on budget.

224
00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:18.951
Kirimgeray Kirimli: You fire the right people, you hire the right people, you promote the right people.

225
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.000
Kirimgeray Kirimli: and you

226
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:29.519
Kirimgeray Kirimli: manage your time more efficiently by knowing which team to be involved in, like which project which area to focus on.

227
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.610
Kirimgeray Kirimli: which then eventually does help you deliver the projects faster, and where you make money.

228
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:47.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I think at the end of the day, and I steal this from Mert. But he talks about how in b 2 b. There are 3 things you can sell. You can sell more revenue.

229
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:52.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): less expense, or less time. Those are the only 3 things you can really sell to a business

230
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? And so you're not really selling more revenue.

231
00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You may or may not be selling less expense. You may be selling less time.

232
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but think about. Those are the things that businesses value. Right?

233
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:18.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I would like love to see you guys get some agreement and clarity around what you think the job to be done is, and the value prop, and I'd love to see you stick the landing

234
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): with the job to be done, because, remember, your buyer

235
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is going to be. If if your buyer hears the job to be done.

236
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it resonates with them, they're going to be coming to seek you out.

237
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:35.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so it's a natural filter for you to say, you know.

238
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:43.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I I don't know how you want to say it, but you know, if you're having trouble getting your projects done on time on Budget. Come, see me. We can fix that for you.

239
00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:51.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, Crap! I gotta go talk to them like, you know, or if if you don't know which of your engineers are performing properly.

240
00:21:51.040 --> 00:22:02.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know who who deserves a promotion and who deserves to be replaced. Come, talk to me. We'll help you figure that out like I would articulate that job to be done in the end as sort of your ask

241
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and nail it.

242
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.547
Kirimgeray Kirimli: That makes sense.

243
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.357
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I mean, it sounds like I have like 5th 5 seconds

244
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.740
Kirimgeray Kirimli: like we're at 55 seconds. So there's just.

245
00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, you could take out a couple of words here and there. You've got a little wiggle room.

246
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:24.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but I love pitches where you open up with the problem, and then you nail the job to be done, or solution in the end

247
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:30.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like it. Just it makes it really easy for the audience to to understand and to to resonate with.

248
00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:47.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and the more specific you are, the better. So when you were, you were specific about managers and and performance. But then, when you opened up in your actual pitch and you talked about engineering man executives, I was like, Oh, this is for engineering executives. I didn't know that from what he had said before.

249
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but it put a finer point on. It made it easier for me to understand.

250
00:22:54.040 --> 00:23:01.159
Kirimgeray Kirimli: That makes sense, I mean, and we could definitely like nail the job to be done with the specific task as well.

251
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:02.770
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Yep.

252
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.200
Kirimgeray Kirimli: yep.

253
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:17.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The more clarity people have. And remember, don't try to be everything to everybody, the narrower your wedges into a market, the easier it is to penetrate. And so, you know, you might be able to do a hundred other things. But nail the one you think is most valuable.

254
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Talk about the one you think is most valuable. That's the one that's gonna open the doors.

255
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.399
Kirimgeray Kirimli: That makes sense

256
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.280
Kirimgeray Kirimli: no.

257
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:26.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right.

258
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:27.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Hello!

259
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.160
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. Fabio.

260
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.680
Fabio Caironi: Hey, Troy?

261
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.220
Fabio Caironi: Hello!

262
00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:40.570
Fabio Caironi: So to start off with the questions, so we are, gonna start with our pitch

263
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:53.970
Fabio Caironi: and then show our video. So the goal for the pitch is to 2 goals. So we want to educate the audience about the problem and and kind of like highlight its size.

264
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.549
Fabio Caironi: So kind of impress the audience about how large of a problem this is.

265
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So

266
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him): time out.

267
00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Were you listening when I was having this interaction just a minute ago with

268
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Karen.

269
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.170
Fabio Caironi: Yeah.

270
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So what is your problem?

271
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:16.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's not enough to say we want to identify the pro, want the audience to resonate with the problem, what problem do you want them to resonate with.

272
00:24:17.077 --> 00:24:17.970
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, or east.

273
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:18.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Pacific.

274
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:27.320
Fabio Caironi: Yeah. So let me restart, we want to educate the audience about the surge in computational demand

275
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.789
Fabio Caironi: required by AI applications.

276
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:35.664
Fabio Caironi: And we want to impress the audience with, you know, some

277
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:44.479
Fabio Caironi: techniques or some data about its size. So the the 1st goal of the pitch is to

278
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:53.383
Fabio Caironi: create a tension and a wow effect around. The the size and importance of

279
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.730
Fabio Caironi: AI models.

280
00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:00.389
Fabio Caironi: And then at some point I kick in and say all of this.

281
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.270
Fabio Caironi: Well, I'll I'll pitch it later. But it's gonna be

282
00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:15.360
Fabio Caironi: bringing up the problem of computing power. So after I created a hook, basically, I shift the attention to the computing power. So everything lies on the computing power to run.

283
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.669
Fabio Caironi: And at that point, it's when I start explaining

284
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:25.300
Fabio Caironi: the benefits of our solution. So how? Easier we make it

285
00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:39.890
Fabio Caironi: to access computing power and how? What makes us stand out so the fact that we tap into a an idle network of devices which makes us better in

286
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.420
Fabio Caironi: a few different ways.

287
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So let me try to put a finer point on it.

288
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think you have an opportunity here

289
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you can talk about.

290
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:55.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and you do it in a couple of seconds. But you can talk about the magic of artificial intelligence

291
00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:03.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then overwhelm them with just how much compute this is. Gonna take.

292
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:11.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Microsoft is talking about buying a nuclear power plant to power the computing process for AI, right?

293
00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We're never gonna be able to do all the things that are possible.

294
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:27.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you take them up on this. AI is amazing. It can, you know, come up with some crazy, great thing that it can do. But we're never gonna see it

295
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him): until now.

296
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:40.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let me tell you how we are going to tap into the resources of the idle computing power. That's gonna blah blah blah blah. So like I think you have a really good opportunity for a huge hook here.

297
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:49.559
Fabio Caironi: Absolutely and I took free inspiration from your feedback last time. So you're gonna hear that? Alright? Let's hear it. Okay, cool.

298
00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then what are you gonna do in the in the video? And then what are you gonna do in the QA.

299
00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:18.100
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, exactly. We just wanna touch upon that. So the video is to provide more details about the space we're operating in. We discussed this with Liliana in a previous session. But basically we are in like a segment of the cloud computing word. And I don't want us to come across as a general cloud computing provider. So the video will will just dwell into

300
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:34.789
Fabio Caironi: a quick explanation of what serverless containers are very quick and simple. I will try to make it as simple as possible. But then, hone in on the use cases. So what are the use? Cases where these things called serverless containers currently used for. And then how can byte night

301
00:27:35.707 --> 00:27:39.530
Fabio Caironi: how does back make it unique? To to solve this.

302
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:39.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So.

303
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.340
Fabio Caironi: Problem.

304
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So again. You've gone into telling me what you you've described the what

305
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:52.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I want to tell them. You haven't told me what the objective is, what do you want the audience to leave the 1Â min video with.

306
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.680
Fabio Caironi: Oh, absolutely they. I want to educate them. I want them to

307
00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.180
Fabio Caironi: be aware of the space.

308
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.439
Fabio Caironi: because it's a very

309
00:28:02.207 --> 00:28:06.530
Fabio Caironi: undiscovered space, you know. From the.

310
00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:12.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So how do we get some emotion around that being aware being educated? Those aren't. Those aren't powerful.

311
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:23.949
Fabio Caironi: I think I think so. The 1st part is the thrill. So the pitch is the thrill of this. This thing called AI that everybody knows, and then the product is, hey, if you want to get to AI,

312
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:36.090
Fabio Caironi: you actually have to go through these nerdy things that are called containers and and and serverless compute. And this is very important. So I think the feeling I want to stir up is.

313
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:42.873
Fabio Caironi: oh, these guys are are nerds. They know how to do this. Oh, there! I don't know. It's it's complicated.

314
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How about this? How about

315
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:55.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I want the pitch to get them excited about the potential. And I want the video to leave them. Feeling confident that we can deliver that potential.

316
00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.749
Fabio Caironi: I love. I love the work. Yeah.

317
00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:05.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right. And so what that means, though, is that while you will sprinkle some education in there.

318
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:16.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you don't want to go down rabbit holes about how containers work. And they're scalable. And they're like, like, you want them to walk away thinking, Damn these guys are smart. They're gonna do this for real.

319
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.020
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, right.

320
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:25.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Q. And A. You can take on the the questions that you've had and the, you know, sell into the objections.

321
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:37.479
Fabio Caironi: Absolutely. Yeah. The the QA. Will figure it out. But it's mainly about answering who are who is our Icp. The go to market strategy, security and and our questions.

322
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.839
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So for everybody on the call, I want you to think about what we just did right.

323
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:53.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He started by saying something along lines of, I want the pitch to tell them about the problem in our solution. And I want the the video to to show them that educate them. That's not exciting

324
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right.

325
00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:13.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But if you have, if you make it about the objective, I want to get them excited about AI. I want to bring them down and tell them it looks like it's impossible. We got to build nuclear power plants. I want to show them that we have a solution that's going to take us to the promised land. And then in the video, I want them to walk away believing that we are the ones who can deliver on that promise.

326
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's something they're going to get excited about.

327
00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:22.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so each of you, as you're thinking about your own business, think about

328
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:29.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): what are the objectives of each stage of this. And how do you take them on that emotional ride? Because emotion is what they're going to remember.

329
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They're gonna be like, damn! Who is that smart guy in the brown hoodie? I want to go talk to him.

330
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They're not going to remember the details, but they are going to remember the emotion.

331
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right.

332
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:39.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let's hear it.

333
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.509
Fabio Caironi: Call me for Ya.

334
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:49.539
Fabio Caironi: In the last 24 months we have seen a shift in technology that is bigger than any we've seen before

335
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.310
Fabio Caironi: the advent of artificial intelligence.

336
00:30:52.590 --> 00:31:00.710
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, the Internet and cloud computing were big. But this is bigger. It's gonna change the way every application interacts with humans.

337
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.990
Fabio Caironi: And there is a race to get there. It's the access to the computing power.

338
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:20.210
Fabio Caironi: even provided that you've found a good deal or snapped up some cloud credits, managing computing resources for your AI or data applications is still technically challenging. And most startups can't do that on their own.

339
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.750
Fabio Caironi: That's why, 2 years ago, I founded byte night.

340
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:37.239
Fabio Caironi: We provide a serverless platform for simple access to application containers, so that each company that wants to utilize cpus and Gpus doesn't have to go through the pain and anguish of trying to set all of this stuff up

341
00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.989
Fabio Caironi: using byte night allows them to get from 0 to functional in a bunch of minutes.

342
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:50.509
Fabio Caironi: and we make it easier, faster, and cheaper than any other cloud. Thanks to tapping into into alternative hardware providers. Let's see it into play.

343
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.440
Lilliana Robinson: One of 7,

344
00:31:53.790 --> 00:32:01.830
Lilliana Robinson: Troy. I don't know if you feel this way, but I honestly think Fabio shouldn't say. 2 years ago he founded by night, I think he should just say he founded by night.

345
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:07.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I would probably take the 2 years out. We're looking for trajectory.

346
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:11.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I I think you can make it

347
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): more passionate.

348
00:32:15.085 --> 00:32:18.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Along the lines of what I talked about like, you know

349
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the the maze.

350
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:30.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We've all seen the amazing power of AI in the last 2 years. It has changed and have some concrete example. I don't care what it is that everybody can relate to.

351
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:40.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him): whether it's deep fakes, whether it's, you know, whatever it is that AI is doing? You know it's it's it's writing your resume faster, doing your like. It is changing the world.

352
00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And it's way bigger than cloud computing.

353
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:51.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it will have a way bigger impact on us than cloud computing did. And it's even going to have a bigger impact on us than the original Internet did

354
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): fundamentally changes the way we work. But

355
00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:05.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): there is so much computing power needed that literally, Microsoft is trying to buy a nuclear power plant to power all these computers.

356
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How will startups compete?

357
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Well, let me tell you.

358
00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:33.489
Troy Henikoff (he/him): byte night has made the interface to Major. I'm gonna screw this up, but may have made a major interface to major computing power as easy as connecting to an Api in our serverless platform. We take care of all of it for you so that all you have to do is is connect and run. We make use of excess computing capacity. Blah, blah blah! Let me show you how it works boom.

359
00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:35.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then you go to the video.

360
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Does that feel a little bit more emotional?

361
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:46.280
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, I like the part where you you try to relate with the audience, with the practical examples.

362
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:51.699
Fabio Caironi: and the trajectory you think is is the right one. I am. Yeah.

363
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now again.

364
00:33:53.300 --> 00:34:00.009
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like I said earlier, you have to do something that feels natural to you. Don't try to be me.

365
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:08.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but if that feels natural to you. Come up with your own examples and deliver it in your own authentic way, and it can be super powerful

366
00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:12.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): bye.

367
00:34:12.824 --> 00:34:19.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You can make it more emotional than what you had. I think you can have a emotional hook, and emotional hooks are awesome.

368
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:27.550
Fabio Caironi: I think I can work that way. But I I gotta think with some of somebody else's mind, because if it were for me I would make it super technical, so I gotta steer away from that.

369
00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.850
Fabio Caironi: And and so, you know.

370
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.000
Fabio Caironi: yep.

371
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:40.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): No, I know. So I was an engineer like my undergraduate degree is mechanical engineering, and my graduate degree is in engineering as well. So I am an engineer, and it took me

372
00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:42.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a while

373
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:49.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to realize that I don't have to explain everything like an engineer. I can understand it like an engineer, but I can explain it like a marketer.

374
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and that's a powerful combination.

375
00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:59.749
Fabio Caironi: Absolutely would love your feedback once. This is at the next version, but thanks for your feedback. So far, great.

376
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:06.630
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. Okay. Thanks. Fabio. Next is Collab.

377
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:09.380
Florence Ettlin: Hi Troy!

378
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Hello!

379
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:34.740
Florence Ettlin: Hello, so the way that we're planning to organize is first, st the pitch and the purpose is to grab attention, create an emotional tie in terms of pain. Point that guests feel when there's staying at short term rentals. Then we're gonna move over to the demo. Video purpose is to illustrate the host, pain, point so the other side, and introduce Anna and show the benefits of our solution.

380
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:47.430
Florence Ettlin: And then the Q. And a. The purpose is to address the most frequently asked questions. But primarily it's going to be about okay. Where do we go from today to becoming a venture? Scalable business? How do we differentiate ourselves? And what's our future vision.

381
00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:48.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Awesome.

382
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Got it?

383
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let's hear it.

384
00:35:52.610 --> 00:36:06.080
Florence Ettlin: So imagine you're finally on holiday, excited to be in Mexico and eat those tacos you've been dreaming of. But instead, you struggle to enter your Airbnb. There's no response from the host, and you're left stranded on the street alone at night with your bags

385
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.829
Florence Ettlin: hours later. Finally, inside, you step in for a shower, only to be met with icy water

386
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:18.620
Florence Ettlin: over 700 million travelers each year face similar frustrations when they can't get timely relevant support.

387
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:34.390
Florence Ettlin: Meanwhile millions of short-term rental hosts worldwide face constant pressure to be available 24, 7, and manually respond to repetitive guest questions while juggling multiple priorities, ultimately sacrificing their freedom and flexibility.

388
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:41.620
Florence Ettlin: I'm Talitha, the CEO of Collab, and we created Anna, an AI pocket concierge to handle all guest communication

389
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:52.659
Florence Ettlin: with Anna Hosts can become superhuman and focus on what matters most improving and growing their business while delivering the guest experience we all seek. So let's see her in action.

390
00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I like it?

391
00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:04.041
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I wanna steal a little bit from Rhonda. I assume you're

392
00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Do you know, Rhonda, from last cohort, the dentist.

393
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.627
Lilliana Robinson: They all just

394
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:19.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, Burhan. Yeah. So one of the things that he said that was really powerful was that, you know, with Rhonda there's never a busy signal.

395
00:37:20.452 --> 00:37:23.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You know, there's there's never a a an

396
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I'm not gonna get it right. He what he basically said is, you know, if you have a dentist

397
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:51.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him): office with a receptionist. You have one person who can answer the phone once they have to, you know. Take breaks, they go to lunch. They're not there 16Â h of the day. And so your patients are left stranded. But with Rhonda there's never a busy signal. Rhonda can handle multiple calls at the same time Rhonda knows everything about every every appointment, etc, etc.

398
00:37:51.760 --> 00:38:03.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him): There's some version of that that I think you should talk about, which will make it sound like your AI. I assume this is where you're headed is actually better at answering most of the questions

399
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:05.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): than the host would be.

400
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:18.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because your AI doesn't get frustrated, it's always on. It never gets a busy signal. It blah blah like I would like to emphasize the fact that this is not a compromise. This is actually a better solution for the customer.

401
00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:33.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Then having a human pick it up while you know, pick up their cell phone while they're driving with kids screaming in the back, trying to answer a question, and you could make a really vivid you. Your opening was great, right? I pictured myself

402
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:37.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): on that dark street in Mexico with my suitcases not being able to get in

403
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and like, oh, that's a little scary. Now what's gonna happen

404
00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right, and we've all been some version of that, and I think most people relate to it.

405
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:58.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then I would do something similar. If you have time, which is relate to the fact that the person you're trying to call is literally driving with a car full of screaming kids trying to answer your question without access to the data and

406
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but not

407
00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): our solution.

408
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:03.230
Florence Ettlin: Alright!

409
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him): AI has access, you know.

410
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:12.059
Troy Henikoff (he/him): No screaming kids, no busy signals, no distractions. Blah blah! And so I'd sell the fact that it's a better solution.

411
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:32.349
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, question, so this is actually exactly what you said is what we were trying to do in our video, which is show the host side. Do you think that? It's important to bring that right away in the pitch? Or do you think it's all right to keep it in the demo. Video. Yeah. Demonstrating, oh, all the priorities they're juggling while they're still trying to answer to those guest questions. Yeah.

412
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:37.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, you have to figure it out where it best fits. So one of the things that I believe is you have a

413
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:43.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): portfolio of things you want to accomplish. I want to get people interested in the space I wanna

414
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him): them to understand how big a problem and how big the market is I want to understand. I want to understand.

415
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:57.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And you have to choose. Which of those things are you going to do in the pitch? Which of those things are you going to do in the video? And which of those things are you going to do in the QA.

416
00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And there is no right answer.

417
00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:15.885
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's up to you, and you have to work with your ear on what what you think is best to put in which part part, I do think it's important to get the attention upfront in the pitch like cause. If you don't, people will zone out, they'll be watching their phones and right. But

418
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:24.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): yeah, you could do it either way you could do it in the video. Maybe it's more effective to do it in the video. So maybe you hand off to the video. And the opening video is.

419
00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:33.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, the opening of the video could be that person in Mexico at the front door, trying to frantically dialing and then getting someone who's clearly

420
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:46.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in a car with screen. I'm picturing this car with screaming kids asking questions about do you have the password. I gotta look it up. You gotta wait till I got, you know. Wait till I pull over, because I can't text while I'm driving, and I can't, you know.

421
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is that the experience you want your

422
00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.829
Troy Henikoff (he/him): your guests to have.

423
00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): or this, and then you show

424
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then you show it in action. A nice conversation.

425
00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:10.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and maybe while you have the conversation going, you could have the human on one side, and on the other side you could have access, show some graphic that shows like access to an infinite database like an infinite calendar.

426
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:18.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): instant access to to, you know, key codes for locks, instant access to Wi-fi passwords instant access to.

427
00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:19.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know.

428
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): there could be a way to communicate that really clearly.

429
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, she likes it. I saw that smile.

430
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.312
Florence Ettlin: We like the link. Yeah, from the pitch into the video with Mexico. And like, yeah.

431
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:35.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, that those are the little details that make these things come to life.

432
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.029
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, right.

433
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:46.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): When there is, there's an Easter egg, or there's something that's in the pitch that is seamlessly brought into the next piece, and then should be asked about potentially, even in the QA.

434
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:47.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You know. So maybe.

435
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.989
Florence Ettlin: Thank you so much.

436
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.280
Florence Ettlin: Sorry.

437
00:41:50.280 --> 00:42:01.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So maybe, like, I'm I'm just making stuff up now. But maybe one of the 1st questions is so. So why are you doing this. Where did this idea come from? And then you say, you know that story in Mexico? That was me.

438
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:08.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I was the one standing on the dark street, and I was so frustrated that I thought, there has to be a better way

439
00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like now you've sewn all 3 together.

440
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.930
Florence Ettlin: And I mean.

441
00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:30.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You've got to be authentic and truthful about what this, but that's what what I'm talking about. If you get. If you sew all 3 together. Then you have a cohesive pitch, and what people don't won't think about it. As these 3 different events, they'll think about it as a continuous story of 3 different mediums.

442
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:38.010
Florence Ettlin: Yeah. Yeah. And we were even thinking of putting on some like mariachi music at the beginning. And we're coming in to set the scene in Mexico.

443
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, of course.

444
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:44.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, you can do whatever walk on music you want. And if you want to set the tone that way, that's fine.

445
00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.480
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, cool.

446
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:53.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I mean, everybody usually does some sort of pump it up kind of music. So that would be different. Here's 1 of the other things for all of you.

447
00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You want to stand out

448
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:59.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right. The audience is, gonna watch. How many pitches are they gonna watch.

449
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.740
Florence Ettlin: Well, I'm.

450
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 12.

451
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:12.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, they're gonna watch 12 pitches. And to them these are like 12 startup businesses that all like you. Really, ideally, each of you has something very unique.

452
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it can be

453
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:35.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him): everything from literally your walk on music. How you talk about it, what you're wearing like we always used to. I don't know if you guys are doing this, little Anna, but we always used to suggest that you guys coordinate so that you each have a different color like, oh, come, talk to us! We're the ones in the bright orange shirts. Come, talk to us. We're the ones in the blue shirts like So

454
00:43:36.206 --> 00:43:36.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know.

455
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you want to be different

456
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because you want to stand out.

457
00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:45.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then people are like, Oh, I want to talk to those people in the orange shirts. That's easy to remember, right?

458
00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:55.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So, having different music, not being the traditional like, pump it up kind of music and having music that ties into your story, I think, would play really nicely.

459
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:58.460
Florence Ettlin: Sounds good. Thank you.

460
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.079
Lilliana Robinson: That's a very creative idea. I like that.

461
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:02.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

462
00:44:03.251 --> 00:44:08.800
Lilliana Robinson: We're doing like optional T-shirts. Because over the years I've realized some people want to wear like a dress or a suit. So.

463
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Totally.

464
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:32.020
Lilliana Robinson: Wear T-shirts. We already talked about it last week. But what Troy is referencing is try to make sure your T-shirts aren't the same color, because people will associate like you on stage. And they're gonna try to find you. And it's if everyone's wearing blue. It's gonna be really hard to find you. So maybe just start at red or talk to each other and share the colors. Cool.

465
00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:52.059
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And at the at the risk of saying something that might offend people I'm not trying to offend. I'm trying to make observations. It seems that women who are pitching tend to be more uncomfortable with the T-shirt, and so a lot of times wear a blazer or something like that. And that's fine, and I've seen a lot of them pull it off where they'll have a blazer over their colored t-shirt.

466
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So like

467
00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:58.101
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm trying to think of examples, Lillian, I'm going back to

468
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him): A lot of my blinking on names. Yeah. And so.

469
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:06.559
Lilliana Robinson: We watched Ariana's the mental health one she was doing. She was wearing that. If you guys remember.

470
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:22.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. And so you can have the colored T-shirt with your logo on, you know, underneath a nice blazer, and you can wear whatever you want. And then your team is typically wearing that T-shirt, and then that kind of ties it all together. But so not necessary. It's just a way of making it

471
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:31.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): visually connecting for the audience, because ideally, they'll be like, Oh, I want to find the people with the pink T-shirts, and I find one of them, and like, where's the person who pitched?

472
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:33.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then you connect them

473
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:34.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right.

474
00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:38.520
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly.

475
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:45.529
Lilliana Robinson: All right. Okay. Well, thank you, Collab, that was great. Next is health blocks.

476
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:48.599
Nirat Attri: Hey! Troy!

477
00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.580
Lilliana Robinson: We're halfway done. Troy.

478
00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay.

479
00:45:53.830 --> 00:46:05.569
Nirat Attri: Alright. So for us the objective is to be talking to investors and PE firms very similar to what, like Rhonda was doing. We figured out. A market segment for us is indeed PE

480
00:46:05.953 --> 00:46:12.630
Nirat Attri: so what we're starting off is a very big, bold vision during our pitch that this is what we do.

481
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:17.160
Nirat Attri: and this is what we aim to do. And then we want that to flow in.

482
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:17.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Hold on!

483
00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:18.120
Nirat Attri: Who are.

484
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Just did.

485
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Why are you all doing this? Your words were.

486
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:29.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we want to start our pitch by saying, This is what we do, and this is what we want to do. I have no idea what you're trying to accomplish.

487
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:40.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Think about those words. This is what we want to do, and this is how we do it, or whatever you said, give me specifics. Make your objective as specific as possible. It will help you

488
00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:45.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to nail your objective. You have something in your head. You just haven't communicated it well enough to me.

489
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:51.237
Nirat Attri: I'm sorry for that, like in my head like actually spelled it out. But then I forgot to say,

490
00:46:51.480 --> 00:47:02.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right? Right? This is, it's it is amazing. So you know, this whole thing is a communication exercise. And hopefully, you're each learning from each other. But let's get really specific about the objective. Alright.

491
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): do it again.

492
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:29.430
Nirat Attri: So in our pitch, we're positioning ourselves as the all in one healthcare platform, and we want to tease the fact that there are competitors that are operational in these verticals. So we have the objective to signal to our investors, potential investors that this is a big market segment that we're going after. And there is existing competition. That's just very vertical specific. But by positioning ourselves by going

493
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:58.839
Nirat Attri: broad and being able to tackle all those verticals, we are a better investment. That would be the intent. When we go into our product video, we want to showcase that this is not just theoretical. We are actually doing it by using the a very tangible customer example and walking through that entire journey. And making sure that we showcase that what we have achieved by doing the things that we have done for them. And then, during the Q. And a. The idea would be to get deeper into

494
00:47:59.153 --> 00:48:18.250
Nirat Attri: these verticals, and like what has actually happened in the industry and like break it down a lot more. So the excitement is capitalized that it's not. We're not just talking theory that we are operational in these market segments. We're actually delivering value in those market segments. And then, perhaps become a good investment opportunity for the people. There.

495
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Got it all right. Let's hear it.

496
00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:24.005
Nirat Attri: But

497
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:28.340
Nirat Attri: healthcare has a 500 billion dollar efficiency problem.

498
00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.849
Nirat Attri: Doctor offices are spending hours doing tasks that could be automated.

499
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:37.730
Nirat Attri: The root cause. Patient data doesn't transfer easily from one system to another.

500
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:46.399
Nirat Attri: At the same time, new technology is constantly being added to solve healthcare challenges with little regard to how it will fit into the ecosystem operationally.

501
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:56.159
Nirat Attri: Hi, I'm neerat atri and I build health blocks, a 1-stop platform that automates all aspects of the healthcare journey right into the existing health record system.

502
00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:05.529
Nirat Attri: say goodbye to time, consuming expensive customized tech, and say hello to plug and play modules that configure easily with Lego like ease.

503
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:13.839
Nirat Attri: giving you an all-in-one platform that is cost efficient revenue, generating, flexible, and has interoperability baked in

504
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:18.239
Nirat Attri: finally, healthcare innovation and come at the cost of tech complexity.

505
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.739
Nirat Attri: Here's a glimpse of what we have achieved so far.

506
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.959
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that was 55 seconds.

507
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So

508
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:30.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I am really skeptical when someone says they're going to solve all my problems.

509
00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:50.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I would like a little more specificity, I think. What you mean is that you have a universal translator, and we talked about this last time with Hl. 7. And right, you have some sort of universal translator. But you're not solving all the healthcare problems

510
00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? And and how will you so?

511
00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:00.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And I just want to be intellectually honest about this right? So if I have some antiquated Ehr?

512
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:05.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And you have some digital X-rays or Mris.

513
00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:11.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you can't put those into my Ehr. If the Ehr doesn't have a way to capture images

514
00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:15.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right like there, there are. Gonna be some limits. You can't do everything for everybody. Correct.

515
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:32.520
Nirat Attri: the theory behind it. What we have achieved so far is we are working with a lot of these legacy systems, and we're leveraging the Apis that they do extend so typically an Mr. Like an MRI would not be

516
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:49.740
Nirat Attri: editable inside of that. Ehr? But what you could do is have a document that's injected, and then has an outbound that opens up the that opens up the help blocks platform where you can do with the whatever things that your Ehr is actually missing.

517
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:50.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Then you're not just.

518
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:51.220
Nirat Attri: At least.

519
00:50:51.220 --> 00:51:00.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I had thought you were actually taking data and stuffing it into the Hr. But you're also you have some sort of a viewer or something that will let you review that stuff.

520
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:13.859
Nirat Attri: The the idea is that that's step one. What the health blocks platform is doing. These modules are actually the ones that are fulfilling the deficit within the Ehr that you're currently on that is preventing you to have a holistic.

521
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.179
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So let me ask a question.

522
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:15.590
Nirat Attri: And.

523
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:20.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What if? And I don't know if I'm pitching this correctly. But what if I pitched your business by saying

524
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:27.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The Federal Government in the Us. Dictated that every

525
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): doctor's office has to have an electronic health care record.

526
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:40.989
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And yet, even with all this automation, billions of dollars is wasted with humans trying to type information into those

527
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we have created a universal translator that can take

528
00:51:46.010 --> 00:52:00.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him): anybody's output from any lab X-ray testing Xyz giggle, snort, whatever it is and input it into any Ehr automatically, without humans having to intervene.

529
00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:05.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And that same data will appear right on the Hr record.

530
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are eliminating the manual data in doctor's offices.

531
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:14.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him): reducing healthcare, spend by billions of dollars. Let me show you how it works.

532
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Is that what you're doing.

533
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:41.869
Nirat Attri: I mean, it's just like one piece of the puzzle. The problem that we have is like to be very honest. The idea is that this is not new, like the interoperability. Thesis by itself is not something that sells really well, but the fact that we are able to empower the doctor to do more with this. Ehr? I feel that is the core.

534
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:43.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The doctor doing more. One example.

535
00:52:44.280 --> 00:53:01.399
Nirat Attri: So one of our clinics is like a multi practice is like a multi practice clinic group. It's by the same ownership. They're in different geographies, and they cater to 10 different partnerships. What they want to do is like have a very bespoke way of dealing with

536
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:21.469
Nirat Attri: each of these referral channels and then have a different way of processing the the referral channel depending upon what their contractual obligation with each of these referral channels is. So using our platform, what they're able to do is customize the intake on each of these referral pathways, and then we're able to

537
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:36.680
Nirat Attri: keep a track of that through the Ehr while the patient's journey is being conducted within the Ehr. And then we're able to relay this information back to the referral partner, because previously, that step was entirely manual for them, so they would.

538
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Do you have like? Do you have these live.

539
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:40.560
Nirat Attri: Yes.

540
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:46.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay. So 2 things, I I think. And I don't know enough about your business. One is.

541
00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it's okay in your pitch

542
00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to oversimplify. To make your point

543
00:53:53.010 --> 00:54:01.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him): as an example. When I did my financial modeling for all you guys I oversimplified. I had churn as a single number. I had marketing as a single number, and I

544
00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:19.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): later on, once you got far enough along the path, you said, Oh, wait a minute. Marketing should change over time. I'm like, yeah, I oversimplified. But now you got it right? So it's okay to oversimplify in a 1Â min pitch. You can't explain the world in 1Â min pitch. But you could leave an Easter egg for you to pick up later.

545
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:28.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): For example, if you did the thing that I just said about, you know inefficiencies in office billions of dollars. We're the universal translator, we do all that.

546
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and

547
00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:39.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we're already saving doctors, offices, millions of dollars a year with our platform with our live platform.

548
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then in the Q. And A, you have someone who says, Wait a minute.

549
00:54:46.140 --> 00:55:06.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You mentioned. You're saving millions of dollars. How are you doing that? You say? Oh, let me give you one simple example. We have this chain of clinics that has multiple referral routes, and they have to. They have to customize how they, how they treat the referral routes, or how they bill them. And with one little customized module we're able to integrate all of that into their Hr. And save them to an estimated 2 million dollars a year.

550
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:13.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Awesome. So you're starting out high, level, oversimplifying, but getting taking people along the journey.

551
00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:21.899
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then, as you go on the journey, and they've digested that you can add more complexity if you try to add too much complexity right off the bat.

552
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:23.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's overwhelming.

553
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:26.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Does that make sense.

554
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:37.459
Nirat Attri: So that would be the skepticism like, because when we talk about like solving everything that come like, we haven't gone into the depth of anything is that the problem with the opening? Would that would be.

555
00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:47.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I would. I would take out words like every problem, all problems. Nobody believes a startup is gonna solve any industries, all their problems

556
00:55:47.470 --> 00:56:00.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like. And so by starting with something that every that people can relate to and know is a problem, and then diving into. For example, we save millions of dollars by having a little module. Does this thing with referrals, whatever you explained really well.

557
00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like. Oh, I get it!

558
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Damn that thing's powerful!

559
00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:13.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And you said, live customer already saving the millions without like. You're adding credibility and traction

560
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:20.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): just by adding that word live customer. Let me show you how we showed our live customer millions of dollars a year.

561
00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:21.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right?

562
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:24.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's not a we're going to it's a, we did

563
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:32.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and you can extrapolate a little bit. They haven't been on board for a year, but they save $50,000 the 1st month, and

564
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:33.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): whatever.

565
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:33.880
Nirat Attri: Okay.

566
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:41.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Would allow you to have that story. Plant the Easter egg in the in the pitch.

567
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:51.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You'll do your video, explain stuff, and then you can pick it up again, whether you picked it in the video or you pick it up again in the QA. And it makes a a thread that makes it all cohesive.

568
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:55.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Got it

569
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:56.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him): awesome.

570
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.500
Nirat Attri: Work on it like I'll be redoing it. And then we can talk. Yeah.

571
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:02.640
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: Great Morgan, you ready?

572
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:05.510
Morgan Stanton: I am.

573
00:57:06.927 --> 00:57:12.739
Morgan Stanton: I started the book with sticky ideas. It's haunting some of those stories.

574
00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:13.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): To stick.

575
00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:14.350
Morgan Stanton: Yes, it makes sense.

576
00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:15.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Good. Yeah. Yeah.

577
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:18.198
Morgan Stanton: It's very good recommended to to everyone else.

578
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:21.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Gives you an idea of how to communicate these ideas. Better right.

579
00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:22.960
Morgan Stanton: Yeah

580
00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:33.565
Morgan Stanton: it. It influenced my pitch a bit. So for demo day I want to start with the pitch, and so

581
00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:58.949
Morgan Stanton: the goal is to for the whole demo day is to get, you know, investors starting to talk with us right? General investors, not just biotech, but maybe people also interested in social impact investing. And so for the pitch, our specific goals are to say, you know, that women's health is neglected in biotech and pharma. It's been a problem for a while, and because of that there is a loss of money in the industry

582
00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:09.260
Morgan Stanton: to follow that up. Opal is here to give science and services and tools to address that neglect and help biotech and pharma play, catch up.

583
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:16.970
Morgan Stanton: and then to tease a little bit of our science, right? I want to go in depth, but just kind of very high level tease the science.

584
00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:24.020
Morgan Stanton: This would feed into our video of kind of how did we get to this problem?

585
00:58:24.385 --> 00:58:32.530
Morgan Stanton: It's a modern problem. A lot of people think people think it's an old problem, olden times. But no, it's a modern problem here today.

586
00:58:32.710 --> 00:59:02.209
Morgan Stanton: and then to bring back the science of, we tease at the beginning. And now here's some more specific examples. Here's clients that are using this science, and like what it looks like at a high level, so they can kind of be more tangible. It's not just something in the air of science and the the Q. And a. Is to talk about the company's future, how it grows. And then, like, what assets do we have? What is our kind of moat as a biotech company to move forward.

587
00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Hey! Let's hear it.

588
00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.069
Morgan Stanton: Exploring the deep blue sea.

589
00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:13.179
Morgan Stanton: the great unknown

590
00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.229
Morgan Stanton: quotes from famed oceanographer, Jacques Cousteau.

591
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:20.719
Morgan Stanton: No, these are statements from people describing women's gynecological health.

592
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:33.010
Morgan Stanton: despite a market of over 180 billion, there's still a huge knowledge gap in our understanding of female reproductive biology causing costly failures in the medical development pipeline

593
00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:41.610
Morgan Stanton: with 92% of drugs failing clinical trials, biotech and pharma are starting to realize the need for better tools in women's health.

594
00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:44.670
Morgan Stanton: And that's exactly where opal therapeutics comes in

595
00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:54.230
Morgan Stanton: at Opal. We're building a biotech platform that truly represents human female biology. No mice or rats, only human biology.

596
00:59:54.310 --> 01:00:03.210
Morgan Stanton: Unlike rodents that don't even have a menstrual cycle. Our platform uses human derived data that delivers accurate, translatable metrics for women's health.

597
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:09.469
Morgan Stanton: Our uterus and a dish platform uses cell-based models that closely replicate the female reproductive system.

598
01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:19.549
Morgan Stanton: enabling us to screen drugs and medical devices with unprecedented accuracy, getting products to market faster in women's health and reducing time and costs and drug development.

599
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:29.320
Morgan Stanton: Imagine a world where research and development finally reflects the true conditions of female human biology. Imagine developing a drug for women in 5 years instead of 10.

600
01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:32.469
Morgan Stanton: That's the future we're creating at opal therapeutics.

601
01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.430
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: A minute! 23.

602
01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:36.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, it felt long.

603
01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So 2 things, one, it felt long.

604
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You can steal a couple of seconds from this. If you make your video a couple of seconds shorter like there's a little bit of wiggle room. Not a lot, but

605
01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:52.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The other thing is, I think you have

606
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:55.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him): an opportunity to

607
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him): stick the landing again

608
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:58.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in a different way.

609
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I would come back to the deep blue sea analogy

610
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that was so great, like the open ocean. You know the like, you know the unexplored, the deep blue sea. So

611
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know what the right thing is, but I would reference it. Think back to the Rotific pitch, where, he said, you know, we're gonna make

612
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:23.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): drivers more efficient. What we won't do is forbid them from making left hand turns, and it reminded you of his opening right?

613
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:30.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): there's something about the deep blue sea, or your other alternative is, I think you said, what 92% of drug trails fail.

614
01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, you know. Imagine, come with us

615
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to a world

616
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:40.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him): where 92% of drug trials are successful.

617
01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:55.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right? Again, reminding them of something earlier, one of those 2. I don't think you can get both the deep blue sea and the 92, but like I'd love to see you tie it back to something in the beginning. And so that because that was such a great opening.

618
01:01:56.390 --> 01:02:00.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him): did you guys like her or her opening give me a thumbs up if you liked her opening.

619
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:06.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I had no idea where you're going with it. I'm like, Oh, damn right!

620
01:02:07.025 --> 01:02:08.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it will be memorable.

621
01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:18.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But you're also gonna have to cut some words. And by the way, you did have some words that were fluff, they sounded good.

622
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:21.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But they didn't necessarily add

623
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:23.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him): something to it. Right?

624
01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:39.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you you'll have to go through this and be like, okay, that's kind of fluff. If I took those words out. It has the same meaning. That's kind of fluff. If I took those words out, it has the same meaning, it will actually be more impactful if it is more meaningfully dense.

625
01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:45.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Then, if it has the same meaning and takes longer to say right, it'll be more more punchy.

626
01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So it's really hard to do, but that

627
01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:55.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that's probably your biggest job is to figure out what you what, what's the fluff? What can you take out and not meaningfully change the message

628
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:58.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you might be able to take out entire sentences.

629
01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:02.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, that sentence is nice, but it doesn't really add that much to the story. I can take it out

630
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:08.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): alright. Great.

631
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.950
Morgan Stanton: Thank you.

632
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:12.250
Morgan Stanton: Who's that?

633
01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:12.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Next.

634
01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.129
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: Aren't you ready.

635
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:17.703
George Reed - Noetic: Yup. Hello! Hey, Troy! Thanks for this.

636
01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:23.070
George Reed - Noetic: So my goal is to with the pitch first.st

637
01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:29.449
George Reed - Noetic: I'm talking to clients, not investors in this whole pitch. Video Q. And a.

638
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:33.819
George Reed - Noetic: Because I feel like investors will sort of get the vibe. It's all good. So

639
01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:36.620
George Reed - Noetic: so I want to

640
01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.459
George Reed - Noetic: lay out the problem. And then so clients will resonate with that. And then in the video, show them how.

641
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Time out. What am I gonna say, team.

642
01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:44.100
George Reed - Noetic: Okay.

643
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What did he just say?

644
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:45.959
Florence Ettlin: What was the.

645
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.342
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, I want, okay, so sorry. Sorry I want to.

646
01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:50.879
George Reed - Noetic: I want to show you.

647
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Specific.

648
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.720
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, I want to show that.

649
01:03:53.950 --> 01:04:06.590
George Reed - Noetic: So basically, it boils down to normally when I'm doing consumer research. If I don't have time to run a big project. I'll go with my gut, and that leads to a lot of failure. But I want to show that instead of doing that now, you can use noetic. So you can

650
01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:13.439
George Reed - Noetic: remove, remove that risk. And yeah, does that make sense and then show them in the video how technically that works like a demo.

651
01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:15.139
George Reed - Noetic: Is that.

652
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Your objective wasn't clear enough to me.

653
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:18.230
George Reed - Noetic: Okay. Okay.

654
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:19.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Try again.

655
01:04:20.371 --> 01:04:23.260
George Reed - Noetic: Okay. So objective is to speak to clients

656
01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:27.670
George Reed - Noetic: and have them resonate with the problem of I don't have time to run a big project.

657
01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:34.369
George Reed - Noetic: and so that often leads to huge failures in like products. And I could lose my job. So I'm feeling that.

658
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:51.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You said you used a bunch of. I'm going to push you again. You used a bunch of generic terms. Speak to clients. I have no idea clients. The last time I had a client I was writing software for them right projects. The last time I had a project I was doing some Bitcoin mining. Are you doing Bitcoin mining

659
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:57.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? That's what came to mind when I said project right? So be specific in your use of language.

660
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:58.119
George Reed - Noetic: Got you? Okay? So.

661
01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Are you speaking to.

662
01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:02.750
George Reed - Noetic: I said. I'm speaking to consumer insight teams running.

663
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:03.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Nice.

664
01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:04.050
George Reed - Noetic: Surveys.

665
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:11.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right who run qualitative surveys, and when they don't have enough time they think they don't have enough time. No.

666
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:14.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him): they tend to go with their gut. Yeah.

667
01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him): which leads to

668
01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:19.489
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a lot of errors. So how do you solve that problem?

669
01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:24.430
George Reed - Noetic: So I'll show it in the in the demo video. But we

670
01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.669
George Reed - Noetic: we offer them a

671
01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:36.980
George Reed - Noetic: a bottom up like instant right? Real time conversation with their consumer so that they can yeah, instantly gather feedback without needing to design a survey and launch it.

672
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.950
George Reed - Noetic: Does that make sense.

673
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:42.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Maybe maybe I need to see the video. Let's hear the pitch.

674
01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:53.940
George Reed - Noetic: All right, cool, cool. Read it out. Okay, so does anyone in the audience remember when 2 of the world's largest consumer brands Coke and Pepsi took a bet on natural sodas, Coke life and Pepsi. True.

675
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:58.249
George Reed - Noetic: there's a reason why most of us don't, and both were 100 million dollar failures.

676
01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:22.999
George Reed - Noetic: And how about Hollywood's short form streaming service quibi, which imploded in its 1st month after burning through nearly 2 billion dollars? If only they'd known their consumers well enough to avoid these mistakes. I'm George, founder of Noetic, and for consumer insight teams who need fast and accurate research, we enable an ongoing bottom up and collaborative conversation with their consumers before the product launches before millions are invested and before career ending mistakes are made.

677
01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:38.369
George Reed - Noetic: Imagine if Coke had a super low friction way to know that natural soda would be rejected, or if Quibi had understood that viewers don't want short form, Hollywood content. Nobody could have saved them billions without democratized, consumer-directed research. Let me show you how it works.

678
01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:39.890
Lilliana Robinson: 50 cents.

679
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:40.469
George Reed - Noetic: To the video.

680
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:41.620
Lilliana Robinson: 5 0.

681
01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:48.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I like the fact that you opened with examples, and you and you tied back to them in the end. I thought that was very good.

682
01:06:48.897 --> 01:06:53.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I do not like the words you used in the opening. Does anybody remember.

683
01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.200
George Reed - Noetic: You know.

684
01:06:54.465 --> 01:07:00.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's very awkward. Wait! Am I supposed to raise my hand? Am I supposed to like? What am I supposed to do

685
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:02.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so? I would open with a statement.

686
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:06.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And maybe you say something like

687
01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:14.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him): There have been

688
01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:19.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a myriad of 1 billion dollar marketing mistakes.

689
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Most people don't even remember them.

690
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:35.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Coke, natural and Pepsi free, or whatever you said, spent 2 billion dollars marketing a product that today nobody, really, nobody has any recollection of.

691
01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:41.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Quimby built, you know, spent 2 billion dollars and blew up within less than less than 4 weeks.

692
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:56.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him): These are expensive mistakes, consumer insight teams. If they had known they could have blah blah blah like I would, I'd just be a little bit more assertive and positive on them as opposed to asking a question. It's it's very difficult to open with a question.

693
01:07:57.535 --> 01:08:00.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Because you don't know how people are gonna respond.

694
01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:07.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And literally there, there are a lot of people who want to answer questions. How many of you have ever heard of, you know? Raise your hand.

695
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:20.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it's just awkward because you don't know how the how the audience is going to respond. You weren't asking them to raise their hand, but it still was. I felt, that awkward moment when I was listening. Am I supposed to, so I would be affirmative.

696
01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:25.270
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, I could just say, like some of you may remember, maybe instead of asking a question, that kind of.

697
01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:27.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Sure you could say that.

698
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then you could tie it back and say.

699
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but most of you don't.

700
01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:35.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah and when you do that.

701
01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:43.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him): There's an interesting psychological thing. So I don't remember that thing about Pepsi and Coke at all. I don't know. When did that happen? By the way.

702
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.890
George Reed - Noetic: It was like 2010, 2012.

703
01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:46.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I have.

704
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.560
George Reed - Noetic: I was trying to use more recent ones. Yeah.

705
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:59.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, yeah, I'm not a soda drinker, but I have no recollection of it. But that's okay. Because what you just did, if you say some of you may remember when Pepsi free and Coke natural whatever came out.

706
01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but and they spent billions of dollars.

707
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): if you remember it.

708
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:08.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you think oh, cool. I remember that, of course. Yeah, I'm cool. I I got that I'm in.

709
01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:10.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then you say, but most of you don't.

710
01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:14.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And for the people like me who don't. You're like, oh, okay.

711
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:15.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm normal.

712
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:16.140
George Reed - Noetic: No.

713
01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:27.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Like, I'm not insulted anymore. Right? So you kinda you hit both sides and both sides will feel good. The people who do remember it will feel exceptional. The others will feel normal. It's totally okay. It's not awkward.

714
01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): yeah. And then I like the fact that you tied it back.

715
01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:44.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then, hopefully, you're gonna demo how this is gonna work. I'm a little skeptical right now, which is good because I'm gonna pay attention. How does this thing work. How could they have known that short form.

716
01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:44.640
George Reed - Noetic: Like make.

717
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, that short form video wasn't gonna work.

718
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:55.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you can prove to me that they should have known short form video wasn't gonna work, and they could have. And then the 1st question in your QA. Could be

719
01:09:55.350 --> 01:10:06.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so. Wait a minute, George. If this had existed, you could have saved. Whoever the studio was, Disney, whatever it was, you could have saved Disney 2 billion dollars, you know. Like, yeah.

720
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:11.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like, think about that as an opening opening question.

721
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): some version of that

722
01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): cool.

723
01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:15.280
George Reed - Noetic: Thanks, trey.

724
01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Cool. Yeah, I like it.

725
01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:23.750
Lilliana Robinson: I think this came from last time you were here. I think you ha had said something about New Coke.

726
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:25.440
George Reed - Noetic: From your feedback. Exactly. Yeah, like.

727
01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, no new. And I know that new Coke was very old, and most of you don't remember it.

728
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.617
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah. And you said, Gatorade. But yeah, I was trying to. Gatorade doesn't have that. Many flops. Actually, surprisingly.

729
01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, okay.

730
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.920
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah.

731
01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.800
George Reed - Noetic: cool. Cool.

732
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.699
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, thank you. George.

733
01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.809
Lilliana Robinson: Next is

734
01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.390
Lilliana Robinson: tutor. Me?

735
01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.920
Nicholas Li: Hi, we're gonna do pitch first.st And in video our pitch, we wanna introduce what Internet.

736
01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Everybody so far has done pitch, then, video.

737
01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And that's okay. You can do that

738
01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:00.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him): if you want to stand out.

739
01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:05.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Maybe somebody should do video 1st and then pitch. It's harder.

740
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:13.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But for the right company it makes sense, Liliana. In each of the last couple of cohorts we've had like one or 2 that have done it that way right.

741
01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:20.170
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, it's only been one or 2, and Neil made it clear. I think he kind of scared everyone. He's like, you have to have a really good reason to do that.

742
01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:20.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You do.

743
01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you definitely do. But anyway, I'm just saying, All right. Sorry, Nicholas, go ahead.

744
01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:49.150
Nicholas Li: No worries. Yeah. So for the pitch, we want to start off with introducing what international baccalaureate is and give context to like. Why these students are stressed because it's not that popular in America. With the video, we wanna visually highlight the stress of the students. We're thinking of like a side by side, and showing, like the difference between having and not having this product, and what

745
01:11:49.150 --> 01:12:06.700
Nicholas Li: receiving, like immediate feedback, and do for the student in terms of giving them clarity and like confidence for the Q. And a. We want to go more deep into, like the business side stuff to answer some of the common concerns we've heard so far, including questions about like being a AI rapper or our plans beyond Ib.

746
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:08.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So

747
01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): again on your objective, I would make it

748
01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him): bigger.

749
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I might say something like

750
01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in the pitch. We want to introduce people to the concept of Ib

751
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and hopefully get them to see

752
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:30.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): how big a deal it is, and be shocked that they didn't know about it. If they didn't

753
01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him): congratulate themselves if they did.

754
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and

755
01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:39.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): at the same time show them how stressful it is for the student

756
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:44.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like I, wanna, I wanna have a bigger purpose than just. I want to tell them about. Ib.

757
01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:50.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? I want that like it'd be cool if people walked away from that thinking, damn my school should have an ib.

758
01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Why didn't my kids do that

759
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:53.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right?

760
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm just trying to get you to think bigger.

761
01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:12.129
Lilliana Robinson: No, that's really. And adding to that, one of the main reasons that you were a standout in the investment committee to get in here was because a few of the people resonated because they said, Ib, is the reason I am like where I am today.

762
01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:15.499
Lilliana Robinson: So the people who did go through it. It's emotional.

763
01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.560
Nicholas Li: Okay.

764
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.050
Nicholas Li: Yep.

765
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:20.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It very much is, yeah.

766
01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:43.449
Nicholas Li: Oh, yeah, the pitch. Imagine getting accepted to your dream university celebrating with family and friends only to have that acceptance revoked months later for international baccalaureate students worldwide, applying to universities outside of North America this nightmare is reality. One failed. Exam and your conditional offer disappears.

767
01:13:43.480 --> 01:14:05.240
Nicholas Li: Growing up in Hong Kong. I lived this pressure, my Imperial college dream hinged entirely on passing a grueling set of final exams. Like thousands of Ib students, I had tutors, but they couldn't be there at 11 Pm. When I was stuck on a practice problem questioning if I was good enough. My name is Nicholas Lee, and I built tutor me for students who struggled the same way I did.

768
01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:31.819
Nicholas Li: Tutorme is a platform designed to work alongside educators, giving Ib students the 24 7 support they so desperately need. We're not replacing traditional tutoring. We're filling the gap between tutoring and school where students feel the most vulnerable and alone. Students no longer have to scout the Internet for pirated practice exams, watch the same Youtube video for hours on end or peer review each other's papers. Instead, they use, Tutorme, ending those late night moments of panic and self-doubt

769
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.080
Nicholas Li: should.

770
01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:41.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Did you ever tell me how tutor me works like I'm assuming it's some kind of an AI Chat body.

771
01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.500
Nicholas Li: Yeah, we were thinking of like doing the product demo in.

772
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:45.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Demo.

773
01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.499
Nicholas Li: Product in the video, like.

774
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:52.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I understand. But this whole time I'm like, is this an army of tutors?

775
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:55.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Is this videos? What is it.

776
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:58.716
Nicholas Li: Yeah, it is what you said. The AI

777
01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:02.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So so you have an opportunity here with a couple words.

778
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:07.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you tell your story, Hong Kong blah blah. And then you say

779
01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:11.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him): with Tutor, me's AI chat.

780
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:15.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Whatever you got to get a phrase, a catchphrase that's really quick

781
01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): with tutor. Me's

782
01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him): AI driven

783
01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him): interactive

784
01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): tutoring

785
01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:32.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): students can get as much tutoring as they want whenever they want, wherever they want. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! You know we adapt.

786
01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:39.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, the agent automatically adapts to the tone of the student learns from each individual student and delivers custom curriculum.

787
01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:42.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It makes students more successful.

788
01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:57.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like, I just, I think there's something you have to do to describe it, because otherwise I'm going through this thing, and I'm like, is it AI? He didn't say AI. He would have said AI if it was AI, so I don't know what the hell it is. It was literally what was going through my head.

789
01:15:58.090 --> 01:16:03.149
Nicholas Li: Is there anything you can recommend to cut because we're already short on time? And I did speak a bit too quickly.

790
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:10.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): yeah, you have to. You have to be more judicious with your words.

791
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:12.989
Troy Henikoff (he/him): there wasn't, I mean.

792
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): E.

793
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:28.323
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The the process of cutting out words is one where you literally have to go through the script and look at it and be like, Oh, that's extraneous! That's extraneous, that's extraneous. It's sort of like editing someone's letter. I can't. I don't have them all in my head right now.

794
01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:35.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but yeah, no, I don't. I think you're close enough that you're gonna be able to do that. And you're gonna have to add a few words. But you're not gonna have to add that much.

795
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:39.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But think about what are the bullet points you're trying to make.

796
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:45.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and anything that is not making those 3 bullet points or 2 bullet points should be removed.

797
01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it will fail. Scary for you

798
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:55.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to remove them. It will feel much better for everybody listening to have a more concise pitch.

799
01:16:57.690 --> 01:16:59.420
Nicholas Li: Okay, that's great advice. Thank you.

800
01:17:01.723 --> 01:17:02.286
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And

801
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:07.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): what was your opening line? It was sort of a question, wasn't it?

802
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.090
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I was gonna.

803
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:09.310
Nicholas Li: Imagine getting

804
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:10.550
Nicholas Li: sorry.

805
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:20.289
Lilliana Robinson: I was. I was gonna also talk about the opener. I don't know if Troy you can help Nick like say it more emotionally like it's supposed to be like kind of a gut wrench. You can say it, Nick.

806
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:22.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, it was. Imagine getting into the school of.

807
01:17:22.690 --> 01:17:29.270
Nicholas Li: Imagine getting accepted university celebrating blah blah, and then that offer can be revoked. If you fail, your exam.

808
01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:42.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright. I don't know if you have time to do this, I'm gonna make it up. I don't. What's the date that people get University acceptance, like March 15th or April first, st or something in the Us. March 15.th So

809
01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:48.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): March 15th in the Us. Is the day that every High School Senior knows what university they're going to go to

810
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the rest of the world. It's not that way.

811
01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:58.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You may get accepted on March 15, th but if you don't pass that final exam. Your application is revoked.

812
01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Talk about pressure.

813
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:02.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him): No senioritis there.

814
01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:04.953
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Boom! Boom!

815
01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, and then you can go into.

816
01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, using the ib, whatever.

817
01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:11.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay.

818
01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:15.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like, there's an opportunity to do a compare and contrast.

819
01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:21.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And and maybe it's not as visceral to you, because you went to school in high school in Hong Kong. But

820
01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:32.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him): literally here, you know, what happens is senior year of high school. Once you get accepted, once you're in, you're like, I'm coasting, but I don't. Even as long as I don't fail anything, I'm good.

821
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:33.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right?

822
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:36.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so we call it senioritis.

823
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.829
Nicholas Li: Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. I'll play around with the word to see where I can figure that in.

824
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

825
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.639
Nicholas Li: Thank you.

826
01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:56.709
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I think that's way better than the opener you gave. So I would watch this recording back and try and deliver it, and you have to deliver it in the same way Troy did, where it's like with emotion, because when you.

827
01:18:56.710 --> 01:18:57.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): There's.

828
01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:57.730
Lilliana Robinson: 1st time it.

829
01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, there's that part, you know.

830
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:08.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): March 15.th It's the day that every senior in in the United States knows if they're going to college where they're going.

831
01:19:08.670 --> 01:19:10.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and senioritis sinks in.

832
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him): not where I went to school in Hong Kong with international baccalaureate.

833
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:20.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Sure, we got in, but we had to pass that exam in June.

834
01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It was pressure. It was hard we were nervous. I don't know.

835
01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:43.229
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, and using the word revoked like that dream school acceptance could be revoked. And then, just like pause for dramatic effect, it'll grab everyone's attention for the rest of the 6Â min like that investment in that opener like, and really saying it correctly, will get everybody to watch all the way till the end, which is really great.

836
01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.754
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. Revoked is a a harsh

837
01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:50.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a harsh word. It's great. It'll get people's attention. I love that.

838
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

839
01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:55.649
Lilliana Robinson: But the whole thing needed some more intonation. It was kind of monotone.

840
01:19:55.890 --> 01:19:59.010
Lilliana Robinson: the whole thing, and you need more pauses.

841
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:01.380
Nicholas Li: Got it. Thank you.

842
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:04.340
Lilliana Robinson: Cool. Okay, let's move on to looney. 8.

843
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:05.700
Lilliana Robinson: Dominique.

844
01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.200
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Hi! Hi! Troy! Thank you for this opportunity.

845
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:10.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Hello!

846
01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:22.179
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Hi, it's always helpful to hear everyone's pictures and feedback. So in terms of objectives, so specifically for the pitch, we are looking for

847
01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:43.650
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: financial firms. More specifically, wealth managers who are looking to improve their marketing with the objective to reach the next Gen. Of investors. So that would either be people in the audience, or at least the audience being excited. That hey? I know someone in my network that could really benefit from looneyate. And

848
01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:47.769
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: this is awesome. I'm going to introduce them. So it's really to get follow up meetings.

849
01:20:48.327 --> 01:20:50.159
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: In terms of the

850
01:20:50.170 --> 01:21:09.789
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: demo video. Which I'm now thinking earlier when you said about the demo. We we've not written it in that way, but now I'm thinking whether to show it first.st But I'll visit that latter? But the demo video really shows the how like, what are we building? What is the solution? How does this work? And then the QA. We really want to focus on.

851
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:23.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Again, I want to get back to the objective. If what you're doing is showing the how your objective is to gain credibility, that we can actually deliver on the promise we set up right. Think about it from the perspective of the audience.

852
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:25.650
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: yep.

853
01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:55.729
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: right? And this is recorded. But I really like that's really helpful yeah it's the it's the credibility absolutely and then segwaying into the QA. This is really the proof point. So we want to focus on the fact that we pivoted in techstars. You know, we were live a month before Demo Day last week we closed our 1st customer. We're hoping to have that week on week growth until demo day. So that's really talking about the proof and the fact that the pain is there, and we're the right people to solve it.

854
01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:59.530
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: So that's how we're thinking about the 3 elements together.

855
01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:01.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right. Let's hear it.

856
01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.100
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Okay.

857
01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.080
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Alright.

858
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:14.520
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: We're currently in the greatest wealth transfer of all time. Millennials are set to inherit 90 trillion dollars in the Us. Alone.

859
01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:22.419
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: with 8 out of 10 millennials seeking professional financial advice online. This presents a massive opportunity for wealth managers.

860
01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:36.230
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: but over 50% of financial firms are archaic. They are held back by outdated systems and lengthy compliance approval processes. This makes it really difficult for marketing teams to effectively reach this millennial audience

861
01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:44.370
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: as the former global head at the world's largest wealth manager. I saw this problem firsthand, and it cost my firm millions of dollars.

862
01:22:44.510 --> 01:23:02.349
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Firms must provide digital content at scale to connect and engage with this next Gen. Audience. And that's why we've built looneyate an AI powered platform that automates the creation and distribution of compliant sentiment driven content to help those financial marketing leaders reach the millennial investor.

863
01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:10.980
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: I'm Dominique, CEO, and co-founder of looneyate. Let me show you how we're helping financial firms capture their share of the 90 million wealth, transfer.

864
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:18.117
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I really like it at at the end you said 90 million, and I think you meant 90 trillion.

865
01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.770
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Yeah, he wasn't supposed to be that. But, thanks.

866
01:23:21.495 --> 01:23:22.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Stop.

867
01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:22.610
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Give me!

868
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:30.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I was listening for the 90 I was listening for, how you were. Gonna tie it in a bow and tie it back to your opening, and you did a beautiful job.

869
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:36.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You just have to get the 1 million thing out of there. But no, I think it's great. I I have

870
01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:38.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): enough of a

871
01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:43.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): from listening to that. I have enough of a idea in my head of what you're doing.

872
01:23:43.730 --> 01:23:56.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but I don't know all the details like, I know you're doing some marketing stuff. I know it's a driven. It's probably specific, like to channel or to person. I don't know how granular you get, and you're gonna help these archaic

873
01:23:56.671 --> 01:24:01.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): wealth managers actually reach out and get get a piece of the action like it.

874
01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:05.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Tell me more. My reaction to that was, I can't wait to see the video.

875
01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:06.490
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Okay.

876
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:08.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Which is a really good reaction, right

877
01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:13.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like that was my reaction to your pitch was, I want to see the video. I want to see how this works.

878
01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.910
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Okay, that's.

879
01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:15.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it was good.

880
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:18.169
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: To do that first.st So thank you.

881
01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:37.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, no, I think it was great. It was it. You had all of the elements, you, and even the the little bit like when you introduce yourself. The 1st time I knew this problem myself, because I was the head of marketing for the largest global wealth manager or whatever in the world like you added a few words that made it made you so sound so credible.

882
01:24:38.130 --> 01:24:39.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Where were you? What firm was it.

883
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:41.550
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: At Ubs.

884
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:51.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, you might want to throw ubs in there instead of largest global, whatever it's up to you. Ubs is obviously a very credible name. Everybody knows of it.

885
01:24:51.825 --> 01:24:53.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It doesn't feel, you know.

886
01:24:53.610 --> 01:25:01.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him): when you said largest global. It felt like, Oh, maybe she's fighting what one like, you know, being more transparent, but I loved it. I thought it was great.

887
01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:11.819
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Thank you. Well, that's thanks to your feedback from last time. So I'm glad it's improved. But definitely on ubs, I I actually removed it, because I didn't know whether everybody would know

888
01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:15.169
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: cause I was one. But I guess the people that need to know

889
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:16.010
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: no.

890
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Investors know ubs.

891
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:19.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a hundred percent.

892
01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:20.459
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: I can. Okay.

893
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:29.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I mean, it's not a they don't advertise heavily. I don't know that your millennials will know it. The people who are potential investors in your company all know it.

894
01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:30.900
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Got it.

895
01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:35.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And if you said, and if you maybe you're redundant, maybe you say the largest global

896
01:25:36.803 --> 01:25:37.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know.

897
01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him): wealth management firm ubs.

898
01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.250
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Yep.

899
01:25:41.825 --> 01:25:43.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Then you kind of have both.

900
01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:47.452
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Yeah, okay, perfect. I'll add it back in. Thank you so much. Troy.

901
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:50.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it's great. How many do we have left? Liliana?

902
01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:52.680
Lilliana Robinson: Just one

903
01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:54.660
Lilliana Robinson: cogniscope.

904
01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:56.570
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, I think, just let.

905
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:57.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Do it.

906
01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:06.449
Ãoruh | CogniScope: So. So we are starting with a pitch emphasizing the problem with a real life crisis case and our value proposition. And then the video will show.

907
01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:06.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That was.

908
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:07.560
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Cogniscope.

909
01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Did he miss?

910
01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What did he miss.

911
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.590
George Reed - Noetic: Who.

912
01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:15.300
Lilliana Robinson: Hey! George!

913
01:26:17.050 --> 01:26:19.980
George Reed - Noetic: I just said, Is he? Who's he helping.

914
01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:20.949
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, what?

915
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:26.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You said, we're gonna we're gonna start with the problem. But you don't tell me what the problem is

916
01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him): person to do.

917
01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:29.950
Lilliana Robinson: Do this.

918
01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:32.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Be specific.

919
01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:37.720
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Okay, I I will start with the real life crisis that Sony had and lost.

920
01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:41.199
Ãoruh | CogniScope: like 300 over 300,000 people

921
01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:43.160
Ãoruh | CogniScope: within a single decision

922
01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:45.470
Ãoruh | CogniScope: emphasizing the problem.

923
01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:49.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay? So I still don't know what the problem is.

924
01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:56.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right? So you're gonna start with a real life example where Sony, a major brand.

925
01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Did? What.

926
01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:03.720
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Major Brand published a minor update.

927
01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:09.810
Ãoruh | CogniScope: and because of that 6, they lost 65% of their community in a month.

928
01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Like a software update.

929
01:27:12.130 --> 01:27:15.700
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, like, they changed how you log into the game.

930
01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.240
Ãoruh | CogniScope: basically. And people were pissed.

931
01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:23.529
Ãoruh | CogniScope: And they left like 300,000 reviewed in 4 days.

932
01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:32.339
Ãoruh | CogniScope: and they their game got delisted on a hundred 70 countries, and people get their refunds.

933
01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:35.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay. So I'm gonna start with

934
01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:41.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him): an example of where a major game publisher had a flaw in their quality control.

935
01:27:42.650 --> 01:27:48.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): published an update that lost them a 3rd of their revenue and user base.

936
01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:56.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right? So I'm getting down to the nitty, gritty game publisher quality control flaw

937
01:27:56.490 --> 01:28:00.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): cost them billions of dollars awesome. Now I got that part. What's next?

938
01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:12.259
Ãoruh | CogniScope: The next is our value proposition, how we can change it, what we do. And then the video will show a use case.

939
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:17.479
Ãoruh | CogniScope: how actually cogniscope operates like, how do we actually do?

940
01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:21.030
Ãoruh | CogniScope: How do we actually delivered our value proposition?

941
01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.499
Ãoruh | CogniScope: And then I'll answer the market and our difference and our vision in the Q&A section.

942
01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, and again.

943
01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I don't know why I keep having to repeat this. But in the second piece

944
01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:54.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it's not about. I'll show you how we deliver. It's I will build credibility that we can deliver the thing that we said. We're gonna do, or I will leave the audience with confidence that we are the right ones, that we thought this through, that we have the right solution, right? It's about the audience. It's not about your pushing. I'm gonna tell them

945
01:28:54.980 --> 01:29:05.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it's about their perception is they have confidence in you. Right? This is a subtle thing. But I mean literally 3 quarters of you didn't say this.

946
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:12.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I feel like I've said this for 3 quarters of you like. Think about what emotion you want to evoke in your audience.

947
01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:20.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and if you're tied into that. And you're thinking about it. You're going to be much more likely to actually get it

948
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:26.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right. And that's what's gonna actually get you to where you want to be on Demo Day. All right, let's hear it.

949
01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.350
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Okay.

950
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:34.010
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Sony's game, Helldivers. 2 lost 65% of their community within a month.

951
01:29:34.170 --> 01:29:39.409
Ãoruh | CogniScope: due to a minor login update that triggered 300,000 negative reviews.

952
01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:46.110
Ãoruh | CogniScope: By the time Sony figured out the problem it was just too late. Players had already lost trust and moved on

953
01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:57.920
Ãoruh | CogniScope: my co-founders, and I saw this issue right away, and even reached out with our concerns about data, privacy, and game progress. But our feedback was drowned in a flood of frustrated comments.

954
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:00.759
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Helldivers 2 is just one example.

955
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:11.749
Ãoruh | CogniScope: This year alone, over 1 billion dollars gaining investment evaporated simply because studios didn't fully understand their communities. And some studios even had to shut down.

956
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:19.289
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Remember, when Facebook revealed it could predict relationship breakups before the people involved even knew

957
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:22.470
Ãoruh | CogniScope: at cogniscope, we do that for gaming companies.

958
01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:31.970
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Our psychology driven AI dive deep into community channels to help studios truly understand their players and catch issues before they escalate.

959
01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:40.959
Ãoruh | CogniScope: I'm choru. And with cogniscope, we help studios create games that players genuinely love by uncovering the why behind the what

960
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:58.130
Ãoruh | CogniScope: studios can quantify their decisions to see the impact on the community making it easier to make smarter choices in today's world of community-driven games. Delving in the player's mind isn't just helpful, but it's essential. Cogniscope makes sure that

961
01:30:58.250 --> 01:31:05.570
Ãoruh | CogniScope: gamers feel hurt, empowers developer with smarter decisions, and gives publishers more confidence in their investments.

962
01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:10.282
Lilliana Robinson: That was 1Â min 35 seconds. So you have to cut it down.

963
01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:11.390
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Okay.

964
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:13.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It felt long. So

965
01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:18.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I see that you tried to pull in the the Facebook example we talked about last time.

966
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:24.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think you I think you can tie those loose ends together

967
01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:27.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): much more quickly and much more strongly.

968
01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:38.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You know you could say, you know, for years Facebook has said that they know when 2 people are going to break up before they do by looking at the interaction in their in their chat.

969
01:31:39.150 --> 01:31:41.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We know when

970
01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:48.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him): customers of games or gamers are gonna abandon a game long before they do by looking at the interaction in their chat.

971
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are bringing that kind of AI to

972
01:31:52.536 --> 01:31:55.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to bear whatever blah blah blah like. I would. I.

973
01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:55.490
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Wouldn't.

974
01:31:55.490 --> 01:32:01.987
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That parallel, and you can cut out a lot of your other words and tighten it up a lot.

975
01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:05.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): okay, submit.

976
01:32:05.610 --> 01:32:07.029
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Should I cut down.

977
01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:12.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If I'm right, you're you have nothing to do with quality control. You're just monitoring chat.

978
01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:18.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay. So then I think the the opening

979
01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:26.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): let me think about something for a second. What if you said something like this?

980
01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We all make mistakes.

981
01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:34.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we don't all recover from them. Well.

982
01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Sony made a mistake in its gaming platform.

983
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:47.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): had an error in the login that cost them 65% of their multi-billion dollar user base because they didn't recover. Well.

984
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:50.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): they should have known

985
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:54.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the discord was wild with chat about it

986
01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:59.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the minute it was released. But it took Sony over a month to correct the problem.

987
01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:06.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Had they had cogniscope they would have known about it the minute the 1st comment was posted

988
01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:09.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and save billions of dollars.

989
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:16.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We monitor chat to get the sentiment analysis of what's going on with a with a Gamers user base.

990
01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:20.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We have the artificial intelligence to learn.

991
01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.942
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm I know I'm going down too many threads

992
01:33:24.330 --> 01:33:32.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But then you could bring in the Facebook thing. I don't know how you transition to it. But you could bring in the Facebook thing Facebook has said for years. They know when people are going to break up by the chat before they do.

993
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:37.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We know when gamers are going to leave a platform before they do by their chat.

994
01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:47.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we're we're exposing this technology. We're using this technology to expose these insights to the to the game publishers so that they can be smarter

995
01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:51.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so that they can recover well, so that they won't make the fatal mistakes.

996
01:33:52.110 --> 01:33:53.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let me show you how it works.

997
01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:57.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Does that feel better? Yeah.

998
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:59.180
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Yeah.

999
01:33:59.790 --> 01:34:04.410
Ãoruh | CogniScope: I think the value proposition part was too long. We we can just like cut it in.

1000
01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:04.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yes.

1001
01:34:05.230 --> 01:34:05.710
Ãoruh | CogniScope: I.

1002
01:34:05.710 --> 01:34:09.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I really like the idea of. We all make mistakes.

1003
01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:16.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but we're judged by how well we recover from them. I believe that in my heart right.

1004
01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:17.140
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Yeah.

1005
01:34:17.449 --> 01:34:20.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Sony made a simple mistake. They had a bad login.

1006
01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:26.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It cost them billions of dollars and 65% of their user base. They didn't recover. Well.

1007
01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:30.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it was out in the public for over a month before they fixed the bug.

1008
01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:33.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Had they had cogniscope

1009
01:34:33.650 --> 01:34:39.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we would have fixed it, we would have notified them in minutes, giving them the opportunity

1010
01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to recover gracefully.

1011
01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know.

1012
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:45.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

1013
01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.690
Ãoruh | CogniScope: I can work on that.

1014
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right. It's up to you again.

1015
01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think we're done, Liliana, right.

1016
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:56.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You all like you feel free to plagiarize as much as you want.

1017
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:58.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him): This has all been recorded.

1018
01:34:59.730 --> 01:35:09.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but make sure that you're delivering something that you believe in your heart that is is authentic to you, that you can deliver with passion.

1019
01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:23.179
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and that you believe in. And you're gonna get more feedback from other folks. And they are, gonna you know, this is almost like mentor madness. You're gonna be told to go left, right up, down, forward, backward. You have to understand the why

1020
01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:28.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I tried to focus on the why with a lot of you, right? I kept hammering on you.

1021
01:35:28.530 --> 01:35:38.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know. Define the problem, define it more clearly. Tell me this like, what are your objectives? Because if you understand the why, then you can decide which. Why is better, for you

1022
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:48.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): don't just take feedback. Someone says, Go, left. Someone says, Go right. You're like, what should I do? Go left or right. You have to understand why they said, go left! Why, they said, Go right and do what's right for you

1023
01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): all right

1024
01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.589
Troy Henikoff (he/him): any last minute. Questions.

1025
01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:04.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I am going to be there in person, so I'm expecting great things out of all of you. I've got my plane ticket. I'm coming in on Friday morning.

1026
01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:05.450
Lilliana Robinson: Yay!

1027
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:07.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I'm excited to see it.

1028
01:36:08.290 --> 01:36:20.500
Lilliana Robinson: Great news. Okay, thanks so much, Troy. I think we'll see you in 2 weeks for one final pass, so I can't wait for you to see where these get. They should be pretty finalized at that point. Troy's not gonna give you like.

1029
01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.580
Lilliana Robinson: I'm not gonna.

1030
01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:24.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Try to change them. I'm going to try to help you on delivery.

1031
01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.630
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly. Alright!

1032
01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:29.100
Lilliana Robinson: Great thanks again for your time, Troy.

1033
01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:30.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Be well, take care, everybody.

1034
01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:30.880
George Reed - Noetic: Thanks. Troy.

1035
01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:31.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Bye.

1036
01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:32.867
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Thank you. Bye.

1037
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Bye.

1038
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:36.680
Lilliana Robinson: Bye, okay, see? You guys, later.

1039
01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:38.969
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Hi! Thanks. Liliana.
