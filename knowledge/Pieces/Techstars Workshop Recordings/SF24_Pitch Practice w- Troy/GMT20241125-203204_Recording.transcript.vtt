1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Friday, right.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.929
Lilliana Robinson: How exciting is that this is! You have not missed a Bay Area Demo day yet, because you were on stage for 2 of them. And now you're gonna attend. It's great.

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm very excited. Yeah.

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:29.099
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. Okay? Well, I'm excited for you to hear the pitches, because Neil and I had individual practice sessions with each of the founders last Thursday and Friday. And so they've really they've really become something different. Tomorrow is their final approval. Deadline. So

5
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:44.879
Lilliana Robinson: these are not like approved, finalized yet. So if there's anything you want them to switch or anything, they still have time. They have a day. But I know that you wanna also focus a lot more on delivery and such in that vein. Do you want them to stand up so that you can give them like delivery?

6
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it's way better. If you stand. When you deliver you can. You can still read off the screen.

7
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But what happens is you're just much more energetic and animated when you're standing. It's hard to be animated when you're sitting.

8
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And actually, if you've noticed a lot of times I'm standing when I'm talking to you guys.

9
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:11.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm traveling today. So it's a little harder. I'm at a laptop, whatever at my fake background. It's the fake background of my real background.

10
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.090
Lilliana Robinson: Never touched.

11
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): yeah. So anyway. But yeah. So if I met a funny angle, it's because I'm standing up to try to be more animated with you all.

12
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So what I'd love you to do is to give your pitch, and to

13
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:52.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him): really think about not just the words, but how you want to deliver them. So I know that I've helped a couple of you over the last couple of weeks, and one of the things that is has helped me to help you better is when you have sent me either an audio or a video of your pitch, because I can hear your intonation. I can feel the passion. And that's a really important component of that pitch. Not just the words that are on paper.

14
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I'm ready whenever you are.

15
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:24.479
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. So why don't? Why don't you guys find a way to you can even just tilt your screen back and like, stand up, even if it's not that great of an angle. But it's important. When it's your turn you stand. It's another reason outside of us being able to hear your energy is that if you're just practicing sitting down this whole time when you get to next week and you start giving it standing up, it's going to be completely different. And you're going to not remember it. And you're going to be confused. Why, it's so different. And it's because you weren't practicing in the way you're going to perform it.

16
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.570
Lilliana Robinson: So.

17
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yep.

18
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.760
Lilliana Robinson: Not negative.

19
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:36.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'll tell you guys a quick story on this line, and I wish I had known this when I was younger. So there's this. There's this saying that

20
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:51.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): practice how you want to perform right? And what happens is, however, you practice it. You build muscle memory in that way, and then, when you're on stage and you get nervous, you will default to whatever is most comfortable, which is the way you've been practicing.

21
00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:06.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So when I was an athlete in high school, they would have us do drills, and I hated doing the drills. I was like, this is such a waste of time, and I would do them half ass, and I wouldn't do them with good form, because I just had to do 10 on this side and 10 on that side, and whatever.

22
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:21.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I was my own worst enemy if I had understood. The reason you do, drills is to perfect that muscle motion, whatever that motion is so that in the game, in the sport you default to that perfect motion.

23
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): when you do them half-assed, you default to half-assed

24
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? And so, if you want to be great on stage. Now is the time that you start practicing

25
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like you want to perform.

26
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:46.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so it really is important that you practice standing up, that you practice having a motion when you talk, that you use pacing, sometimes quiet and slow, sometimes fast and loud, because you're excited.

27
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because if you get used to reading, just a drone to memorize the words. That's what you will sound like when you get on stage.

28
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Pretty good.

29
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right.

30
00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:06.660
Lilliana Robinson: Agreed. Also, practice standing still. That's a huge one. People are always shocked when they get into Week 13. And I make them start over because they're pacing all around.

31
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:17.419
Lilliana Robinson: You have to plant your feet. You can take a step forward at a moment that is for dramatic purpose. Otherwise you shouldn't be moving. It's very distracting. And it makes you look nervous.

32
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.589
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, so those are all our tips. Who would like to go first.st

33
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.880
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, do we already have names in the chat.

34
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.020
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, no, that's Fabio. Okay, okay, Dave, you got it.

35
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.420
Dave Scott: Hey, guys?

36
00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:36.209
Dave Scott: Let me see if I can set up my camera so that you guys can see me.

37
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.503
Lilliana Robinson: Good. Go ahead and stand up, Dave Troy! Do you want them to start again with their objective? So you can remember

38
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:52.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it's really helpful, not just for me, but I think it's helpful for you. My objective is, and give a very clear objective for what you want to achieve in this 1 min.

39
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because it will help you as you're delivering your 1 min.

40
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.675
Troy Henikoff (he/him): or do you want to know their objective for all of demo day, like

41
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him): focus on the pitch at this point, because we're not gonna change the other stuff.

42
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.979
Lilliana Robinson: So who are you speaking to in this pitch? Go ahead and answer that question.

43
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.490
Lilliana Robinson: What do you want them to get.

44
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:20.200
Dave Scott: Yeah, I am speaking to potential investors to close my round unless my round has already been closed, and then I'll be speaking to potential investors for my next round.

45
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.390
Lilliana Robinson: Where do you want them?

46
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If it is.

47
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.780
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

48
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yep.

49
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.849
Dave Scott: And so my objective is to be able to schedule as many, many meetings as possible

50
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.429
Dave Scott: after this Demo day.

51
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.450
Lilliana Robinson: So join me for the pitch specific. Sorry to interrupt.

52
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:43.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So so let's let's pretend we're doing jobs to be done. So you want to get those meetings. And what are you gonna do in order to get those meetings.

53
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.180
Dave Scott: Yeah.

54
00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:56.480
Dave Scott: My pitch is to introduce them into the market that I'm selling, into, which is tabletop games. Help them understand why there's been a disruption, and how my product is gonna solve

55
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.730
Dave Scott: that particular disruption, such that I'm going to dominate this industry.

56
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:24.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So I'd say it a little differently. We're getting to the right track. But to cut to the chase, I'd say my goal is to get people to understand the massive size of this tabletop game industry, the seismic, the the change that's happening to online and be curious about how you know, and and want to ask me. Engage with me more about how we're going to dominate the industry.

57
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So it's about them, not you. So I don't like. When people say my objective is to describe my business.

58
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:41.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Anybody can do that. Your objective is to get curiosity out of the audience about your business. Your objective is to get right because you want an impact and effect on them.

59
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So all right, Dave, let's hear it.

60
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:52.439
Dave Scott: Okay. So I made a major change to this and I. And you guys have already heard my last one. I want to get back, get feedback on this major change.

61
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yep.

62
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.999
Dave Scott: At the last minute, right?

63
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:03.790
Dave Scott: Thanks to shows like stranger things, tabletop role, playing games like dungeons and dragons are as popular as ever.

64
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:11.829
Dave Scott: Over a hundred 50 million gamers come together with friends and family each week to throw dice.

65
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:22.339
Dave Scott: but then Covid prevented people from getting together in person, and permanently disrupted the way this 50 year old game was being played.

66
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.249
Dave Scott: even though people couldn't get together like they used to.

67
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.000
Dave Scott: The demand has never changed.

68
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:40.559
Dave Scott: I'm Dave Scott, founder of evil genius games. We make it easy to recreate the physical game experience on the computer anywhere in the world.

69
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.349
Dave Scott: We're ushering in the future of tabletop games.

70
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:55.159
Dave Scott: Since launching 2 years ago we have grown to 35,000 customers, and we're on a path to hit 2 million dollars in revenue. In 2024

71
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.859
Dave Scott: we created the perfect solution to make stranger things more familiar than ever.

72
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.619
Lilliana Robinson: Great job, Dave. That was almost exactly a minute.

73
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:15.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I liked it. I mean you, you and I've gone back and forth. I don't feel like it. Was that different than our last rendition. What was so different.

74
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:24.879
Dave Scott: So what I actually did is I removed the concept about, we amplify we. This amplified the loneliness epidemic so many people experience during the pandemic

75
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Dave Scott: and I removed. We're here to restore those social relationships and cure the loneliness so pharmacological.

76
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I mean for me. The big catch was Giant market 150 million people.

77
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:43.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They're still wanting to do it today. And you already have 35,000 paying customers who've given you 2 million bucks. I'm interested

78
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:50.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like the fact that you have 2035,000 people who've given you 2 million dollars means there is traction here.

79
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I love it.

80
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.399
Dave Scott: Oh, I got the L. Word from Troy.

81
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:03.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, no, I really I do. And and I think your and I think your delivery was good. Did you guys notice how he

82
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him): paused.

83
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How he used his voice! He used his hands to emphasize like stranger things like you. I

84
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think you just

85
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:21.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him): polish like, you know. Keep polishing the delivery. So it's totally comfortable. You can do it in your sleep, and you're going to get up on stage, and it's going to be effortless.

86
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I wouldn't change anything.

87
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.689
Lilliana Robinson: I knew it was great.

88
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:32.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm curious, I mean, I am very open to hearing other suggestions. Anybody have any other comments or suggestions.

89
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:47.800
Lilliana Robinson: I would just say I I'm guessing that a lot of that delivery was like kind of spur of the moment like that. That's not something you could consistently do 5 times, and it would be the same every time. So I encourage you to watch this recording back and watch what you were doing, and try and like.

90
00:09:47.800 --> 00:10:10.200
Lilliana Robinson: bake it into the pie. So it's not just that that happened to be good, but you can do it consistently like that every time, because you have to add the nerve element right? It'll be a little bit different. So make it second nature, like I loved. How you pause before you said like making it familiar again, and like whatever you did in your body, there was like very confident. So just watch it back, and then practice doing that again and again.

91
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yep.

92
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.440
Lilliana Robinson: Great, great job. Thanks for starting us off, Dave. Okay, Morgan.

93
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.010
Lilliana Robinson: Where's market? Are you able to see that.

94
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Phone booth. So I mean, I'm just going to get in the corner of the phone booth all right.

95
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.150
Lilliana Robinson: That's fine!

96
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.730
Morgan Stanton: Don't still fit.

97
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.030
Morgan Stanton: Alright, what's happening?

98
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:51.800
Morgan Stanton: Okay, yeah. To start with the objective. So my objective for the pitch specifically is to get people excited for the video and to come talk to me to the networking event afterward. So it's the really kind of like real people.

99
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Very clear.

100
00:10:52.590 --> 00:11:03.389
Morgan Stanton: Interested on doing. And then the objective of Demo Day is to get these investors. I've spoken to a little bit over the year coming in for a second meeting.

101
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yep.

102
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:10.769
Morgan Stanton: Okay, exploring the deep blue sea, the great unknown

103
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.939
Morgan Stanton: words from famed oceanographer, Jacques Cousteau.

104
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.570
Morgan Stanton: No, these are phrases used to describe female gynecological health.

105
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:28.359
Morgan Stanton: I'm Morgan Stanton. I'm the CEO of opal therapeutics. I have a Phd. I'm a scientist. I'm here to ask, why are we still so lost when it comes to the uterus.

106
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:36.440
Morgan Stanton: Even in us market valued at over 180 billion dollars. Ambitions in women's health have remained timid. Some would even say, meager.

107
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:48.690
Morgan Stanton: does this sit right with you? Should we settle for mediocre when it comes to your health, your daughter's health, your mom's health, because right now women are forced to accept a lower standard of care and a lower quality of life than men.

108
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:55.640
Morgan Stanton: The good news, biotech and pharma are waking up to this problem. Losing a few 1 billion dollars in bad experiments will do that to you.

109
00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:10.239
Morgan Stanton: So let's forge a new path forward. No more treating women's health as uncharted waters at Opal. Female biology isn't just seen. It's deeply understood. It's prioritized, and it's valued. So let me show you how we got here. And more importantly how Opal is going to fix it.

110
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.440
Lilliana Robinson: 1 0, 1.

111
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, I think your opening is awesome.

112
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:28.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I I had forgotten where it was going, and when I heard, I'm like, Oh, that's right. And I just big smile came across my face. Because I think it really is. It's 1 of those openings where you have misdirection.

113
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:37.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and what that means to me is, I think you're going one way, and I'm like Whoa! I better pay attention. She went a totally different direction. So I really like the opening

114
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:46.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the piece that's missing for me. And maybe this would come in. The video is from just your words. I have no idea what your product is. I have no idea what you do.

115
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:59.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so you have to decide. Is that okay? And is there enough suspense and your video going to get their attention. Enough that paired. They're going to be perfect.

116
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:09.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Or do you need to tease out the fact that you know? Yes, we have built an actual physical model of the like whatever. However, you want to describe it.

117
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, in your, in your.

118
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:16.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in your opening. Since I haven't seen your video, I don't know. And those 2 parry go together.

119
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:21.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But you should know that at the end of the minute I had no idea what your product was.

120
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.190
Lilliana Robinson: That was.

121
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.510
Morgan Stanton: Yeah.

122
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:37.959
Lilliana Robinson: Idea right, Morgan, like he said he, Neil was saying, like, it's going to be hard to get people to listen for all 6 min with how deep science this is. So he wanted Morgan to kind of take the route of spending the 1st minute to get people's investment of their attention.

123
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:52.929
Morgan Stanton: And yeah, so the the video is exactly what you said. I, I go more showcase. Some like prettier science pictures in the video and the Q&A. There's more about like how we are an actual business. I just don't want people to get bored. If I'm doing too much technical biotech talk.

124
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I mean, I, what I remember is, you have some sort of a physical model of a uterus. Right?

125
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So are you. Do you show that right away in the video.

126
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.870
Morgan Stanton: It's in the. It's in the second half of the video.

127
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:17.059
Lilliana Robinson: It shows in like a lab coat in the lab, actually doing stuff and like kind of explains part of the product. And then they show it later, they explain their pilot customer and what they're doing for them.

128
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:22.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And do you tie it back to your pitch, IE.

129
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Something like, you know, we're not exploring the deep blues.

130
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): See, we have

131
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:41.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him): opal. You know we had. We had. We actually know we somehow tie it back to that phrase about the deep blue sea, or somehow the unknown or Jacques Cousteau, or like.

132
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:57.920
Morgan Stanton: That's a good, but I don't exactly tie it to Jacques Cousteau. The intro part of the video is showcasing, like, why we are here now, like why this problem exists like a very quick historical perspective of like, Hey, like women's health, is being ignored for a long time. And this is why we don't know about it. Here's opal for the solution.

133
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then you show the solution.

134
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:09.769
Morgan Stanton: Yeah, I talk about our pilot, how we're doing that. And then I show, like, what we're doing. If the the uterine organoid like, yeah. Organ model for the uterus.

135
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I just wanna make sure that you

136
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:19.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you it'd be interesting for you to share your pitch

137
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:24.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and your video with someone who has no idea what you do, and get their reaction

138
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like. Do you put them to sleep before you shut before it appears?

139
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Are they intrigued and and suspenseful and and do it.

140
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:53.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'd experiment with it with a handful of people who don't have a vested interest in you like. See if you can get maybe co-founders of some of the other company. Well, they'll know what you do. But see if you can get how you know. Don't do it with your immediate family. Don't do it with the Ceos around the table, who know what you're doing. See what reaction you get.

141
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:59.889
Lilliana Robinson: Go ask the the galvanized front desk. People like Pooja would listen. He has no idea what you do.

142
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:10.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, people like that. It'd be awesome. I do think that your opening is great. It is such misdirection that it just made me sit up in my seat and pay attention.

143
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.530
Lilliana Robinson: Couple of

144
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:37.040
Lilliana Robinson: delivery things. The beginning awesome. I think you should pause before you say before you introduce yourself, because you give a really good line before that, like it's been ignored for hundreds of years. Like pause, I'm Morgan Stanton. And then the second half was extremely rushed. So you had this great pace, this great like? What would you say like certainty in your words?

145
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:58.679
Lilliana Robinson: And then the second half, I just kept wanting you to pause, because you had these powerful lines, but you just kept going through them. So you need to figure out where to pause. It doesn't have to be every time. But just pick like in the second half there should probably be like 3 more pauses than what you did, and you were just working once. So you have time to pause. It! You just flew through it, and then it lost all the power behind the words.

146
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.530
Morgan Stanton: Okay, okay, I can do that.

147
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.629
Lilliana Robinson: That was it. Okay, good job, Morgan, let's go to Fabio.

148
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.090
Fabio Caironi: Hey, Troy, I've iterated your feedback multiple times.

149
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:19.600
Fabio Caironi: So the goal for the demo day in general is to attract investors

150
00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:26.000
Fabio Caironi: and potential customers. So the pitch video. Sorry the the 1 min pitch

151
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:33.580
Fabio Caironi: will have has a purpose of getting investors that are already

152
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:43.989
Fabio Caironi: familiar with this pace even more excited. So something's gonna click in their mind. And they're gonna be like, oh, now I see the problem even even better.

153
00:17:44.608 --> 00:17:46.012
Fabio Caironi: And that would

154
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:55.480
Fabio Caironi: demo video. As you suggested, we want to convey this sense of confidence that we, we got it. We can solve the problem.

155
00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:08.400
Fabio Caironi: And finally, the QA. Where we'll actually address some of the biggest questions like, How can you compete against? Aws? Who is our your Icp and security related questions.

156
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Hey!

157
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:19.250
Fabio Caironi: The next wave of AI. Innovation isn't about smarter algorithms. It's about unleashing the power to scale

158
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:27.739
Fabio Caironi: companies like Rampod model. And Anyskill have already lined up in the rush to serve the builders of the greatest applications of tomorrow.

159
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:37.720
Fabio Caironi: But how can these companies serve a demand projected to double by 2030, if they mainly rely on finite infrastructure provided by centralized clouds.

160
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:58.420
Fabio Caironi: My name is Fabio, and that's why I founded by Knight. We offer a platform that brings together the scale of crowdsource, computing with the accessibility of serverless configurations, so that companies building an AI big data and media processing can utilize unlimited, untapped computing power without worrying about sourcing and managing.

161
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:08.309
Fabio Caironi: using byted allows them to get from 0 to functional with no delays and to unlock significant time and money savings that they can reinvest in their vision

162
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:19.130
Fabio Caironi: with our product set to launch by ear, and in a team deeply connected with the struggles in this industry, this vision will soon become a reality. Let me show you how we help. Companies succeed with White Knight.

163
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.820
Lilliana Robinson: 1 0, 5.

164
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:31.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So what is your hook in the beginning? What do you think is going to get the audience's attention.

165
00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.089
Fabio Caironi: The next wave of AI innovation isn't about algorithms.

166
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:45.881
Fabio Caironi: Is like, just I'm debunking this myth of

167
00:19:47.110 --> 00:20:03.939
Fabio Caironi: Well, actually, for the general audience, who's like lay people, they're they're gonna be more interest to learn more about. What's behind AI and the people that actually already know about the problem of scale and computing. They're gonna be nodding. So the hook is just

168
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.020
Fabio Caironi: resonating.

169
00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.899
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yes, I don't think that's a hook.

170
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:21.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So one of the things that I think I said in our 1st meeting was, if you say things that people just not along with, they're like, Yeah, I know what this is. I know what this is. Okay. I'm gonna get on my phone now, because I know this, I'm I got this

171
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right. And next thing you know, you've lost them.

172
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and that's why I liked Morgan's intro so well.

173
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:41.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so much is because she started talking about the great blue sea and Jacques Cousteau, and then, like, No, that's the women woman's uterus, and I'm like what the oh, my God! Like I better pay attention. I don't know where this thing's going

174
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right.

175
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so I mean, I felt like

176
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I felt like you didn't have a hook, and then and this

177
00:20:54.510 --> 00:21:05.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): your your delivery was pretty monotone. Mono paste, monospaced mono! Everything which leads to boring.

178
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:14.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and so I'd like to see you give me some cues about. What are you really excited about, and what part are you just telling me to inform me.

179
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:26.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and what it just makes it so much more interesting than saying the same words at the same pace, at the same volume all the time throughout your entire presentation, without any variation at all whatsoever.

180
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:36.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You gotta have more dynamic right? Like, Liliana said. Whether it's dynamic in its volume, it's dynamic in its pacing. It's dynamic in your expression

181
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like, I want to see your excitement. So

182
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:46.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think I know you're running out of time. But I would love to see you have a hook.

183
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:51.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What is something? What could you use as a hook in the beginning to get my attention.

184
00:21:52.510 --> 00:22:08.599
Lilliana Robinson: It doesn't have to subvert expectations like Morgan. It could be something that's interesting that leads into your solution. Like Dave, like Dave, talks about stranger things, because not everyone knows dungeons and dragons. So it's like related to the populace. Right?

185
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.909
Lilliana Robinson: What is that like? Oh, I don't know something that's interesting that can then relate to what you're talking about.

186
00:22:17.358 --> 00:22:19.660
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, I gotta think about it.

187
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:27.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): No, I'm gonna give you some. I'm gonna try to throw some spaghetti on the wall. I'm sure that I'm wrong in what I say, but I'm just trying to give you ideas

188
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right?

189
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We all have heard of AI. We're all tired of hearing of AI,

190
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:38.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but I'm here to tell you why AI is so critical to new application.

191
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know.

192
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:49.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we've all heard about AI and Chat Gpt, and think that it needs a hundred 1 billion dollars of investment

193
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to build an Llm.

194
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I've got news for you. We have a solution.

195
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): or you can do it for the cost of aws.

196
00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, I better pay attention right?

197
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:16.160
Lilliana Robinson: Troy. What about if he takes kind of what he already has, but makes it a lot more almost controversial, or like he's trying to ruffle feathers. I remember Andrew from Bloomfilter did something similar for his hook. If he's saying, like, Yeah.

198
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.999
Lilliana Robinson: we have all these ideas for what AI innovation is, I want you to know they're wrong.

199
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.849
Lilliana Robinson: And then just pause. It's something like that where people are like what like

200
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:32.379
Lilliana Robinson: no, AI is the like, the biggest deal you're like, no AI needs to be used for scale. That's the future. Something like that where it's like.

201
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Totally.

202
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:33.790
Lilliana Robinson: You see that.

203
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

204
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.640
Lilliana Robinson: Can it be controverted.

205
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:36.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So.

206
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.800
Lilliana Robinson: That's cool.

207
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:47.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So hopefully. You know, these will give you some ideas, and I don't think any one of the what the 3 things we just said, are the right ideas.

208
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:55.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But they're gonna hopefully spur you. You, I really would like to see you have something that captures people's attention in the 1st 15 seconds.

209
00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:09.359
Fabio Caironi: Yeah. So to be honest with you, I would like to keep most of it intact, like I would say 80% of it intact, so I would just need to change the hook which I totally agree with, and I think it. It's powerful to find something.

210
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Why do you say you want to keep most of it intact? I'm curious.

211
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:18.780
Fabio Caironi: Because it's been like the result of 6 iterations where we actually like converged into like

212
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:23.039
Fabio Caironi: this way of delivering the problem and solution that

213
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:34.729
Fabio Caironi: passes from our competitors to the their shortages, their their problems. And then, what we do

214
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:44.500
Fabio Caironi: like, the solution mainly has been reworked multiple times to yeah. Well.

215
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:50.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): A lot of time into it. You all have put a lot of time into it, but those are sunk costs. That's not a reason to say you want to keep it

216
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so. What did you tell me? The objective was for the for the pitch part.

217
00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:01.230
Fabio Caironi: So to get investor and customer attention.

218
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so the objective is to get their interest and attention.

219
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:19.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And when I ask why you want to keep it, you've talked about well how it describes the the problem and the solution, and how you've narrowed down on it. Not once did you mention this keeps people's attention.

220
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): which is your objective right?

221
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:34.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And I'm I'm trying to be provocative here, not just for you, by the way, but for everybody on the call like this is why I have. You reiterate what your objective is

222
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because I think it does do a decent job of laying out what you do and how you do it.

223
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and don't take it the wrong way. I'm not trying to be a jerk about it, Fabio, but

224
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it's not that interesting the way you lay it out, and the way you deliver it.

225
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.839
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and your objective is to get attention and interest.

226
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:58.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and so think about what are tweaks you can make to it to make it more attention. Getting and interesting.

227
00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You might not have to change much. It may be a couple words.

228
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but remember, the objective is to get their attention and their interest.

229
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:14.500
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, sorry. I I just have to. Add something here like our audience is idly of

230
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:23.120
Fabio Caironi: people that already understand. Understand this problem. So I'm totally with you, with the hook like.

231
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:40.871
Fabio Caironi: try to get the attention of any person like really trying to get them off their phone and and deliver something that is compelling. And oh, okay, I gotta listen to this. But then, like the rest of it, it people that are gonna understand this are. Gonna understand it like

232
00:26:41.380 --> 00:27:03.969
Fabio Caironi: regardless. So I don't want to inflate it too much to make it sound rocket science when it's actually something very tangible that we are delivering a very tangible problem that we're solving. So I, my my only concern, is not to make it too much inflated and too much sci-fi like.

233
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): An inflated and sci-fi like, but you could.

234
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:14.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So 1st of all, angel investors, which is who you're likely to get at this stage of a company.

235
00:27:14.963 --> 00:27:20.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Many of them will invest in something because it makes sense to them, not because they understand it deeply.

236
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:26.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so by, if you get too technical. You're ruling out a bunch of potential check writers.

237
00:27:26.471 --> 00:27:34.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And second of all, I mean, I think you can explain it in simpler terms where you could say. You know, I don't know what the rate

238
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him): again, I don't full. I certainly don't fully understand your technology, but

239
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him): just as aws brought the world from

240
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): buying servers and stacking racks and investing capital.

241
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:57.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are taking Llms from expensive 1 billion dollar propositions to something that you can.

242
00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's to something that you can implement, for you know the the cost of an aws

243
00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like by using those kinds of words. You're sort of

244
00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:25.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him): making it, not just explaining it to everybody. But you're also making it. Wow! That's really interesting. I don't know much about this, but I've heard about the billions of dollars that Openai has raised, and if we could do this for a fraction of that, I'm interested in investing.

245
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:34.180
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, Fabio, I would say a couple of the things you're saying I don't think are what Troy is saying. Troy is not telling you to change the rest of the pitch to make it like

246
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:57.930
Lilliana Robinson: dumbed down. So people understand? He's only talking about your hook, and if you heard what he said, is that people right now with what it is are going to say, oh, I understand that. Yeah, it's a problem. But I'm not. This isn't super engaging. And they're gonna go on their phone. Even the people that you're saying you want to talk to, who understand part of that can be fixed in like the second, the 80% of the pitch after the hook. If you just fix your delivery

247
00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:18.440
Lilliana Robinson: because you were saying it in a very boring way you were saying it almost like you're not excited about it. If you saw Morgan and Dave, you could feel how excited they are about their businesses. So you just need to practice that. But this, the hook part. It's also important for the people who understand, because you don't want them to just be like, Oh, yeah. Been there. Seen that? Totally. Get it? Let me check my email.

248
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:20.780
Fabio Caironi: Cool.

249
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.730
Fabio Caironi: Thank you for Juliana.

250
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:28.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I don't think needs you to change the rest of the pitch. It's just the beginning, and then fix your delivery.

251
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:35.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't need anything. I'm just trying to make suggestions. I want to be clear at the end of the day. This has to be something for that. Each of you

252
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:50.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is feels is authentic to what you're trying to deliver, that you believe in, and that you get up on stage with confidence delivering. I don't want you to be giving. You know my words because, I said, they're better. I want you to do your words that you are.

253
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:58.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You believe in. You have confidence and are authentic to you. That's most important, because if you try to be someone else, it'll it'll show.

254
00:29:59.030 --> 00:29:59.425
Lilliana Robinson: It's

255
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm just trying to nudge you in the right direction.

256
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:11.509
Lilliana Robinson: That is so important. All of you could leave it exactly the same. I would say, most of you, if you really didn't want to change it can leave it exactly the same as what you give today. But fix your delivery

257
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:19.639
Lilliana Robinson: that that it costs so much to have poor delivery you could have the same pitch twice and 2 different outcomes just by how you're saying it.

258
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:24.050
Lilliana Robinson: So just focus on that, Fabio. And then think about, think about your 1st sentence.

259
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.169
Fabio Caironi: Absolutely. Thank you.

260
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.840
Lilliana Robinson: All right, true.

261
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:48.199
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah. So, hey, my objective is to expand my network within the gaming industry. So I'm expecting the investors get the attention. Who is like, who also has their own investments or own interest in the gaming industry, so they can introduce me with the

262
00:30:48.993 --> 00:30:57.120
Çoruh | CogniScope: potential clients, and my pitch is built on expressing a problem

263
00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:06.030
Çoruh | CogniScope: like with the how gaming industry interacts with the community, and how powerful is the community to explain a bit more about

264
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.050
Çoruh | CogniScope: the industry at all

265
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.220
Çoruh | CogniScope: over 1 billion dollars in gaming investments vanished this year

266
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.600
Çoruh | CogniScope: just because studios didn't understand their committees.

267
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:28.049
Çoruh | CogniScope: A minor update sparked over 300,000 negative reviews in 3 days for Sony's best multiplayer game. Helldivers 2.

268
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.949
Çoruh | CogniScope: And what's the consequence?

269
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.909
Çoruh | CogniScope: They lost 65% of their players in a month.

270
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.560
Çoruh | CogniScope: Companies have access to more user data than ever.

271
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:43.750
Çoruh | CogniScope: Hell! When you get home you might receive some sony ads on Instagram just because you listen to this pitch.

272
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.400
Çoruh | CogniScope: Gaming companies have that feedback, too.

273
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.820
Çoruh | CogniScope: but they can't cut through the noise.

274
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:53.210
Çoruh | CogniScope: They're missing the mark, and it's costing them hundreds of millions.

275
00:31:53.590 --> 00:32:04.279
Çoruh | CogniScope: I'm Churu, the CEO of cogniscope. We uncover the why behind the what in today's community-driven world and help studios create games. Players. Truly, love.

276
00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.000
Çoruh | CogniScope: Let me show you how cogniscope changes the game.

277
00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:23.549
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that was 54 seconds. I have to say this pitch that you just did had the most people on this zoom like nodding along with you like a bunch of your classmates here. It was very good delivery, because a bunch of them are like, Oh, wow! That's great. I was just watching everyone's reactions.

278
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:29.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, no, I think it's come a long way. I think it's much better than the last time I heard it.

279
00:32:29.779 --> 00:32:33.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think you are gonna have still have some challenge

280
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:54.804
Troy Henikoff (he/him): with your accent, and I think you've done a better job of of slowing down and and trying to articulate those words. There are a few words that are still a little hard like it takes processing for me when I hear your word to figure out. Oh, that's the word, he said.

281
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:55.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And

282
00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you know you can.

283
00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:21.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You can either you can work on it. Make sure you have pause. I would not add anything. You're 54 seconds if you have to slow your pace down ever so slightly on some of those more complicated words. That would be great work on articulation. I loved the part where you said your Instagram may have ads because you were sitting listening to the pit like that just made me chuckle inside. That was awesome.

284
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That was really really awesome.

285
00:33:25.499 --> 00:33:36.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it's come a long way. And then I assume we're gonna see a video that's gonna deliver on the promise of let me show you how this works, because you didn't tell me how it works.

286
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:36.670
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah.

287
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You just set up the problem.

288
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:47.109
Çoruh | CogniScope: Exactly. The video is all about how it works and how they're like it's on the real life use case. So people can relate

289
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:52.370
Çoruh | CogniScope: how community managers and product managers has to deal with all kind of feedback.

290
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:57.210
Çoruh | CogniScope: a really like audio intensive experience.

291
00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:07.869
Çoruh | CogniScope: I'm off to like. I'll put loads of sounds and ask some questions to the audience in the video. Did you understand anything? They said.

292
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.899
Çoruh | CogniScope: Neither did I, and neither the product managers.

293
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:20.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I was it this cohort that I shared the the pitch for Guillaume and pictorine.

294
00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.650
Lilliana Robinson: The French accent.

295
00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:23.379
Lilliana Robinson: Yes.

296
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Did you watch that one.

297
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.749
Lilliana Robinson: Do you remember? He put in the chat during the

298
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.330
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, I think so.

299
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.250
Lilliana Robinson: Gemini.

300
00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:37.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You say you think so? You would remember who watched the one with Guillaume and pictorine the French accent.

301
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:43.440
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, maybe we didn't. Maybe it was a different cohort, because I'm surprised. None of you have seen this.

302
00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:54.839
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's funny it is worth watching just for entertainment. But for those of you who are thinking about is my accent a liability or an asset.

303
00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm gonna I'm gonna find it right now, real quickly.

304
00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.180
Lilliana Robinson: Got it.

305
00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He? Huh!

306
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:00.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You got it already.

307
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.849
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I got it.

308
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:07.105
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay. He did a great job of

309
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:14.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): of making it an asset. He had this very thick French accent he was difficult to understand, and it

310
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:22.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I loved it. He's great. You should watch it, particularly those of you, if you think you have any trouble with accents and articulation.

311
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:30.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and for everybody else. It was just a fun fun pitch, I mean. People walked out of the House of Blues, mimicking him, saying that was for Mock.

312
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it was just funny. So.

313
00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him): anyway, take a look at it may give you some ideas.

314
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:41.429
Lilliana Robinson: I think maybe we talked about it, and then we never followed up with the link. So here's the link.

315
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right.

316
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:43.940
Lilliana Robinson: Cool.

317
00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I I thought I had put it in there. But go ahead alright.

318
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:48.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think.

319
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:56.250
Lilliana Robinson: I didn't post on base camp afterwards, so I kind of got lost in the ether. That's my bad, all right, Tro. Did you have any other questions, or are you good?

320
00:35:56.832 --> 00:35:58.120
Çoruh | CogniScope: No, I'm good. Thanks.

321
00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.019
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. Nick.

322
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.470
Nicholas Li: Hey? The angle is gonna be really weird.

323
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's fine!

324
00:36:06.183 --> 00:36:08.700
Nicholas Li: Yeah. Our objective is sorry.

325
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.070
Lilliana Robinson: Project, so we can still hear you up there.

326
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:18.319
Nicholas Li: Yeah, our objective for the pitch is to introduce what international baccalaury is and like to provide context on why these students are stressed.

327
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:27.060
Nicholas Li: Yep, every night. Sorry every night in homes around the world. International baccalaureate students face the same crisis.

328
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:32.270
Nicholas Li: They've just finished their tutoring session. But now, alone at their desk. They're stuck.

329
00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:36.080
Nicholas Li: Their next session is a full days, but their deadline is tomorrow

330
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:47.489
Nicholas Li: for these students. 1 point can mean the difference between Cambridge or not. Parents know this. Their child's education is priceless to them, and they'll spend any amount to give their child that edge.

331
00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:55.670
Nicholas Li: because, unlike American college admissions. Conditional offers are absolute. You miss your target score overnight. Your acceptance letter is revoked.

332
00:36:55.910 --> 00:37:04.110
Nicholas Li: I'm Nick and I built tutor me because I live this reality even with amazing teachers and tutors I was stressed, lost, and overwhelmed.

333
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:09.369
Nicholas Li: That gap between tutoring sessions and schools is where a tutor me comes in.

334
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:12.090
Nicholas Li: We're transforming what's possible between sessions.

335
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:19.280
Nicholas Li: When a student is stuck on an essay at midnight, we guide them through the thinking process and provide detailed Ib. Specific feedback instantly

336
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:24.749
Nicholas Li: with tutor. Me students get 24, 7 personalized dynamic feedback and support.

337
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.850
Lilliana Robinson: 1 0, 2.

338
00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it's good.

339
00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it can be better

340
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so. I think your delivery can be more animated.

341
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:40.040
Nicholas Li: It wasn't horrible.

342
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But it was sort of the same level, the same pace.

343
00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:48.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I feel like you have an opportunity at the end

344
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to add a word or 2 to close.

345
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Go ahead, tying back to the beginning.

346
00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:00.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so I don't know what it is. But what's your opening line?

347
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.680
Nicholas Li: Every night in homes around the world. International baccalaureate students face the same crisis.

348
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:12.779
Nicholas Li: They've just finished their tutoring sessions. But now, alone at the desk, and they're stuck. Their next session isn't for days, but then deadline is tomorrow.

349
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, alright. And what's your last line?

350
00:38:16.701 --> 00:38:20.920
Nicholas Li: With tier. 2. Me students get 24, 7 personalized dynamic feedback and support.

351
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.819
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, they didn't feel like the end. I I almost was like.

352
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): In it.

353
00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:30.700
Lilliana Robinson: That you stopped speaking because it wasn't like a close. You can like people to. And let's show you how it works.

354
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.860
Lilliana Robinson: or you can bring it back to.

355
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:38.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Or yeah, or come back to the start. I was gonna suggest something like with tutor. Me.

356
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Students never have to feel stuck.

357
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They never have to feel alone.

358
00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We're there 24, 7,

359
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:54.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know our, our with tutor me. They never feel stuck. They never have to feel alone. Help us change the world. Let me show you how it works.

360
00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:01.283
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Those aren't the exact words, but I'm trying to tie it back to how you opened and

361
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him): yeah. So there's a suggestion of of

362
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:15.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): starting with a scene. It's 1130 on a Tuesday night. Well, so Demo day is going to be on a Friday.

363
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.550
Nicholas Li: Yeah.

364
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I wonder if you'd say something because it's gonna be a Friday evening

365
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:27.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and say, you know, you tie it to today. So if you said if you opened with something like

366
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:35.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it's Friday evening, and we're all celebrating here. But I can tell you that international baccalaureate students right now are panicked.

367
00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:44.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They just had finished their their tutoring session earlier. They don't have another one for 3 days, and their papers do, and you know their papers due on Monday

368
00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him): they feel stuck. It's basically your same intro. It's just making it feel here. And now

369
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:55.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it is Friday evening. We're all celebrating. They're panicked.

370
00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:57.240
Nicholas Li: Okay, that's good.

371
00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:03.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And the same, the rest of the same words. I mean, it's I don't think it's any longer, and then in the end

372
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:10.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you can again tie back to it. So help us make sure that Novak Ib. Student needs to feel panicked on a Friday night.

373
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:14.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are there to help them at any time. Let me show you how it works.

374
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.339
Nicholas Li: Okay. I believe like that.

375
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.724
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think there's something there where you can personalize it. Tell the story.

376
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think that was a great suggestion from Talitha. Did I pronounce that right.

377
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm so bad with names. I apologize.

378
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:33.610
Lilliana Robinson: No, that's correct.

379
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:38.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yep, yeah. Make people feel it

380
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:46.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and think about how people will feel in the audience like, we're all here celebrating. And Ib students around the world are panicking. What.

381
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.740
Nicholas Li: Okay.

382
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.000
Lilliana Robinson: Really good.

383
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's Friday night.

384
00:40:53.370 --> 00:41:00.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Boom! Boom! I think that I think you can do you deliver that. Well, that is, gonna that's gonna be awesome.

385
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.299
Nicholas Li: It's gonna take a little work on delivery.

386
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.080
Nicholas Li: Yeah.

387
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Pauses, confidence, yep.

388
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:21.989
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, Nick, I feel like you're just like, naturally a very calm person. You don't have like a lot of like like high spikes of intonation on the regular. So you're gonna have to practice it. So it feels natural. But you do need to be

389
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.040
Lilliana Robinson: like

390
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:30.559
Lilliana Robinson: 20 to 25% more animated than you're than you would ever normally be, because you're on stage right? So like.

391
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.100
Nicholas Li: Yeah.

392
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.269
Lilliana Robinson: Just don't be afraid to do that. It'll just enhance it.

393
00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:37.989
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Have you to to that point, Liliana.

394
00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:42.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him): have any of any of you have a theater background? Anybody been in a play?

395
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:47.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): No theater background. Okay, Dave, I don't know if this will apply to you, but I'm gonna try.

396
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So in theater, when you go on stage, they put a bunch of makeup on you.

397
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:59.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and the makeup they put on would look so obnoxious and horrible if you were like walking around in person.

398
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:06.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right? And the reason they do. That is because it has to be visible from 5,100 200 feet away.

399
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:19.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you're right next to someone who has stage makeup on. They're like it looks like they painted, you know, round red circles on their cheeks to make them look rosy at 200 feet. They look like rosy cheeks. At 2 feet they look silly, they look like a clown.

400
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Well, the same goes for your expressions.

401
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:36.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You have to exaggerate your expressions to make them come across across the distance. If you remember the routific pitch that we saw like at 1 point, he said, and these are the companies that love us already.

402
00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:41.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you had done that in a casual conversation, people would send you to the insane asylum.

403
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But on stage it looks appropriate.

404
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:51.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You need to have bigger expressions, bigger intonations, more makeup.

405
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.439
Lilliana Robinson: That's exactly what I was thinking of with the makeup when I was saying.

406
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.590
Lilliana Robinson: 25% more than normal.

407
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:00.830
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

408
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:17.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I mean, it's really. I remember as a kid, my mom used to take us on Sundays to this matinee thing for kids. And when the actors came out to sign your little book, they just looked like clown. Their makeup was so obnoxious, and it would just, I don't know. I have this very vivid

409
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): image painted in my brain.

410
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:26.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But you have to be. You have to be the makeup. You have to be more vivid, more impactful.

411
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:27.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): exactly delivery.

412
00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:33.800
Lilliana Robinson: And luckily you guys get a little bit of leeway, because this is one of the most intimate spaces we've ever done. Demo Day.

413
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:51.619
Lilliana Robinson: It's about like 150 people. And it'll be like, really exclusive in Google. So you won't have like people sitting super far away trying to see so there is some leeway. But it's still gonna be big enough that nobody's gonna like, Hear you or understand or listen in the back.

414
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:53.420
Lilliana Robinson: So you need to do that.

415
00:43:53.660 --> 00:44:01.049
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, Nick. I can't wait to see what you come up with tomorrow. Make sure you you implement those things by tomorrow, Karim. You're next.

416
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:09.379
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Trying to arrange my computer screen so you can see me standing out.

417
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yep.

418
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:43.649
Kirimgeray Kirimli: As an engineering executive. It's your job to have full visibility across your team, but many will admit it often feels like flying blind. I've been there, too, managing over 300 engineers taught me that higher roles mean bigger decisions, but fewer answers. I've also been an engineer in a big company, and I always thought I did a great job, but I had no way of showing or justifying this. To be a good leader. You need both the numbers and the story behind them.

419
00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:51.260
Kirimgeray Kirimli: It's not just about hitting targets. It's about knowing who's creating value, who needs support. And when key projects will get done.

420
00:44:51.320 --> 00:45:04.250
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I'm kurum. And that's why I built snapshot reviews. Unlike unlike tools that only provide raw statistics. Snapshot uses AI to bring clarity and context by pulling data from Github.

421
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:31.250
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Jira standups. And more, it helps you make faster, more confident decisions, whether reviewing performance, justifying headcount or optimizing costs. This isn't just another chat. Gpt Wrapper. It's solving a technical problem in a 40 billion dollars market for engineering performance and team insights it highlights. What's working what's not and where to focus your time, giving you the confidence to lead smarter.

422
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:36.599
Lilliana Robinson: 1 12, so slightly over.

423
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him): A little long

424
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:46.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in general. I think it. I think the

425
00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:51.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him): pitch itself was good. I would love to see you work more on the delivery.

426
00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and again have more variation in pace

427
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:58.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and more variation in your volume. Use your voice.

428
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:04.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So when you open up and you talk about how you need to. You need to have the data. And then you say, I know

429
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:05.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I was there.

430
00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:11.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I led these teams like do it as an aside almost like

431
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:14.725
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in Routeific. He did, if you remember, at

432
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:22.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him): at 1 point, he said, oh, and these companies grew up, and I know, because I was a consultant for these companies. Let me tell you what I learned

433
00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:29.102
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right, just that variation will make it far more interesting. It was. It was a little too monotone.

434
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:38.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him): trying to think of how to make the opening a little bit more catchy.

435
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What if we did something like this.

436
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:49.489
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, managing engineer ears is about dashboards and numbers and productivity.

437
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.489
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm here to tell you it's not.

438
00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:56.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's actually about understanding the stories behind

439
00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the dashboards, the numbers and the productivity

440
00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:09.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): with. Armed with those stories, you have the ability to make better decisions in in less time and be much more effective at managing.

441
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:17.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I know I've been there. I managed over 300 engineers, and I was an engineer before that. It's a hard job

442
00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): without the tools. You feel like you're flying blind?

443
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:26.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know.

444
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:27.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Does that rest.

445
00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.830
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I see what you mean. I mean, there's something

446
00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.609
Kirimgeray Kirimli: in the the 1st paragraph that that is missing.

447
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Why don't you read your 1st paragraph to me again?

448
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:47.409
Kirimgeray Kirimli: As an engineering executive. It's your job to have full visibility across your team.

449
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.739
Kirimgeray Kirimli: but many will admit it often feels like flying blind.

450
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.280
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I've been there, too.

451
00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:59.990
Kirimgeray Kirimli: managing over 300 engineers taught me that higher roles mean bigger decisions, but fewer answers.

452
00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:09.160
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I've also been an engineer in a big company, and I always thought I did a great job, but I had no way of showing or justifying this.

453
00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:17.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, that whole thing. That's all. Like, I'm nodding. And I'm like, Yeah, that makes sense. But I'm just not that interested.

454
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:20.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And, by the way.

455
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:27.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): while I never managed 300 engineers, my undergraduate degree is in engineering, and I have a master's in project management. So

456
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:31.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I really think that if you do something like

457
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:39.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like, I said, and you'll hear it in the recording. But you know, managing engineers is all about productivity and dashboards and kpis.

458
00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:45.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him): or most people think managing engineers about dashboard productivity and kpis. It's not.

459
00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's about the stories behind them.

460
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:53.489
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then you say, I know blah blah blah like you. You have that.

461
00:48:53.560 --> 00:49:11.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then the stories behind them. And then you talk about how your tool gets the data from all the various sources, puts it together and constructs and lets you know what's actually going on, which lets you address the problem, not the symptom of the problem. The symptom of the problem is, the Kpi is changing. The real problem is the story behind it.

462
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you can address this real problem, you're going to be more successful.

463
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think there's something in there.

464
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.109
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I think I can. You don't look.

465
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:25.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Convinced, but.

466
00:49:25.975 --> 00:49:27.434
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I'm trying to like

467
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.769
Kirimgeray Kirimli: and find a way to word it. But

468
00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.179
Kirimgeray Kirimli: go back and go back and listen to the recording.

469
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:35.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Wording.

470
00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:39.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Listen to the part I mean I I did it just off the off the cough.

471
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:41.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but I think it was pretty close.

472
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:46.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it gave you an arc that could replace the 1st 20 seconds of your pitch.

473
00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You'll change some words. You'll make it more accurate.

474
00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:50.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But yeah.

475
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think there's something there for you to start with, and then you gotta tweak it a little bit.

476
00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:03.550
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, that's why we record these. Because Troy is really great, like off the cuff stuff. And then you can just write it down.

477
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:06.026
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The second to to say it again.

478
00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:11.359
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, it'll be really hard if they're like, okay, wait. Say it again. Let me write it down. It wouldn't be the same.

479
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.960
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, yeah.

480
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:24.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'd recommend you. Go back and just write down what I said that 1st time, because it felt like it flowed pretty well, and then decide what you like of it, what you don't throw out what you don't like, whatever, but again make it yours.

481
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:32.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's got to be authentic. It's got to be yours. I'm just trying to give you suggestions to get the juices rolling for you to think about what feels best for you.

482
00:50:33.980 --> 00:51:00.439
Lilliana Robinson: I can kind of tell from your delivery that a lot of this I know you worked on it with your co-founders. Really, you need to really own this pitch and know that know it like the back of your hand. So spend some time with it, because the delivery piece is gonna elevate this more than anything. It was really monotone, really kind of quiet. It would be really easy for people to have tuned out for that entire minute. I don't want them to do that, because it's a very good company

483
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.649
Lilliana Robinson: with very interesting things to say. But you're not saying it in an interesting way.

484
00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:09.849
Lilliana Robinson: So I want you to really focus on delivery. So when you show it to us tomorrow.

485
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:17.580
Lilliana Robinson: try to have practiced interesting ways to say it like we said dynamics, loud, soft, fast, slow.

486
00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:23.159
Lilliana Robinson: Put pauses, put inflection on your voice.

487
00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:31.259
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, cool. Okay. Thanks. Krim. Did you have any more questions?

488
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:36.329
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, cool. Let's go to Tamletha.

489
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:55.149
Talitha: Hi Troy. So the purpose of our pitch is to get the crowd excited about how the travel industry is going to look like in the future, and also get them. Curious about how we're going to be supporting both operators and also guests as well. So that part will be actually demonstrated through our video. And Q. And A,

490
00:51:56.838 --> 00:52:03.870
Talitha: all right, I'm gonna stand up okay to.

491
00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.019
Talitha: I want you to take a moment

492
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:10.360
Talitha: and imagine a world where travel feels effortless

493
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:14.410
Talitha: once you arrive, you're not just a visitor, you're at home.

494
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:20.420
Talitha: Your space is intuitive and welcoming each detail tailored to your desired experience.

495
00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.490
Talitha: This isn't just a fantasy. It's the future we're building.

496
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:36.480
Talitha: But reality is 700 million short-term rental travelers globally lack support when navigating unfamiliar places which can quickly turn a joyful getaway into a stressful ordeal.

497
00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:46.230
Talitha: On the other hand, millions of short-term rental hosts struggle to be available. 24, 7 manually answer repetitive questions and balance operations with business growth.

498
00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.750
Talitha: I'm Talitha, CEO of Collab, and we're redefining hospitality.

499
00:52:50.940 --> 00:53:01.089
Talitha: Let me take you into a future where you all have a 5 star concierge at your fingertips, anticipating needs, sparking inspiration, and making every stay seamless.

500
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:04.749
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, 57.

501
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:07.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So, so I like it.

502
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:14.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I feel like you teased me a little bit with the lead in, and it didn't pay off.

503
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:17.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So read your 1st couple sentences.

504
00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:23.780
Talitha: Yeah. So I want you to take a moment and imagine a world where travel feels effortless

505
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:32.989
Talitha: once you arrive, you're not just a visitor. You're at home. Your space is intuitive and welcoming each detail tailored to your desired experience.

506
00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.260
Talitha: Do you want me to continue.

507
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:55.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So. So what I was expecting from the and maybe it's just that each detail tailored to your experience or feel at home. I was expecting. You have something where it's like virtual reality you're gonna make like at my house. The the salt is on the left, and the peppers on the right or whatever like that. You were gonna rearrange things before I got there. And I don't think that's what you're delivering.

508
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:56.589
Talitha: No, no.

509
00:53:56.950 --> 00:54:03.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so the the I really liked it. And, by the way, your delivery was great.

510
00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:10.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Did you see how she like she almost was like taking me on this journey. Right? Imagine a world

511
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:23.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him): with and with your your voice was soothing. You were getting me to think about it. You got excited at times, but the thing that annoyed me was that I didn't have the payoff that I felt like you laid up in the front.

512
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:25.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and so

513
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:40.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think there's probably I think it's easy. Well, it's gonna be hard. But I think once you get the right thing, it'll be easy to deliver. I think you have to replace the part where you make me think you are physically rearranging the place. I'm going to stay.

514
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:49.839
Troy Henikoff (he/him): With something that says we make it intuitive about, make it intuitive to find the things that

515
00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know what the right words are. Here.

516
00:54:51.940 --> 00:55:08.269
Lilliana Robinson: Well, their problems are fixed. It's not just like they can find recommendations. It's that like, there's no hot water. Well, it's fixed really quickly, because we have this concierge that'll help you. So I feel like that's what needs to replace it right like, where any any problem is is immediately fixed

517
00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.960
Lilliana Robinson: in a timely and convenient way.

518
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:23.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Not only are you one touch, one touch away from knowing everything about your stay in the location. Any unexpected problems that come up are immediately fixed with our with our 24, 7 concierge.

519
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:24.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

520
00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:31.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now it feels like, Oh, I'm going into an unfamiliar place. You're going to make it familiar for me. And if I have a problem, you're gonna fix it.

521
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:33.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's something you can actually deliver.

522
00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:34.490
Talitha: Yeah.

523
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:39.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I think you just need a subtle thing in the beginning, where, instead of

524
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:46.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): when I when I heard your beginning, I thought you were gonna literally, physically rearrange the place to make it look like my house.

525
00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:49.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That is what it is that way.

526
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:51.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and that's not what you're doing.

527
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.280
Talitha: Yeah.

528
00:55:53.217 --> 00:56:16.650
Talitha: so question, so what we were trying to do here is basically like the you're at home. It's the idea that you don't feel foreign anywhere, because you would know the spaces that you're going into. You know all the information about it. That's why it's like intuitive and feels welcoming. You don't feel like, Oh, this is like, how do I figure out this new space and not just space, but also like the local area and stuff like that. But what you're saying is, it creates like false expectations.

529
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, the way you delivered it. I definitely in the 1st paragraph, thought you were gonna actually physically rearrange space for me.

530
00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:25.750
Talitha: Okay.

531
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.893
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then it didn't pay off. So I was disappointed. So yeah, I

532
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:40.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): yeah, be careful. Like, are you gonna make the space more intuitive? Or are you just gonna provide tools

533
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:45.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to make it easy to find what you need to make it easy to accomplish what you want to accomplish

534
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:49.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): cause. I don't think you're gonna change the physical space right?

535
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.790
Talitha: No.

536
00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:54.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So be careful about words like that. We're going to make the space more intuitive.

537
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:55.470
Talitha: Yeah.

538
00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.056
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I really like it?

539
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:04.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so your customer is like Airbnb owners.

540
00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:10.540
Talitha: Exactly. So. It's like these property management companies that have a portfolio of short term rentals. Yeah.

541
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): No, and I've I

542
00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:31.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): stay in a bunch of Airbnb. I travel. I stay in a bunch of Airbnbs, and I could use that because I'm always fighting for. Oh, my God! Where is the Wi-fi password? Do I need a key to get, you know, to take the garbage out? What am I like? I don't know. There are 100 things that I always ask the same things every time.

543
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:35.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and making that intuitive and easy would be great.

544
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:39.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I can't quite picture how you're delivering it. But that's okay.

545
00:57:40.426 --> 00:57:40.800
Talitha: Well, that.

546
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That in the.

547
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:43.330
Talitha: Still in the video, exactly. Yeah.

548
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:44.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Awesome.

549
00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:50.959
Talitha: Okay, so we'll fix the intro part to make it a bit more connected to the actual product that we're delivering at least the service.

550
00:57:50.960 --> 00:58:12.020
Lilliana Robinson: Like Troy, picked out the exact phrases that were a problem, and it was I completely agree with the ones he picked up. So watch back the recording, because when you read it back it's like those last 2 phrases, because even I, this is the 1st time I've heard this hook because you had a different one last week. Even I was like, that's not exactly what what you're delivering right. And it's not

551
00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:17.599
Lilliana Robinson: what you're delivering is not of lesser value. It's just different than what you're saying.

552
00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:22.579
Talitha: Yeah, I would also say you were swaying, and it was distracting.

553
00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:23.340
Talitha: Oh, Catherine.

554
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:30.470
Lilliana Robinson: We practice standing up so you need to like, stay still. I don't know if Troy you noticed that, or if swaying is fine, if they're not moving their feet.

555
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:44.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm zoom. I tend to like close my eyes or look in a different direction. So I'm concentrating on the words more than the but, the reason we have you stand up when you're on zoom is you tend to speak differently when you're standing up, you're more energetic.

556
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:48.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I didn't really watch and see you swaying. I apologize.

557
00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.290
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. And the second half.

558
00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:53.129
Talitha: The walk of it. So sorry. Yeah.

559
00:58:53.130 --> 00:59:20.929
Lilliana Robinson: Practice planting your feet. I just like usually put a tape X on the ground, and you practice standing on that. And the second half was more rushed in your delivery. I agree with Troy that you were energetic at good parts, so there was like the inflection of energy, but you started speeding through, and you came out to only 57 seconds. So just put some more pauses in the second half, very similar to Morgan, like you have this great opening that's timed perfectly. And then you just started like, and then we do this. This is this, and this is the end.

560
00:59:21.175 --> 00:59:31.470
Lilliana Robinson: And I don't know if, Troy you felt the way about the closing that Nick also had the problem. But I I was surprised that Talitha ended like it didn't feel like that was the end. I almost feel like you need.

561
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:33.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Read your last last 2 sentences.

562
00:59:34.179 --> 00:59:47.809
Talitha: Yeah. So it's I'm Talitha, CEO of Collab, and we're redefining hospitality. Let me take you into a future where you all have a 5 star concierge at your fingertips, anticipating needs, sparking inspiration, and making every stay seamless.

563
00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:51.249
Lilliana Robinson: See your delivery was different. There, that's not how you said it the 1st time.

564
00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:51.710
Talitha: Exactly.

565
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:53.469
Lilliana Robinson: Very clear that that's the end.

566
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:55.800
Talitha: Okay.

567
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:56.359
Lilliana Robinson: Make it S.

568
00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Pacing it. Pacing gives you a good clue as to what's happening right?

569
01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:04.339
Lilliana Robinson: Yes, you must have said it in a way that made it sound like there was like another sound.

570
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.999
Talitha: More to go. Okay, yeah.

571
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.239
Lilliana Robinson: Was was great. So just say it like that.

572
01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:11.190
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I think you've thought you were running out of time or something.

573
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:23.900
Talitha: Yeah, I always feel like I have to like Rush, because I'm being I'm so slow. But there's gonna be one more sentence at the end where we're gonna connect it to the video. So just sort of like. And this is how we support hosts and guests alike, and then cue to the video.

574
01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:37.619
Lilliana Robinson: That's fine. Just make sure that you. You know that you're under time, so you can take those pauses. Don't feel rushed like you know how long your pitch is. You don't have to guess so. Just calm, calm, and deliver it.

575
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:38.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yep.

576
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:42.170
Lilliana Robinson: Anything else, Troy. Here, we're good.

577
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.270
Talitha: Okay. Thank you.

578
01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.010
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

579
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:45.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

580
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:48.400
Lilliana Robinson: Health blocks near it.

581
01:00:50.520 --> 01:01:01.990
Nirat Attri: So for us the objective is to gather preliminary investor interest. So the way we are structuring the pitch is to paint a grand vision for our healthcare platform

582
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:16.700
Nirat Attri: and get them interested enough to ask questions about how it's being done, and potentially, that serves as a hook into our demo video. And any gaps that are left. We are aiming to take that up in the Q&A,

583
01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:21.500
Nirat Attri: so that's where we stand up.

584
01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let's hear it.

585
01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:27.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Expect big things out of you. We went back and forth a couple times.

586
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:31.379
Nirat Attri: Yes, American healthcare is a paradox.

587
01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:40.860
Nirat Attri: Today I can sequence a genome in 2 h. Yet, ironically, I can spend longer waiting at the effing doctor's office, due to horrible healthcare systems

588
01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:52.430
Nirat Attri: across 350,000 Us. Healthcare practices, staff waste countless hours in paperwork and juggling, disconnected systems leading to burnout and billions in lost revenue.

589
01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:58.520
Nirat Attri: I'm Nerok Atri, and after successfully exiting my previous health tech startup, I knew there had to be a better way.

590
01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:08.800
Nirat Attri: so I decided to build health blocks, a platform with a suite of plug and play Api modules that seamlessly connect existing systems without the need for expensive overhauls

591
01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.560
Nirat Attri: our early results speak for themselves.

592
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:19.709
Nirat Attri: Poor healthcare companies already use our platform reducing manual work by 80% and impacting profit margins by up to 40%.

593
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.699
Nirat Attri: We're not just building another healthcare tool.

594
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:30.839
Nirat Attri: We're creating the infrastructure layer that will finally let you unlock decades of healthcare data reducing cost, increasing revenue.

595
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.840
Nirat Attri: But most importantly, enabling convenience.

596
01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.490
Lilliana Robinson: 1 0, 4.

597
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:44.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm biased because I helped you write parts of it, but I think it's good.

598
01:02:45.054 --> 01:02:53.885
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I like the paradox. That's a really great word. When we were talking about this we talked. We didn't come up with that, but that I think that's great.

599
01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Read your 1st sentence with the paradox thing in it again, because there was something in it I wanted to tweak.

600
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:11.960
Nirat Attri: American healthcare today is a paradox. Today you can sequence a genome in 2 h. Yet, ironically, you can spend longer waiting at the effing doctor's office, due to horrible healthcare systems.

601
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:17.953
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So I think there's a little tweak to that. And I I'm trying to find things to improve. But

602
01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:26.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): healthcare American healthcare is a paradox. You can sequence an entire genome in 2 h. Yet it takes longer than that

603
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:32.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to whatever the thing was like.

604
01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:45.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's just a little word choice there, but you just set up 2 h, and so do the contrast of longer than that to do this simple little task, you know, to fill out the paperwork and see a doctor, whatever the the what was the back end of that.

605
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:51.630
Nirat Attri: You can. Still waiting at the effing doctor's office, due to horrible healthcare systems.

606
01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But it takes longer. But you spend more time than that waiting at the doctor's office, due to.

607
01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:03.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Healthcare systems like there's a just set up that contrast. You've set up the 2 h. So just contrast it

608
01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:08.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him): directly. But no, I like it. I'm curious what the rest of the group thought

609
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): cause he definitely changed it since the last time we did this together.

610
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:29.420
Nirat Attri: I think that was literally the phrase that I changed because, like everybody, wanted it to be smaller. But then I actually figured what we had initially was better. Even as I said it, like, this was one of the second times that I was doing this version. But yeah.

611
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.420
Nirat Attri: the version that you're mentioning fits better.

612
01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:39.180
Lilliana Robinson: I do agree. I was gonna say, it's a little bit out of place, you say, Effing.

613
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:43.990
Lilliana Robinson: because the way that you delivered it was so calm

614
01:04:43.990 --> 01:05:07.580
Lilliana Robinson: like you almost are like a doctor. You're coming off as an authority. You're very calm. You're like sternly saying these things. There's really no room to even doubt you. That's how well you're delivering it. I liked your hands like this. There was no fidgeting. You were an authority, and so it's a little bit out of place to say something more like juvenile. I don't know if you, if you want that in there as like talk value, or

615
01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:19.260
Lilliana Robinson: 1st people to like Perk up their ears. It's up to you, but that's what I thought. But I really loved your delivery standing up. It was just so calm. Your body positioning was just like radiating authority. It was very good.

616
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I agree. I think the

617
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know you could say fucking.

618
01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:38.563
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I think that would be probably worse. It would get more of a shock value. And I think Effing feels sort of man out of place. I would probably skip that word as I did when I delivered that.

619
01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:42.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I just think it's not.

620
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:56.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, when in Routeific, he said, that, you know don't make left hand turns. I'm going to tell you that's bullshit, but he wasn't trying to be a doctor. He wasn't trying to be a an authority, and I I think it worked there. It's unusual

621
01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:01.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in general. You have to have a really good reason to to swear on stage.

622
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:10.989
Nirat Attri: I think the idea was that, like I was expecting the room to be crowded. So I wanted like to have that shock value to begin with, so that people pay attention.

623
01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:20.799
Nirat Attri: But I also understand, like, I'm also putting it there for no justification, like I started off with like fucking. But then it's just not me. So I

624
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:23.689
Nirat Attri: like, like, somewhere in the middle. Yeah.

625
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:42.589
Lilliana Robinson: But you found another way to get people to listen. Which is the way you're delivering it, like I think people are going to be like. Oh, this is really interesting, because you're not saying it in a monotone way, like some of your classmates here who, I've said, need to work on it. You're saying it in a calm way. So it's just like, Oh, I really need to listen to this guy. He knows what he's talking about.

626
01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:51.440
Lilliana Robinson: That's all you need. And then George had a good point. You're talking about how frustrating it is so sound frustrated you don't have to use. You don't have to use verbiage for it.

627
01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:55.930
Lilliana Robinson: waiting at the doctor's office, okay.

628
01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:00.700
Nirat Attri: I'll I'll work with that.

629
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:01.920
Lilliana Robinson: Board of.

630
01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him): No, I think it's very good.

631
01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:09.910
Lilliana Robinson: Troy. I can see your hand in that that I really like. That's really good.

632
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.449
Nirat Attri: It's all I think it's it's 90% dry at this point. So.

633
01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You're delivering it. You gotta own it.

634
01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.119
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, it's yours now.

635
01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.719
Lilliana Robinson: All right, George. Last, but not least.

636
01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.720
Lilliana Robinson: Start with your objective.

637
01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:32.509
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, thanks. Troy. Yeah. So objective is to sort of

638
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:39.919
George Reed - Noetic: I'm looking for client attention. I'm looking to speak with clients. And so I want to use the 1 min pitch to sort of set up the problem and sort of

639
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:49.180
George Reed - Noetic: maybe make people in the audience feel some sort of frustration with the problem and then use the demo video to give a real world example and have an actual

640
01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:57.589
George Reed - Noetic: client go through their case study in the video to sort of make it feel real, and then use the Q&A to fill the gaps in terms of the business and everything.

641
01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:04.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright. So I'm gonna ask you to restate that using specific language. This is something we did last time. So you said.

642
01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:27.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm gonna talk about the problem. I'm gonna have a client. I'm gonna do. QA. In real life. And you didn't even use a single word that gave me clues to what your business is, or who the client is, or what the problem is right. So we have to all get out of the habit of saying, I want people to understand my problem. We have to say, I want people understand how painful it is that healthcare systems don't connect to each other.

643
01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:37.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right? That's the that's what you want. Right? So let's do it again. But use specific language about who your client, what the problem like, use specifics whenever available.

644
01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): use specifics.

645
01:08:39.939 --> 01:08:45.601
George Reed - Noetic: Okay? Sure. So speaking to clients who are consumer insight managers, I want them to use the pitch to

646
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:49.829
George Reed - Noetic: make them feel the pain of conducting poorly

647
01:08:50.616 --> 01:08:55.739
George Reed - Noetic: some guided research making the wrong decisions, costing them that money

648
01:08:56.127 --> 01:09:10.819
George Reed - Noetic: and then use the demo to give a real world example of that where a project was failing, and would have been a complete wash had they not used noetic system to then revive the product, and then put it on the right track. And then, yeah, use the Q&A to

649
01:09:11.079 --> 01:09:17.219
George Reed - Noetic: fill in all the gaps that those consumer insight managers might be thinking about

650
01:09:17.499 --> 01:09:20.679
George Reed - Noetic: based on those 1st 2 parts? Does it make more sense.

651
01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:26.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Makes much more sense to me. It's much more specific, and I think for everybody

652
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:32.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him): use specific language whenever possible, especially when you can replace a

653
01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:43.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): generic word like client with a specific word, consumer insight manager, I mean, it's 3 words. But you know, instead of saying, I'm looking for clients, you say I'm looking for consumer insight managers.

654
01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:49.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Like it. Just use specific specific language. All right, go ahead.

655
01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.229
George Reed - Noetic: Cool. Thanks, Troy! Alrighty!

656
01:09:51.850 --> 01:10:01.420
George Reed - Noetic: So some of you in the audience might remember when 2 of the world's largest consumer brands Coke and Pepsi took a bet on natural sodas. Coke life and Pepsi. True.

657
01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:14.640
George Reed - Noetic: Well, there's a reason why most of us don't remember. And both were multimillion dollar failures. And how about Hollywood's short form streaming service quibi, which imploded in its 1st month after burning through nearly 2 billion dollars of funding

658
01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:21.200
George Reed - Noetic: with an easy way to understand their consumers at every decision point they could have significantly mitigated these risks.

659
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:34.619
George Reed - Noetic: I'm George, founder of Noetic, and for consumer insight teams who need fast and accurate research, we enable a constant collaboration with their market by reflecting consumers, own insights back to them through iterated conversation.

660
01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:40.190
George Reed - Noetic: before the product launches before millions are invested, and before career ending mistakes are made.

661
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:51.010
George Reed - Noetic: Imagine if Coke had a super low friction way to know their natural soda would be rejected, or if Quibi had understood that viewers don't want short form. Hollywood, content.

662
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:59.310
George Reed - Noetic: know that it could have saved them from career ending failure with our democratized consumer directed research. Let's hear from our client Dom, to see how it works.

663
01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.279
Lilliana Robinson: 1 0, 3.

664
01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I like that.

665
01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Cool you are.

666
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:05.740
George Reed - Noetic: Thanks. Paul.

667
01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:20.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Compared to the 1st time you were very specific about what problem you're solving and for whom you used an example. What I like about the example of the natural sodas. Is it caught my attention? Right? You named 2 sodas I'd never heard of.

668
01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:27.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it's like you may have heard of. No, I haven't heard of those. And then you made me feel okay about it, because you said most of you haven't, because it was such a failure.

669
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:43.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, I'm not clueless like it was. It was engaging. And I was thought, What's the next example? Oh, Quibi, that's right. I've forgotten the name, Quibby, but I did remember that experiment, that short form video experiment where they spent so much money.

670
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:48.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I thought it. I thought it was compelling and great. Now, hopefully, you have a video that's going to deliver

671
01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:52.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and and show us how it works. But I think the pitch is very good.

672
01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:55.710
George Reed - Noetic: Cool. Thanks, right. Thanks to you.

673
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:58.669
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Thing, so if I were to try to make it better.

674
01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:03.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think you can tweak your delivery a little bit. You can be a little bit more passionate. You were a little.

675
01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You were still, you had variation.

676
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.829
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but you were a little monotone in it.

677
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.730
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah. Totally. Okay. Cool.

678
01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.739
George Reed - Noetic: Got a couple of weeks, not 10 days to work on that. Thank you.

679
01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:14.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yep.

680
01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:18.150
Lilliana Robinson: I think your opening can be a lot more fun in the delivery.

681
01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:36.490
Lilliana Robinson: because that's that's interesting. Right? That's like, I think it's going to be a breath of fresh air with like, how you're opening. It's interesting. It's like, Oh, that's really cool. That's an interesting way to think about it, but you're delivering it like it should be boring almost, but it's like fun and interesting. So say it like it's fun and interesting.

682
01:12:36.948 --> 01:12:42.800
Lilliana Robinson: Remember, like Pepsi Pepsi life, or whatever it's called Coke. What it was. It was it called Coke life.

683
01:12:43.148 --> 01:12:44.890
George Reed - Noetic: Coke, life and Pepsi, true.

684
01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:47.330
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, Coke life. And is he true?

685
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:51.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And you gotta. And the way to make it more impactful

686
01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:58.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is to deliver it in a way where, like in the 1st sentence, you just are assuming everybody remembers it right? So what was it.

687
01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:01.650
George Reed - Noetic: Og, Coclear, Pepsi, True.

688
01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:02.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

689
01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you all probably remember when the 2 biggest soda companies

690
01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): did. You know, had this had this natural flavoring thing Pepsi life and poke true.

691
01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:15.140
George Reed - Noetic: True. I'm doing it the other way around where I'm like skeptical tone.

692
01:13:15.872 --> 01:13:17.390
George Reed - Noetic: But you're right. That's that's better.

693
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:23.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So if you do it like that, and everybody's like, Wait! No, I don't. Well, many of you don't remember it, because it was a total failure.

694
01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:31.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How about Quibi? Remember that 1, 2 billion dollars spent on short form video turns out, none of us want to watch short form video.

695
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:35.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It'd been amazing if they'd had those insights before they spent the money.

696
01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:42.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But I think deliver the the Pepsi life, and Coke, true as though you're assuming everybody's heard it.

697
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:43.110
George Reed - Noetic: Hmm.

698
01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:50.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then you pause, and they say most of you haven't, because it was a total failure.

699
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.420
George Reed - Noetic: Like. I think that'll be punchier, cool.

700
01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:54.070
Lilliana Robinson: It's all about the job.

701
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:56.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The right words. You just change the delivery.

702
01:13:56.713 --> 01:13:58.330
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, love it. Thank you.

703
01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:00.600
Lilliana Robinson: But you have to have that drop that Troy was saying.

704
01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:06.210
George Reed - Noetic: I put the pause in, and I do that. But I gotta change the tones, flip the tone kind of yeah, I like.

705
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:12.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, yeah. Get all excited. You guys all remember that great fight between Pepsi and Coke, where they did Pepsi life and Coke True was awesome.

706
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:17.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, most of you don't remember that, do you? It was a total failure.

707
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How about Quidby? Remember, you know, like

708
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:30.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him): again, you're overemphasizing. It would feel unnatural in a face to face conversation. But when you're on stage delivering to 150 people.

709
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it'll feel just right.

710
01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:40.510
Lilliana Robinson: And, like you said you have 10 days, so it will feel unnatural at first, st and then the more you do it, it'll feel natural.

711
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:42.850
Lilliana Robinson: Good job, George.

712
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:44.620
George Reed - Noetic: Awesome. Thank you.

713
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:58.760
Lilliana Robinson: Troy. We made it because we only have 9 today. The other 3 had something they let us know. Thank you for coming 3 times. I cannot thank you enough for sharing your time. He only does this with our cohort guys. So this is like.

714
01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, this is a, this is a special thing for you guys.

715
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:09.134
Lilliana Robinson: Yes, and we really really appreciate it. It honestly makes such a difference for all of the pitches. It's it's wonderful. Thank you so much for

716
01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:16.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Fun, and I will be there in person. I can't wait to see you all meet you all in person, and watch you kick ass on stage.

717
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:17.700
Lilliana Robinson: When do you.

718
01:15:19.443 --> 01:15:23.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Like I don't know. 2 noon or 2 o'clock on Friday, so.

719
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:24.310
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, great. Okay.

720
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:25.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'll go straight there.

721
01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.380
Lilliana Robinson: Amazing.

722
01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:31.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't even know where there is, but I'm sure I have it in my calendar, so I'll figure it out.

723
01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:33.030
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, we're saying.

724
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): At 4.

725
01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:38.650
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, the doors are gonna close at 4 15. So just make sure you're there before that.

726
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:41.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, hold on. Let me check what time I land.

727
01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and you got to save me a seat.

728
01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:47.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't do all this work for free. I need a seat.

729
01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:47.820
Lilliana Robinson: Of course.

730
01:15:48.885 --> 01:15:50.719
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: I anyone. It's gonna be you.

731
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:51.610
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. We'll also.

732
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:57.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, I land at 1244, so I should have no trouble at Sfo.

733
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:58.960
Lilliana Robinson: Totally put you in the front row.

734
01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:02.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right. Awesome.

735
01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:02.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay.

736
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:03.600
Lilliana Robinson: Good luck!

737
01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Practice, and remember

738
01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:18.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that you are building muscle memory. However you practice. However, whatever your intonations are, whatever your hand motions are, that's what you're going to default to when you're nervous on stage.

739
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:27.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So whatever you want it to be on stage, that's how you should be practicing, whether it's in front of a mirror, whether it's in front of your friends, whatever it is.

740
01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:30.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): practice the way you want to deliver it.

741
01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:36.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then that'll be natural, and that's how you'll deliver it, because that's what you'll default to.

742
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Awesome.

743
01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You heard him. Okay, Troy. See? You soon.

744
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.830
George Reed - Noetic: Troy.

745
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:43.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Bye.

746
01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.789
Talitha: Bye, thanks, bye.
