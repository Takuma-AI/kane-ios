### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Lilliana Robinson: making the time for the meeting. Yes, I mean, let's jump to the statements. Okay? Cause I wanna make sure we like, okay, we trust your process. So 1 one thing that I want to point out here is we were hearing, you know. So for us, we were like very concerned about that, like, they're not really making a lot of noise about, you know, the issues, thanks to go all the way to the the flasters.
- Lilliana Robinson: And then you almost treat it like a client situation that leads you into a platform develop. That's my thought. Because, like, if you're struggling to gauge the pain through this process, we might need to throw out this process just like get paid.
- Lilliana Robinson: So question for you. So wh, what are the implications here? Because I have a lot of questions about? You know the process and the screening criteria like who you were talking to what you're trying to learn. But that being said, tell us what your plan is. Now and then we'll see where that takes us.

### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: But that is not the external number. The external number is below. The more important number, rather is, the quality is 3.5. And I think for us it's more important that we get to a 5, you know. So that's why you can go to the next slide."

> "Lilliana Robinson: That plastering, collecting the data in a structured manner is difficult. So this is the consistency, the format measuring protocols, and to see, and then, finally, the person had to do. This is always overwhelmed, you know. So we were trying very hard to hunt on the person who specifically has to do this."

> "Danny Pereira: it was always when some key life inflection point happened negatively for someone to thinking about money for the first time. Negatively, I guess abstract. I'll explain on a sec. But it was everything from being cut off by their parents, which is what like every college could told us right or when they were just getting a job for the first time, or an internship, and not wanting to blow their money away."

> "Danny Pereira: Yeah, so literally. So we realize that there's always fragmented solutions between Oss and then private companies. But really the only way you're ever gonna drive and find the best experiences, the best coaches, the best, whatever it may be, is by letting the people who are best at that build them out and test through them. So we're gonna give people a platform to essentially be able to host their experiences, host their games, host their functions, to allow people to essentially purchase them in the package"

> "Danny Pereira: Totally. No, yeah. I totally hear you like this. There's definitely affluence speaking here in these, in some of these people that we interviewed. I think the key thing, though, is right there right, even if, like the pedes are self funding whatever. And we heard one of the people we talked to was one of like the ones who wasn't affluent. It's the fact that it's right because they're college kids. They're so peer pressure. They're so wanting to have fun. And all these things"
