1
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.180
Sambhav Mehta: Keep it

2
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.209
Sambhav Mehta: another check in before our final understanding of this 1st session on Thursday.

3
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.620
Sambhav Mehta: So did I integrate with synthesis

4
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:40.350
Sambhav Mehta: what we're seeing for when we talk about why? For the why is one to 3 formal job seekers. Okay? So going back to this format of the

5
00:01:41.190 --> 00:02:10.519
Sambhav Mehta: what's your situation. I want to accomplish this goal. So I can achieve Xyz End result. Going back to this, we want one to 3 of these supported by evidence. So going back to your interview transcripts picking out high energy quotes, if it's not supported by the data you're receiving in those interviews, it's not. It's not real, and you'll be, you'll be building on. So really focusing on those quotes where you're finding the highest energy. Probably.

6
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.050
Sambhav Mehta: So before the presentation brief job statement you want to see enforces

7
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:29.250
Sambhav Mehta: the habits, anxieties, push and pull which you should have from your debriefs after each interview. Should have been for sirens group each of these interviews

8
00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:39.900
Sambhav Mehta: the motivations. Remember your your circle of functional, emotional, and social motivations. Why are people? What extra external factors are are acting on people.

9
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.630
Sambhav Mehta: So how we're we're looking at this

10
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:56.180
Sambhav Mehta: the competitors or existing alternatives for your segment. So what is the group currently doing to solve their problems. Where are they at at the time you're reaching them, especially if they're not user of your product.

11
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.150
Sambhav Mehta: and then quotes huge on the data. If you

12
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:16.479
Sambhav Mehta: want to refer back taking another flip through one on one would be a great thing to do tonight. Especially now that we have a little bit of time to look at this, the system that's outlined there.

13
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:28.660
Sambhav Mehta: So to give an example of a full, why, before the wire report, this is posted in base camp. We keep running that.

14
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.050
Sambhav Mehta: But

15
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:51.256
Sambhav Mehta: the origin of why, before the why originates with. So if you remember, from the earlier understanding your customer workshops, the the hair on fire base camp, little graphics like why people ended up coming to base camp because they were missing deadlines and using information.

16
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.279
Sambhav Mehta: this is essentially what we're what Jake turned back to when he was putting together. What? When? Why, after

17
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:07.429
Sambhav Mehta: conducting all of his interviews. So he landed on 4 clusters or customer stories, essentially job statements.

18
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.599
Sambhav Mehta: And here those are. So 1st off, there's gotta be a better way to spend my time.

19
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:33.259
Sambhav Mehta: So people who were feeling incompetent, feeling like they were wasting their time wanted to work on a new skill, useless. So super here, almost like an identity thing, and you can see how he explains in detail their situations where they're finding themselves the moment they

20
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.239
Sambhav Mehta: look at zest and sort of the situation that's pushing them towards this this new solution.

21
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:53.259
Sambhav Mehta: I don't offer enough to the people I care about so super super social here. He outlines some of the timeline elements, how their loved ones are interacting with them.

22
00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:04.479
Sambhav Mehta: And he stopped eating shitty food. So this one he actually didn't focus on early on, but ended up coming back to this profile pretty recently.

23
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.500
Sambhav Mehta: he started off with with this. It's like his 1st

24
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.130
Sambhav Mehta: to the customer, with the highest energy, the highest paying this

25
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.669
Sambhav Mehta: understanding like the end game of this and business, he ended up choosing this program that he's expanding to

26
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.499
Sambhav Mehta: approach and target different profiles as he's moved through.

27
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.460
Sambhav Mehta: and then the final one, how can I get my friends to help with me?

28
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.969
Sambhav Mehta: So I think

29
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.130
Sambhav Mehta: Neil correct me? But it started with. I don't offer enough to people I care about. Thank you to. How can I get my friends sitting out with me?

30
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Number 4, got really, big, yeah.

31
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.990
Sambhav Mehta: And then

32
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:54.119
Sambhav Mehta: this one kind of shows up in his dual window for cooking, messaging that he's adopted more recently. And now he's conducting additional interviews to see how we can better

33
00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:09.810
Sambhav Mehta: support people who are really home conscious. So when you're looking at these profiles, some of them, it's it's not going to be a never. But you are going to choose people who are the highest energy to focus on. Now as we get into growth, that's sort of the end results

34
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.559
Sambhav Mehta: in terms of what we're asking you for tomorrow.

35
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:28.300
Sambhav Mehta: We're gonna ask for your full reports on basecamp if you have them, and then we're asking for a 4 or 5 min presentation of the top 2 to 3 insights the jobs to be done. Process that you've done so far.

36
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:41.340
Sambhav Mehta: So the insights can be like, what's surprising, what's the most interesting. First, st we'll go through examples of alumni presentations momentarily. But basically, as you're putting this whole

37
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:52.820
Sambhav Mehta: document together, things will jump out as as the biggest things you want to talk about with the group within the areas you need support. If you want those jobs

38
00:06:53.412 --> 00:07:00.950
Sambhav Mehta: do your best, take a stab at this. If you're truly too early to have any form of synthesis or like

39
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:16.919
Sambhav Mehta: larger, more developed understanding here. Treat it as another checkpoint presentation. Tell us what you need next, to keep moving along through this process and use it to get support from the group and improve this process over.

40
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.750
Sambhav Mehta: and then, Neil, and go through this whole business

41
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:38.669
Sambhav Mehta: once you're finished with it. But everyone is gonna present for 5 min. Give or take for 5 min, and we do want to see the top 3 things that are interesting. And if you can see the most.

42
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.700
Sambhav Mehta: The only thing to add on, send us a.

43
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:49.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, this will be dissimilar to what we did 4 weeks ago. Together in week one when we talked this out before we headed off for the retreat.

44
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:59.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But just know that, like our expectation is that many of you have made a lot more progress since then. Some of you might still be struggling, and we'll help you. But this is our like final real

45
00:08:00.524 --> 00:08:09.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: wave of jobs to be done like time. Aside from the masterclass that we'll schedule with Bob towards the end of the program. So we're moving into growth.

46
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You know, product development sales

47
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:18.019
Neal Sáles-Griffin: fundraising like, that's the rest of this program. So just to be clear like, this is our way of basically saying.

48
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:24.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, go off into the jungle and figure it out. Otherwise you get one on one time with me and and otherwise, and get support on this.

49
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.740
Sambhav Mehta: That's yeah.

50
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:42.659
Sambhav Mehta: just a quick question. So for the beginning of the slide is like one to 3 states. So each of those statements. So, for example, you presented for Jake each of those statements is that like a combination of 8 to 12? Or is that like A

51
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:58.740
Sambhav Mehta: instead of like all the Jtvds that you've done, and then you put these 4 statements. Great great question. So he did his 10 to 12 interviews, and then over the course, these 10 to 12 interviews. He looked at the force diagrams and pulled in groups that emerged from within that

52
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.050
Sambhav Mehta: process. So he found that people gravitated into these 4 buckets

53
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.920
Sambhav Mehta: from the the set of interviews did excellent

54
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.190
Sambhav Mehta: oops.

55
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:21.209
Sambhav Mehta: So this is A. b 2 b. Example from Club, Rev. Our. Oakland, 2024.

56
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:41.500
Sambhav Mehta: So they were a they were focused on recruiting. And here's just their presentation in full, their main thing exactly who they were looking to interview. So they included their screening criteria, which is a great context reset, because many screening criteria change over time.

57
00:09:41.650 --> 00:10:11.310
Sambhav Mehta: So if you've updated your script screen criteria, it's a great thing to include here. The other thing is up to their learning question. So they were starting. They started off as application an applicant tracking system, and they were exploring. That was the like, the primary thing where they thought it was touching. This is what we need to explore and better understand? Are we better off? Being an additional tool for agencies versus standard

58
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.820
Sambhav Mehta: that makes sense.

59
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.125
Sambhav Mehta: So the

60
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:25.449
Sambhav Mehta: more more on their context, like what they brought into the process.

61
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:33.099
Sambhav Mehta: And then here is where we get into their statements overall. So the why before the Y here is my team is on the lead

62
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:49.759
Sambhav Mehta: very high energy very high, and that's where they came in. They found that a lot of people had recruiters who were getting burned out and overwhelmed, and the volume of hiring was too high, and they were afraid that they were gonna lose their teams because the workload was was too much.

63
00:10:49.780 --> 00:11:04.169
Sambhav Mehta: So below. You can see their job statement for this. For this cluster I have recruiters getting overwhelmed, overburdened. I want to alleviate their stress and bring on additional hiring support so that I can avoid attrition while still getting our hiring

64
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:16.199
Sambhav Mehta: so super clear. You understand exactly where these people are at, why they're shopping for different tools. Why, they're hiring additional support in the form of club Rec or additional tools, whatever that may be.

65
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:29.990
Sambhav Mehta: Their second cluster was, my recruiters were seen as incompetent. So this was pretty social it was. How was my my business being seen by candidates? How mapping to the public image?

66
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:38.133
Sambhav Mehta: Pretty, very processes. 1st question for a lot of folks so wanting to keep that clean

67
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:49.689
Sambhav Mehta: make sure that they're representing their company with specific skills and expertise, and avoiding for recruiters and their team for any hiring issues. So

68
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:56.559
Sambhav Mehta: another interesting one there, final one. I don't want to leave a bad taste in candidates. Mouth.

69
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:13.360
Sambhav Mehta: So this is larger scale. Here candidates can become competitors, customers discuss their personal experiences, also their social positive experiences and questions of the company. So their recommendation is.

70
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:25.170
Sambhav Mehta: So then they got into applications. To these insights. How are they gonna add these insights to sales, marketing, and product? So

71
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:47.029
Sambhav Mehta: they they gave a very high, level, simple overview of what their next steps were. From editing their messaging website and outreach to better show how coverage targets the specific pain points outlined, and they ended up starting off with with this as their their highest pain point that they targeted.

72
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:57.770
Sambhav Mehta: and then, as a sort of appendix. They didn't go through all this in their presentation, but they included a high level force diagram of what they found, and then

73
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.859
Sambhav Mehta: only been simple.

74
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:13.319
Sambhav Mehta: Next up we have Travaris. So you'll remember J. Lo! From the building, cross culture and all of my family.

75
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:22.720
Sambhav Mehta: So, Neil, these travel companies hates hate saints, and this this actually converted.

76
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.190
Sambhav Mehta: So he like

77
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:35.670
Sambhav Mehta: he's like founder bet for Jlo. Everything like her, not sold on entrepreneurs all until she put together this set of insights. It was like, Okay.

78
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.870
Sambhav Mehta: oh, a leader.

79
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.600
Sambhav Mehta: So consumer company.

80
00:13:42.242 --> 00:13:58.130
Sambhav Mehta: they started out techstars as a regenerative travel market. So very sustainability focused to planet. And it was gonna be a true marketplace connecting consumers with providers. These travel experience.

81
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:24.960
Sambhav Mehta: So the 1st cluster that they found is I am paying for them to care about the things that the things that I care about. So folks who like nice things want to spend money on them, send them up and make the most of their limited time off finding special places, makes us feel good, and allows us to relax and be conscious of our health, and the planet validates our choices and allows us to fully let go of any lingered guilt.

82
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:43.949
Sambhav Mehta: And you can see they included the 3 interviews that made up this cluster here. So if you want to attribute the exact names and interview numbers to keep you on track of, like the energy that each group has. You'll do that.

83
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:56.066
Sambhav Mehta: You don't need beautiful graphics. J. Lo has a an on staffing, anything gorgeous it can be really like like. But

84
00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:03.420
Sambhav Mehta: here we're seeing that it's it's not maybe, clerk, because

85
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:32.150
Sambhav Mehta: this is really different to the Rah rah planet. I want to find things that make the planet feel good. So through this process, she discovered that it's it's about guilt, and it's about would be willing to pay a little extra to alleviate larger, larger guilt about stability. There's this extra layer of social and emotional layers to this versus just the functional.

86
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:38.149
Sambhav Mehta: I want to do good for the planet. It's like an identity thing. So a lot more depth we're seeing here.

87
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:45.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The one really nice touch that they added to this was coding the interviewees associated with the insight

88
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: from all the people that they spoke to. I really like that extra 10.

89
00:15:52.592 --> 00:16:10.769
Sambhav Mehta: Here she included the existing alternatives on how people are are sort of solving for this problem now. So she didn't include her screening criteria. But her screening criteria was people who had hired a regenerative travel service or had actively sought out.

90
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:26.710
Sambhav Mehta: So things that are like marketed towards sustainability, but like wanted to understand why people were like on whatever service, whether it's travel agents, additional research tools that you have, that that's what she was trying to dig into.

91
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:41.339
Sambhav Mehta: So you can also see here her analysis of what that means for tobars, how she's thinking about targeting, how she's thinking about messaging, and how she's thinking about enabling the targeting of these specific groups

92
00:16:42.430 --> 00:17:12.050
Sambhav Mehta: for closer to this one was huge. She had not been thinking about this at all, but the bluster is, I don't want to be that American tourist, and this actually made it into her demonic like this exact mind. So I love to go to new places all over the world and enjoy the immersion cultures, people and food. But I want to make sure I get it right. I don't offend anyone, and I definitely don't just want to be surrounded by other wherever I go.

93
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:19.990
Sambhav Mehta: So some of you probably relate to this like not wanting to stick out like a sore thumb as at American first, st but just so, so.

94
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:35.520
Sambhav Mehta: so, so so social. Not even like any emotional aspects of sustainability, aren't there at all. This is about feeling like a local. And I think it's the place on the cultural level. The sustainability goals that that Jlo had front and center aren't part of this.

95
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:51.537
Sambhav Mehta: And she realized that she was projecting her values onto the customers. And it's a huge swaps of people that she could have taken advantage of before. So this ended up being her focus right on that. After she

96
00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.588
Sambhav Mehta: completed this process, she found that that messaging was

97
00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.230
Sambhav Mehta: really effective to implement it made it into a demo package, all of that.

98
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.459
Sambhav Mehta: So this this ended up being really taken too further.

99
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:27.789
Sambhav Mehta: So you can see the existing alternatives. How we're solving the problem now and the consistency of the language that you have this coming up. So if you see any like repeated language patterns like that. It probably won't be quite so obvious as this, like consumer example. But really pay attention to like high energy tones, clusters.

100
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.430
Sambhav Mehta: and then she's got her a little bit on how she can support this particular group of travelers.

101
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:41.180
Sambhav Mehta: Her 3rd cluster she kind of grew up watching. So in the high level

102
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.999
Sambhav Mehta: would recommend doing sort of subgroups, because the ultimate

103
00:18:45.770 --> 00:19:00.590
Sambhav Mehta: the ultimate conclusion here was that this group was a little too fractured, and there wasn't enough sort of shared pain for it to be a larger market. But she sort of brought these people together over the larger theme of identifying with the I go

104
00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:05.770
Sambhav Mehta: sort of mantra and like having an identity

105
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:11.570
Sambhav Mehta: focus on being kind of like, not like slip travel planning.

106
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:33.617
Sambhav Mehta: So this 1st group of parents was around wanting to share unique cultural experiences with their kids. But needing to combine that with more luxury and safety now that they have kids. I long for the way I used to travel, spontaneously immersive and focusing on

107
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:47.289
Sambhav Mehta: having needing more of a routine to travel and not being able to be as spontaneous while having kids. This was also, this sort of parent need. She targeted on a smaller scale for a little bit.

108
00:19:48.172 --> 00:19:53.660
Sambhav Mehta: She she got into the lobby groups to to talk to people about this.

109
00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:05.613
Sambhav Mehta: And there's more sort of context here. And then again, yeah, she highlights the identities. How important it was! And then she had a free C as well.

110
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:16.579
Sambhav Mehta: wanting to maximize my time and find the perfect balance between going to urban region. So combining those 2 features of vacations and bringing together.

111
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:27.519
Sambhav Mehta: And then here's a summary of her functional, social, and emotional forces here. Or motivations.

112
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:35.530
Sambhav Mehta: I don't believe she actually presented this, but she had it in her attendance an aggregated force diagram.

113
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:50.150
Sambhav Mehta: And then what she did present was her total, like her overall insights, that her regenerative marketplace became more immersive. Travel experience and targeted additional customer segments who weren't so focused on sustainability.

114
00:20:50.330 --> 00:21:11.680
Sambhav Mehta: So she changed her messaging and value prop to cater to a wider group of people, and better reflect the needs of the people who were finding these people were finding her, and they they just. She had been projecting her own and her team's motivations onto these people a bit more than it was really relevant, she was able to target her messaging a lot more.

115
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:22.349
Sambhav Mehta: She also moved from a standard marketplace model into a more concierge travel experience. So was mostly

116
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:34.960
Sambhav Mehta: file focused on bringing on more and more local experts and personalized itineraries based on people's individual goals, family situations. And that's what brought her to her 1st revenue?

117
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I wanna make sure we leave room for some questions, because I know we're getting close to the end of the time that we scheduled this for.

118
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.130
Sambhav Mehta: So back to the insights

119
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.970
Sambhav Mehta: chat questions.

120
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.520

121

Sambhav Mehta: We'll post these samples screenshot here tomorrow.

122
00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:20.480
Sambhav Mehta: It's 1 of my takeaways, like some really like the narrative.

123
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:26.760
Sambhav Mehta: because, like every company, is a little different. For this.

124
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.650
Sambhav Mehta: How much is this in this session? Do like.

126
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:40.860
Sambhav Mehta: or whatever you guys are doing for the like structure of the presentation. Well, how many interviews have you done

127
00:22:41.050 --> 00:23:03.579
Sambhav Mehta: so. That's part of the thing is that we we've done a lot of interviews. For realizing that the one that we want to do it in. We have scheduled those. So a lot of the for us, a lot of the a lot of what our analysis is actually more of who we don't want to target a different thing for us.

128
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:24.169
Sambhav Mehta: This you're all at different stages. This is like a lot of this endgame of the why before the why that we're going to send to route to the challenge. But in the short term, if you can't get to this stage yet. Then, who did you interview? Why did it break? Who are you targeting next? How can we help you find more of those people like

129
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.089
