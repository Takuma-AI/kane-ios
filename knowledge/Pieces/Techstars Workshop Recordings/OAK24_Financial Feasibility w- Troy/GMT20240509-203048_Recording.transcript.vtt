1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I will share

2
00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:08.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I will share the deck, and I will share the spreadsheets that we go over after this.

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:20.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I'm happy to do that again, I'd love it if you guys are who are here are actually here and present. So on video, not on email and slack, and your phones.

4
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

5
00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:26.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I see a lot of people who aren't on video yet.

6
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.780
Lilliana Robinson: I'm gonna assume you guys are coming on video. If not, you can drop and watch the recording. So just make sure that you're here. If you're here.

7
00:00:34.150 --> 00:01:03.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yep, alright. And this is, we're gonna do this interactively. So here's what the plan is. I'm gonna walk you through a couple of little an introduction to a deck. I'm gonna show you a very simple spreadsheet, and then I'm gonna give you a task, and the task is for you to build a spreadsheet like my very simple one. When I say simple, I mean, I do this on a whiteboard like you don't need excel. You could do it on a whiteboard. And then we're gonna have a few of you share what your work product was, and we'll be done with all of that within an hour. Okay.

8
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:17.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: can I get a thumbs up from you guys that you're here? You're present. You're engaged your emails off. Awesome. Alright. I'm going to try to do this really quickly, but it's shocking to me how many startups haven't thought through this?

9
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So if I do this right, I will share my screen, and

10
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I will.

11
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.300
Lilliana Robinson: Troy. Can I ask you a question first, before you can?

12
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:41.289
Lilliana Robinson: Is it true, like the background for this? What Ferona told me is that you had a financial modeling kind of part to you taught at Kellogg. And then you realized that these founders could really use it. So you wanted to share is that the background.

13
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:50.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So here's what's happened. You guys have most of you saw my financial modeling big talk, right? That we did a few what 4 weeks ago, or something like that. Right? Liliana. Yeah.

14
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.370
Lilliana Robinson: Just about.

15
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And it turns out that that's a little daunting for some people

16
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:13.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and and so I've reworked my entire financial modeling talk to start with this part which you're gonna see, it evolves, and I'll share with you at the end of the talk. How it evolves into something that looks a lot like Dollar Cave Club, but I am retiring. Dollar Cave Club.

17
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:25.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright, so you can see my screen. I'm going to start rolling again. Blurt stuff out. This is for you. It's not for me. Don't be shy, and jump right in.

18
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:49.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So again, I believe that financial modeling is a cheat code for operating a business. I always like to start with the objectives. This is the same. So you saw before. I want you to see the power financial model. Run your business. Better raise money more easily. Everybody wants to do those things. I'm going to give you some takeaways, and the same resources. Page that you saw before. Boom! So why should I care? Do you want to run your business better?

19
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Do you want to make raising capital easier.

20
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Do you want to make your business more predictable? Predictable is really, really, really important

21
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in business?

22
00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:07.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And a good model help you that. And then I give the example I gave last time, which is, if you knew you were going to grow 20, you could do great

23
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:17.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: if you knew you're gonna do 200. You could plan for that. You could do great. But if you plan for 20, if you plan for 200 growth and you got 20% growth. You're screwed.

24
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And, by the way, if you plan for 20, you get 200, you're also in big trouble because you don't have enough inventory. You don't have enough customer service.

25
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:32.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So and then we talk about financial models have to be dynamic. I'm going super fast because you guys have been exposed to this in the last financial modeling stuff.

26
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:57.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But you know the world we change in. We operate in changes all the time. This is why I say, the only thing I know for sure about a model is it's wrong, because the minute you write it, the economic conditions change. The new technologies come out. I mean, think about how fundamentally different AI has made so many things that were, you know, in the last 18 months, competitors come out. We've global pandemics, right? So no matter how accurate it was when you started, it's it's never gonna be perfect.

27
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:09.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But we can build a model that can change as conditions change. So I'm going to start with my simple example. This is the new content for you. So I want to be an entrepreneur. I love coffee. Who likes coffee.

28
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:36.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I see some hands. Okay, not everybody. Damn, I make the best coffee. I got this special secret ingredient, and I want to sell my coffee. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a lemonade stand except I'm gonna sell coffee. So I'm gonna picture like a little table, some boiling water and a yeti thermos pour overs. It's awesome, and I make better coffee. Everybody I share with it loves it, and I want to be an entrepreneur.

29
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: See? But to quit my day job I need to be able to pay the bills.

30
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I need 5 grand a month.

31
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's what I need.

32
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and so I have to figure out

33
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: how much coffee do I need to sell to make my minimum?

34
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: How do I figure that out? Anybody have an idea how many cups of coffee do I have to sell to sell my minimum

35
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to to make my minimum make 5 grand

36
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: depends on the.

37
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.570
Mircea Gogoncea: I don't think.

38
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.370
Jeremy Banning: Costs and output costs, and then

39
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:14.758
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, exactly. It depends. So we're gonna cut over to a spreadsheet. In a second, I have to switch my sharing because I haven't optimized this really for

40
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Unfortunately, I haven't optimized this for

41
00:05:19.022 --> 00:05:25.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: zoom, but let's do it. So I'm gonna share my screen again. And I'm gonna walk through.

42
00:05:26.343 --> 00:05:41.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I want this one alright share. Boom, alright. So here's the deal. You guys should be familiar with. This blue is inputs black or calculated. I got some inputs on my coffee. It turns out that you know I can buy coffee for 12 bucks a pound

43
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:50.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: pound of coffee makes 32 cups, so I divide those 2. You can see I did the math here, and I get it cost me 38 cents worth of coffee in a cup.

44
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:59.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: My secret ingredients, which I can't tell you what it is, but that's a 6 cents the lid. The cream, the sugar cost me 77 cents to make a cup of coffee.

45
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

46
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: now let's take a look at what I sell the coffee for.

47
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so if I sell the coffee for 2 50,

48
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:21.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and it cost me 77 cents. I'm left with a buck. 74. There's some rounding because they're fractional pennies. It's close enough. Trust me, and and so it's a buck. 74 is what I make on each cup of coffee.

49
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Now, I said I wanted to make 5 grand.

50
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:33.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so in order to make 5 grand. I take the 5 grand. I divide by the 174, and I get 2,882 cups of coffee a month.

51
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I can't get my head around that.

52
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:43.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so I divide by the 26 days a month. I plan on working. That's 111 cups a day. I can't get my head around that.

53
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I divide by the 8 HI plan on working a day, and that's 13.9 cups of coffee per hour.

54
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what this has told me

55
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is that in order to make a business that can pay me 5 grand.

56
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:08.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I have to sell 13 cups of coffee for 14 cups of coffee an hour, and I think that's too much. I don't. I could do that on busy hours, but I'm not going to sell that at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

57
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I think my business is going to fail. I'm going to just quit right.

58
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Cameron. Why you shaking your head, why why shouldn't I quit.

59
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.537
Cameron M Kruger Gyftgram: You can increase the amount of profit that you would make on your cup of coffee in order to.

60
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Her.

61
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.549
Cameron M Kruger Gyftgram: It's hours a day. You work.

62
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:33.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So sure so I could do something like I could lower the I could buy cheaper coffee. I'm gonna buy $10 a pound coffee instead of 12 pound coffee.

63
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:40.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, well, that didn't make much of an impact. It went from 13 9 to 13 4. I want good coffee. I really like good coffee.

64
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What else if I, if I, changing.

65
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: reducing my cost, didn't help much? What else can I do.

66
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.819
Mircea Gogoncea: Increase the sale price.

67
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: How much should I charge for my coffee?

68
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.230
Cameron M Kruger Gyftgram: Depends.

69
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.829
Mircea Gogoncea: $4. Ford.

70
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:59.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: $4 a cup, and now I only have to sell 7 cups of coffee an hour

71
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that feels more manageable. That's like one every 9 min, 10 min that feels manageable to me.

72
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: As a matter of fact, I think that feels good enough

73
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that I'm willing to to go out and actually start working on this business because I now have a target

74
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:23.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that in order to get this business running and break, even, I have to sell 7.4 cups of coffee an hour. I think I can do that.

75
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and and I think it's worth doing

76
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: every single business I have ever started.

77
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I have done this, whether it was on a simple spreadsheet like this.

78
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or it was on the back of a napkin, or it was on a whiteboard.

79
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: This is the first step I take.

80
00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:44.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Now I'm going to show you 2 more examples.

81
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I see there are some questions in the chat. What's the chat? Say.

82
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.520
Lilliana Robinson: No, I.

83
00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:58.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, got it. Okay, you're watching me. Alright. Let me give you 2 more examples. So if you remember, I started a company called sure payroll.

84
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:17.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So sure payroll. It looks sort of like this, we I doing this one differently. I'm not doing it per month. I'm doing this per year, because we have some expenses. And so in my expenses. So our expenses are basically moving money between accounts. And so the number of employees that a customer has

85
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:27.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: dictates how many accounts we have to move back and forth. So the average we looked up in the public filings that paychecks had 14 employees and their average customer.

86
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:38.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I did a little math about how many transfers. That is because there's some for taxes and other things. So it's number of employees plus a constant. It cost us about 3 cents an Ach! So 60 cents a payroll.

87
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:47.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The average customer runs 20 payrolls per year. So that's 12 bucks in cost of moving money around. That's not very much.

88
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:54.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, but then I had some other costs. So here's my! I brought my 12 bucks over here.

89
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let's start at the top. I know that I'm charging on a per employee basis. I put this little formula in here. It was 1995, plus 50 cents a pay an employee.

90
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I know we're running 20 payroll. So that got me my revenue

91
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:18.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then my costs. I pulled the cost over from here, and then I had to customer service. I'm estimating it was 3 h of customer service a year at 25 bucks an hour.

92
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's 75 bucks. So my total cost is 87. So I make 4 50

93
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: per customer per year.

94
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:35.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, I have some fixed costs here, some file servers, some couple of developers, a controller. I needed to put an office for them. That's about 450,000.

95
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:43.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So in round numbers, if I have to cover $450,000, and I make 4 50 in contribution margin. I need basically a thousand customers.

96
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: This make sense to everybody.

97
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright, I'm going to give you one more example.

98
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: different one, and this is a mobile app, and at apples.

99
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.109
Lilliana Robinson: Try. Yeah, in the gym.

100
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.240
Lilliana Robinson: How did you come to the estimate on customer service hours a year.

101
00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I made that shit up.

102
00:11:00.772 --> 00:11:02.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But it's an input.

103
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So if I'm wrong, it's a great question.

104
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:15.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I just tried to like pencil it in what I thought it was going to be. I'm like, well, you know, in the first month they'll probably need an hour customer service. Maybe I don't know. It is a wild ask. Yes.

105
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know. But if it if I'm off by factor of 2,

106
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it's actually not that big a deal.

107
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:28.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because it went. Now I doubled my customer service hours. And now I need basically 1,200 instead of 1,000.

108
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:35.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But I can see the sense, the beauty of this is, I can see the sensitivity. So that was an excellent, excellent question.

109
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:42.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: By the way, I didn't tell you the rest of the story. The rest of the story was, we started processing payroll.

110
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and it turned out we didn't average 14 like paychecks, did.

111
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:56.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We averaged 6 employees, for we ended up skewing towards a smaller customer base who had 6 employees like, Oh, no, I'm screwed. I'm going to have half the revenue.

112
00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:04.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but it turns out I can just type in a 6 here. This is real life. This is what happened like, oh, crap! We're only averaging 6.

113
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:21.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, you know what? It's not that bad. My revenue went down. I don't make 4 50 anymore. I make, you know, 3 77. And again it comes out to about 1,200. So it was a 20 difference in how many customers I needed. It wasn't a hundred percent difference.

114
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You see how, even in this very simple one tab.

115
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: this is a dynamic model where I have inputs. And I have outputs.

116
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right, let me show you the third example.

117
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: a basic iphone app.

118
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:47.095
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So this time I did it. It says annual. But it's really lifetime, because most iphone most consumer facing iphone apps. Don't

119
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, the monthly. So the subscript average subscription is well under a year.

120
00:12:52.003 --> 00:12:52.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But anyway.

121
00:12:52.980 --> 00:13:01.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so this time I said, well, I gotta pay to acquire the customer my variable expenses, and I put in 25 bucks for customer acquisition. I'm gonna have to pay apple tax

122
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: of 30%, right?

123
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So that's based on what my revenue.

124
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I guess I should update that to say, average

125
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:19.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm you can tell. This is my Mvp and I guess that should say average also.

126
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:37.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So anyway, so so I had that I'm charging 999. The average customer stays 5 and a half months. So I make a total of 54, 95 times the 30 cents gets me the cost here you can see it. That gets me the apple tax.

127
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so I've cost the $41.

128
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:49.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I had revenue of 54. So 54, minus 41 gets me 13. So I make 13 bucks on each customer.

129
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:55.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I have some servers for the back end. I said. I've got some developer costs. I've got to pay the found or something.

130
00:13:56.448 --> 00:13:59.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I need $250,000.

131
00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:04.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: If I'm only making $13 a customer. I need 18,000 customers.

132
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Can I get 18,000 customers?

133
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know.

134
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:17.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It also quickly gets you some levers here. If you realize, if you're going to, if you think you only can charge 5, 99.

135
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, I lose money on every customer. I'm out of business

136
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:35.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like it. The math doesn't even work. It comes up to negative 127,000 customers. That's because you have a negative like it. You're out of business right? If your churn is such that your average customer only stays 3 months, you're out of business

137
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like you see that you can play with some of these levers.

138
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So here's what I wanna do.

139
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What I want to do at this point is, I want

140
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:55.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: first, I want to take questions on this. Now, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna reshare my screen with all 3 of these examples, the simple coffee stop

141
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the sure payroll and the basic mobile app, and I want you each to build.

142
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Take 10 min and build your version of this.

143
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:10.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: How many customers, how many transactions, how many subscriptions? I don't know what your businesses are. They're all different. Do you need

144
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to break even? And I think most of you are going to be sort of similar to

145
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: this payroll, where you have some costs

146
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:25.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: of delivering your service. That could be. Api calls for the AI engine. Whatever it could be.

147
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You have some amount of revenue.

148
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You subtract out all of your costs that are variable costs

149
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that gets you a contribution margin per customer.

150
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:44.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then you have some things that you need to keep the doors open. This is the indirect cost

151
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or overhead cost. Then you figure out how many of those transaction subscriptions.

152
00:15:50.310 --> 00:16:07.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: etc. You need to to take to break. Even does this make sense any questions about the assignment? And then what we're gonna do is I'm gonna have like, like a couple of you share these and say, Oh, I had a lot of problems I didn't understand. Here's how my business works. And there's gonna be a bunch of learning around

153
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: this very basic feasibility. Valeria.

154
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:25.511
valeria brenner: Okay, I have kind of like, a, okay. So our business model, we sell shipping labels. And so how do we go about doing it when it's dependent on. Yes, the number of customers we get, but also the number of shipping labels we.

155
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, one of your assumptions is, how many shipping labels does a customer have.

156
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.580
valeria brenner: Okay.

157
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Does your average customer have right.

158
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:34.460
valeria brenner: Yeah.

159
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:43.992
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So you're trying to figure out your average. I'm just setting up right now, the other the other windows so that we can see all, you'll be able to see all 3 of them on your screen at once.

160
00:16:44.709 --> 00:16:52.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then I need one more. So. Yes. Do you have that just like I had an assumption of how many employees do I have per

161
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: customer in the payroll business.

162
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because we charge more based on the

163
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:05.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: number of we charge based on the number of employees you would have. How many shipping labels does the average customer buy

164
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? Does that make sense.

165
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.090
valeria brenner: Yes.

166
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:14.539
Lilliana Robinson: And since Valeria has re real customers already, should she just pull the average? That's like that is.

167
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:34.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So for this exercise I would encourage you to not spend a waste a lot of time on researching averages, but rather to just put in what your best guess is. Later on you'll be able to. More important is that you get the math correctly correct. Later on you'll be able to tweak it and put your actual, more precise numbers in.

168
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:51.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I'm going to share my screen so that you can see all 3 models. They might be a little small. I apologize, but you can see all 3 now. I'll try to make them a little bigger for you and and take. We're going to take literally.

169
00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:57.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: will take 12 min. And I want you each to build a model

170
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:04.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like this for your business. And then we're gonna we're gonna have one at a time. We're gonna have a couple of you guys share, and we're gonna talk through them all right. Go

171
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: feel free to hit me up in chat. If you have questions.

172
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:17.120
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, there's one question in the chat. So go ahead and start, guys. But Jeremy asked, can you show the formula for the total contribution margin.

173
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So in this one it's just a sum of revenue minus total cost.

174
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:28.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And oh, wait! Do I have the same one up? I have the same one up twice for my simple coffee stand

175
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: oops. I gotta shrink this. Sorry.

176
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know. Contribution per cup is again revenue minus cost.

177
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:40.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And and then for basic mobile app. I sorry I didn't.

178
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I I got 3 copies up. I just didn't switch to the various tabs.

179
00:18:45.576 --> 00:18:50.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Again. It is gonna be your total revenue, minus your variable costs.

180
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So it's the same in all 3. It's revenue minus variable costs.

181
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right?

182
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Trying to arrange these so they can be as big as possible.

183
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.949
Lilliana Robinson: It's it's legible how it is right now, if you just click.

184
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:13.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Ok, Bye.

185
00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.970
Lilliana Robinson: See one, since it's overlap.

186
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.030
Lilliana Robinson: Yep.

187
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:17.739
Lilliana Robinson: so like.

188
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That all right.

189
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.505
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: This looks really simple on the surface. And I think you're gonna find it's more difficult than you thought.

190
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And the fun part Liliana is, I'm going to randomly pick people to share. How about that?

191
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.289
Lilliana Robinson: That's always fun.

192
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Keep them on their toes.

193
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, yeah.

194
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.289
Lilliana Robinson: Better make sure you're building. It

195
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.790
Lilliana Robinson: also doesn't need to be perfect. The whole.

196
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:04.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: No, it won't be perfect. And don't worry about putting pretty boxes and making it look nice like I just don't worry about that.

197
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:12.080
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, like Troy said at Kellogg, the business school. He has them right on a whiteboard, so you could even like write this out.

198
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:18.936
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I mean, really, though, Troy, like what you want, like everybody here should be chomping at the bit to get your eyes on their model.

199
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I mean.

200
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

201
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Make my business better. Please help me.

202
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Think so.

203
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm a little biased, though, Neil.

204
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.217
Lilliana Robinson: How many minutes do we have left for them? Try.

205
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:40.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We're gonna go. Sorry we started at 48. So we're gonna go to the top of the hour to give them 12 min. So

206
00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:41.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you got

207
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 7 and a half minutes left.

208
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.650
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect.

209
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. You should be thinking about wrapping up

210
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: oops.

211
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.540
Lilliana Robinson: Troy. Is there meant to be a document over some of this.

212
00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, I don't know why that came up. Sorry! That's

213
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'll move it.

214
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.530
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. 1 min. Left. Everybody.

215
00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Thanks.

216
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I should have moved it earlier.

217
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right, you guys ready who wants to go first?

218
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Valeria? Awesome. I will stop sharing.

219
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.839
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and you can share.

220
00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.616
valeria brenner: Okay. Awesome. Let me hold on. Share my screen.

221
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:15.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And I would actually love it if your peers are the ones who are making more of the comments than me. But

222
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: let's see what happens here.

223
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.849
valeria brenner: Okay, very bare bones. Here's what I came up with for the very.

224
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:24.555
Lilliana Robinson: Start, start, start with a 10 s overview of what your business is. Cause.

225
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:34.129
valeria brenner: Okay, yeah, we sell shipping labels to small businesses on Instagram. So we just help them ship out their products back faster. And they just buy usps, shipping labels from us.

226
00:30:35.105 --> 00:30:35.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Kay.

227
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:58.430
valeria brenner: And then so I looked at the variable expense for transactions. They cover the payment processing costs, and then we're about to switch over to a shipping program that actually won't have a label Api cost cause they make revenue off of the shipping labels. They sell to us as like a commission from Usps. And so I looked at just the cost to acquire a customer, for right now.

228
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:15.190
valeria brenner: Then, in the contribution margin section. I looked at the revenue per label sold. So we earn 30 cents on every shipping label sold. The average label sold per transaction is 6.7. And so we earn around $2 and one cents per transaction.

229
00:31:15.446 --> 00:31:30.860
valeria brenner: And then the average number of transactions they do in a month is 4, and the average lifetime. I didn't have time to look that up was 5.5. I just like copied it from you, and I was like, oh, sure, that sounds about right. And so the average revenue I earn a year per customer.

230
00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Can you click into that cell?

231
00:31:33.415 --> 00:31:34.839
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 44 22? Nope.

232
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.898
valeria brenner: Yes, so I did.

233
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:43.649
valeria brenner: the revenue per transaction times 4 transactions a month, times of average lifetime of 5.5.

234
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:44.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Great.

235
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.719
valeria brenner: So we got $44 and 22 cents, minus the cost of goods. Sold, says $41

236
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.080
valeria brenner: per customer.

237
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

238
00:31:52.300 --> 00:32:01.059
valeria brenner: And then I looked at gross profit to cover weekly overhead. And so for founders, there's 2 of us. So I did like a hundred 50 for 2 people, and then we spent.

239
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So annual overhead.

240
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:03.450
valeria brenner: Yes.

241
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:04.590
valeria brenner: and so.

242
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It says weekly, that's all.

243
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:32.329
valeria brenner: I got sorry I was playing around with different things and so then, we spend around 10,000 on like front end developers cause. It's me and a CTO. So he does most of the development work. And so the estimate of like 10 K development work and then for operations I just like didn't have time to crunch everything. But I was like, sure, like the website Api we pay for was $90 or sorry the email ap the email Api service we pay for is that.

244
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:37.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It'll it'll go up over time. But so you basically need about 4,000 customers

245
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to

246
00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:46.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: break even here. And how are you acquiring these customers. You had a customer cost of $3. That seems really low to me.

247
00:32:46.200 --> 00:33:00.219
valeria brenner: So right now all of our customer acquisition is organic, but we just launched an ambassador program where any ambassador who enjoys using us like reps us. And then if someone signs up using their link, they earn $3 and shipping label credits.

248
00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:00.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Got it.

249
00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:02.489
valeria brenner: And that's how I got that Cac.

250
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:06.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So do you think you can get to 4,000 customers organically?

251
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.210
valeria brenner: Yes.

252
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Awesome. Well, Leanna is her hand up.

253
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:15.879
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, why is B, 7 0. The labels really cost nothing.

254
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.960
valeria brenner: Well, right now they cost like

255
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:36.960
valeria brenner: 3 cents ish per label like the Api fee. But then we're gonna move over to Easy Post, and then the first, like 100,000 labels you ship with or like, generate through them. There's 0 Api fees, and then they're going to. We're looking at like getting a unique deal with them. We might not have to pay those Api fees.

256
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.379
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, interesting. Yeah, that's not how I thought it worked. That's cool.

257
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:39.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Awesome.

258
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So there are a couple people with hands up.

259
00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.789
Lilliana Robinson: Think they're volunteering to go.

260
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Volunteering to go. Question.

261
00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.990
Lilliana Robinson: Is anyone asking something or commenting on Valerias?

262
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.770
valeria brenner: Please give me feedback guys.

263
00:33:52.080 --> 00:34:00.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So, you know, I think you're. I think this is really interesting. So before you did this, did you have in your head that you needed 4,000 customers break. Even

264
00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: did you have any idea how many you needed to break even.

265
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:04.470
valeria brenner: Nope.

266
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:16.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, this is a number you all should have in your head that you should. It'll change over time, and you'll refine it. But you can now start updating these numbers. And this is

267
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:23.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: this is just like to get a feasible business like, if this number had come out to say 100,000 you would have been like, Oh, damn

268
00:34:24.066 --> 00:34:37.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right like! And then you would have had to rethink your business model for either need to make more money and need to reduce cost, etc. But I think this is a really great first step. So thank you for being the first one to share that was awesome.

269
00:34:37.803 --> 00:34:40.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Liliana, you wanna manage us. Who's next.

270
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.019
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, Mircha.

271
00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:43.880
Lilliana Robinson: you can go and.

272
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.780
Mircea Gogoncea: Alright. Thank you, everybody. I'm gonna.

273
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.685
Lilliana Robinson: Mirrocha, you're really quiet. Is there a way to make you.

274
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.360
Mircea Gogoncea: About that. Yeah.

275
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Probably picking up the wrong mic or something.

276
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.379
Lilliana Robinson: He has a very intense setup, so I'm sure.

277
00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:09.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well while he fixes it, Troy, I was just gonna say that. And this might be true with your experience, too. I know a lot of founders, Meredith in particular, who like to put that number up somewhere like physically.

278
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah.

279
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:10.582
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like it's like,

280
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Goal.

281
00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Progress towards it. Exactly. That's a very common thing.

282
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.090
Mircea Gogoncea: Is this better?

283
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Now.

284
00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.479
Mircea Gogoncea: No, it's add.

285
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Staticky, and now.

286
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.030
Mircea Gogoncea: Okay, it's different. I'm

287
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.897
Mircea Gogoncea: I'm so sorry I don't know what the issue is.

288
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:30.924
Lilliana Robinson: We can hear you from the other one. Just go back to how it was before. It's okay.

289
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You might need to project.

290
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.210
Mircea Gogoncea: Tai ray.

291
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Voice, which we know you're very good at.

292
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.920
Mircea Gogoncea: Hello! Everybody!

293
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:38.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, that's better.

294
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Mic.

295
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Yeah. Here you go for.

296
00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.020
Mircea Gogoncea: This is this is the same. Okay, it doesn't matter.

297
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.089
Lilliana Robinson: The lines. Yep.

298
00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:52.300
Mircea Gogoncea: Okay, we have a bit of a weird case, because we have 2 different revenue streams. We have subscription and transactional revenue. So a quick overview of the business.

299
00:35:52.597 --> 00:36:15.229
Mircea Gogoncea: We help musicians make more money. They pay us a subscription to use our services, and we also enable some extra transactions at their concerts that they couldn't have done otherwise. So we take 10% of every transaction, and we take $30 as a subscription. But because about a third of our users are annual. The average revenue per user from subscription is actually $21 when you blend the 2 together.

300
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.190
Mircea Gogoncea: Anyway.

301
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.280
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, can you just like zoom it.

302
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.239
Mircea Gogoncea: I can make it very much bigger. Yes.

303
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:20.819
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you.

304
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.889
Mircea Gogoncea: Okay, where do we start, Troy? Would you like me to walk you through this.

305
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah.

306
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:49.750
Mircea Gogoncea: Okay. So first of all, I came up with this cac out of my behind. We've never done paid ads. So I don't know what this would be. Right now it's 0. But let's assume that we do something like that. So I don't know. $40 transaction fees is not what we charge is what stripe and shopify, and all the other providers that we work with charge us in transactions that comes out

307
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:57.940
Mircea Gogoncea: to an average of this, when you consider how many there are generally on average per month, and what the value is of each one.

308
00:36:58.271 --> 00:37:19.166
Mircea Gogoncea: We take 10% so our total take you know, take rate from a Gmv of $612 per user would be something like 61 when you combine that with the average subscription price times the number of lifetime months, you get $420 from subscription $61 from a transactional. So

309
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.869
Mircea Gogoncea: this is wrong. Scenario 61 plus.

310
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:52.909
Mircea Gogoncea: Oh, yeah. Cause this is a monthly sorry. And I was, I was just. I just switched into yearly there. That doesn't actually matter. So it's 21 plus 61 equals 82 and then our variable expenses are these ones per user, c, 9 is over here. So this, this total cost per user. So total contribution margin is this much per user per month. So if we pay ourselves much more actually than we pay right now 75 k. Per year comes out to 12 and a half for each founder per month.

311
00:37:52.910 --> 00:38:17.909
Mircea Gogoncea: and let's say, $500 in all the subscriptions that we use, and the servers and all the other stuff that is, $13,000 per month. So we would need 545 customers to cover that. However, a lot of these numbers are kind of made up 12 transactions per month. Well, if we have a great artist that could be 120 transactions a month, boom could be a hundred dollars in total transactional value. But maybe in this case we need a hundred dollars. Maybe we need 200

312
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:26.689
Mircea Gogoncea: dollars to get this user. I don't know. We might need $2,000 to get this user, because it's a vip. So yeah, this is highly dependent on a lot of different inputs.

313
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, and I I. So I think this is great.

314
00:38:30.554 --> 00:38:57.995
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think that you will play with these. I'd encourage you to do some color coding. So you know, what's an input? What's a formula like I did the blue and the black. You can do whatever colors you want, and then what you want to do is focus on which of these variables really matter? Do a sensitivity analysis? So which of the variables when you change them? Oh, my God! They have a huge impact on my, on my numbers, and which of them don't really matter so much, and have a small impact on my numbers and

315
00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:02.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And I think that's how. And then you're gonna go run some real world tests

316
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to see

317
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:13.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like what's gonna actually so, you know, if I go back to my coffee one I could have put into the formula. I'm gonna charge $50 for a cup of coffee, and it would have looked really good on the spreadsheet.

318
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:20.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but I'm not going to be able to sell coffee for $50. So just because it says it on the spreadsheet doesn't mean you can do it in the real world.

319
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:35.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so this is your opportunity to start to ask questions and be like, what do I think you know, how do you find out what the average transactions per month are? How do you find out if your 10% take rate is a fair take rate. Can you get 20? Because if you can get 20,

320
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it's gonna more than cut in half. So let's just try this. My.

321
00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:49.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I am predicting that if you take your 10%, change it to 20, you're going to be down to not half of 5, 45, but something under 200?

322
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What about 1 52.

323
00:39:52.365 --> 00:39:52.899
Mircea Gogoncea: Amazing.

324
00:39:53.570 --> 00:40:01.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You would think it was twice because. But it's not because you have this cost of the transaction that didn't change. So this is why these numbers matter.

325
00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:05.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I think you did an awesome job. I would love to see you

326
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:10.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: refine this and go out to the real world and figure out what some of these real numbers are, especially the Cac.

327
00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.333
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And yeah,

328
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:25.156
Mircea Gogoncea: And and this is also hard, because depending on the type of artist that we work with. It could be some people we talk to some people that sell $10,000 worth of merch at one concert. That's incredible. But most people sell like 200, maybe less. So. Yeah.

329
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.730
Mircea Gogoncea: yep, it. But.

330
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:28.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But it's giving you an idea of what your levers are.

331
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:34.699
Lilliana Robinson: Sorry. There's a question in the chat about this, I think. I think. Do you have to factor in taxes somewhere?

332
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:47.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So for those of you who are worried about factoring taxes like income tax. Don't worry about it. You're not going to be profitable. You're not going to be paying income tax for a long time, and if you are, that is a champagne problem.

333
00:40:48.090 --> 00:41:12.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I hope you're all paying income tax because you're make. You have profitable businesses, very few. I can't think there's only one business that I know. The only business I can think of that's really paid any meaningful income tax that came out of techstars in any period of time is trading to like most of these businesses. You're raising money. You're raising money because you're raising money. You have spent more than you've actually

334
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:25.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: earned, because raising money doesn't count as revenue. So you're actually negative. You're in the hole, and then you carry those losses forward into future years. It'll be a long time before you're paying income tax. Don't worry about it.

335
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:33.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: If you did, you could just say 30% or something. But that's later, no income taxes. All right, let's take the next one who's next.

336
00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:48.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And I think if we do 3 of these we could do 3 or 4. It's up to you, Liliana, but I think you're getting the gist of it, and then and then I want to take a couple of minutes to to tell the rest of the story, so I would love to have 5 min at the end. Okay.

337
00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:53.999
Lilliana Robinson: We'll see if we can get to you, Snow. But let's do. Antonio Antonio high level 10 s, what does aware? Do.

338
00:41:54.340 --> 00:42:02.479
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, it's a wearable, a couple with an app that measures your stress and anxiety and gives you actionable recommendation to announce your mental wellbeing every day.

339
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.609
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So we make money out of subscription and hardware

340
00:42:07.455 --> 00:42:11.820
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: with customer acquisition $25 per customer

341
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:17.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Do you think you're gonna acquire customers for $25 on a 300 wearable.

342
00:42:19.973 --> 00:42:25.270
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: It's probably well, what I was saying is 2 2. Was that 2.5

343
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.720
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: $2.5 per click click first customer.

344
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.989
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: so that would be.

345
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And you're not gonna close 10%.

346
00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.260
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, okay.

347
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:41.257
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Like you should be. So what you should do is go look at some companies that have

348
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: shared this information, whether they're public companies, or they've had

349
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:51.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: data. But I'm trying to think like Fitbit was a public company. You could look up Fitbit and find out what did fit it.

350
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:59.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What was their customer acquisition cost? I'm guessing it was. Yeah, you're closer. It might even be higher than that. But anyway.

351
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:03.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you'll do that later. And the point of this exercise, by the way, is, if your math is correct.

352
00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:14.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: we can plug in new numbers there and then we get better answers like we should focus on getting the math correct. We know the assumptions are wrong, but alright great. So this is sort of like my aura ring.

353
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:20.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right? It's, I think ring is 499. The hardware was about 300 bucks.

354
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:21.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah.

355
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:28.710
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Exactly Cox available. I mean, I think, yeah. Didn't include the here. This.

356
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:36.144
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: we we it's it's it's possible $50 we we have to see for us, you know.

357
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:42.359
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: once, if we do go to production, I think this number might might vary. But then here's where. Okay.

358
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Can you? What's in B 12. What's the formula on B 12.

359
00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:47.444
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Look,

360
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:48.520
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Click on b.

361
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 12. Yeah.

362
00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:51.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Scott.

363
00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:52.210
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Depth

364
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.439
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: now, yep.

365
00:43:54.450 --> 00:44:00.680
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and then. So these would be the total contribution margin. So $200 per customer.

366
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.275
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and then I I put backhand to developers, front end and back end

367
00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.929
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: to ponders, hardware design, industrial design and packaging shipping.

368
00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:16.800
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And I. We came out with 2,200 customers.

369
00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: How does that feel to you?

370
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:28.830
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: It's actually feels good, because in the financial model there was, there's so many numbers in our financial. This gives me an idea. Oh, if you want to do a crossfinding campaign, this is what we need.

371
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.069
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So it it looks.

372
00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:36.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Now you. You have another issue, though. So when I look at this, I'm like 2,000 customers. Great.

373
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but I have to pay for the manufacturing of 2,000 of these wearables.

374
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:49.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right? So that's gonna be what $100,000 I gotta pay upfront probably 6 months before I get any revenue

375
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:56.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm gonna have to pay for some of this customer acquisition costs, but it gives you an idea of how big the the nut is. This is this is great.

376
00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:59.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: alright.

377
00:45:00.154 --> 00:45:03.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We have time, I think, to do snow.

378
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Great, thank you.

379
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.590
Lilliana Robinson: Are you familiar with Runbear, or have? Are you in starboard snow?

380
00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.210
Snow Lee / Runbear: I mean, start starboard.

381
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:16.109
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, yeah. Give it 10 s.

382
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:21.979
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah. So we help customers create custom Gpts and integrate

383
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:28.188
Snow Lee / Runbear: them into their communication platform, such as slack Hubspot Microsoft teams.

384
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:35.479
Snow Lee / Runbear: So this is, the the really quick, simple financial model. So about the experience.

385
00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:45.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Again. I wanna I'm gonna use the term financial viability as separate from the financial model. The model is when we start looking forward and doing all the stuff we did

386
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: with Dollar Cave Club. So this financial

387
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but viability, anyway.

388
00:45:51.107 --> 00:45:52.120
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah, thank you.

389
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:53.923
Snow Lee / Runbear: So who?

390
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.710
Snow Lee / Runbear: the expense? We haven't tried the so so we don't know the number of

391
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:02.580
Snow Lee / Runbear: but customer Acquisition coast.

392
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:16.410
Snow Lee / Runbear: but I put them $100 for here and we recently decided to provide some of the open AI coast so free tokens to the customers. So we added some of the that coast

393
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:23.460
Snow Lee / Runbear: per customer so annually we expect $200 per customer

394
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:34.979
Snow Lee / Runbear: and about the contribution margin. So our average subscription fee is $99. And then we have around 10% monthly turn rate. So.

395
00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.159
Snow Lee / Runbear: It's not the dollar, so it's a it's a.

396
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Percent. It

397
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: number Yup.

398
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:52.540
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah. And there's a revenue can be 909 $90 and the variable subtracting variable expense. We got the 790

399
00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:59.089
Snow Lee / Runbear: and server at this is not the actual number, so we just put the 10 k.

400
00:47:00.155 --> 00:47:02.880
Snow Lee / Runbear: And the the the salaries

401
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:08.819
Snow Lee / Runbear: so overall overhead is 270 k. So.

402
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:13.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: How are you gonna get customers for 100 bucks like cause that has to include

403
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:21.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: all of your car? I think you're gonna have to have salespeople to do this? I don't maybe not. Maybe you can do this with just ads and self service.

404
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:35.120
Snow Lee / Runbear: That's a good point. So until now, we run the content marketing to get the customers. But definitely, we need to hire salesperson. If we hire sales person? Do I need to put it the overhead or.

405
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:35.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well.

406
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:36.380
Snow Lee / Runbear: Is it you have to.

407
00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: To decide. So is that part of your is that part of your

408
00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:47.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: customer acquisition cost? Or is it part of your overhead. You can. You can decide.

409
00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:48.750
Lilliana Robinson: What would?

410
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:49.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Ways.

411
00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:58.539
Lilliana Robinson: Because I got a question privately what that was like? What is the difference between variable expenses? And overhead? I thought it was that one is like more fixed. Is that correct?

412
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:04.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, so so there is some gray areas so variable, or expenses are generally the expenses that go up

413
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.899
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: as your number of customers goes up

414
00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:13.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and overhead is generally the stuff that doesn't really change. So your rent, your CEO salary that.

415
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:26.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And it turns out that with salespeople and with customer service people. It's really a stair step function like you hire one customer service person. Maybe they can handle 200 customers, and then at some point you hire a second one for the next 200,

416
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:33.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so you can treat it either way. But you have to account for it somewhere, because you're going to spend some money on salespeople, and

417
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:39.475
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I would tend to think that what's gonna happen with your salespeople like I did

418
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:41.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like I did with

419
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:43.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: well.

420
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:54.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: at sure payroll. I knew that each salesperson could bring in 15 new customers a month, and so I knew what my customer acquisition cost was because it was the salary and commission and benefits of a salesperson divided by 15,

421
00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:00.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and it was way, more than a hundred dollars.

422
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:02.660
Snow Lee / Runbear: Definitely out, yeah.

423
00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:29.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You may, you're doing something different. So it might be. But now we know. Okay. So if I were doing, if I were in your shoes. I'd be like, all right. I want to dive deep on what it's gonna I want to run some tests right now and customer acquisition. I want to do some. I want to do some Wizard of Oz test I want to do. See if marketing can get me like key to this. I think that number is going to be like 400. 500. I mean B twob. Companies that I have in our portfolio that are acquiring customers.

424
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Nobody's acquiring them, for under a hundred bucks

425
00:49:33.794 --> 00:49:43.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and you gotta figure out that customer acquisition motion. But that's where I would be focusing. But I think this is great, so real quickly. Are there any questions about this process?

426
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:49.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Hopefully, you've seen you saw my 3 examples. You saw 4 of your peers examples. Does this. Make sense to you guys

427
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: if you need help.

428
00:49:52.390 --> 00:50:01.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: They're folks at at techstars that can help you. I am going to share my screen again, and I'm going to do something.

429
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:06.144
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm gonna take you through the rest of the the next step in the presentation.

430
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:07.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yep.

431
00:50:08.735 --> 00:50:12.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Does this replace the need for these founders to finish their financial models?

432
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, God! No.

433
00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:15.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay. Good.

434
00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:17.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: God, no, I'm gonna take.

435
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:18.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, say, it had to say it.

436
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yes, alright.

437
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I'm going to

438
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:28.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: maybe share my screen. If I can find here we go share my screen. I have too many windows on one screen. Now, alright.

439
00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:34.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I'm going to share my screen, and I'm going to go to back to the deck.

440
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:47.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So this was a very simple model. It was easy to understand. It was linear. It was predictable. If the cost change, I could change the number of cups I had to sell right? I could go. But my job now was to go test this against the real world.

441
00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:52.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So we're back to my coffee cart. Then what happens is.

442
00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:59.059
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the health inspector closes me down. They're like, Damn! You can't do that. You can't sell food outside without a license.

443
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I realize

444
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to make this business real.

445
00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:20.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I have to go find customers. I've got to find an indoor place where they're aggregated. It turns out they're a bunch of large apartment buildings. Everybody needs coffee. I I'm gonna install kiosks, self serve kiosks with my special coffee in the lobbies of these apartment buildings.

446
00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:34.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But now that's gonna require me to spend about $5,000 in building out physical infrastructure. I need a $3,500 machine. I have to keep some inventory. I need credit card processing for 3.5.

447
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:37.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And I need I'm gonna run a 12 month trial in each building.

448
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:41.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So let's take a look at what that looks like.

449
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:50.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So here is the model, the viability, feasibility model that we were just looking at. This is the same one. All these numbers should look exactly what you're used to.

450
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:53.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but we've added some things

451
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:59.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you'll notice that I've added in yellow these additional things that I need to put into my model.

452
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:09.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But I don't know where they go, because they don't really go with variable expenses. They don't really go with monthly overhead. They're kind of one time. It's

453
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it's weird.

454
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:17.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to reorganize these into a different shape.

455
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:27.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So these are the same numbers on the right. I've just made them look like an income statement, so we can see that my number of cups sold came right here from my number of cups to sell

456
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:34.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: my revenue per cup came right from my revenue per cup. I multiply those 2. I get a total revenue number. Now it's starting to look like an income. Statement.

457
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:42.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: My direct expenses came by totalling the number of cups times my cost per cup.

458
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:49.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I got a gross profit of $5,000. I had operating expenses of $5,000. So I got 0

459
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:56.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: net profit. Oh, well, that's because that's how we solve, for we solve. For how many cups do I need to break even to pay myself 5 grand

460
00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:57.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: perfect.

461
00:52:58.450 --> 00:52:59.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Now.

462
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:02.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: what do I do with these one-time expenses?

463
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:06.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I'm going to make a time-based model. So here's what I did.

464
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:15.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What I did was I took that income statement and I said, but before I start up I've got to buy the build out, and I've got to buy the coffee machine.

465
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:20.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And now, all of a sudden, you'll see that I've lost almost $10,000

466
00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:21.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in the first month.

467
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:31.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, that sort of sucks, and you know what else sucks is that I'm losing 1,316. I wait. I thought I was break even. Why am I losing $1,300 every month?

468
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Wasn't I break even? What happened?

469
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Does anybody see.

470
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:48.560
Mircea Gogoncea: There's an extra credit card processing thing.

471
00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:55.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, I gotta pay for credit card processing that 3 and a half. So that's $216. Where's the rest of it

472
00:53:56.570 --> 00:54:01.899
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: turns out I needed a telephone line because I need to telephone into the credit card machine.

473
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:06.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And I snuck this in that. You actually have to pay taxes on employees.

474
00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:10.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: If you add those 3 up, 2, 16, plus 100 plus 1,000 is

475
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:14.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 1,316. So I'm actually losing 1,300 bucks a month.

476
00:54:15.812 --> 00:54:24.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well! And this isn't really fair. I don't want to lose all this money in the first month, so there's this magic trick we do in accounting called depreciation.

477
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:36.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Where what we do is we decide we're not gonna actually, we're not gonna actually charge ourselves for this in one month. We're gonna charge ourselves for this over the useful life. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this

478
00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:47.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 5,000, 3,500, divide by 12 and charge myself. I'm using air quotes, charge myself 1, 12 of it each month, because it has a useful life at 12 months.

479
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:54.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And now what happens is, I got a loss of $2,000 every month, but at least it's even

480
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: okay.

481
00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:03.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Why am I losing money? I thought this was going to be a profitable business. Why isn't this a profitable business?

482
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:11.539
Sanjith Jacob Thomas: Is it because the customer acquisition cost got higher?

483
00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.550
Sanjith Jacob Thomas: And since you.

484
00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:18.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: There's no customer acquisition cost, because I'm just sitting in a lobby of an apartment building.

485
00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:25.609
valeria brenner: Is it cause? The like sales you have is still for that break, even without putting those new factors into consideration.

486
00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's true.

487
00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:35.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But what happened here is I have a kiosk that is a self-serve kiosk in an apartment building, and I'm paying

488
00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:40.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: a salary for a human being to maintain one kiosk.

489
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:42.829
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's not very efficient.

490
00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:49.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right it? I may as well not have the kiosk and have the human being serving the coffee right?

491
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So it turns out that I should have multiple locations.

492
00:55:53.710 --> 00:56:09.669
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I've taken the same spreadsheet. I've just highlighted in yellow the things that are gonna change. So if I go to 2 locations, I'm gonna have twice as many sales. I'll twice as many cost of good sold twice as many credit cards twice as many telephones, twice as much build out and twice as much equipment.

493
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:15.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But you'll notice I don't have to have twice as much salary or taxes, because one person can manage 2 locations.

494
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.249
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and when I go to 2 locations

495
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:19.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm profitable.

496
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:31.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because now, instead of being effectively charged, the full $6,000 in salary for one location. It's split over 2 each one's only charged 3,000, and I get to profitability.

497
00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:33.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: As a matter of fact.

498
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:38.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: one person can do a lot more than 2. Maybe one person can manage 4 locations.

499
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:45.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: My spreadsheet says one person could manage 4,000 locations, 40,000 locations, whatever number you want.

500
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but that's not going to happen in the real world.

501
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:53.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: One person can't. I mean I it'd be nice. I'd make $15,000 a profit every month.

502
00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But let's go to 4

503
00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: at 4 locations.

504
00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: One person managing 4 locations with these kiosks.

505
00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:07.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I make $10,000, basically a month. That's starting to feel like a good business.

506
00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: However, there's a problem.

507
00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What's the problem?

508
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm running out of time.

509
00:57:20.813 --> 00:57:21.420
Mircea Gogoncea: At all.

510
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:28.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, I'm not growing, because I'm in a lobby of an apartment building. I can't grow. I don't have any way to get customers. So.

511
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:29.600
Snow Lee / Runbear: Coast, goes up.

512
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:30.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Huh!

513
00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:34.829
Snow Lee / Runbear: As the initial cost goes up is, if you increase.

514
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:38.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, and it's not shown on here because we depreciated it.

515
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so we need to look at our cash flow.

516
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:50.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And in our cash flow. You'll see that we actually are out of business in the first month, because we had to pay for $34,000 worth of equipment in the first month.

517
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:54.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, crap! This is why we need to take an investment.

518
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:57.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So let's say, we raised 40 grand.

519
00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:09.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Now the 40 grand that we raised can cover our cost of startup, and then we can actually make money, and we turn the 40 grand of investment into 159 grand by the end of the year.

520
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:26.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't have time to go through the whole detail with you, but I want to show you there's also a balance sheet in here which shows you your liabilities. Here's the 159 grand we just saw at the end of the year. There's some interesting stuff in here where you can see we bought $34,000 worth of equipment.

521
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:28.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We have that equipment.

522
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:34.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but we depreciate or have accumulated depreciation that goes up every month.

523
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:43.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: such that by the end of the year we've depreciated the full 34 grand. So on our books, we've paid for the equipment, and it's worth 0 on our books right now.

524
00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:50.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So this is the next step. This is, I think, the level of detail you all should be at now.

525
00:58:50.400 --> 00:59:02.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I'm going to share these files with you. The step after this. By the way, as I'm teaching this now is basically Dollar Cave Club, except what I do is, I say, oh, the coffee is so good that people want to buy it on the Internet.

526
00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:05.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so I take this business.

527
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:23.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I start adding a subscription for coffee service. I have Facebook ads, Google, Ads, Cac Ltv. Churn all the things that you add in Dollar Cave Club. And I get this fancy model that looks just like the Dollar Cave Club model, except it's for Angel Street coffee.

528
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:30.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I don't have time to show you that because I have a call and I have somebody in my waiting room now, but I will send you

529
00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:38.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the Dac. Which is not too different than the deck you had last time. It's just different template. I'll send you the first model we used

530
00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:48.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: this model, which is the level I think you guys should be at today, and then I will send you the third model that we did not review. That's going to look complicated.

531
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:53.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But it's basically this business adding subscription like Dollar Cave Club on top of it.

532
00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:55.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright.

533
00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.999
Lilliana Robinson: I mean. Thank you so much. Troy.

534
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Thank you. Troy.

535
00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:05.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I would love feedback if this made sense. I felt a little rushed to me. But, this is the first time I'm doing this for a techstars cohort.

536
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Obviously, what I think I want to do next time is, do this stuff in the very beginning of of the session.

537
01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:21.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then, a couple of weeks later, pick it up and say, now, here's what it can look like in the future and send you the Dollar Cave Club, or the more sophisticated model. I gotta run. I apologize.

538
01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:22.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You! The best.

539
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:23.660
Lilliana Robinson: And thank you.

540
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right.

541
01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: See you all.

542
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:26.599
valeria brenner: I.

543
01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.259
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you very much.

544
01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.020
