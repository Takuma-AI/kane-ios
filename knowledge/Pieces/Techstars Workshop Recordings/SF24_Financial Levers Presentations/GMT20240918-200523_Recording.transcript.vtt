1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.030
Lilliana Robinson: For you guys.

2
00:00:02.393 --> 00:00:05.459
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): And do I share my screen? Yes, okay.

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.310
Lilliana Robinson: Whenever you're ready I'll start the time.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.749
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, can you guys see

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.130
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): my screen.

6
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.240
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, you can see it now.

7
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.909
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay? So I have a lever on each slide and they're all revenue

8
00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.209
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): related, as you'll see.

9
00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:29.599
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): So this is lever number one sorry, too far forward.

10
00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.129
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, so referral program spend. So

11
00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:49.369
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): in terms of significance, this is a proxy for word of mouth marketing. Which is, you know, really relevant in our industry. That's typically how people find new suppliers. And while we can't rely on word of mouth until we have

12
00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:14.989
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): a quorum of clients who can start referring us. We're hoping that having a referral program will accelerate our word of mouth. Once we have a bolus of clients and so the expected change in output is that it will lead to more warm leads, which is important, which will lead to demos, deals, and revenue. In terms of how to pull. These are all similar. Generate more revenue under funding to create a referral program. So something like

13
00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:29.559
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): giving $200 for every referral with whom you land a deal. And in terms of testing in the financial model. It will just reveal to what degree this lever affects revenue. This is going to be standard throughout my lovers.

14
00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.999
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): So any questions, or should I.

15
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm curious about this. So

16
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: referral program spend. So what what is the spend? Exactly.

17
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.974
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Like the $200 right like

18
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay.

19
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.440
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Infrastructure, right? Like getting the word out about our referral program. It's kind of like a marketing initiative.

20
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.389
Lilliana Robinson: But we talk.

21
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Do you have? Do you have any evidence of this already?

22
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:58.699
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): No evidence. I've never tried it before.

23
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:16.430
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, but I know word of mouth like word of mouth again. This is a huge assumption, but based on my 1st hand experience is how news travels? Right? When we're starting a clinical trial. We ask our colleagues like, who did you use for X. Who did you use for y like? That's typically how we source.

24
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:34.309
Lilliana Robinson: So I want to let you continue. But, Neil, this is something we talked about in the assumptions workshop. So one of Monica's main assumptions is this and, Monica, we did talk about that. You might be able to do it for free, like Dave and I were both saying, but I want you to continue the presentation. We can talk about that in a sec.

25
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.240
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay.

26
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:49.406
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): So lever 2 is industry conference, sponsorship spend. So again, this is a historically large driver for pharma enterprise. B, 2 B solutions like ours. It has the highest conversion rate. Second, to referrals again, a huge assumption.

27
00:02:49.770 --> 00:03:15.009
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): And now I'm like super aware of what is an assumption. If prospects don't know we exist. We they can't even begin to buy from us or refer to us via word of mouth we need to be visible in the market. Conferences are where the decision makers are hanging out normally. See them on Linkedin. They're actually physically at these conferences. Again, expected change in output is similar, except these would be colder leads. They wouldn't be warm because they weren't referred.

28
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:27.109
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): How to pull and testing and financial model is pretty similar. Pulling is just spending more here. Testing will. Let us see the

29
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.860
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): effect on revenue.

30
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.540
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Any questions.

31
00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:37.160
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, lever 3. Industry, publication. Spend

32
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:58.339
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): similar to conference spend in terms of visibility and conversion rate. However, this conversion may take longer, as this is less about immediate in person connections, and more about making multiple touch points with prospects via recurring thought leadership articles and webinars. So typically these publications, they do an email blast of their monthly

33
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:20.010
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): volume of their publication, and within that publication would be an article written by us like multiple articles. And so they would have multiple exposure to our brand and our thought leadership, and sometimes they throw in a webinar for us as well. Again, similar expected change in output leading to revenue.

34
00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:32.749
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): and the the rest are similar as well. How to pull is just spending more in this area. This is probably the most expensive. I just explored this opportunity, and it was like $50,000 for a year testing and financial model is simple.

35
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.909
Lilliana Robinson: Their time, Monica. So I'm gonna have to pause you there.

36
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:35.530
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay.

37
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.979
Lilliana Robinson: I'll let Neil speak first, st because it sounded like you wanted to speak on the 1st lever.

38
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, if we can jump to the 1st one.

39
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and this might carry over to the other 2 as well.

40
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But like.

41
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I guess

42
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the notion here is that

43
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like your $200? Can you tell me what the $200 like?

44
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: When is that

45
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: spent

46
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like? How does it.

47
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:19.840
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, yeah. So we'd put the program out there. So we'd say, Hey, clinical operations person, if you refer us to someone who's seeking a solution like ours, and we actually land a deal with them. At that point you get $200,

48
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.570
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): and if they're not in our database already. So that's how that.

49
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And and are these individuals like? Is that meaningful to them? Is that $200, like an actual.

50
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.399
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): That's just a guess. It's all assumption.

51
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.905
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay. Alright, so

52
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in. In this. In this sense, I'm almost curious to know if there are other

53
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:56.481
Neal Sáles-Griffin: potential levers of individual effort that could be applied here on top of that referral spend, because I noticed that for each of the 3 that you've come up with it's all related to spending money and which makes sense. These are financial levers. However.

54
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.818
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there might be some other

55
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: more granular

56
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: inputs that you could analyze and measure to determine which ones are most effective.

57
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So my initial reaction here is that there's a few other layers of detail

58
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for each of the 3 levers that could exist that could allow you to measure, even like smaller points

59
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of of input and influence. So there's more predictability with those behaviors.

60
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But yeah, I'll I'll let other people ask questions to weigh in, because I can obviously spend more time with you outside of this, to talk more about it.

61
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:51.773
Lilliana Robinson: No, that's exactly it. I think, Monica, thank you for going first, st because I think a lot of people are gonna have that same exact thing. So what Neil's saying about predictability is really like the goal that we're getting to. So like the smaller actions you can take that, you know, are gonna like, move the lever, because we're kind of early. And a lot of these are unvalidated assumptions which I like that you like gave that disclaimer.

62
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.130
Lilliana Robinson: I think this is good for now, but what Neil is saying is what you should work toward.

63
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:10.469
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, yeah, it makes total sense. And each one can be broken down, especially just really quickly. The sponsoring the conference. There's different types of conference. There's different levels of sponsorship like you can get deeper into that.

64
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:26.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right and the actions you're taking at the conference itself. Right? What are the interactions? Who are the people, and what institutions? And there's there's so many other aspects to it that become more meaningful to measure beyond just the sponsorship itself, that I would encourage you to like. Consider.

65
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.120
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay. Yeah.

66
00:07:29.177 --> 00:07:42.200
Lilliana Robinson: So that's our time. We might have more time in in the other feedbacks for other people to have the class gift. But we just we just gave all of our feedback time. So let's go to Flo and Monica. Thank you again for going first.st

67
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.830
Florence Ettlin: Are you?

68
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.339
Lilliana Robinson: Great little snapshots I I like. How high level yours was, Monica. Alright! Go on.

69
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.180
Florence Ettlin: Ice cream.

70
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.580
Lilliana Robinson: Yep, we can see it.

71
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:22.329
Florence Ettlin: Okay. So for us, as a disclaimer, I think, since we heard the 1st conversation this morning, maybe there's some that aren't correct, but that's why we're here. So the 1st lever that we identified is the units onboarded per sales rep per month. So how many units each person can actually on board. And this is actually one of the strongest levers. So if we figure out how to pull that

72
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:28.710
Florence Ettlin: properly, and what things to put into place. This can really increase our revenue exponentially when we played around it

73
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.980
Florence Ettlin: in our model.

74
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:46.649
Florence Ettlin: and it really forces us to detect bottlenecks in our onboarding process and tackle these. So we just for the high level analysis, we thought of some strategies we could do to kind of increase the number of units that we could on.

75
00:08:46.950 --> 00:09:07.300
Florence Ettlin: for instance, limit the property information that is required to start implementing Anna so that we can get started quicker with these clients and sending someone to gather all the info of properties. And this actually came out of multiple conversations with with our peers. And also an example that you guys had given, and then incentivize speedy onboarding through additional perks.

76
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:14.299
Florence Ettlin: So that's the 1st lever we identified. Should I go through, or do you want to comment on that already.

77
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Very quickly.

78
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so the unit onboarded is directly influenced by what actions.

79
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:39.999
Florence Ettlin: So these are some assumptions right now that we say these strategies, we could try them out to see if it affects the number of units we can onboard. So, for example, limit the info that we need from the clients, because right now there is a long wait until they provide us all the information to train the model

80
00:09:40.284 --> 00:09:49.899
Florence Ettlin: so instead of that, we could just get started with small pieces and add on as we go, which would then allow us to onboard way quicker to what we do right now, and start.

81
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:57.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right. So there's an efficiency with the onboarding as well. But, like, what like are you also trying to do top of funnel like, are you trying to bring in more to the top.

82
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.850
Florence Ettlin: You mean sales units? Yes, absolutely.

83
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, yes.

84
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:09.600
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, for sure. So like the number of hours we spend on. Oh, are you alluring to another? Lever here.

85
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: May. Maybe it's another level. You're gonna present. Okay? Also.

86
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.040
Florence Ettlin: No, no, it's not.

87
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Very good.

88
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.979
Florence Ettlin: Actually could be. Now I get it. What you.

89
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:15.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh!

90
00:10:15.842 --> 00:10:20.829
Florence Ettlin: Like the number of hours we spend on outreach and getting these people to come.

91
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, let's go get it.

92
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay?

93
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.309
Florence Ettlin: Got it? Got it? Got it? Yeah.

94
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.279
Lilliana Robinson: Have a minute left, so why don't you stop.

95
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So sorry I'll shut up, and Andy's got something to say to you.

96
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:30.970
Florence Ettlin: You know.

97
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.510
Lilliana Robinson: We'll do feedback in a few.

98
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:44.109
Florence Ettlin: So it's kind of connected to this, but more on the hiring part. So this is how many sales reps we would hire. So the number of sales reps really influences. How much time can be spent on outreach

99
00:10:44.374 --> 00:11:05.509
Florence Ettlin: and we in our model, we see that with each new sales rep, we're able to grow revenue by 40%, while only increasing cost by 20%. So it's definitely a lever that we should also consider. And this has actually also been based on when we could observe when we both were doing outreach versus when only one of us was doing outreach the impact. Obviously, the more time we spend on it, the more results you get.

100
00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:30.800
Florence Ettlin: So it informs us about when to hire, and how many additional sales reps to hire in order to reach the goals we set. And then the 3rd one I'm just going to go through. Is the subscription price I know earlier today you had mentioned that it's not really a lever. So we pick that from Troy's class as a lever. But I'm happy to change. Of course. This obviously has a significant impact on how many units we need to onboard in order to reach our our goals.

101
00:11:31.154 --> 00:11:39.425
Florence Ettlin: And and we are actually see it as a way to help us build different pricing packages for the future. So how could we

102
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.920
Florence Ettlin: offer

103
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:55.130
Florence Ettlin: higher amounts of price, lower amounts of price. What kind of feature packs would be relevant for these different clients? But this is the lever with the least amount of flexibility, because obviously there's a cap we can't just keep on increasing our pricing. So that's what we came up with.

104
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.789
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that's time. So that was perfect.

105
00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.800
Lilliana Robinson: Can you go back to the 1st one?

106
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.330
Lilliana Robinson: Yes.

107
00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:16.620
Lilliana Robinson: I think. Well, Neil was saying, top of funnel that'll be like probably a separate one. This seems like it's like efficiency, like each sales rep needs to be able to get more units on boarded per month. I think jobs to be done will help with this, because, like targeting the correct segment.

108
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:25.300
Lilliana Robinson: remember, from W. 3, they're supposed to, it's supposed to be a heck. Yes, like absolutely. So. Then you'll just be able to start getting people to sign quickly.

109
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:33.830
Lilliana Robinson: and I think them moving slowly with the onboarding is also probably a result. This is an assumption, but probably a result of it not being like a morphine problem.

110
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:39.570
Lilliana Robinson: right? Like, if I really really needed this. I I would be like giving you all the stuff that you need right now.

111
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.580
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

112
00:12:42.220 --> 00:13:02.139
Florence Ettlin: So for the financial lever. Then, just to get back to what Neil had mentioned. Would it be better to look at really the kind of what we also measure in our Kpis, like the number of hours I dedicate each week or each month. How many emails, how many emails I'm sending like. Would that be kind of the same things that we're measuring with our Kpis would be our financial levers. Is that what we're trying to unlock here.

113
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.

114
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.220
Florence Ettlin: Okay.

115
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.220
Florence Ettlin: Okay.

116
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:16.040
Lilliana Robinson: And this is much more an awareness than something you're going to measure week over week for all of you for financial levers. It's like you want to be aware of what lovers are, the ones pulling the strings for your business.

117
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I want. I like the what all of you want is to feel like when you look at your model.

118
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And you compare your individual like inputs or effort

119
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:31.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to the what you have in the model. You can go okay next week. If we increase our efforts in these ways.

120
00:13:31.580 --> 00:14:01.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm predicting that this is going to be the impact. You know, as far as our our numbers returns, our our Kpis like that's that's where we want to get to. And and some of these are like almost by products of those inputs. But I want to see more of the granular inputs that you can actually bet on, you know. Okay, I'm gonna send. I'm gonna double down. I'm gonna spend 20% more of my time sending out these emails this week. And by then I'll send out this number. And we think by sending this number instead of that previous one. It's gonna have this kind of measurable impact on.

121
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.820
Florence Ettlin: Okay, so would hiring. Then count as one of those, because

122
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:10.090
Florence Ettlin: obviously increasing your team and getting a new team member to help do and replicate and spend more of those times.

123
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:21.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Maybe maybe. But I would say with the team I'm more interested in, I think that's Lever 3. If you want to jump to that slide? Yeah. So oh, actually, number 2. Sorry you you got it? Number 2.

124
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:32.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So these sales, what are they doing? What what actions are they taking. And are we measuring the actions that they're taking to make progress first, st before we bring in just more people and assume that that means better results.

125
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.540
Florence Ettlin: Granular at.

126
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.

127
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.370
Florence Ettlin: Their inputs. Okay, got it? Yep. Understood.

128
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.450
Lilliana Robinson: Let's do, or and then Annie.

129
00:14:41.130 --> 00:15:09.777
Uğur Koç | dert: Yeah, really quickly. If you go to slide one may maybe like I might be getting the whole lever thing, you know, upside down. But looking at number of units on board that per sales representative per month. If I'm reading this correctly like, is this something that you can influence manually by just putting in more resources into? Or is this more of a performance metric that you you wish that it's gonna get better.

130
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:32.370
Florence Ettlin: Yeah. So our assumption is that by doing these strategies down here we would actually be able to influence that. But then, back to what Liliana has said, it could be that this simply is an indication that it's not the strong enough problem for them. So that's kind of where we would want to see. Okay, what can we do about it? Onboarding process actively do to make it shorter and easier for people to onboard?

131
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:38.500
Florence Ettlin: Or are we simply not targeting the right market with the right struggling moment. So, yeah.

132
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.300
Florence Ettlin: part, partly being able to actually influence that output.

133
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.520
Florence Ettlin: That's the idea.

134
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:44.630
Florence Ettlin: Yeah.

135
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:46.660
Lilliana Robinson: Annie.

136
00:15:48.360 --> 00:16:02.429
Annie Brown: Yeah, I was just really quick. Gonna add that if you know, part of the onboarding bottleneck is training the model speed I would love to talk to you, you guys, and and yoge about that, because I think I can help.

137
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.470
Florence Ettlin: Thank you.

138
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:06.970
Florence Ettlin: Okay.

139
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.670
Florence Ettlin: I think we're done.

140
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:17.709
Lilliana Robinson: Great job, collab. Thank you. And those were really succinct answers, I can tell you, really understand. So that's really good.

141
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.409
Lilliana Robinson: George Reid is next.

142
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.760
George Reed - Noetic: Well, thank you. Sure.

143
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.470
George Reed - Noetic: Okay.

144
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.369
George Reed - Noetic: How's that? Can everyone register to vote

145
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.949
George Reed - Noetic: alright? Can you all see the

146
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.480
George Reed - Noetic: slides now?

147
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.520
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, now, we can.

148
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.441
George Reed - Noetic: Cool, cool. Thank you. Okay. So the 1st one I've put here is

149
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:54.350
George Reed - Noetic: I mean, I think these are all financial like they're all they'll directly impact finances. So upselling from volume based to premium subscription. So the idea is to

150
00:16:55.571 --> 00:17:10.690
George Reed - Noetic: sort of have a wide funnel of volume based clients that are maybe easier to sell. They can even like sign up themselves eventually. Oh, this cat that's cute and then be able to upsell them into the premium subscription, and like the support package. So

151
00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:16.219
George Reed - Noetic: the idea there being that may maybe the lever here we could pull would be as well.

152
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:24.534
George Reed - Noetic: by increasing those like the idea, the the financial practice, Mrr. Of course, growth. But we also want to learn

153
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:37.710
George Reed - Noetic: through that like different client profiles and even use them as like foundations or inputs to the next rounds of jobs to be done interviews. So we could take that wide funnel, and we could like narrow down and learn more from that. So that would be like the learning

154
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.960
George Reed - Noetic: from that.

155
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So. So what are we pulling here like like.

156
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.350
George Reed - Noetic: Get to work.

157
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Talking about a little lever.

158
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:44.400
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah.

159
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What does the lever do?

160
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:51.589
George Reed - Noetic: I think the up well is upselling. Not a lever. Maybe I'm I need to. I it's obviously I haven't read the book yet, so.

161
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, it's okay. No. So so like, when you say upselling like, what action are you measurably taking.

162
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:57.290
George Reed - Noetic: On a week.

163
00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Basis that influences this.

164
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:08.649
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, true. So maybe it could be like number of volume based clients that we book a 1 to one call with to try and upsell

165
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:09.639
George Reed - Noetic: like if they.

166
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:17.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What? What are the friction, and steps to getting a client on that upsell trajectory, or call.

167
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.830
George Reed - Noetic: So obviously, all assumptions are that would probably be like

168
00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:30.140
George Reed - Noetic: doing jobs to be done, kind of thinking on them and trying to narrow them down into the the volume. Clients who are in need of like a higher tier, or would benefit from a higher tier.

169
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.010
George Reed - Noetic: so.

170
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:45.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, it sounds like there's more fidelity. It needs to exist between, like your pipeline, of whoever these potential clients are, what actions you're taking to schedule these conversations and calls, and then how those actually go for you to then ultimately either upsell or convert them.

171
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:49.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like whatever details happen between the pipeline list that you can reach out to. And

172
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we have them.

173
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: those like. There's steps within there that you need to start to measure and identify, that are going to be those levels.

174
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:09.550
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, cool, cool cheers. Thanks. Neil. Yeah. Again, super assumption based right? Now. Okay, so next one, of course, very basic fundamentals. Just outreach and referral volume, I guess.

175
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.660
George Reed - Noetic: might be wrong. So

176
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:19.129
George Reed - Noetic: number of completed sales, calls, and number of referrals made. So introducing referral program could be a lever here

177
00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:25.609
George Reed - Noetic: potentially, does it make sense? To increase the yeah. Cac and Ltv of customers.

178
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.560
George Reed - Noetic: And then again, like it could provide insight into

179
00:19:30.072 --> 00:19:31.279
George Reed - Noetic: more of the

180
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.679
George Reed - Noetic: acquisition channels and like marketing strategies

181
00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.229
George Reed - Noetic: that would work best

182
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.980
George Reed - Noetic: potentially like

183
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.279
George Reed - Noetic: I might need feedback on this one.

184
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You can go to the next one, too, if you have one.

185
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.380
Lilliana Robinson: Questions, yeah.

186
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.334
George Reed - Noetic: And then so here, like focusing on this, is more of a oops. Sorry this is more of a product based

187
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.859
George Reed - Noetic: lever, maybe, is trying to increase that number of hours saved per client, because that's sort of like a direct

188
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.773
George Reed - Noetic: indicator of efficiency and value.

189
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.740
George Reed - Noetic: for the clients.

190
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:08.629
George Reed - Noetic: So again. This could be another jobs to be done around, but monitoring, monitoring those and fine tune, the product based on that, too.

191
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:16.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I like that. I like that. You use the word monitoring, because, like I, I would reframe it and go. We don't want to monitor any of this. We want to pull them.

192
00:20:16.768 --> 00:20:23.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We want to pull levers. We don't want to monitor levers, right? We need to be able to take action to influence them. So

193
00:20:23.595 --> 00:20:28.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the big kind of feedback I have over all 3 that you presented. George is

194
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there, I think.

195
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:39.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: are levers within each of the categories that you're describing. But we haven't actually particularly identified them yet.

196
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.960
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, yeah, yeah.

197
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:50.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you should be able to look at each of these 3 categories, and not even without reading the book. Right? You should be able to look at each of these categories. Maybe talk amongst the class, talk more to me.

198
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and we should be able to pinpoint some act like actions. You can take.

199
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.130
George Reed - Noetic: And.

200
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That influence the increase in each of these categories.

201
00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.318
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, that clicked before when you were talking.

202
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right.

203
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.206
George Reed - Noetic: Saying that, yeah. So that's tonight's job. Yeah, just gentlemen, just

204
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:16.639
George Reed - Noetic: I'm I'm basically yeah, thinking about how to validate those assumptions. So of course we've got to go back and do that there and then, thinking about you've mentioned like, wanting to run lots of like

205
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.789
George Reed - Noetic: sort of small experiments

206
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:26.759
George Reed - Noetic: outside of jobs to be done, and sort of thinking about what those could be as well to test these levers and sort of validate those assumptions.

207
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.710
George Reed - Noetic: I'm not sure what what those could be yet, but that's something to think about as well. So and that's it. Now, that's that's the whole.

208
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.240
Lilliana Robinson: Glad to open it to your class. I see Collab has a comment.

209
00:21:39.250 --> 00:22:03.379
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, it's more of a question. Actually, I feel like, maybe there was a bit of a confusion with all of us. In terms of, are we actually looking at? Kind of the secondary like Kpis that we're measuring like, Oh, I want to do. You know, if I put X amount of hours into outreach and X amount of hours into a weekly test. Or is that what we're trying to get to with these financial covers? So it's kind of in line with the Kpis.

210
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right. So I hear you mentioned hours a lot with respect to this effort.

211
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:07.930
Florence Ettlin: Yeah.

212
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:20.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think it's the actions within those hours, not just the hours themselves. It's not a unit of time. It's a unit of like like, what are those actions that you're actually doing within that timeframe? Yeah, exactly. So you want to quantify it more. Yeah.

213
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.100
Florence Ettlin: Okay? So that's kind of like in line with the Kpis. Then what would that.

214
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:25.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yep.

215
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.679
Florence Ettlin: Okay, got it. Now, it makes sense. Okay. Thank you.

216
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.060
Lilliana Robinson: Any other comments for George.

217
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:38.590
George Reed - Noetic: Be confused.

218
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.820
Lilliana Robinson: You're fine, George. That's the whole point of this.

219
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.580
Lilliana Robinson: So.

220
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.620
Dave Scott: George, George, I'm happy to talk to you after this, and we can brainstorm around it.

221
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.689
George Reed - Noetic: Cheers Dave. Alright. Sounds good.

222
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.169
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you, Dave. That's very sweet.

223
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:55.840
Fabio Caironi: Here.

224
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.730
Lilliana Robinson: And Fabio. There we go.

225
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.623
George Reed - Noetic: Oh, there you go! Thanks for being.

226
00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.790
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect

227
00:23:02.246 --> 00:23:07.490
Lilliana Robinson: and you can take another stab. You can post in base camp and we'll we'll check it out online.

228
00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.960
Lilliana Robinson: Async, cool.

229
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.130
Lilliana Robinson: perfect.

230
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.420
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

231
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.590
Lilliana Robinson: next is.

232
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.610
Lilliana Robinson: let's here

233
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.569
Lilliana Robinson: near it.

234
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.870
Lilliana Robinson: and then cogniscope is on down.

235
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.200
George Reed - Noetic: Current location.

236
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:40.300
Nirat Attri: Alright

237
00:23:41.116 --> 00:23:50.399
Nirat Attri: like just to chime in there like I feel like I'm also pretty confused now, after listening to all the comments. So

238
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.590
Nirat Attri: I think

239
00:23:52.820 --> 00:24:05.959
Nirat Attri: what we, what I've tried to do is like, build it around the financial model. Primarily. So, one of the 1st ones that we identified was around hiring that. The way we want to do it is for spend optimization

240
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:11.010
Nirat Attri: that the ability to build a remote team from day one allows us to

241
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.470
Nirat Attri: higher

242
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:22.580
Nirat Attri: like talent equivalents that would be beneficial for pushing out more features, and then, of course, being able to monetize those features faster.

243
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:32.210
Nirat Attri: and then the next one is around visibility. I think this is the one that we are needing to validate a little bit because

244
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:49.069
Nirat Attri: in healthcare. What we've figured out is direct sales is the norm, and, like Monica was mentioning, everything happens to be very word of mouth. So we do want to see what kind of marketing spend leads us to more

245
00:24:49.567 --> 00:25:01.180
Nirat Attri: core leads to like core lead conversion. That's what we want to experiment with, and then kind of come up with what the formula around it is. So again.

246
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:14.160
Nirat Attri: just referring back to some jobs to be done. Interviews we felt like, I mean, we have like a sample size of 2 or 3 right now. But the idea is that a lot of this hires that came in were people that were always, somehow around

247
00:25:14.542 --> 00:25:20.370
Nirat Attri: the customer already. So we feel like this is something that we should be focusing more on.

248
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:49.480
Nirat Attri: And one thing which we do talk about is a circular customer. Acquisition strategy there, that the customers of our customers have potential to be our customers, because whenever you talk about connectivity solutions you are already connecting to something. So whoever you're connecting to has the potential to be our customers as well, so we haven't pulled on this level yet, but we do feel that that would be something that we can actually use to bring down customer acquisition cost and traditional channels already.

249
00:25:49.932 --> 00:26:14.280
Nirat Attri: The last one that we want to look at is time to pilot conversion like. So whenever we do sign up pilots, and that's generally the way initial sales go in health. Tech we want to lower down the time that it takes for us to convert a potential client from being on a pilot to a Saas model recurring revenue kind of customer.

250
00:26:14.675 --> 00:26:25.370
Nirat Attri: And then we feel like this would also help us build on the differentiation of our product. Because, typically we feel that this is somewhere where a lot of

251
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:48.058
Nirat Attri: people doing similar things as us lose their clients because it tends to be a very slow thing. So if you're able to build differentiation around it it's also going to help us in the marketing that we want to push as part of the visibility channels, and then hopefully, as time to part, conversion goes down. We'll have increased customers Ltv and decreased. Cse,

252
00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.259
Nirat Attri: so yeah, broadly speaking, that's what.

253
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.220
Nirat Attri: Thank you.

254
00:26:53.780 --> 00:27:03.299
Lilliana Robinson: I like that. You put need to validate next to increasing marketing, spend right? Cause we don't. That's an assumption. We don't know if that's gonna increase lead conversion. But it could.

255
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.069
Lilliana Robinson: I do like

256
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.359
Lilliana Robinson: trying to increase virality and word of mouth and stuff like that.

257
00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:25.600
Lilliana Robinson: Lead conversion could also be like I was telling Collab a segment issue. So if, like, your leads aren't converting, maybe you're not targeting the correct pool and that's what the majority of people who come into our program have the issue of. So that is probably the issue. But

258
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:40.239
Lilliana Robinson: increasing marketing spend could also make a fly well for you guys. So that's something we can validate by like doing, you know, putting small investments in instead of just buying 10 grand worth of ads. So I like that. You put that there. I don't know if, Neil, you want to comment

259
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.710
Lilliana Robinson: on anything.

260
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm open to what others want to say first.st

261
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.819
Lilliana Robinson: Cool. Let's open it to the room.

262
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.430
Çoruh | CogniScope: if I have a question about the 3rd one, because I

263
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.030
Çoruh | CogniScope: as like as I think of a lever, I think it should

264
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.749
Çoruh | CogniScope: kind of have some kind of like trade off. Like to

265
00:28:08.344 --> 00:28:11.739
Çoruh | CogniScope: pull the lever upside or down should benefit

266
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:18.940
Çoruh | CogniScope: for different coast, maybe because, like, that's what I was thinking, when we are like thinking about the levers, because.

267
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.060
Çoruh | CogniScope: like for the 3rd one, like when you do faster.

268
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:31.549
Çoruh | CogniScope: I don't. It will get first, st and it will only benefit. But if you have much more time to like pilot conversion.

269
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.179
Çoruh | CogniScope: what will you get

270
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:40.139
Çoruh | CogniScope: when you do that like? I don't know if I'm right or wrong on like thinking about this structure. But

271
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.330
Çoruh | CogniScope: yeah, that's my opinion.

272
00:28:42.980 --> 00:29:08.560
Nirat Attri: I'll take it up. So typically when you do something that's more bespoke. If you don't have the tools to be able to support that it takes a lot of time before you actually get into the pilot stage. And then the second part of it is, pilots generally have certain benchmarks that you have to hit before they would convert into actually paid customers. So typically if you're not hitting the benchmark of the pilot, the customer would basically say that you have failed.

273
00:29:08.839 --> 00:29:21.690
Nirat Attri: So the moment you're able to deliver that value faster, you'll be able to convert that customer faster. So that would be the thing that we are targeting. If you're if you're like a lot of times you would onboard b 2 b customers. But the

274
00:29:22.014 --> 00:29:30.419
Nirat Attri: value delivery tends to be a little bit more iterative, so the sooner you're able to build the features that allow them to reach their goals. That would be the intent behind it.

275
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.020
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, but like it's.

276
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:43.490
Çoruh | CogniScope: it seems like a more like gold than a lever to me, you know, because you should do that because you should get to that point, so it will be much faster. You'll attain that faster. But

277
00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:50.260
Çoruh | CogniScope: I don't know like it's more like a love, more like a goal than a lever to me.

278
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.150
Nirat Attri: I see what I mean.

279
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.840
Lilliana Robinson: Any other comments for health blocks.

280
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:09.220
Annie Brown: Just one question, should these financial levers be short term, like what our company is now and then, basically, you change

281
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.499
Annie Brown: your financial levers as.

282
00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.

283
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.409
Annie Brown: When it grows. Okay?

284
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:23.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, yeah. And by the way, Annie, what you posted in the chat, I just want to say, like, I I think that's super helpful and important for people to review, and what I want to clarify about it is.

285
00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:34.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I would say that as much as they're being framed, those categories, boosting sales volume, operational efficiency, expanding market. They're framed as levers, because in the model they could exist as such.

286
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:40.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I almost want you all. I'm gonna edit what Troy's saying in real time here, I guess, for the sake of this room. But

287
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:56.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: T, like those are rooms. Those are control rooms that have multiple like panels in them with levers on them, I guess, is how I'm trying to describe the metaphor. So like you step into the room of improving operational efficiency. And then you're like, oh.

288
00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:06.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what lever should I pull? Because here are all the different things I can do to improve operational efficiency? It's not a lever in and of itself. There's things within that category that you then pull to influence it

289
00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so hopefully that resonates with the room as far as what I'm getting at.

290
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:11.940
Annie Brown: That helps a lot.

291
00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:12.710
Annie Brown: Yeah.

292
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:21.799
Lilliana Robinson: I like what? Or put words lovers and his understanding are repeatable things you can do to create change in your business. That's the simplest way to say it.

293
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:28.319
Lilliana Robinson: neurit. What would be helpful here? What do you have? The most questions about.

294
00:31:30.572 --> 00:31:32.419
Nirat Attri: I feel like everything

295
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:51.919
Nirat Attri: finally boils down to monetization and like increasing like influencing the financial model. I feel like I just want to understand a little bit more on what would be levers on the product side that would actually impact us around. I mean differentiation. And like visibility in that regard.

296
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.030
Nirat Attri: So

297
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.749
Nirat Attri: yeah, that would be something that I would need to figure out.

298
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.649
Lilliana Robinson: That might naturally happen from product market fit.

299
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:06.040
Lilliana Robinson: right? Like the the visibility piece from the product side.

300
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.339
Lilliana Robinson: Cool. Okay. I'm excited to see you work on this. This is great, very clear, and I think you understand pretty well.

301
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:15.737
Lilliana Robinson: Let's jump. Thank you.

302
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.160
Lilliana Robinson: let's jump to cogniscope.

303
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.230
Lilliana Robinson: Oh.

304
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.069
Çoruh | CogniScope: No, I'm okay. I think

305
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.315
Çoruh | CogniScope: so.

306
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:48.839
Çoruh | CogniScope: here is our like financial levers. But we thought directly on the Troy's model, like the assumptions, and how we can make this

307
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:55.120
Çoruh | CogniScope: like, how many people should we attain to get on the profitability side. So

308
00:32:55.853 --> 00:33:00.820
Çoruh | CogniScope: we decided on getting like the subscription price and price for feedback

309
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:06.439
Çoruh | CogniScope: optimization to like balancing customer acquisition and maximizing revenue.

310
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:19.779
Çoruh | CogniScope: and also, like Gpu, C, we have a Gpu and CPU inferences which optimizes the performance basically and has a trade off between cost and performance plus.

311
00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:35.540
Çoruh | CogniScope: And we have a networking budget like which this is the main marketing channel we talked about thought about, because at this stage we should build the personal relationships and more events, we go as actually more

312
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.220
Çoruh | CogniScope: a possible lead to us. So

313
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.896
Çoruh | CogniScope: why this this matters?

314
00:33:41.970 --> 00:34:03.770
Çoruh | CogniScope: it's actually like, I said. The outcome is pro adjusting the pricing to refine revenue model appeal to more customer segments, and also finding that balance point the lower, the prices is equal to more small, to medium studios. Extraction, which, built to make us need more customers to reach profitability, but the higher prices

315
00:34:04.825 --> 00:34:08.870
Çoruh | CogniScope: we'll need to aim for larger studios, which takes a long

316
00:34:09.493 --> 00:34:16.760
Çoruh | CogniScope: Lent long time to lend customers. And also we need to close annual deal deals then like more

317
00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:21.899
Çoruh | CogniScope: one time or monthly deals. So we need to focus on that regard

318
00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:32.349
Çoruh | CogniScope: on the performance. Things. Is the like optimizing computing resources to make it more profitable and scalable

319
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:41.380
Çoruh | CogniScope: for our products. So expensive. Gpu is faster processing, but less profitable, but higher lifetime. Video for time. Sensitive customers which

320
00:34:42.266 --> 00:34:47.389
Çoruh | CogniScope: we don't know yet, surely because we haven't completed our jobs to be done.

321
00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:51.809
Çoruh | CogniScope: and cheap Cp like CPU. Option is slow processing, but

322
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.710
Çoruh | CogniScope: more profitable.

323
00:34:53.790 --> 00:35:14.879
Çoruh | CogniScope: but suitable only for the customers are not time sensitive, and the networking is, as I said, like we should focus on like we can focus on the high return on investment events and get prepared for that to reduce the amount of money we spend on going to those events. The more networking budget is equal to more leads and presence

324
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:19.822
Çoruh | CogniScope: which will attract more possible customers. But when we

325
00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:31.580
Çoruh | CogniScope: decrease the amount of budget it. We have to be more roi con high roi concerned. And we need to put more efforts on those events.

326
00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.679
Çoruh | CogniScope: So these are like a nutshell.

327
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.840
Çoruh | CogniScope: or lovers

328
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.750
Çoruh | CogniScope: out

329
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:43.450
Çoruh | CogniScope: any comments.

330
00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.439
Morgan Stanton: Can you go back to the 1st slide.

331
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:47.650
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yep.

332
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.790
Morgan Stanton: I don't understand. Lover 2 like

333
00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:01.339
Morgan Stanton: maybe that's just that's not my field as well like.

334
00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:13.340
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, I I think we could make we could add more context on it. So we are AI models. Works can work on CPU or Gpus Gpus require much more like

335
00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:21.189
Çoruh | CogniScope: they cost lots, and they do the analysis much faster in real time. But when we use CPU we

336
00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:26.560
Çoruh | CogniScope: decrease the performance, so it won't be that real time. It would have a much

337
00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.719
Çoruh | CogniScope: larger buffer time.

338
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.159
Çoruh | CogniScope: so it will affect the performance of the users.

339
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.729
Çoruh | CogniScope: So if the user is

340
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.600
Çoruh | CogniScope: like a really time sensitive user

341
00:36:39.351 --> 00:36:46.739
Çoruh | CogniScope: they wouldn't be the CPU wouldn't be beneficial as Gpu inferences. So that's actually the

342
00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.449
Çoruh | CogniScope: choices we have to make.

343
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:52.649
Morgan Stanton: Is it something you can rapidly switch between like, we'll we'll do it. Okay.

344
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.129
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, just just like, just on a switch.

345
00:36:55.130 --> 00:37:10.830
Uğur Koç | dert: Well, the thing is, we can change the availability of these instances more than you know. If we are giving the user more CPU inferences versus more Gpu inferences. The number of these basically correlate directly to

346
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:39.879
Uğur Koç | dert: the time it takes for our analysis to conclude which in turn is basically time for our customers. So if we were to up these, you know, Cpus or gpus, or decrease them, or, you know, allow for them both like it basically shortens the time that it takes for a customer to do the analysis. So like these levers are quite interesting, because the information that we found in the book. And then the information we added on top

347
00:37:40.308 --> 00:37:49.730
Uğur Koç | dert: after listening to listening to Troy's exercise, it's a bit conflicting like writing. These was a bit conflicting, because, you know.

348
00:37:49.730 --> 00:38:16.030
Uğur Koç | dert: Price, yes, is something that we have direct control over, and when we change it, you know, it might increase ourselves, because, you know, supply demand, and you know price equilibrium moves with it. I guess, Econ. 1 0 1, but like it at the same time. This is not something you can change week by week, basis to, you know, continuously drive, change like you can't play with your price week or week. So that's a question that we have over there.

349
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.420
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah.

350
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:25.330
Uğur Koç | dert: Same thing goes with the CPU versus Gpu thing, which is like, yes, we can change it to make the product more pleasant to use.

351
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:35.759
Uğur Koç | dert: But the it's not something that we can change continuously to, you know. It's not something we can continuously do to invoke change. It's just like a parameter of

352
00:38:36.248 --> 00:38:45.060
Uğur Koç | dert: parameter that we can play with, so that you know our product becomes more pleasant. But I guess we're looking forward to comments on these things.

353
00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:45.550
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

354
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.120
Uğur Koç | dert: How we perceive levers.

355
00:38:48.120 --> 00:39:03.269
Lilliana Robinson: Nick is saying, this is an interesting question. He's saying, Why, why don't you just have tiers where the customer decides if they care about paying more, or if they care about not being super fast, so they can just pay less, and then they get CPU pay more.

356
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.090
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, that's.

357
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:07.020
Uğur Koç | dert: Roughly what we have. Yeah, that's roughly what we have.

358
00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:13.289
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah. But like, it's, I think it, we will get the answer of this on jobs to be done. Interviews, because

359
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:34.949
Çoruh | CogniScope: this actually lies within in our value proposition to our customers. So to be able to do these kind of things in real time or not. If it's matters or not wish. That's like kind of the assumption phase. That's why why we're like not sure about how to balance between them. Because.

360
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.530
Çoruh | CogniScope: like, if you go on

361
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:42.910
Çoruh | CogniScope: like, if you go on a web page and see you can do a real time analysis. It's

362
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.770
Çoruh | CogniScope: a different customer segment.

363
00:39:45.790 --> 00:40:00.770
Çoruh | CogniScope: and like, if you can get like a report kind of thing. This is a whole other way of thinking about how you can benefit the outcome. And I think it has a different user base. Essentially. So

364
00:40:01.434 --> 00:40:05.440
Çoruh | CogniScope: that's why we are a bit more conflicting on those sites.

365
00:40:05.881 --> 00:40:14.309
Lilliana Robinson: I do agree with what George put in the chat where it's like we need to talk about what the action is. But I'm gonna let Annie and Fabio speak so, Annie, and then we'll go to Fabio.

366
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:42.399
Annie Brown: Yeah, it just. We can talk more about this offline. But just for the group, too. Networking and conferences are notoriously, really hard to track Roi on. So you just want to be. You'll see. I have it on my side, too. But you just want to be really careful about saying, Oh, I'm pulling this lever. It's not working. And and also budget investment in an event doesn't necessarily mean quality, because if you get a free speaking position at that event

367
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:52.939
Annie Brown: that might actually be better than buying a table at the event. So I think that one's just one you want to keep your eye on that. It's a little bit less black and white than maybe some of the others.

368
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:08.480
Dave Scott: Yeah, I I agree with Annie. And then, like the what I typically tell people is the strat. The best strategy for events and seminars is how many meetings you can set up before you actually get to this to the show?

369
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:19.619
Dave Scott: because I I wouldn't spend a dime on having a table there, but I would make sure that I had a certain sponsorship where they gave me the list of all the attendees ahead of time.

370
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:24.339
Dave Scott: and then I would. I would just set up as many meetings as I could. When when they were all there.

371
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:31.620
Lilliana Robinson: Good advice. The same advice that Dave gave Monica a couple of weeks ago. Fabio.

372
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:52.209
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, and we, we have a similar lever as a 3rd one. But my question was like, I'm curious about what is the cost for levers number one and 2 and to be more specific, how many users do you think you will lose by raising the subscription price? And for the second lever. What is actually that you have to do to

373
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.950
Fabio Caironi: optimize CPU versus gpu like?

374
00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.049
Fabio Caironi: Does it require more time for you to work on.

375
00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:14.260
Uğur Koç | dert: I mean I I can answer that. But I think I should answer that in a you know, private conversation with you. It's not that, you know, it's confidential information, but it's very specific and technical. I think you know. It's more or less about the financial levers and more about you know how to, you know, serve a cloud

376
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.409
Uğur Koç | dert: product. So I guess, like.

377
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:34.950
Fabio Caironi: Like, I'm just. I'm just trying to see like, what is the cost that you have to factor in like, if it's like, you know a month of work from an engineer, or maybe a day, because that would like change a lot like, can you? How how easily can you pull the lever. That's like, basically my question.

378
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:44.880
Uğur Koç | dert: Yeah, I mean, it's very shortly we're at time, but like very shortly, if we add another gpu to the cluster, it's roughly $2,000 a month extra.

379
00:42:44.950 --> 00:43:00.620
Uğur Koç | dert: and you know it allows for parallel processing, and I can increase the gpus indefinitely. But then it's costing us more money. The same thing goes with the available CPU instances. More CPU instances, we make available more, the cost less than 2,000. But yeah, still.

380
00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.040
Fabio Caironi: Gotcha. I I would just like to challenge you there to like find some

381
00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:14.070
Fabio Caironi: like numeric correlation, like, I know we're still at early stages with these assumptions. But that will help a lot, I guess. Just finding out.

382
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.789
Fabio Caironi: If I increase $2,000 in Gpus, will I actually get them back? So just.

383
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.860
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah.

384
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:46.830
Lilliana Robinson: That's a good question to post, I think in general, we need to like identify some action items here. Kind of like we were talking about in the chat like things you can do to move the needle. So these are the things that kind of you're hinging your business on. Make sense. These are great ways to identify it. What what do you guys want to do? What are the action items? So that's what I will leave you with, and maybe you can upload some on Base camp and we can give you some comments.

385
00:43:47.244 --> 00:43:53.875
Çoruh | CogniScope: And like these are all like long term, bigger picture levers, because like when we

386
00:43:54.660 --> 00:44:14.349
Çoruh | CogniScope: when we are at the toys workshop. He was always like. He started with like the costs the revenues. How many customers should we attain to get profitable? And so on so forth. So we because we do financial levers. We only thought about that frame.

387
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:19.660
Çoruh | CogniScope: So that's why I think it's became much more like a big picture thing than like

388
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.670
Çoruh | CogniScope: striking on a weekly basis. Thing.

389
00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.619
Lilliana Robinson: Cool. Thank you. Card mescope.

390
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.340
Lilliana Robinson: I think.

391
00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:33.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The underlying implication overall is still predictability. Everyone, remember, like these are all useless. Unless we can actually track

392
00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:38.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: actions, we can take that can influence our forecast of what it's going to look like.

393
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:47.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay? So it's not enough to have the right things to identify as what the levers might be. We have to go. Okay, what actions, what? What's the input what's the effort?

394
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:52.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then I know I can like, look in the mirror and like, see the truth of my efforts.

395
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:55.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's what I why, I keep drilling into here.

396
00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:14.559
Lilliana Robinson: We've taught you guys like 6 different ways to look at your business in the past few weeks. So I get that your heads are kind of spinning, but they are all super important, and they're all ways that I think most people wouldn't go about their business but they really are the keys to success. That's why so many people have found success following lovers.

397
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:15.979
Lilliana Robinson: Next is Morgan.

398
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:22.079
Lilliana Robinson: and then reliables on deck.

399
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:54.910
Morgan Stanton: I only have the one slide. So these are my 3 levers. The 1st is customer. Follow up with in person meetings, so the. You know, I haven't been around that long, but the success I've had is actually been with people I've actually talked to multiple times in person. I know I can't do that for every customer in the future. But right now a lot of my network is regional. So getting lunch, coffee chats, whatever has

400
00:45:54.910 --> 00:46:09.139
Morgan Stanton: been a big advantage to me. It builds relationship with me, helps them feel more confident and opal. It also ensures. I know what they want, I think, is also in this jobs to be done. It's really helpful for me to know exactly what they're looking for, and then, just

401
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:25.790
Morgan Stanton: as long as I keep doing is, it increases the chance of a potential customer becoming an actual customer and using our services. Number 2 is reducing time of contracts. So right now like I only had the my 1st client, and I was proposing like a 3 to 4 month contract, and that was because I wasn't sure

402
00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:47.630
Morgan Stanton: how long certain things would take. And now I have a better idea and trying to minimize that time. So we're not spouting any of the the costs over multiple months, we can compact it down. And the cost per contract is only over like 2 months instead of 3 months. It's more revenue. Per month. It also reduces our, you know, overhead costs and helps us utilize our resources efficiently.

403
00:46:48.242 --> 00:47:12.930
Morgan Stanton: And then, finally, this is kind of an odd one. I call it consumable sharing or running experiments. Concurrently I envisioned when I 1st started the company that we'd be doing things very separately, I would run our internal pipeline, and then we'd have our customer, pipeline, and I'd be ordering separate things for each one. I think that works well for a much larger company. But for me, specifically, it actually saves money to run things at the same time. Each set of experiments is not so big. So we're basically using

404
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:18.670
Morgan Stanton: less consumables, less cells, less time. Essentially, we can do kind of 2 birds with one stone.

405
00:47:19.123 --> 00:47:28.649
Morgan Stanton: Again, utilizing our resources efficiently. And gets us our own internal milestones as well as reaching our customers.

406
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:31.900
Morgan Stanton: That's it.

407
00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:42.310
Lilliana Robinson: This is pretty comprehensive, mark. I appreciate how you laid out. Let's go to Monica.

408
00:47:43.630 --> 00:48:00.189
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I have 2 questions. So maybe for number 2. Do you mean reducing time to contract execution or the duration that's outlined in the contract and number 3 by consumables. Do you mean like, we like lab reagents and stuff? Or, yes, yeah.

409
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:22.289
Morgan Stanton: So for for 2. So yeah, to be specific reducing time of contract is the actual duration of the contract. So before I was quite nervous and put like a huge amount of buffer room. And I know you can't decide everything for biology, but really trying to keep that as low as possible. And then for consumable sharing. Yes, I mean, like lab essentials that we're buying to like, keep the lab operating and do cell culture.

410
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:32.120
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): How does reducing the duration of the contract reduce the overhead costs? I'm just trying to understand.

411
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:42.369
Morgan Stanton: It's more that we get more revenue per month, right? So if it's like $10,000 over 3 months, or $10,000 over 2 month. Then we we were saying, like the

412
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.630
Morgan Stanton: We're not spending resources into that 3rd month.

413
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:50.629
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay? And then the prospect or the clients are okay with that paying more.

414
00:48:50.950 --> 00:49:04.049
Morgan Stanton: I mean, this is again in a sum. This is just based off the 1st contract we ran. And I just thought, like, we're we took a long time. That's fine. We're that's our 1st run. So my goal is like the next time to reduce it down as much as we can to be reasonable. I

415
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.080
Morgan Stanton: neera did you have something.

416
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:25.459
Nirat Attri: Yep, I think it's like it's it's more towards Leon and Neil, actually so like the reducing time of contracts that becomes something that you optimize towards, and eventually it would saturate, like same as the like comment that Choru had in terms of our goal.

417
00:49:26.034 --> 00:49:31.799
Nirat Attri: So does that also mean that eventually all levers run out

418
00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.549
Nirat Attri: like is that? Is that also like an assumption? That would be

419
00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:38.020
Nirat Attri: that we have to follow through.

420
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They run out. What do you mean by run out.

421
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:53.400
Nirat Attri: I mean, there is only a certain extent to which you could pull this level. For example, if reducing time of contracts is is there like you would always hit one optimization level. And after that you can't change anything about it.

422
00:49:53.400 --> 00:50:01.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Potentially. Yeah, potentially. Yeah, yeah, it can hit a. It can hit a cap of sorts. But you want to figure out the right balance, and the right sweet spot for each of them.

423
00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:06.130
Nirat Attri: So would it mean like that? That's what I meant like, so once a level

424
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:09.830
Nirat Attri: hits that cab, then it stops being a lever. Is that the case? Then.

425
00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:10.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No.

426
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: no, you're still utilizing it. You just.

427
00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.120
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

428
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, you're still pulling it.

429
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:22.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You're just pulling in a certain amount, because that's the capacity for it. In a given, you know, timeframe or instance or week.

430
00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.890
Nirat Attri: Got it. So it's still legitimate.

431
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:27.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

432
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, yeah.

433
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:31.220
Uğur Koç | dert: Guess the idea.

434
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:35.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Honestly like what? What? It sorry. I don't mean to jump in. I just want to clarify one more thing like

435
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the

436
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:56.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it should be boring at some point like this should be boring because it's so predictable. Because we just kind of know what's gonna happen. And we just have it there like, that's what you want to get to is like a very predictable set of things that almost doesn't even seem that interesting anymore. Because, you already know it's gonna be what it is like. That's what we want. Most of us don't have that right now.

437
00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:57.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hope, that's clear.

438
00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:05.306
Uğur Koç | dert: Yeah, can I come up with a comment. I think the way that you know. Now, hearing Liliana Neil speak about this

439
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:29.910
Uğur Koç | dert: like for the opal therapeutics example, it would be like customer follow up in person meetings, let's say opal starts with doing 40 follow ups per week, and then they see that there's high demand, so they increase it to 60, and then it's too much. Then they decide on 50, and they find out that you know, 50 is the amount of follow ups that they have to do per week to, you know. Get the best results

440
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:33.439
Uğur Koç | dert: they'll still have to commit to doing 50.

441
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:33.820
Morgan Stanton: And.

442
00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:46.789
Uğur Koç | dert: Every single week and essentially pulling the lever. I think the pulling, the lever anecdote is basically doing something. Each iteration that gives you results.

443
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.000
Morgan Stanton: That's a big story.

444
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.419
Uğur Koç | dert: Think about it, so it won't ever run out.

445
00:51:52.770 --> 00:52:05.860
Florence Ettlin: So if I can just piggyback on that. So then how would the reducing time of contracts, or, for example, like an app like the subscription price. Those are then not levers. Right? Those are because it's not an action that we do

446
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.099
Florence Ettlin: like by changing the subscription price, etc. That's not

447
00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.740
Florence Ettlin: kind of what, or just alluded to like, okay, 50 customer follow-ups every week.

448
00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:19.010
Florence Ettlin: So how? How is the second one here? A lever? I'm just yeah.

449
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:25.859
Uğur Koç | dert: That's what I think. And I think we've messed this up on number on the number 2 levers of our presentation as well. I think

450
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.299
Uğur Koç | dert: now that we've gone through the discussions. You know I.

451
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:29.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Home, with.

452
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.049
Uğur Koç | dert: I agree with what you've said.

453
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:34.489
Lilliana Robinson: You didn't mess anything up, I would just say.

454
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like, yeah, I was, gonna say.

455
00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:35.630
Lilliana Robinson: I want to.

456
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:40.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You guys had messed anything up. No, no one's in trouble. No one said anything wrong.

457
00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:46.560
Lilliana Robinson: No, we're just. We're just here to get it right. So you might want to revisit

458
00:52:47.079 --> 00:53:02.370
Lilliana Robinson: cogniscope. Same here, Morgan, I would say, you just need to narrow down number 2 to what the actual action is to reduce the contract like, what is it that you're going to do? What is the repeatable action that that then moves your business.

459
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:03.220
Morgan Stanton: Okay.

460
00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:07.579
Dave Scott: Yeah. But I think Morgan's point is that these are fixed contracts. So.

461
00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:07.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Correct.

462
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:16.880
Dave Scott: She's gonna get $10,000 whether or not she does it in a day, or she does it in 30 days. And so optimizing. That is a lever for increasing revenue. It's a smart idea.

463
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.019
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I agree.

464
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.950
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you. Morgan. Okay.

465
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.390
Annie Brown: Okay.

466
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.510
Annie Brown: yeah.

467
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:31.270
Annie Brown: And then, okay.

468
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:32.680
Lilliana Robinson: Kevin Sue is next.

469
00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:44.420
Annie Brown: Alright. So. I have 2 financial levers that I feel pretty good about. And 3, rd Slider, once I have questions on. So this is just increase the number of sales calls per week. I mean, we've

470
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:58.990
Annie Brown: everything. All of our traction so far has been inbound. We haven't done any outbound at all. So I think this is a good place to start. Would be eager to get feedback on that one.

471
00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:05.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's a lever. Just to be clear. You mind going back for a second. I think everyone's seeing it is everybody seeing this.

472
00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is like a very clear

473
00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:16.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like, we can all nod and agree like, Okay, if she increases the sales calls per week. That makes sense as a thing that I'm doing to influence my sales right?

474
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:18.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I appreciate that.

475
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:24.189
Lilliana Robinson: And and he wrote it out right. Look with how that ends up affecting the bottom line of revenue

476
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.850
Lilliana Robinson: like this affects that which affects that I like this. This is good.

477
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:37.069
Morgan Stanton: And sorry. What! Just to follow up real quick. Would the Kpi for this just be number of sales calls per week, and like this would be the action item like verb, that would be before the lever.

478
00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:40.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.

479
00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.762
Annie Brown: Okay, cool. And then

480
00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:57.150
Annie Brown: This next one, I think, is headed in the right direction. But given this discussion, I think it needs to be narrowed down. So I said, invest in thought leadership through industry

481
00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:16.851
Annie Brown: conferences, publishing research, enhancing SEO for target customer search terms. So I think maybe a better one would be I guess, like a number of hours spent on, you know, publishing a re, or number of research papers published, or

482
00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:18.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Good edit.

483
00:55:19.356 --> 00:55:21.090
Annie Brown: Number of

484
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.740
Annie Brown: per number of dollars

485
00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.430
Annie Brown: spent on

486
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:31.969
Annie Brown: blog posts and Pr in a month, or something like that would be the SEO one. So what actually impacts SEO.

487
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You got it.

488
00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.360
Annie Brown: Okay.

489
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:41.261
Annie Brown: But I I, this one is one that we have some good evidence on so far that it does

490
00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.249
Annie Brown: increase or it does

491
00:55:44.573 --> 00:55:52.470
Annie Brown: impact traction, but we haven't measured it. So I'm excited to actually start measuring it. And like, I said, it's going to be tricky. But I think now that I've

492
00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:56.859
Annie Brown: yeah, we're talking it through. I think I see it now and then. The last one are 2.

493
00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:11.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So sorry. I need to jump in just to be clear with what you just said. It sounds like you've been succeeding with your eyes closed. Yes, you're like, Hey, like, it's just working. And like, I'm not questioning it. But it's happening. And that's good. And now we're going to open our eyes, and we're gonna look at it. And then we're going to make it even better. Good.

494
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:29.339
Annie Brown: And then the last 2 that I'm kind of deciding like which one should be our 3rd main lever. I think the the issue here is kind of same as what we've been discussing at. These are the rooms, not necessarily the levers, so maybe the Standardized service delivery.

495
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:39.389
Annie Brown: lever would be some sort of action that leads to standardization. And then the operational efficiency. I think maybe we could just focus on

496
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.170
Annie Brown: maybe.

497
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:43.960
Annie Brown: Well, I don't know why I want to say, maybe, like

498
00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:49.520
Annie Brown: velocity of service delivery, maybe back to Morgan's thing like how fast we're able to

499
00:56:49.630 --> 00:57:02.300
Annie Brown: deliver the data annotation, product, or like, not the product. But this is actually specifically to our data, annot annotation like concierge service.

500
00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:10.610
Annie Brown: And then that's my last slide.

501
00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.040
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, let's open it to comments from the group.

502
00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:25.080
Lilliana Robinson: What do you guys think especially about the ones that Annie has questions on.

503
00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:33.689
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, I feel like any already. Now, through all this conversation you kind of hit it on the nailed with.

504
00:57:34.070 --> 00:58:01.730
Florence Ettlin: Now I think we all understand. It's by the actions that we put in. And we also looked at the optimizing one. I think it's just hard to figure out what's the actions that we can measure towards that so if we come to any conclusions we're happy to share. But yeah, I think definitely the 1st one, now that we see, it's like basically the secondary Kpis that we thought of all the different actions that we can take. I think the 1st one you presented was spot on. Now it makes sense

505
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:02.680
Florence Ettlin: for sure.

506
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:11.570
Lilliana Robinson: Anybody else.

507
00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:22.279
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I don't know if, Neil, before we move on, you wanted to say anything about these

508
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.430
Lilliana Robinson: 2.

509
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm gonna give this this last one some, thought Annie.

510
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:30.940
Annie Brown: Okay.

511
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:33.245
Annie Brown: Okay. Great. Yeah. Me, too.

512
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.440
Annie Brown: Oh, Monica.

513
00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:49.430
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, sorry, Annie. This isn't related to your slides, but it was going off of what Florence just said. Like the levers are discrete actions we can take. But like, how do you parse out

514
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:55.260
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): expenditure versus actions cause like, if you're talking about Google ads or something, it's just

515
00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:01.559
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): the lever is the spend right? So when is the lever? The spend versus the lever, the action.

516
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.400
Lilliana Robinson: I would say the love the lover is always the action that you're taking.

517
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:22.409
Lilliana Robinson: No, and not just the amount that you're that you would spend on that thing. It's that. Well, first, st that's an assumption. But say, that's true. It's the action of okay, we increase these ads by X percent. I know that that will increase revenue by Y percent.

518
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.460
Lilliana Robinson: That's like what I really like you guys to get to

519
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:43.840
Lilliana Robinson: like apricot. And by this time the Teenage Bra Company. They can. Basically, if I, if I texted them and asked them, they would be able to say, like, if I spend X on adding a new influencer to have them like do marketing for us. This is how much on average, they would probably bring in per like

520
00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.940
Lilliana Robinson: per month in sales.

521
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:50.799
Lilliana Robinson: because there are like these things that happen after I pull that lever.

522
00:59:50.820 --> 01:00:06.190
Lilliana Robinson: That's the predictability we want to get to. So like for you, it's like I spend 200 on each conference that results in 3 leads, one converts, and it will be this amount. And that's in 6 months. And so you just know that that $200 will turn into that X amount of dollars.

523
01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.400
Lilliana Robinson: Does that? Does that make sense, Monica? You still look uncertain.

524
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:21.339
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, I mean, I think when you are spending something, you just have to know exactly what that's resulting in and what that thing results in and so on and so forth, right

525
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:25.039
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): like the whole chain of events, has to be predictable.

526
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.080
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Think that's what I'm getting.

527
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:48.230
Nirat Attri: Like just to just to add to that, because, like same same question, because I also understand coming from the same marketing perspective, it's just very expensive to run this experiment. In the 1st place, that's where my mind is going. But if you are trying to look at more visibility at conference booths and spends in that regard and trying to optimize for what happens afterwards.

528
01:00:48.618 --> 01:00:52.780
Nirat Attri: Just an experiment that's slightly expensive to run. That's why I'm

529
01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:54.330
Nirat Attri: thinking about it right now.

530
01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.730
Nirat Attri: How really? How do you validate it?

531
01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:58.399
Uğur Koç | dert: I really want to ask, like.

532
01:00:58.857 --> 01:01:05.110
Uğur Koç | dert: I I think the main point of confusion, because, like, you know, everyone has different ways of

533
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:11.160
Uğur Koç | dert: talking about levers, but like, what's the difference between a financial lever and

534
01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:15.220
Uğur Koç | dert: the lever that we know from the book or the course work? Because.

535
01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:15.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

536
01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:20.549
Uğur Koç | dert: Like, can we please elude a bit on that? Because, like Troy's

537
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:27.500
Uğur Koç | dert: presentation and the book seems to be sort of conflicting. I don't wanna.

538
01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.040
Uğur Koç | dert: you know, like I I didn't get it.

539
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, well, Troy, Troy, Troy, Troy, wrote the book.

540
01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:37.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like the large part of the book, is what Trey wrote as well, just to be clear.

541
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:41.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I don't know if they're that conflicting. But

542
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:48.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what we're saying might conflict with it a bit, because I think the analogy I said earlier, or is about the the room

543
01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:56.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with each room having certain actual levers, so on a financial model, you might represent the progress with these larger buckets.

544
01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:07.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but at the end of the day. What's going to help you all actually measure your progress and hold yourself accountable to making real progress? It's not just tracking these

545
01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:15.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like broader kind of categories. It's actually tracking the efforts you're making to influence those categories.

546
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:17.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Is that tracking? Does that make sense.

547
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:26.580
Uğur Koç | dert: Yes, but in Troy's presentation I got it, as you know, increasing the price of your product or decreasing the price.

548
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.

549
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:32.120
Uğur Koç | dert: Product will have a profound influence on how many units you're selling, because.

550
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:35.779
Uğur Koç | dert: you know, price equilibrium moves to the right, to the left.

551
01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:36.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's right.

552
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:43.609
Uğur Koç | dert: But in our case now, the following, the conversation that conversations that we're having here right now.

553
01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:53.570
Uğur Koç | dert: I wouldn't count price as a lever. Why? Because it's not something that we I can continuously put effort into and get some output out of.

554
01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:23.167
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's yeah. There, there's a nuance there. I think you identified on the pricing point like an important distinction. You could still consider it a lever, and that like, if you increase it or decrease, it could have certain factors of influence, I think, before the term lever started to become popularized the way that Troy would describe it was sensitivity analysis. So we poke around in our financial models and figure out what influence something has. And if you change the price. It has a huge difference, something else you change. It doesn't make a difference at all. That kind of thing. So that's all. Legitimate.

555
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:29.919
Uğur Koç | dert: What about the repeatability aspect of it? Like changing the price is not something you can repeat continuously.

556
01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:39.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That that. And that's where I'm coming from. So what I'm getting at is I want, I want things that you guys have like, actual predictable control over that we can support you on throughout the program.

557
01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.260
Çoruh | CogniScope: May I contribute to that analogy a bit on my understanding.

558
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:46.969
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, yeah.

559
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:47.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No.

560
01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:47.980
Çoruh | CogniScope: So

561
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:56.279
Çoruh | CogniScope: so, as you said, like, if we take these like Troy's financial assumption, thing is

562
01:03:56.470 --> 01:04:02.710
Çoruh | CogniScope: as control like control panels. We have a lot of levers to control

563
01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:16.280
Çoruh | CogniScope: that controlled room, basically. And possibly the gigs on those levers are actually our Kpis to keep track of how the lever is working or not

564
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:17.599
Çoruh | CogniScope: kind of thing.

565
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:37.789
Çoruh | CogniScope: maybe, like as a as a cockpit. They have many panels, and they have many buttons, but when you flip a button. It's like the gag on the like. Flip tells you how like, how is the temperature like, how is the speed is like, how you're doing with the kind of like the orientation of the plane.

566
01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:46.129
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, you and you should crap, keep track of these. But you should control these by like turning these Lev that buttons and levers

567
01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:52.766
Çoruh | CogniScope: to control. Hold the plane on a like for the possible direction. Maybe like add an allergy for my case.

568
01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.789
Çoruh | CogniScope: Sure, that's what I understood from your

569
01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:57.900
Çoruh | CogniScope: approach. Basically.

570
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:59.290
Lilliana Robinson: I like that a lot.

571
01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:01.750
Çoruh | CogniScope: Nice way to put it out there. I think.

572
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:02.580
Lilliana Robinson: I know Neil like.

573
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:02.970
Çoruh | CogniScope: Since.

574
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:04.340
Lilliana Robinson: White analogies.

575
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.350
Lilliana Robinson: That's really good.

576
01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:07.809
Çoruh | CogniScope: I'm also I don't know what you said. Look, guys, so

577
01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:09.880
Çoruh | CogniScope: I love it.

578
01:05:11.288 --> 01:05:20.080
Lilliana Robinson: And yeah, the people in the chat are asking, yeah, the Kpis can measure the health of the business. That's kind of the whole point of metrics which we'll get to tomorrow. But yes.

579
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:21.319
Lilliana Robinson: a collab.

580
01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:26.899
Florence Ettlin: So we wanted clarification on that example that you gave us about the Teenage Bra Company

581
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:33.050
Florence Ettlin: is the lever, the influencers? Or is it the number of posts that they would be? Yeah publishing.

582
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:40.769
Florence Ettlin: because wouldn't the room be the control room? Sort of be like social media marketing or the influencers, and then the lever be the number of posts.

583
01:05:42.524 --> 01:05:57.310
Lilliana Robinson: I think they were doing it based on how many influencers they were hiring, because then they could know that I don't think they were paying them for a per post. I think it was like they they had this like deal that they would just sign them up, for I don't know. It was 2 years ago, so I don't remember exactly, but either one

584
01:05:57.591 --> 01:06:12.530
Lilliana Robinson: something that they can actionably do. So they're either increasing the amount of posts per the 5 influencers they're already paying, or they're going out and adding more influencers because they want to increase the amount of virality they get. I'm not sure how they set up their deal with them. But yeah.

585
01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.960
Lilliana Robinson: either one are actionable steps.

586
01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:26.839
Florence Ettlin: So that means salespeople could be a lever. Because, let's say, one salesperson can bring in 10 new companies that could be a lever. So I bring in another sales. Rep like they just bring in another influencer.

587
01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:32.330
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. But you have to get that validated. So like you have to know, like, before you spend money on doing that.

588
01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:32.810
Florence Ettlin: And.

589
01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:52.200
Lilliana Robinson: On one and make sure that they're targeting the right segment so that you can increase the amount of deals per salesperson. And then you know what to hold the new person accountable for right? And then you want to know how much that can convert to to sales. So then you know how much money you should probably be spending on the sales. Rep. You don't want to pay more on the sales rep than what they can bring in.

590
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:54.380
Florence Ettlin: Yeah.

591
01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:12.129
Dave Scott: That's how salesforce grew. Salesforce had a calculation. They knew exactly how much revenue any new salesperson would bring in on year one year, 2 year 3. And so if they needed to hit a certain goal of 200 million dollars, they'd be like boom. I need 14 sales reps.

592
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.040
Dave Scott: It's pretty impressive.

593
01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:26.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Speaking of impressive Fabio, that's a really nice coat. Look at you all stylish over there, hanging out.

594
01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:31.899
Fabio Caironi: Appreciate it. I can give off some more advice if you just meet me personally.

595
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:34.260
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

596
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.750
Uğur Koç | dert: Very classy.

597
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:38.170
Lilliana Robinson: Kevin Sue, you're up next.

598
01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:44.819
Kevin Su: I cannot see chat. So if anybody has questions, comments, feel free to shout it out.

599
01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.579
Kevin Su: Can everyone see my screen.

600
01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.370
Lilliana Robinson: Yep.

601
01:07:48.480 --> 01:08:00.059
Kevin Su: So I think I format this a little bit more different. I. Personally, my levers are increase, decrease, and pay marketing channels, drive partnerships and improving the base product.

602
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:05.590
Kevin Su: But I think that's just more broad strategies for very specific levers. And you guys will see what I mean.

603
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:13.050
Kevin Su: so for increase in pay marketing channels. This is the primary driver of our user acquisition.

604
01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:37.950
Kevin Su: Our users rely heavily on social media to discover new resources, and we've seen success with it with organic marketing. So one of our prime levers right now is number of Reddit posts lead to X number of users X number of website business which leads to X number of account sign ups. But we haven't identified the marginal value on per dollar spend for our pay channels. So not confident, saying, This is the

605
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:46.550
Kevin Su: any of these are our main lever that we can pull, which has the biggest effect on our business. That's why, there's a couple but some examples that we thought that was number

606
01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:58.389
Kevin Su: a dollar increase or decrease in social media marketing channels. After we've identified, which has the highest roi which has the highest traction for us through tests affiliate marketing with it

607
01:08:58.851 --> 01:09:05.499
Kevin Su: influencers so number of influencers we partner with, and the number of users that lead us to.

608
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:11.439
Kevin Su: And then ambassador programs with students and our tutors, which is kind of on the same structure with influencers.

609
01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:27.850
Kevin Su: So number 2 is increase in partnerships. We see this as secondary driver of user acquisition. It's not as direct as organic or pay channels, but it gives access to users in larger volumes.

610
01:09:28.237 --> 01:09:38.712
Kevin Su: So some inputs for this is the increase in time spent on creating partnerships. And I think how we pull that lever is identify, how long it takes to generate a partnership.

611
01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:54.390
Kevin Su: what the resources needed for that is, and then how? What the outsource is in terms of number of potential new users. The second input is hiring a partnership team. So per partnership person, how many partnerships are we generating from that hire

612
01:09:55.447 --> 01:10:07.130
Kevin Su: and finally, I think this is where I would like some ideas from the group. So the way I understand the last 2 is user acquisition is how we get our 1st users. Number 3 is user retention.

613
01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:12.109
Kevin Su: And we chose this lever to improve user intention because that directly affects profitability.

614
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:24.179
Kevin Su: We think improving, the product will increase increase stickiness of the product. But we're unsure how to actually quantify that, what actual inputs into our product can we make

615
01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:44.960
Kevin Su: to make our products more sticky, to increase monthly user retention or annual user retention. But like, I said, the goal here is to increase usage, time, retention idea thought of us sending customer surveys, seeing who's happy with what features, and then building our features from there to see increase in revenue. But I think I'm still brainstorming here?

616
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:47.570
Kevin Su: Yeah.

617
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.949
Lilliana Robinson: How does the is this the end, Kevin? I don't want to.

618
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:51.760
Kevin Su: Understand.

619
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:55.450
Lilliana Robinson: How does improving the base product like walk me through?

620
01:10:55.500 --> 01:11:03.600
Lilliana Robinson: How that's going to change your end line. And I don't remember exactly your revenue model. So is it like they're paying per amount that they come back.

621
01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:07.470
Kevin Su: Yeah, great question. So we have, we're a freeman model.

622
01:11:07.955 --> 01:11:13.880
Kevin Su: And right now, we're projecting basically, 20% of our free users will become paid.

623
01:11:14.816 --> 01:11:16.030
Kevin Su: We have

624
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:28.389
Kevin Su: access. Free users have access to the base model and some features, but mainly we're a subscription model that makes money from our paid users, and the way we increase our pay to free

625
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:32.890
Kevin Su: percentage is by increasing usage time, which increases our retention.

626
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:40.469
Lilliana Robinson: And you've seen that. So that's repeatable. So you've seen that when they hit like X number of hours on the platform, they convert.

627
01:11:41.725 --> 01:11:49.999
Kevin Su: We haven't launched monetization yet. So that's an assumption. But we just assume that for most premium models, that's the basic assumption to be made there. Well, where soon?

628
01:11:50.630 --> 01:12:08.670
Lilliana Robinson: That's what I want you to get to. Once you launch with your own company. That you know for sure like, hey? If we can keep them on for 20 h, then they'll flip. Cause. Then you would know that this 3rd lover is a hundred percent worth it right to like, keep them on for longer to make them convert right now, just like an assumption.

629
01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.609
Lilliana Robinson: Can you go back to 2 and one really quick

630
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:18.319
Lilliana Robinson: cause? These are things you can do like right now, when are you launching monetization.

631
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:21.369
Kevin Su: September 30, th tentatively.

632
01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:22.180
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, okay.

633
01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:25.210
Lilliana Robinson: Does anyone have any comments for Kevin.

634
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:37.689
Morgan Stanton: Kevin, I had a quick comment. I know you're not making money yet, but this the increase and decrease in social media marketing channels. You, you said you are when you post on Reddit you're getting a certain number of like increase in subscriptions.

635
01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:38.890
Morgan Stanton: and so.

636
01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:40.669
Kevin Su: So you? Oh, bye.

637
01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:47.639
Morgan Stanton: No go ahead like. So I feel like, that's just like a really nice data source you already have that could potentially help you make some decisions. Now.

638
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:52.669
Kevin Su: Yeah, absolutely. We're so we're basing this off of

639
01:12:52.930 --> 01:12:55.598
Kevin Su: what we're seeing from our organic channels.

640
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:58.590
Kevin Su: which might not actually be the smartest

641
01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:17.329
Kevin Su: assumption. But we're assuming that because we're seeing this growth from our organic channels you Reddit, once we actually start investing paying for different marketing channels. And once we can identify which channel has the biggest conversion per dollar spend. That's where we want to spend most of our efforts and investment on.

642
01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:39.180
Morgan Stanton: Couldn't you use it even like sooner to like I I don't know how much, if you have to pay for the Reddit or whatever. But like, if you make a post, and you see you get 50 people like, isn't that great data already to kind of make some bigger assumptions about how much money you could get like, or at least to like, stay with Reddit like twice a week we make posts or 3 times a week, and we get this number of turnover.

643
01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:45.699
Nicholas Li: I think a bit of context for this is that we can only make one post a week. So there's a difference between post and ads.

644
01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.839
Nicholas Li: So I've read, it limits the post to one a week.

645
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:54.480
Nicholas Li: and when we start monetization it goes down to 30 days, or once once every month.

646
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:58.250
Nicholas Li: so like we can't post more frequently than that.

647
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.190
Nicholas Li: Users see the post versus an ad, so they might click differently.

648
01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:04.250
Morgan Stanton: Got it.

649
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:17.040
Kevin Su: And just to add additional context. There, too, we have. We pause in the summer to work on product building. So very last 2 weeks was when we did our second round of Pre Beta, just to test our products. But this is why we haven't

650
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.370
Kevin Su: experimented with paid social paid marketing channels earlier, just because we haven't

651
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:24.180
Kevin Su: been doing any of this acquisition.

652
01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.950
Lilliana Robinson: Any other comments for true to me.

653
01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.029
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, cool. Let's go to our next one. Thank you, Kevin.

654
01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:47.469
Lilliana Robinson: Just scroll all the way up to the beginning.

655
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:52.580
Lilliana Robinson: After Kevin. I have Fabio, and then I don't have any other

656
01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:56.780
Lilliana Robinson: volunteers. So if you didn't put your name in yet, make sure that you throw.

657
01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.700
Dave Scott: How do we? How do we get on the list?

658
01:14:58.850 --> 01:15:00.030
Lilliana Robinson: You just put in the chat.

659
01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:03.949
Fabio Caironi: Okay, cool.

660
01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.749
Fabio Caironi: Let me close this

661
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.400
Fabio Caironi: whatever.

662
01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.859
Fabio Caironi: I'm sorry I have to close this.

663
01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.920
Fabio Caironi: Sorry something's not working.

664
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.620
Fabio Caironi: Oh.

665
01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.759
Lilliana Robinson: And maybe just unshare and reshare.

666
01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:22.360
Fabio Caironi: Yeah. But I don't see that

667
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:25.290
Fabio Caironi: pointer anymore. Okay? One second.

668
01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.859
Fabio Caironi: again. Same problem. Sorry. Let me just share the full screen.

669
01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:40.590
Fabio Caironi: Okay, sorry about that.

670
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.520
Lilliana Robinson: It's okay.

671
01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.220
Fabio Caironi: There we go!

672
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:42.990
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

673
01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.149
Lilliana Robinson: yeah, this works fine. We can see it.

674
01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:48.849
Fabio Caironi: Great. Yeah. So

675
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:53.170
Fabio Caironi: Following Neil's comment this morning

676
01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.219
Fabio Caironi: we took out our

677
01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:58.619
Fabio Caironi: compute price as one of the levers

678
01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:06.190
Fabio Caironi: I would like to like. Go back on that after I presented a free 3 levers that we have identified, because I think it's still like sort of like

679
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:18.719
Fabio Caironi: a something that we can factor in. But probably it will come like at a later stage. So we focus on something that is very reproducible is very tangible, is very measurable.

680
01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:25.810
Fabio Caironi: And and something that we we've also seen some like hints off, if not like real data.

681
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:28.260
Fabio Caironi: So the 1st one will be

682
01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:34.380
Fabio Caironi: here we go. The 1st one will be expanding our guides and tutorials

683
01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:38.600
Fabio Caironi: about our product and about use cases and

684
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:40.020
Fabio Caironi: basically

685
01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:45.240
Fabio Caironi: posting on our online locations. This kind of content

686
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:47.820
Fabio Caironi: will not only increase

687
01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:51.370
Fabio Caironi: our inbound sales.

688
01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:52.780
Fabio Caironi: but also

689
01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:53.970
Fabio Caironi: it will

690
01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:54.845
Fabio Caironi: basically

691
01:16:56.090 --> 01:17:10.234
Fabio Caironi: improve our customer retention. So we we plan on improving our documentation by producing this bits of content that are very easily to easy to consume.

692
01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.859
Fabio Caironi: because we have seen that typically

693
01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.799
Fabio Caironi: this is a pattern for other other platforms, competitive platforms.

694
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:32.869
Fabio Caironi: and in this way we can also win over undecided customers. So we are catering to the top of the funnel. For this specific lever, and I think there can be like a specific measurement on like.

695
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.310
Fabio Caironi: you know, if we post one guide a week.

696
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:38.350
Fabio Caironi: we can get X amount of new sign-ups

697
01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.580
Fabio Caironi: every week.

698
01:17:40.465 --> 01:17:44.889
Fabio Caironi: So how can we pull? It is pretty much like having someone do this.

699
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:53.590
Fabio Caironi: maybe like, if not full time, at least, like, you know, 20 h, 30 HA week, because it takes a lot of time. You have to understand fully the product. And

700
01:17:53.650 --> 01:18:00.689
Fabio Caironi: then you have to create these Demos distribute them. So it's probably like the work of a person

701
01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:14.009
Fabio Caironi: can be like a contractor, so you know, can cost up some money, or I can devote some time to this, but of course it will take some. Take some time out of other activities. So definitely, you have to think twice before

702
01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.260
Fabio Caironi: pulling this lever, but

703
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:18.460
Fabio Caironi: it definitely produces good results.

704
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.510
Fabio Caironi: The next, like.

705
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:21.520
Lilliana Robinson: 1 1 min left Fabia.

706
01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:26.619
Fabio Caironi: Okay, I'll be quick. Add, spend on a service computing keywords. It is pretty simple.

707
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.209
Fabio Caironi: Service computing is very niche. So we will cater to the bottom funnel.

708
01:18:33.090 --> 01:18:42.700
Fabio Caironi: yeah. People that already know what did it? What that is that has already tried functions as a service like, aws, lambda, they're just trying to look for new solution. So what to do? They look

709
01:18:43.282 --> 01:18:51.737
Fabio Caironi: for service computing or cloud functions or Api for containerized computing on Google cloud. Oh, sorry on Google search. And

710
01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.239
Fabio Caironi: yeah, we can be right there positioning on the top results

711
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:57.980
Fabio Caironi: exhibition

712
01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:02.830
Fabio Caironi: slash pitches at known AI cloud tech us. So we saw this.

713
01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:04.400
Fabio Caironi: Like

714
01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:12.809
Fabio Caironi: 1st hand this is very high converting so, but it is also expensive, like it's a lever that we can pull. We can decide. Oh, yeah, we do.

715
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:20.240
Fabio Caironi: We do 2 events this month, or we do 0 events this month, depending on what is our workload and also what are our resources? Because sometimes

716
01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:27.050
Fabio Caironi: this is expensive, you know, like a booth can like like 5 or 10 bucks at a at a big trade shows.

717
01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.050
Fabio Caironi: But we saw a lot of

718
01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:30.840
Fabio Caironi: possibilities to

719
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:35.949
Fabio Caironi: on board new people and also grow our audience with prospects outside our network.

720
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.070
Fabio Caironi: So all these 3 types of levers are

721
01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:44.450
Fabio Caironi: increasing, basically the inbound, and the volume and value of sales.

722
01:19:50.500 --> 01:20:01.579
Uğur Koç | dert: Before anyone chimes in. Can I say something? I think this is like, this is really good, because, like, we've already done an interview with Fabio's team. Because, you know, we

723
01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:30.940
Uğur Koç | dert: use these services so one could say that we are potential prospecting customer. And these levers I can verify from the demand side, because I've seen products similar to bite night via these things like, I've seen products like Byte night at exhibitions where they present it to me. I've seen it on Google when I was looking for a solution, I saw them online. So you know, I think this is very spot on from the demand side as well.

724
01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.089
Fabio Caironi: Appreciate your feedback.

725
01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:35.420
Lilliana Robinson: Any.

726
01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:44.279
Annie Brown: Yeah, I was sorry going to say something similar from the demand side. I I'm really obsessed with the 1st one. Because I think

727
01:20:44.370 --> 01:21:07.280
Annie Brown: that's such. That's 1 that, including myself, like oftentimes gets overlooked that like, you know, if somebody understood it a bit more, or understood how it was used a bit more. Then they would come on like on board as a customer, quicker, or maybe stay on longer as a customer. So yeah, I actually added that one to my own list, because I think that's that's great.

728
01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:29.179
Lilliana Robinson: I, yeah, I especially like your next steps here, like the next steps section that you have for every single one. I think everyone should make one like that, he called it. How how can we pull it? But basically like, what what do we do to get this done? So either hiring someone to produce those or delegating it to one of your current team members. I like that a lot.

729
01:21:29.530 --> 01:21:32.789
Lilliana Robinson: I also like the last one. If you go to the 3.

730
01:21:33.812 --> 01:21:51.059
Lilliana Robinson: I've seen a lot of you guys. There's like a right. You're like the 4th one that is saying like exhibitions, things like that so? I'll just echo what Dave said. Where it's like you can. You can get this to be free, and you can figure out like savvy ways to get in here and have the same value.

731
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:58.959
Fabio Caironi: I would just like to like, express our own concern and like critique to this presentation.

732
01:21:59.486 --> 01:22:03.140
Fabio Caironi: There's not. There's not data yet. So

733
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:16.809
Fabio Caironi: and and I think that can be very crucial, because, like, we've seen, you know, perfect. For example, for this specific lever going to events we've seen like our spending increase substantially like. Once we went to this trade show, we spent almost like

734
01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.180
Fabio Caironi: 15 K.

735
01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:19.840
Fabio Caironi: And

736
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:22.609
Fabio Caironi: the result was very good. But

737
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:28.669
Fabio Caironi: we weren't ready to sell a product back then. So we didn't have a specific like.

738
01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:31.550
Fabio Caironi: Roi! On that activity

739
01:22:31.570 --> 01:22:34.140
Fabio Caironi: which makes it more difficult now to

740
01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:39.390
Fabio Caironi: understand really like, how much can we afford in terms of time and resources spent?

741
01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:44.759
Fabio Caironi: So these like are good and paper. But I think we'll have to refine and and prioritize

742
01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:51.079
Fabio Caironi: some of these, or maybe add more ones, as we figure out the ones that have a better profitability.

743
01:22:51.540 --> 01:23:00.609
Dave Scott: Here. Here's what I'll do. On Monday, the 23rd at noon. I will do a trade show masterclass for lunch.

744
01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:12.630
Dave Scott: So anyone who wants to go in there I will tell you all the ins and outs of jumping onto a trade show and getting the most out of it, so that'll be on the 23rd at noon. I'll have. I'll maybe Chloe can help me put it on the calendar.

745
01:23:13.230 --> 01:23:17.750
Lilliana Robinson: There you go. You can reach out to Chloe. She'll make sure that it fits in between people's mentor. Madness slots.

746
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:20.740
Dave Scott: Okay, yeah. Okay, fair. Fair enough. Happy to do it.

747
01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.719
Lilliana Robinson: That's great, Dave. I love that.

748
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:24.699
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. Cause we've had, like 4 or 5

749
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:29.490
Lilliana Robinson: cool any other final things for Fabio here. I think you're on a great

750
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:31.299
Lilliana Robinson: path here, Fabia.

751
01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.220
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you.

752
01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:36.330
Lilliana Robinson: Cool. Okay.

753
01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:38.389
Lilliana Robinson: let's go to Dave.

754
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.880
Dave Scott: I was writing a note for myself.

755
01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:50.810
Dave Scott: Alright, so I think I probably I think I got this thing entirely wrong

756
01:23:51.251 --> 01:23:57.040
Dave Scott: so I'm really glad I got to go last, because I got to fix it while I watched all you amazing people do your thing.

757
01:23:57.526 --> 01:24:15.899
Dave Scott: So I actually start out with the rooms, so I started out with, there are 3 made. There are 3, 4 major letter levers, 4 major rooms I care about. One is customer acquisition, which is a calculation of lifetime value. Cac. And return on ad spend. One is net growth, which is a combination of new subscribers.

758
01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.860
Dave Scott: plus total subscribers minus churn subscribers.

759
01:24:20.406 --> 01:24:35.009
Dave Scott: The next is engagement, which is dau mau minutes per session, and sessions per week, and then revenue, which is Mrr versus times. Arpu, minus net churn is how I calculate revenue. So I started out really broad, probably too broad

760
01:24:35.369 --> 01:24:40.190
Dave Scott: to sort of think about sort of the the financial levers that at least I know are in my financial model.

761
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:42.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Great so far, Dave.

762
01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:43.210
Dave Scott: Sorry.

763
01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I said, this is great so far we're all with you.

764
01:24:46.030 --> 01:25:00.302
Dave Scott: Okay, cool, cool. Then I got savvy. I got savvy and big goal number one here, which is increase subscription revenue. So the why is we have a thousands of people in our community that engage with our brand on a daily basis that are not subscribers.

765
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:18.510
Dave Scott: Only a small percentage of them have subscribed to our Patreon. And so I'm wondering if there are levers that I can use to increase the percentage of subscribers coming from my discord channel. So some of the levers I pull are. I wonder if I could create like a free tier. See if I can pull people to the free tier and then upgrade up

766
01:25:19.018 --> 01:25:31.670
Dave Scott: test different value propositions, different mixtures of content and value that I can share in order to increase the conversion rate, and then the way I would measure it is number of subscribers. As a percentage of my discord community.

767
01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:39.370
Dave Scott: My second is increase free to pay. So this is the premium path.

768
01:25:39.888 --> 01:25:52.630
Dave Scott: And so another hypothesis is that if I can recruit people to my free tier, do they convert faster or better than I if I convert them directly to my paid. So is that stutter step useful or not useful?

769
01:25:52.980 --> 01:26:04.609
Dave Scott: So we have a lot of people who are subscribed to our free tier now. So I'm wondering whether or not I can. If if there is value in increasing the percentage of subscribers from the free tier and spending energy there

770
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:18.389
Dave Scott: the levers to pull our test that free tier test some free drops. So by drops, I mean content dropping content and dropping loot essentially and then offer promotions to get people to upgrade.

771
01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:27.969
Dave Scott: And then, if this is done well, then the number of paid that I can measure it by the number of paid subscribers as a percentage of total subscribers, which is free plus paid

772
01:26:29.655 --> 01:26:35.639
Dave Scott: and then the 3rd one is reduced churn. So churn is the killer of most subscription businesses. As you guys know.

773
01:26:36.521 --> 01:26:49.209
Dave Scott: Once people subscribe, it's harder to get unsubscribed, it's hard to get them back. So the hope is I can lower churn, and so the levers I can pull are, you know. Would it be valuable if I could increase their engagement on the platform.

774
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:52.740
Dave Scott: Maybe I can test unique content drops in the middle of the month.

775
01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:59.169
Dave Scott: so they don't want to churn, and then, if they do churn, conduct, exit interviews to find out why they churned

776
01:27:00.425 --> 01:27:06.430
Dave Scott: and the the impact on the model is less unsubscribes per period which equals greater. Mr.

777
01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:18.040
Lilliana Robinson: So, Dave, out of these 3 goals, which one do you think would move the lever or move the needle for your business? The most.

778
01:27:18.370 --> 01:27:23.889
Dave Scott: This one. I've got 35,000 people in my community, and only 181 subscribers.

779
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:25.390
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

780
01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:27.550
Lilliana Robinson: yeah.

781
01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.630
Lilliana Robinson: It looks like Annie, unmuted.

782
01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:34.330
Annie Brown: Oh, yeah, I was just. I like the way you broke this down. Cause I think this helps

783
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:41.120
Annie Brown: helps me. So like, for example, my thought leadership. One like increase investment thought leadership. And then I could have several levers

784
01:27:41.170 --> 01:27:46.760
Annie Brown: under that. So I like that. You'd like that. Levers to pull line, I think, is very useful.

785
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:48.250
Dave Scott: Cool.

786
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:52.850
Dave Scott: I stole it from flow.

787
01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.689
Lilliana Robinson: Any other comments for Dave here.

788
01:28:02.996 --> 01:28:14.660
Florence Ettlin: I guess, just based on the conversation we had today. I wonder here those test free tier and test different value propositions. Would those be considered levers, or would we need to go more granular to be like?

789
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:20.119
Florence Ettlin: I don't know on top of my mind, but like more on the action side of what we can do.

790
01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:39.280
Florence Ettlin: Quantify it more, I guess. I think, on your number 3. Dave, one of them was like really, really clear, like conduct exit interviews like that one is super clear. I'm going to conduct. I don't know. 10 exit interviews each week. So for that previous one, wouldn't we need to find something similar to that style.

791
01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:46.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I had the same question, Flo. Actually, if you go back to Number 3, Dave, just for those 2 increase engagement and test content drops.

792
01:28:47.801 --> 01:28:50.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Those could be probably specified further

793
01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:56.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in in a similar way, that conduct exit. Exit. Interviews are already fairly objective and clear.

794
01:28:57.650 --> 01:29:00.080
Dave Scott: Yeah, he means like the different kinds of or the free.

795
01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, exactly like. So what would you do to increase engagement on platform? Yeah.

796
01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:06.559
Dave Scott: Yeah, more quizzes. More

797
01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.250
Dave Scott: people are polls for some reason, so do a punish polls.

798
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:14.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you've got quantifiable things that you can experiment with the test and measure to see what works right.

799
01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:15.970
Dave Scott: Helpful. Yeah.

800
01:29:15.970 --> 01:29:16.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There you go!

801
01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:19.830
Lilliana Robinson: And then same with gold, too. Can you go back aside?

802
01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.370
Lilliana Robinson: Flo is asking here.

803
01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:25.920
Dave Scott: So she's saying that like testing a free tier is binary

804
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:30.060
Dave Scott: which I think I get, I get your point for that.

805
01:29:35.210 --> 01:29:35.830
Lilliana Robinson: Cool.

806
01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:36.950
Lilliana Robinson: Well.

807
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:37.594
Dave Scott: Yeah.

808
01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:46.509
Lilliana Robinson: The other ones. Yeah, the other ones are repeatable actions and things that you can validate. As to whether or not it's going to move the needle for goal 2.

809
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:48.660
Dave Scott: Okay.

810
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:49.630
Lilliana Robinson: Cool

811
01:29:51.299 --> 01:29:51.910
Lilliana Robinson: and.

812
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:59.839
Çoruh | CogniScope: Also, I think we can help you with some of those to actually with your discord, channels, messages, at least.

813
01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.180
Dave Scott: I'm ready. I've been waiting. I'm here.

814
01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:07.969
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, yeah, I know. I know. I know there's too much happening. So we're always talking about you. But

815
01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:10.329
Çoruh | CogniScope: let's do this.

816
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.910
Lilliana Robinson: I love that. That's awesome.

817
01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:24.020
Lilliana Robinson: Cool. Okay, Dave, this is great. So just like I said to other people, you don't use the word like mess up or did it wrong? It's great. You just have a few little tweaks to make.

818
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.920
Lilliana Robinson: So totally good.

819
01:30:26.388 --> 01:30:29.339
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I'm gonna share my screen because we agent.

820
01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, we have snapshot.

821
01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:34.629
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, snapshot reviews. Cesar, you wanna go.

822
01:30:34.630 --> 01:30:36.099
Sezer: Yeah, I just said it.

823
01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.250
Sezer: Alright. Let me share my screen

824
01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.099
Sezer: hopefully. You're able to see.

825
01:30:43.194 --> 01:30:46.090
Sezer: So I hope I

826
01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:58.039
Sezer: took the whole thing from the correct perspective. But I added 2 levers, one it. This is like this was a plan that we had for a while. And last week we actually

827
01:30:58.672 --> 01:31:00.270
Sezer: got into action

828
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:04.130
Sezer: about this. But this is onboarding some

829
01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:05.660
Sezer: clients

830
01:31:06.364 --> 01:31:21.005
Sezer: unpaid. But just to be clear, these are clients, companies, organizations that we already have relation ship for years. So it's not like free tier or free

831
01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.199
Sezer: plan per se.

832
01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.350
Sezer: but more like

833
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:29.199
Sezer: allowing them to use our product

834
01:31:29.410 --> 01:31:31.920
Sezer: for a while to test.

835
01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:35.380
Sezer: to give their feedbacks, because these organizations are

836
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:38.090
Sezer: very large organizations with like

837
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:40.339
Sezer: hundreds of engineers.

838
01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:41.340
Sezer: So

839
01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.680
Sezer: that actually serves as a big

840
01:31:45.142 --> 01:31:55.870
Sezer: testing opportunity for us both from technical perspective, but also from the product perspective as well. So we have to suck up the AI costs

841
01:31:55.980 --> 01:32:03.549
Sezer: for these organizations also to onboard these customers. We have to do a lot of manual work.

842
01:32:03.690 --> 01:32:04.700
Sezer: and

843
01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:11.629
Sezer: it was a real pain to onboard their data to be honest. That

844
01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:21.520
Sezer: that's what we have been doing for the last one week. Like. If you see if you see us busy on one corner of the Co working space. That's why

845
01:32:22.671 --> 01:32:36.190
Sezer: but we are already getting a lot of good feedbacks. We saw all the problems that are related to our onboarding process, because it's very large data that we can't

846
01:32:36.835 --> 01:32:46.140
Sezer: have ourselves. Also, at some point, if they really decide to decide that this product is the product for them.

847
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:52.800
Sezer: The pay will be huge like we'll suddenly have a good revenue.

848
01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:54.000
Sezer: And

849
01:32:54.260 --> 01:33:04.530
Sezer: even though neither of them happens, those are big names in their space so good reference in that sense.

850
01:33:07.330 --> 01:33:08.410
Sezer: So.

851
01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:10.169
Lilliana Robinson: Do you have other lovers, Scissor.

852
01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:19.039
Sezer: Yeah. The other lever is a bit more simpler than that is the Pr and marketing activities that we have been doing for a while.

853
01:33:19.459 --> 01:33:27.640
Sezer: It is costly, and it is mostly trial and error. Approach there to understand what works better than the others.

854
01:33:27.670 --> 01:33:35.079
Sezer: We work with some Pr. Agencies before we are doing ourselves also, like Google as

855
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:39.469
Sezer: Facebook, slash Instagram as whatever we never

856
01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:43.740
Sezer: pushed it too far because we didn't think

857
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:49.740
Sezer: the product was there yet, but nowadays we feel like it like the product

858
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:55.457
Sezer: we have more trusting. So we are ready, actually, to go more

859
01:33:56.150 --> 01:33:58.020
Sezer: harsh with the Pr

860
01:33:58.090 --> 01:34:00.489
Sezer: and marketing. But yeah, it's

861
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:06.020
Sezer: the risk is is costly, and we don't know what we'll get eventually. But

862
01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:11.300
Sezer: on the bright side it's an experience. I guess that we have to pass through.

863
01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.560
Sezer: and also it allows us to

864
01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:17.769
Sezer: build some structure like

865
01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:24.440
Sezer: tracking structures or analytics structure, and like at some point, everything.

866
01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:31.430
Sezer: Every piece will come together, and you'll have a working structure. That's the expectation there.

867
01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:34.469
Sezer: So yeah, those were the 2 levers I had.

868
01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:49.220
Lilliana Robinson: So how validated is this spend you're doing on Pr and marketing activities. You said you've been doing it for a while. Is this something like, you know. If you put in X amount of dollars into this, you'll get a return on your investment.

869
01:34:50.826 --> 01:34:56.799
Sezer: So actually, we have been observing what works better than the others. For example.

870
01:34:57.010 --> 01:35:04.990
Sezer: few months ago, chrome had a podcast and a article ads that was published in Stack Overflow.

871
01:35:05.406 --> 01:35:21.259
Sezer: We actually had some leads from there. A few few people came up to the site. They sign up and try to explore the product. But the product was not that mature enough back then? But still we validated that

872
01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:27.789
Sezer: like having articles may work in, of course, in reputable sites.

873
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:38.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think both of these need a lot of work. I think I think they need to, based on everything we talked about so far with everyone else's. There's a lot of chiseling that needs to happen here, so that we know specifically what you can measure and manage.

874
01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:44.469
Sezer: Yeah. But I guess what we are missing here is just to calculate

875
01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:48.809
Sezer: how much it really costs, like per people like

876
01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:49.880
Sezer: what we will.

877
01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:50.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

878
01:35:50.290 --> 01:35:51.390
Sezer: Actually.

879
01:35:52.300 --> 01:36:02.932
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I. You know, I mentioned to you guys last week when you talked about Pr. How that usually scares me because a lot of startups sink money into Pr, and it's just like basically light lighting a big ball of money on fire.

880
01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:09.029
Annie Brown: Before anybody pays anybody to do. Pr come, talk to me, cause.

881
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:10.629
Sezer: Yeah, we're allowed to.

882
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:20.820
Annie Brown: Yeah, there's a lot of ways you can get really good Pr for free just earn earn media. And it's and Pr agencies really do.

883
01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:23.800
Annie Brown: they're they're a little parasitic. So.

884
01:36:25.230 --> 01:36:46.609
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So, Sarah, were you? I don't know if you saw the discussion earlier, but you might want to watch this recording back and see, like we had a pretty thorough discussion on, like how these need to be actionable. And you need to talk about like exactly what repeatable actions you can take that would move the lever for your business, so I'd love for you to take another stab at this and maybe upload it in base camp.

885
01:36:47.010 --> 01:36:51.160
Lilliana Robinson: changing it to be actionable, based on the things we talked about in this session.

886
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:53.610
Sezer: Yeah. Alright.

887
01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:02.629
Lilliana Robinson: Any other final points for snapshot here. Anything anyone else wants to add.

888
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:09.809
Lilliana Robinson: Alright. Well, thank you.

889
01:37:09.810 --> 01:37:10.390
Sezer: Thank you.

890
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:16.820
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, super quick. And then I think we'll be able to end on time is agent linear.

891
01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:34.119
Lilliana Robinson: hey? Everyone. Hi, guys, we're really sorry we can't be there. We're about to jump into our jobs to be done interview, but just wanted to share a brief presentation about how we're thinking about our levers. So Dominique and I have had a bit of a discussion. We've had an opportunity to flick through some of this book.

892
01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:59.070
Lilliana Robinson: and one of the key takeaways from it was that we see that our inputs are really a key measure of effort. So a couple of examples from the book were the number of lines of code written or average response times for customers. So we've taken a little bit of inspiration from the book to create our 3 levers and then inputs, and we've put some thought around that which I'll hand over to Dominique to walk through. Exactly. Thank you. So there's 3 different levers that we are thinking about. But first, st before we talk about input, we've zoomed out

893
01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:12.800
Lilliana Robinson: and thought about well, what 3 areas are really key for us as a business and where we're at in our journey. And those 3 areas are one market penetration, 2 market development and 3 product development. So I'll briefly walk you through those 3 levers. Now explain to you what the input is and the rationale behind that, and why we're very excited to measure it.

894
01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:35.309
Lilliana Robinson: So the 1st one is all about market penetration. So specifically, the input that we are going to measure as a result of our efforts is number of sales meetings conducted. You can think of this as Demos. There's various rationale behind this. But to give you one example, this is really going to help us to optimize our funnel, and, importantly, that marketing to sales conversion. So we can really start to get in front of the customer, get our product in front of the customer, and in terms of how we would turn that into a growth lever. One idea that we've had is

895
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:45.260
Lilliana Robinson: pre-recording our Demos and eventually moving these onto the website we found in the past that this really helps to improve impound. Mql, so marketing qualified leads. And so this is something that we'd really like to focus on as we scale

896
01:38:45.310 --> 01:39:05.099
Lilliana Robinson: moving on to the second lever. This is all about market development. And specifically, we want to focus on the number of emails that we send in terms of direct outreach. One of the rationales is really, this is going to help us understand this channel as part of our acquisition strategy and importantly evaluate our Roi things we're going to be focusing on are a B testing and really building triggered email sequences at specific time intervals and again helping to move users down the funnel.

897
01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:24.590
Lilliana Robinson: I have 30 seconds left. Lever 3 is all about product development. Specifically, we're going to focus on user feedback implemented the rationale is that we're really early stage in our product. So we want to improve this as quickly as we can to have that competitive edge and also really focus on launching beta groups. So we can gather actionable feedback. And before a widespread release we're out of time. We're excited to catch up with you all and welcome any feedback offline. Thanks, guys. Thank you.

898
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:26.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. That was impressive.

899
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:34.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's really good, right? It was a good way to bring it home, you know all the point we were trying to make. And then Angel Luner clearly understood the assignment.

900
01:39:34.330 --> 01:39:34.960
Lilliana Robinson: I.

901
01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:35.400
Florence Ettlin: First.st

902
01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

903
01:39:37.870 --> 01:40:00.739
Lilliana Robinson: So they're gonna watch this recording back. I don't know if anyone has any feedback for them that you wanted to quickly say. But we're at time, so just throw it in the chat. We'll give Agent Lunar direct feedback via Boxer. But this was great. I hope that you guys all understand, and some of you do need to do some tweaks. But most of you overall really understood it. So tomorrow we're going to bring this home with Kpis. 1st thing

904
01:40:01.130 --> 01:40:10.370
Lilliana Robinson: we'll see you. Then, if you have any, follow up questions or anything like that, just send us a box here. But overall this was great. I hope that you guys feel like you have a really good grasp on your lovers.

905
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.650
Lilliana Robinson: Alright. See you later.
