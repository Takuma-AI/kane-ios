1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So. But, David.

3
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:14.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I thought we had run into a landmine, and that you weren't able to do this actual. Make this business happen this way, or have you worked around that.

4
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.879
David Akinyemi: So we've been able to find a potential solution which is partnering with companies

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.529
David Akinyemi: and so working with them to change their ruling around edging policies.

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.983
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And what's the motivation for them to want it? So you think you're gonna be able to move forward with this.

7
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.320
David Akinyemi: Correct.

8
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:45.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Awesome. Okay, then, that's great. I couldn't help but thinking about that as you were pitching so what's your objective with this section. Tell me what order you're going to go with the 3 sections. And what's your objection? Objective for each one.

9
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.850
David Akinyemi: And so traditional order. So the pitch followed by the demo and then QA.

10
00:00:52.179 --> 00:01:04.260
David Akinyemi: And then with this section, we want to use this section to share my story lightly, educate people on like the problem around stock based compensation and the overall risk and then briefly show investors like the market potential.

11
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So I want to peel that back a little bit. We gotta get more focused on the objective.

12
00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:26.377
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So don't take this personally, but I'll say it to everybody. Nobody cares about your personal story until they understand what the business is, and should they care about it like relative to the business.

13
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:40.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think, explaining the the problem is a good one. And I do like that. You make it personal, like your your emotion there with like, yeah, baby, I made it that like that was awesome. That's really really good.

14
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: explaining the problem

15
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:53.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then showing the size of yep, I think that's good, overall. Your delivery was good. Do you know, we don't know what the timing was?

16
00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:54.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's.

17
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.660
David Akinyemi: I think it's over. It's over by a lot. And so that's something.

18
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You had said that, so you gotta cut it down. The other thing I would do is I would simplify at the end. I wouldn't give away.

19
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I wouldn't.

20
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You are packaging up insurance

21
00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:19.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for these employees. How you're actually deciding to hedge the insurance with put options and stuff. That's your issue that's inside a black box.

22
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I would rephrase that and not talk about complicated stock trading

23
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: strategies. But I would say we're offering insurance

24
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for the customer or for the employee, so that if their stock does go down

25
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.059
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the value of it won't

26
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know our.

27
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:49.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and that you gotta figure out how to say it, but I'd make it simple that we ensure that there's a limit to, you know they can. They can buy insurance at various prices that their stock won't go below.

28
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:59.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then you're imply, and people will figure out that you're hedging. But I would make it simple like they're they're not. They're not waking up, saying, I want to do complicated trading strategies.

29
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The job to be done for them is, I don't want the value of my compensation to go down.

30
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So in general, I think your arc is pretty good. But and then what are you going to do with the video? What's your objective with the video.

31
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.960
David Akinyemi: Yes. So

32
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.829
David Akinyemi: again, some more education on, like the risk associated with stock based compensation

33
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.000
David Akinyemi: by like a 2 by 2 comparison. And so, or one by one comparison to one person who use the platform.

34
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.920
David Akinyemi: our platform, one person that that doesn't, and then using that to also show, like

35
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.030
David Akinyemi: what touch does and how it can help users with this problem.

36
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.669
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, so I would.

37
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So you're telling me what you're doing. I want to know what the objective is. My objective is for investors to walk away thinking.

38
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: this is a unique problem. My objective is for investors to see

39
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: how simple our solution is. I want them to understand how big the market is like.

40
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: what is the objective? What is success with your video? If the invent, if the people in the audience understand.

41
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.540
David Akinyemi: I think it's understanding what Tux does and how it helps users.

42
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Didn't we cover that in the in the pitch?

43
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The the pitch was about what Tux does and how it impacts users because you were talking about your personal journey. The stock went down 40.

44
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.660
David Akinyemi: Yeah.

45
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:34.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right? So typically it would be something like, make it feel, make Demo the product so that they realize it's real. I don't think you're quite there yet.

46
00:04:35.114 --> 00:04:41.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Maybe show them, you know. Maybe you want to communicate the economics of how it works under the hood.

47
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Maybe you want, but you want to have a really clear.

48
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:55.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: really clear objective now, maybe because your pitch is so long, you're gonna have to shorten your pitch. You're not going to be able to accomplish everything in it. And you're gonna have to accomplish some of it in the video.

49
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.040
David Akinyemi: Yeah.

50
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right.

51
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But

52
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you're gonna you're gonna have to figure this out.

53
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.360
David Akinyemi: Definitely.

54
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright!

55
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.360
David Akinyemi: Thanks. Troy.

56
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right. Who's next?

57
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.940
Ciera Cravens: We have gift, Graham. So Kevin and Marissa.

58
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let's do it.

59
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's been at least 30 min since I've talked to them

60
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: this.

61
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.630
Kevin: Nice to see you again. Troy.

62
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.729
Kevin: Okay. So here we go.

63
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.500
Kevin: Okay.

64
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.509
Kevin: So I want all of you to take a second.

65
00:05:28.914 --> 00:05:30.129
Ciera Cravens: Sec. Objective. First.

66
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.299
Kevin: Oh! So!

67
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What are the? What order are you doing? The 3 parts? And what's the objective for each one.

68
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.740
Kevin: So it's gonna be gonna be pitch.

69
00:05:38.793 --> 00:05:40.640
Kevin: Video, FAQ,

70
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.380
Kevin: the objective for the pitch

71
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.170
Kevin: is to

72
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.930
Kevin: state the problem how we relate to that actual problem.

73
00:05:49.657 --> 00:05:55.899
Kevin: The objective for the video is to provide the value proposition to the customer and the restaurant

74
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:05.240
Kevin: and the FAQ is to address underlining questions about the technology that we're using metrics and the size of the market.

75
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay? And you meant consumer cause. Your customer is actually the restaurant right?

76
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.249
Kevin: True. Yes, patron, patron and restaurant. Yeah.

77
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.016
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Patron and restaurant. Yep, awesome.

78
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.280
Kevin: Pick.

79
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:28.030
Kevin: So I want all of you to take a second to think of a favorite restaurant that close that you loved, and why you loved it

80
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.409
Kevin: with less than 5% profit margins. It's not uncommon that our favorite spots will close

81
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.860
Kevin: 4 out of 5 restaurants close in 5 years

82
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.929
Kevin: sadly. That's not a very high success rate.

83
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.930
Kevin: I'm Kevin Malley, and I'm CEO of Gift Graham.

84
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.909
Kevin: If Graham started as a digital gift card platform to help restaurants increase their profit margins.

85
00:06:49.920 --> 00:07:01.970
Kevin: But what what? I and my co-founder, Maricell, who's managed restaurants for over a decade discovered, was like other loyalty and reward programs digital gift. Cards do not provide restaurants with what they need most

86
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.290
Kevin: a way to bring back their customers.

87
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.729
Kevin: And how do you do that

88
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.360
Kevin: by identifying them to understand their likes and their dislikes.

89
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.650
Kevin: At Giftgram. We know that we're all different.

90
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.079
Kevin: What works for you may not work for somebody else.

91
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:27.159
Kevin: and that's why we're empowering restaurants with the first AI generated web 3 platform that helps restaurants better understand and identify their customers upon entry

92
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.089
Kevin: so they can provide unique benefits and memorable experiences that bring them back.

93
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.690
Kevin: We're not your generic loyalty program.

94
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, you're a little long there. It was about what 1 15.

95
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.416
Kevin: Yeah, I need to pick up the

96
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:52.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, well, don't just rush it, though. What you did. Well, your your pacing was good. So one of the things. So we just did this session with the other group earlier today.

97
00:07:52.700 --> 00:08:03.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And a bunch of people their answer to I'm too long was, I'm just gonna talk really fast. And then you won't understand a word that I'm going to say, and it's going to be really boring, because I'm going to talk in the same tone all the time and same pacing, and it's really horrible to listen to.

98
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right?

99
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:13.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You did a nice job with your pacing. It sounded conversational. It sounded natural, that's all great. You just have to figure out how to cut out some words to make it fit

100
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And

101
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know that I loved the opening

102
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you opened with something negative. Think of your favorite restaurant that closed.

103
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: huh?

104
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Like, can we do it? Is there a way to flip this

105
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to make it

106
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: positive

107
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:44.589
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like, maybe. Think of the fate you know. Think of your favorite restaurant that you love to go to time and time again.

108
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Why was it different?

109
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:53.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What made it ha like? Is there some way to make it a positive? We bring that magic

110
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: on a customized basis to every restaurant?

111
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I just. I'd rather see you focus on the positive than the negative

112
00:09:05.636 --> 00:09:10.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and you're gonna have to rewrite a bunch of it, anyway, because you're gonna have to cut out

113
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.846
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: a bunch.

114
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:13.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but

115
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.136
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: yeah, Nelson wrote a comment about the bar and cheers.

116
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so yeah, in cheers where everybody knows your name. That was the tagline right?

117
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.019
Kevin: Yes. Yes. Yeah.

118
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:27.895
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And

119
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know. So imagine.

120
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.509
Kevin: We actually call our AI platform norm. So.

121
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Norm, that's awesome. Hey, norm? So

122
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Because you do that, maybe you

123
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:51.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: literally start out with something about you know many of you in the audience may remember the sitcom cheers where everybody knows your name.

124
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Could you picture Norm

125
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:59.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: ever going to a bar that wasn't run by Sam, it had never happened.

126
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Why? Because of the relationship.

127
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Those relationships are really hard to build.

128
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But with our AI engine

129
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:20.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: we have the ability to give the restaurant owner an unfair advantage to know their customer, to understand them and provide each of them the unique thing that will make them feel like they're at home.

130
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.669
Kevin: That's awesome.

131
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right.

132
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:34.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And maybe you play up the cheers thing. And then maybe in your video, you actually, you know, have a cut from the opening of cheers or something, and you I don't know. I mean

133
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I love chairs. When I was in college we watched

134
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.831
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that every Thursday night. But but anyway,

135
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so and then.

136
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.740
Kevin: The others.

137
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The other thing I would I would recommend.

138
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and is that at the end of your pitch

139
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that you do something to tee up the video.

140
00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:03.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So now take a look at you know. See how easy it is to be a restaurant. Or, again, we got to decide what the objective of the video is and tee up

141
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:11.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: something along the lines of that objective. So you know, see how easy it is to be a restaurant. See how easy it is to increase profitability in a restaurant.

142
00:11:12.189 --> 00:11:16.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Watch as we build those relationships, whatever it is.

143
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but prepare them mentally. They only have a minute

144
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: of the video. So you want to prepare. Put them in the mindset of what they're looking for, so that they will see it

145
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right?

146
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yep.

147
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: yeah, alright.

148
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Who's next.

149
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.000
Ciera Cravens: Awesome. So we have Danny next?

150
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.090
Ciera Cravens: yeah, what is? Did you have a you had a name change right?

151
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.059
Danny Pereira: Yeah. Awesome part of technically is next. But I'm this one. I'm happy to go. Just didn't wanna.

152
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.639
Ciera Cravens: Oh, I think in the chat it says that, Dennis, you're you got it so.

153
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.759
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: It's okay. You can go, Danny. I've gotta go grab something really quick, and then I can go right after you.

154
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.380
Ciera Cravens: Perfect.

155
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.789
Danny Pereira: Can you guys hear me? Or do you guys hear that fan in the background.

156
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We hear you fine.

157
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.470
Danny Pereira: Steph.

158
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.390
Danny Pereira: So my co-founder, and saw Helen.

159
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.450
Ciera Cravens: Objective.

160
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Time out

161
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: what order and objective for each of the 3.

162
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.390
Danny Pereira: Yeah, so the order is intro than the video.

163
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

164
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:31.829
Danny Pereira: And then the 3 things that we're trying to get out of this are we're trying to get the people in the audience to feel like they can't live without this. We want them to feel excited about using us in their day to day lives and possible angels.

165
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:37.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what is the goal? What is the objective of the 1 min pitch.

166
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:44.499
Danny Pereira: Oh, sorry, to introduce the problem, to show how we solve it and to tee up the video.

167
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Kay.

168
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and you're gonna show how you solve it with your words.

169
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You're not using that. The video to show how you solve it.

170
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.709
Danny Pereira: No, we are. We're

171
00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.079
Danny Pereira: yeah. Maybe I don't have to. Yeah, you're making me realize maybe I don't have to put anything in here

172
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.240
Danny Pereira: about that.

173
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's really your life will get much easier for all of you if you have a very clear objective for each

174
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: section.

175
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because then you can focus on it, you can nail it. You can be like, okay.

176
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.249
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the the pitch is all about in this case. Maybe it's all about teeing up the problem.

177
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then you've got them curious.

178
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The video shows them the solution.

179
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:33.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Then the you know the QA. Might be to, to, you know. Talk about how we actually implement and deliver it. I made that up. I don't know if that's right.

180
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but that's the sort of thing that allows you to really focus on each section

181
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and have it tight.

182
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Got it?

183
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what's the objective for the pitch, Danny.

184
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.310
Danny Pereira: The objective.

185
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:57.450
Danny Pereira: Well, what I just said was, but now I'm realizing I need to modulate it to not be so much about showing the problem in the solution, and more so about like the lifestyle that I think it would bring about.

186
00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:04.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So the objective is to show the lifestyle. It will bring about.

187
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.809
Danny Pereira: Like using our software will provide for you or like.

188
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.319
Danny Pereira: I guess that's also what I'm trying to do in the video. I'm realizing.

189
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So at some point, you have to identify what problem you're solving.

190
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right?

191
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:28.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. If you have something written up, let's let's take it. But you you're gonna start hopefully. Everybody is seeing how like, oh, crap! If I don't have a clear objective.

192
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I can't tell the story

193
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:42.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? You're gonna end up wandering, using extra words being mishmash. So it's real. It is really important that you have a clear objective for each section. But let's see what you got. Let's take it away.

194
00:14:44.960 --> 00:15:01.399
Danny Pereira: My co-founder saw Hill and I grew up as band kids as French horn players. It always fascinated us. How so many different instruments combined into one symphony. But why am I telling you about our band days? Well, much like a band or work? Life is run with a bunch of different instruments that we call apps platforms and services.

195
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:18.619
Danny Pereira: The issue is, bands have a conductor to keep them running smoothly. Knowledge workers don't knowledge workers are overwhelmed trying to fit a million different notifications, meetings, and requests with no clear path through the mass. It's not surprising that the average knowledge worker spends about an entire day of the week on busy work, like finding documents.

196
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.250
Danny Pereira: Thankfully, this is what AI was made to solve.

197
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:46.340
Danny Pereira: That's why we're introducing conductor an OS. Created to intelligently manage the inflow of all your communications and automates problem solving to a couple of clicks with one simple keyboard shortcut, you can interact with conductor offload tasks, recall information, and not only surface insights, but act on them as time goes on. We learn from your habits, and do a better job of predicting your needs and tailoring our actions, our go to market borrows from tried and true playbooks like slack and base camp.

198
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.860
Danny Pereira: We're going to make our end users fall in love with us first, and then turn them into evangelists. As we develop conductive for teams.

199
00:15:51.860 --> 00:16:04.190
Danny Pereira: we believe this is the future of work which will be standard within the next 5 years, rendering a world or AI agents can work for us. All they need is the proper context and control. Our vision is to facilitate a world where most problems can be solved with one click.

200
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:11.119
Danny Pereira: instead of combing through a million different apps and AI agent platforms. Just communicate with your conductor, and let us do the busy work for you.

201
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That sounded really long. How was it?

202
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright? A minute, 26.

203
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So that was long

204
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: interesting.

205
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I like the band analogy.

206
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I didn't think I was going to at first when you opened up with it, but I like the conductor analogy, and the name conductor is great

207
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:44.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: somewhere. You have to get in the word cacophony just because it's such a fun word that you know. Without us your your apps are just a cacophony, something like that that would be awesome, memorable, right?

208
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:52.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's only been a couple of weeks since I've talked to you, but I don't know. I have no idea how this thing works.

209
00:16:52.963 --> 00:17:00.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Is this sort of like, you know, way back in the day of instant messenger and and the various messengers, there were some

210
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:14.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: master messengers where you could get all of your like, your Aol messenger and your other messengers in, and one little window, so you could you could communicate on multiple channels and not care what channel it is. Is it sort of like that. But on steroids.

211
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:36.589
Danny Pereira: Kind of yeah, but on steroids. So it's like all your comms and data. So if you were to send be like Dan, email, me, Daniel, send me this document, or something, or like when was it? Instead of having to like respond to you? It'll automatically like, pull this document from my computer or the ask, and I just have to click like send. And then it'll just automatically route it to you. I mean, that applies for a variety of different actions, and requests.

212
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So you're gonna try to be

213
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:45.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: just as email has clients. So like, I use an email client for email.

214
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you're gonna try to be a client that can tap into email.

215
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: text, chat.

216
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: slack, etc.

217
00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.560
Danny Pereira: Correct.

218
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, so I don't. That's great.

219
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't think you're gonna be.

220
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:04.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: My data is old. But I had a company that was trying to do this, and they were trying to tap into

221
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Apple's texting, and they could not.

222
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know if you've looked into that yet.

223
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:29.760
Danny Pereira: That's the one thing that we're struggling with. The only way we can do it right now is by scraping their computer on imessage, which we can do. But there's limitations to it. So that's why we focused it on like work right now, versus like that life aspect. Given that, most people at work are living off like email, slack teams, things of that nature to execute like work activities.

224
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And can you put a client on the front of slack? I don't know.

225
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I guess you can, because I've seen slack integrations.

226
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.520
Danny Pereira: They have an Ap. They have a pretty robust Api. Yeah.

227
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Kai

228
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: interesting. Alright, you're gonna have to cut out a lot of words. You were also talking way too fast.

229
00:18:47.943 --> 00:18:52.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And you went way too long. So you're gonna have to trim this down. So I said this to the other group.

230
00:18:53.650 --> 00:19:03.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Here's the deal. If your house were on fire right now, and you had just enough time to run in once you know what you would grab right. You grab the things that are not replaceable.

231
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:11.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so you'd grab the you know paper photos of your grandmother or the the memory be things that are not replaceable.

232
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Your pitch is on fire right now, Danny.

233
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you gotta grab like you only have time to grab

234
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:23.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 2 thirds of the things that are in there. What do you grab? And what do you let burn

235
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because you can't do it all.

236
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:32.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so when you look at this pitch and you look at those bullet points that you have for speaking, you're gonna have to let a bunch of them burn.

237
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:49.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And you're gonna just pick what's most important. And I think that's a really good a really good way of thinking about shortening these pitches is like your house is on fire. You can grab 3 things. What is it? Your pitch is on fire. You can only grab so much. What is it

238
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because you got to shorten that up.

239
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.010
Danny Pereira: Yeah.

240
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I.

241
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.550
Danny Pereira: You're not.

242
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:59.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I mean, I think the the message was fairly clear. You just have to get way more concise.

243
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.200
Danny Pereira: You got it.

244
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right.

245
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Who's next?

246
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.220
Ciera Cravens: And so we got pardon next.

247
00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Pardo!

248
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:08.263
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Hey, Troy!

249
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:09.440
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Who are you?

250
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Hello! Very good. So what are your objectives?

251
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:32.874
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Yes, our 3 objectives are the for the 1 min pitch is to present folks with the problem how we're going to solve the problem. And then our demo video is going to show how we're uniquely solving the problem. Really building these new set of tools that don't exist yet, and how they can leverage it to in in a way that solves their problem.

252
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:44.529
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: And then the third for our our the third is actually to raise awareness around that we're open towards potential partnerships, and then, of course,

253
00:20:45.254 --> 00:20:48.599
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: contributing towards our raise so that we can grow our team.

254
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:50.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Tay.

255
00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:51.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright!

256
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let's hear the pitch.

257
00:20:53.580 --> 00:21:01.810
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Yup. So I myself several times over the weekend on the pitch. So I am 25 s over, and I'm working on bringing it down. But this is what I've got so far.

258
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So when you're 25 s over.

259
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:15.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I mean you'll go ahead and do it now. But if you were at that pace like you literally have to do the house on fire exercise and be like, what the hell am I gonna let burn and just let it go.

260
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: guys, is

261
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you? You're not going to get there by removing a word. You're not going to get there by removing us, you know.

262
00:21:22.108 --> 00:21:24.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: speaking faster. Alright! Let's hear it.

263
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.049
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: I think it's mostly because I pause in between. But yeah, I'll just get get this going.

264
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You don't have 25 s of pauses.

265
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:51.750
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Yeah, yeah, so it starts off with the the combined trading volume generated by the global stocks futures and for its markets is over one trillion dollars daily. The technical analysis and trading software market, which are the collections of tools that help with making sense of the billions of data points

266
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.100
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: so that you can issue a trade.

267
00:21:54.270 --> 00:22:00.200
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: It's expected this market's expected to grow by more than 100 billion over the next 5 years alone.

268
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:11.110
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: That's the market. We're targeting. Why? Because, after hearing from over 50 traders and investors, we realize that even the most advanced tools still far too complex

269
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.589
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: leading opportunities obscured by complexity.

270
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:25.440
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: This is the problem we're solving at Trinium labs. And we're starting with Trinium AI, where less than a dozen of our technical indicators behind the scenes perform the work of over 100

271
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:36.809
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: and and our AI, which is trained in all these tools, knows how they work and interpret all this complexity and helps you understand it. But genuine investment opportunities presenting itself.

272
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:46.459
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Our mission is in making it effortless for anyone to seize opportunities across all markets. The very same opportunities that were previously obscured by complexity.

273
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:54.499
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: And then that's where I see it off to towards the video, and it will like show them visually how these tools work on their behalf.

274
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, I feel like there is a simpler path.

275
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: alright! Let me try to hit a couple of things.

276
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What if you opened up by just saying

277
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: one trillion dollars a day.

278
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's how much

279
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:27.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the value of stock securities that are traded today equals one trillion dollars a day creating billions of data points.

280
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And even this, even the smartest traders don't know what to do with all that data

281
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: at trillium labs

282
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: at Trinium labs. We've taken all of that data.

283
00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: put it into

284
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:49.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: an AI engine that knows how to interpret it, knows how to present it to you simply and in a way that you can understand

285
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: whether you are an experienced trader

286
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or a

287
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know. 16 year old, Wannabe.

288
00:23:57.208 --> 00:24:03.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you can. You can understand dictators and what they mean and what you don't understand. You can ask it

289
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: simple English language, and it'll respond in English.

290
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:13.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We're taking the complexity out of trading to make traders more profitable. Let me show you how it works.

291
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.589
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Got it. That's actually

292
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:23.029
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: really great. This is recorded right? So I wasn't able to jot jot it all down. But.

293
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: No, no, no, it's it's being recorded for just that reason. So I think that I mean.

294
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:43.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm biased because I just came up with it, but I think that structure is pretty good, and you'll if you take that apart, and you know Wordsmith it and make it better. I feel like you can. I think I was about 60 Si didn't feel much longer than 60, so I think that you can. I think you'll be able to get that to 60 s.

295
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.970
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Awesome.

296
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:51.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But what I liked about it. I like the opening, and I just tweaked your. I just played on your opening

297
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:52.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right?

298
00:24:55.235 --> 00:24:59.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: where you taught that. But the fact that a trillion dollars a day is traded

299
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:06.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is just nutty, and then that next step that obviously creates billions of data points.

300
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Who could ever possibly understand all that

301
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:11.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the AI can?

302
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.249
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's kind of cool.

303
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.260
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: That's exactly it. Yep.

304
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Cool.

305
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's all right.

306
00:25:22.043 --> 00:25:23.030
Ciera Cravens: Is next.

307
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right. Let's hear it.

308
00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.510
Ciera Cravens: So that's interesting. Yeah.

309
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.338
Ciera Cravens: Yup. So, Vincent, just go ahead and you can get started and tell us.

310
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Give me the 3. Give me your 3 objectives.

311
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:42.810
Ciera Cravens: Yes. Yeah.

312
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.080
Vincent Lucero: So the objectives for the pitch are we want to explain?

313
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.653
Vincent Lucero: shoot! I just I just lost it. But

314
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.009
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So an objective should not start with. I want to explain

315
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:03.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? Because that's you're trying to evoke something from the listener.

316
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So maybe we want the listener to understand something.

317
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:14.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But but an objective is not. I want to explain. Does that makes it like you have to use the perspective of the listener of the audience

318
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:23.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like, we want the audience to get excited about it. We want them to understand the problem. We want the them to be packed like those are. Those are the kinds of objectives you have.

319
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Does that make sense? Vincent?

320
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:39.820
Vincent Lucero: Yes, I'm realizing that I actually created my narrative arc with the outcomes for my QA. But not for the pitch, the pitch. We don't quite have.

321
00:26:40.639 --> 00:26:41.120
Vincent Lucero: Okay.

322
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We can skip.

323
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.959
Vincent Lucero: So I'm gonna skip that part just because I don't wanna waste you guys time. So

324
00:26:45.990 --> 00:27:06.540
Vincent Lucero: what I did do was I followed the stripe methodology. So today lenders deny many more loan applicants than necessary, because they incorrectly believe they cannot lend to the bottom 52% of Americans. Every incorrect loan decision reduces lender revenue, but it actively harms 17 million Americans by making them dependent on 400 Apr payday loans.

325
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:16.200
Vincent Lucero: Predatory loans are all that is left for them. Because banks, human based under ready is incredibly expensive. And according to Federal reserve research, humans aren't even good at assessing complex risk.

326
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:44.910
Vincent Lucero: Our solution combines industry expertise across explainable AI loan decision and debt capital into an integrated solution. To help lenders lend more money more safely to more consumers. The magic is in the models. After being featured by visa for our working. AI, we have letters of intent from the 2 largest credit builder cards in the United States to safely expand on the momentum they've brought to borrowers in the lower credit bands with 1.2 trillion dollars in net interest margin every year. Lenny is the lifeblood of the global economy, and we expect to double it.

327
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:53.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. So I have a fundamental problem with the structure which is in the beginning

328
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: slowly read what you started with the beginning about

329
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the first paragraph.

330
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:07.860
Vincent Lucero: Today lenders deny many more applicants than necessary, because they incorrectly believe they cannot safely lend the bottom. 52% of Americans.

331
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. And then, what's next?

332
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:21.879
Vincent Lucero: And then every incorrect loan decision reduces lender revenue, but it also actively harms the 17 million American borrowers by making them dependent on 400 Apr. Payday loans.

333
00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So this feels to me like this is about the consumer

334
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:27.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: at this point.

335
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:34.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It doesn't feel like you've it feels like the problem is, the consumer is gonna have to go spend the 400 Apr payday loan.

336
00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so

337
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think

338
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I would try to make it more highly targeted on the bank.

339
00:28:44.356 --> 00:28:47.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and and upfront. And so

340
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm gonna make something up. It's not gonna be good.

341
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know.

342
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: everybody understands how banks work.

343
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: They have money that's put on deposit. They pay an interest rate, and then that

344
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:08.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to get that money, and then they lend it out at a higher interest rate to borrowers.

345
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Banks need to create loans to make money.

346
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:21.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yet 52 of all loans are are rejected because the banks don't feel comfortable that they have enough information to safely

347
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: lend that money.

348
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:32.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We have a tool that's going to be better. And then you talk about how your tool is better, so that they can make better decisions, allowing them

349
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to create more loans which allows the bank to make more money.

350
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:45.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And if you have time, you could say, and as an aside, there's a benefit to the consumer. But I would focus on the bank problem

351
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and the bank solution because it gets confusing the way you

352
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: did it last time? I thought it was all about the consumers. Does that make sense.

353
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.579
Vincent Lucero: It does make sense.

354
00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.910
Vincent Lucero: Yeah.

355
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:04.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And I think you were too long. No, you weren't. It looks like you were right at 56, you you also. You did talk really, really fast when you did it.

356
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.781
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: go back and listen to the recording, and you'll see. But

357
00:30:10.363 --> 00:30:14.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: yeah, I would. I would focus on bank problem.

358
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: cool technology that allows them to loan more with confidence.

359
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Banks will make help, you know. Banks will make more money. And.

360
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: by the way, as you know

361
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:38.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: a side benefit is that more consumers will be able to have access to bank loans, enabling them to get money efficiently rather than having to go to payday loans and pay high rates, you know. Pay

362
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: users rates something like that if you have time at the end.

363
00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:47.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But that but that's an aside. Let's see how banks are. Gonna make more money and then shoot. Shoot them over to the video.

364
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.269
Vincent Lucero: Yeah, yeah, we're actually thinking about starting with the video first to set a little bit more of the context around like

365
00:30:54.170 --> 00:31:02.910
Vincent Lucero: breaking apart, we? We know we we've learned the banks don't really care about the message of inclusion right? And only a subset of Vcs care about that message.

366
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:26.229
Vincent Lucero: So the morphine need is really from the consumers that are being taken advantage of describing that in the video with like an a little bit more of an example, and then the pitch leaning into more of the bank narrative, and how we solve for it. So that we have set the context with the video about who the end consumer is, and then flipping it over. But I I I actually do like your feedback, and maybe we should make the pitch more about the the bank need.

367
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:33.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I always want the customer who's paying me to have a real need, the job to be done. So

368
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:38.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I would lead with the bank's need, and how, having more loans, makes the bank more money.

369
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:40.990
Vincent Lucero: Yeah.

370
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.050
Vincent Lucero: yeah.

371
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And, by the way, that'll help you sell, too.

372
00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because

373
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you you gotta get. You gotta get the banks to buy.

374
00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.989
Ciera Cravens: Nice. So we have Malcolm next.

375
00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.642
Malc: Hey, everyone, hey, Troy? Good to see you again.

376
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:06.740
Malc: Cool. Order is pitch video than QA

377
00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:27.083
Malc: objective for the pitch is to make the problem feel real objective. For the video is to simply show them how fun and addicting the game play is so fun and immersive, say, and then the third point are the or the QA. Is really to dig a little bit deeper into kind of size market, and and like plan the points around the opportunity. Essentially. So get people excited around the opportunity.

378
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.050
Malc: Alright, okay.

379
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:36.240
Malc: in 2019 retail options traders accounted for roughly 25% of daily trading volume

380
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:52.619
Malc: fast forward to 2023, and this numbers doubled. We can attribute Robinhood and and stock lending platforms for making it easier, making more accessible. But the irony here is that retail traders are losing money faster than ever, 350,000 per day, to be exact.

381
00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:57.369
Malc: Now, some of you might say these folks don't have a clue. What they're doing. That's part of the issue.

382
00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:11.730
Malc: The reality here is that these traders think they're investing, but they're really just speculating. And to make matters worse, they're competing against the wrong component. Sorry opponent. Let's change that. I'm Malcolm SEO. Wage wages. The proving ground for novice traders.

383
00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:17.780
Malc: We allow it to be a more level and even playing field, allowing traders to refine their strategies and find their edge.

384
00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.080
Malc: Let's wage.

385
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.940
Malc: That's my transition to the video.

386
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then the video is gonna show how it actually works. And then.

387
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:36.580
Malc: My video. Yeah, I skipped a few sections, but that was a that was a rough gist. And so the video comes in splits in with the start of 2 folks. Day goes ahead to head kind of scenario and shows the game played throughout the day.

388
00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:47.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I think so. You're only 48 s. You have a little more time, and so you could use that to set tee up the fact that this is a game.

389
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.550
Malc: And then.

390
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:51.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: This is an opportunity to, you know.

391
00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Challenge your friends, show off your expertise.

392
00:33:55.783 --> 00:33:56.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You know.

393
00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:06.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and and do it in a safe space, where, instead of losing thousands of dollars at a time, you know you're you're betting with your friends $10 at a time. I don't know whatever the like.

394
00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.718
Malc: Yep, you got it. Yep.

395
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.636
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah,

396
00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:15.839
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and and the other piece. And I'm gonna push back on this a little bit. It feels to me. So

397
00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:22.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: with options. And are you really focused on options trading? Or are you focused on

398
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: commodities, trading.

399
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:50.419
Malc: We do. Okay? So so the way it works is, you pick 3 commodities. So you pick a category so you can pick 3 stocks or 3 commodities, and that's your portfolio. The reason I use the reference for options traders is because it's the most high risk. Right? So, and people that are day trading, that more so than stock. So there's more to draw the parallel of that risky decision making. And how we make that we lessen that risk and reduce that. So that was kind of the analogy. But does that get confusing? Is that kind of what I'm hearing.

400
00:34:52.829 --> 00:35:00.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It was a little bit confusing, and then the other pieces that you talked that you said 350,000 lose a day. I didn't know what that meant.

401
00:35:00.279 --> 00:35:15.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Did that mean? 350,000 people traded and added, at loss for that day? But don't you, almost by definition. If you have 700,000 people trading, you're gonna have 350 who lost in 350 who gained right? Like it's. I mean.

402
00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:21.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it may not be totally a 0 sum game if the whole market goes up, but.

403
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:36.619
Malc: Sorry. I'm not sure if I understand your question. What that number was referencing the average amount that retail options traders lose per day. So it's a combined amount. So out of all the retail traders, they lose $350,000 per day. It wasn't reference to the game.

404
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: On average.

405
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:39.040
Malc: On average. Yes.

406
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:43.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Is that of only the losers, or what it was that of

407
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:48.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: everybody who is a retail trader on average, loses $350,000 a day.

408
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:49.590
Malc: The latter. Yeah.

409
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, then.

410
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:55.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: why would anybody retail trade like I?

411
00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:56.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I threw him.

412
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:04.819
Malc: The point I'm making is that they're losing so much money. They don't have another avenue, and so we're allowing you to do is refine that in a lower risk condition by competing head to head against someone.

413
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:06.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah.

414
00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:21.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't believe I don't believe that data point that that the average trader loses 350,000 every single day, because if you were the average trader you'd be losing 2 million dollars a week, and you'd be out of business in a week.

415
00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:25.579
Malc: It's a combined figure, I think that's where we're missing it, I'm saying collectively.

416
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:31.690
Malc: retail options traders lose that collectively. I'm not sure how many there are per day. I just gave you the initial percentage.

417
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.470
Malc: Does that make sense? It's a combined figure. I'm not saying an individual retail trader loses that per day.

418
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:43.065
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay it. The number was confusing either way. So you want to take out confusing numbers.

419
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:44.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: alright

420
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:55.107
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'd love to hear you iterate on this and and help you with it a little further. But

421
00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:01.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: got it. I was hung up on that piece. Yeah, I would just be. I would go tighter.

422
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:08.059
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So you know, if you have a used case, and then I really would love you to tee up the idea of gameplay

423
00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then be able to go to the video and say, let's see how the game is played.

424
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think that would be great.

425
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.349
Malc: Awesome. Appreciate it, Troy. Love it, thank you.

426
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:17.269
Malc: Yep. Who's.

427
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Next.

428
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.760
Ciera Cravens: We have Brian with circle plus.

429
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.715
Brian Simiyu: I try a hardship of a loss today.

430
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.740
Brian Simiyu: so my structure is a default.

431
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:39.449
Brian Simiyu: I will be doing the peach, and then the video. And then the QA purpose of the pitch is to entice.

432
00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:44.719
Brian Simiyu: Purpose of the video is to showcase and the Q. And I'll be validating.

433
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:46.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay. So I'm in the mode.

434
00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:47.100
Brian Simiyu: The.

435
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Were trying to entice me.

436
00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:49.293
Brian Simiyu: Okay.

437
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Entice away.

438
00:37:53.390 --> 00:38:00.459
Brian Simiyu: Oh, we often come across the phrase, know your numbers well, imagine a world where your numbers knew you better than you know them

439
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:06.930
Brian Simiyu: tackle, plus whether you're an investor or an innovator rather than build top down, we help you build bottom up.

440
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.590
Brian Simiyu: Say goodbye to follow up emails and fancy spreadsheets.

441
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:16.299
Brian Simiyu: We are shaping a world where you can anticipate what metrics you should track, visualize, and report.

442
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:22.259
Brian Simiyu: Our platform is a tailor-made command center where you can master the metrics your way.

443
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:29.400
Brian Simiyu: Thanks for the advances in computing. You can now slice and dice your data, or plug and play your integrations in one single click.

444
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.520
Brian Simiyu: We urge you to join us on our journey to fetch the future, if it happens.

445
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:38.030
Brian Simiyu: get investors and innovators in the room case where you should send up to sucker plus

446
00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:38.980
Brian Simiyu: do digging.

447
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.420
Brian Simiyu: but that's me.

448
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:48.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I feel like you use too many vague words, and we're not specific enough.

449
00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:55.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know. I'm curious. You guys all know each other, and you know what he's doing. But did it feel vague?

450
00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm seeing some nods.

451
00:39:00.745 --> 00:39:02.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It didn't feel specific enough.

452
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.230
Brian Simiyu: Let's.

453
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

454
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know. You know what if we did something like.

455
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.803
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know?

456
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:21.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: if investors know one thing, they know their numbers.

457
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Investing is a game of spreadsheets

458
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:30.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and quant, you know, and and and quantifying value. Yet

459
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:37.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: every quarter, every month it's next to impossible to get all those numbers from your portfolio companies.

460
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:45.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: spreadsheets, emails, Google drive, etc. at circle plus. We make it easy.

461
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

462
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Like, I feel like just being much more specific

463
00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: about what you're actually doing.

464
00:39:54.030 --> 00:40:11.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know. So it's circle plus. We make it easy allowing your portfolio companies to connect their data directly to your dashboard, allowing you to have the allowing investors to have the data they need to make more intelligent decisions, to lean into the right companies to report to their lps.

465
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We take the pain out of reporting.

466
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:20.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I like being more specific like that.

467
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.320
Brian Simiyu: Okay.

468
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:24.920
Brian Simiyu: Alright.

469
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.663
Brian Simiyu: Gotcha, thank you for your feedback.

470
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:32.350
Ciera Cravens: Awesome.

471
00:40:32.985 --> 00:40:35.259
Ciera Cravens: So I think we have

472
00:40:35.917 --> 00:40:37.290
Ciera Cravens: tune day. Next?

473
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:39.910
Ciera Cravens: Not yeah. Mistaken.

474
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:48.069
Tunde IO : Quick file. I will go very quickly. Hi, Troy! So the order I'm doing is the the standard order in the

475
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:57.480
Tunde IO : and the pitch. I want to kind of explain the the problem. Because, yeah, explain the problem. The the demo I want.

476
00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:10.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So hang on. I'd said it earlier. You might not have been here. But explaining the problem is from your perspective, I want you to get it from the audience. Perspective. What do you want? The aud. What is your objective for the audience to walk away with.

477
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.290
Tunde IO : I want the audience to understand the pain points.

478
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay. So you want the audience to feel the pain.

479
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.620
Tunde IO : Yes, to feel the pain.

480
00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right. Let's make it more emotional. Feel the pain.

481
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:22.850
Tunde IO : To feel the pain.

482
00:41:23.455 --> 00:41:27.554
Tunde IO : From the pitch. I want the audience to

483
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.300
Tunde IO : Understand.

484
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.620
Tunde IO : products, how we do what we do

485
00:41:33.139 --> 00:41:41.119
Tunde IO : and also hear from our customers to know that we can actually make the we can solve the problem.

486
00:41:41.955 --> 00:41:45.689
Tunde IO : And then the in the QA.

487
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.240
Tunde IO : I'd like to

488
00:41:47.340 --> 00:42:01.799
Tunde IO : cover off the quite. I would like the audience to be able to to. I'll be able to. I like to answer the questions. Let's bring up the questions that everyone would have around. Specific things like, Go to market. Size of the market. And how do we? We scale.

489
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So you wanna sell into their objections. Okay, great.

490
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:05.570
Tunde IO : Except yes.

491
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:10.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. Let's hear the first one. I wanna feel the pain. I'm ready. Give me the pain.

492
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.419
Tunde IO : Over the last 10 years. Digital payments in Africa have grown by over 1,500%.

493
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:24.229
Tunde IO : Now this is largely driven by financial products that are unique to Africa, such as mobile money, Ussd and agency banking.

494
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:35.269
Tunde IO : So what is so unique about these financial products? Well, let's take agency banking as an example. This is just a fancy way of saying you have an individual walking around with a pos machine that acts as a bank.

495
00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.420
Tunde IO : second deposits and facilitating withdrawals.

496
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.760
Tunde IO : Now that's great for financial inclusion in underserved markets.

497
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.819
Tunde IO : but not so much for compliance.

498
00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:50.490
Tunde IO : Africa, UN. Africa's unique financial products have led to unintended consequences with an alarming rise in payment. Fraud.

499
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:56.820
Tunde IO : according to the Financial Action Task Force. Nearly one in 2 Africans has experienced or are vulnerable to payment fraud.

500
00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.869
Tunde IO : Now, that's not just a statistic. I have been a victim of payment fraud

501
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:06.110
Tunde IO : multiple times, and you could say, Bro, come on, how could you get taking more than once.

502
00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:10.270
Tunde IO : But trust me, I've done all I can do. It's the payment system that is failing me.

503
00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:19.700
Tunde IO : My name is Sunday. I am the co-founder and CEO of Reck file, and along with my co-founders in the middle Antoniwa we are building rek, file the gold standard for compliance in Africa.

504
00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:30.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I thought you set it up really nicely.

505
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:35.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Your goal was to feel the pain you said. You've been hit more than once.

506
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:40.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I have no idea how you're solving it, but I guess that's gonna come in the video.

507
00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:45.028
Tunde IO : Yes, correct. I I'd see it up for the video. And then it kind of shows how we do it. It. It's

508
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:50.819
Tunde IO : products I miss a customer journey once they get on boarded, how the system protects them! So it's like a.

509
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: User training window.

510
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.609
Tunde IO : Use the platform.

511
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:57.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And is your customer the consumer? Or is your customer the

512
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the unregulated bank.

513
00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:01.120
Tunde IO : The financial institution. Yeah.

514
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:03.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

515
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:08.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: why aren't you talking about the financial institutions? Pain.

516
00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.491
Tunde IO : That's a good point.

517
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:17.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: They're the ones who have to buy right? They're.

518
00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:17.830
Tunde IO : Correct, so.

519
00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:22.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So if they're the ones who have to buy you, you better be solving a pain for them.

520
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.620
Tunde IO : Yeah.

521
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:29.229
Tunde IO : you make a very good point, I think. We were

522
00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:35.230
Tunde IO : looking to draw more emotion out of more relatable pain.

523
00:44:36.254 --> 00:44:38.609
Tunde IO : But yeah, I see. I see the point.

524
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:50.368
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So. And I get a little confused when you say financial institution, because I don't know. Is it the person who's walking around with the pos and doing the stuff? Or is it like the banks that back them? But

525
00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But I feel like you could make the connection

526
00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in that you can say.

527
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I don't have the right words. But if you said something, you know.

528
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:12.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: mobile transactions in Africa are growing rapidly, it's awesome for inclusion. But there's a ton of fraud. I know it. I've been. I've been a victim of it myself multiple times

529
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:18.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: as a victim of fraud. I have lost trust in the financial institutions that I deal with.

530
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:22.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Those financial institutions have a real problem.

531
00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:31.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So we have taken and you've got you have a great team. Right? You have great resumes. We have an amazing team. If you could.

532
00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:49.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, talk a little bit about the background really quickly. But with our amazing world class team. We've actually put together tools that help those financial institutions gain the trust to consumers growing their deposits, growing their transactions and making them the leaders in a competitive marketplace.

533
00:45:51.370 --> 00:46:04.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I I don't know that those are the right words, but that arc. If you want to start with the pain of the consumer. That's fine, but I feel like you have to get it over to the bank because you're going to talk about how you're selling the banks.

534
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.790
Tunde IO : Yeah, yeah, yeah.

535
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:13.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: If you don't trust a bank, you're not going to put your money there. You're not going to do business with them, and they're going to be out of business really fast.

536
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:23.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and so in the end, maybe your maybe your tagline is we help Banks earn the trust of their consumers. Let me show you how it works.

537
00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:25.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then you go to the video.

538
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:29.410
Tunde IO : Thank you. Troy.

539
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.959
Ciera Cravens: Do we have time for one more superbook.

540
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yep.

541
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.530
Ciera Cravens: Okay, alright. So then we got Burhan.

542
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:44.110
Burhan Syed: Alright. I'll make it super quick standard sort of pitch. And then Video.

543
00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.050
Burhan Syed: cool.

544
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:47.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What's the objective of your pitch?

545
00:46:47.950 --> 00:47:02.279
Burhan Syed: Okay. The initial objective was to really put the people that are listening to me in the shoes of a dentist and feel that pain. But I think I'm gonna start making a new pitch that tells more of a story rather than focuses on that pain point.

546
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what's the objective of the pitch?

547
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:16.000
Burhan Syed: The objective of the pitch is to get people to understand that dental practices are suffering because they don't have automated ways of booking appointments.

548
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So they're missing revenue.

549
00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:20.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

550
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.959
Burhan Syed: Missing revenue, and are inefficient. Yeah.

551
00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:23.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

552
00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.620
Burhan Syed: Alright, I shall go.

553
00:47:26.354 --> 00:47:45.799
Burhan Syed: So the dental industry is suffering. Dental practices are in the business of maximizing the number of appointments at the lowest cost possible, yet they still use the most expensive and manual method of scheduling appointments. A receptionist, in fact, 70% of a receptionist time is spent on the phone scheduling appointments while also juggling in person. Customer service.

554
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:57.399
Burhan Syed: Unsurprisingly, 30% of calls made to a dental practice are missed and the majority are never returned. To make matters worse, practices are extremely short staffed, and receptionists have a very high turnover rate.

555
00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:14.530
Burhan Syed: so put yourself in the shoes of a dentist for a minute. How do you operate a business profitably when your receptionist are overworked? Can't return every call, charge over $30 an hour, and may leave. You can't in the business of maximizing appointments at the lowest cost possible. Dentists are failing.

556
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:26.800
Burhan Syed: That's why we built Rhonda, an AI receptionist for dentists. Rhonda works 24, 7 can take hundreds of calls at a time, integrates with the practices existing technology, and does all this work at a fraction of the cost of the human receptionist.

557
00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:34.780
Burhan Syed: Rhonda never misses a call and is built to maximize revenue. The best part. Nothing changes. The patient still calls the clinic, but this time, Rhonda answers the phone.

558
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:36.990
Burhan Syed: Here's a video of showing around at work.

559
00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:38.730
Burhan Syed: That's the pitch.

560
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I like that one.

561
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I mean you. You did. You told a story, but you made it very clear.

562
00:48:47.406 --> 00:48:50.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The only piece that I don't like is

563
00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that you see, you said in the beginning

564
00:48:54.940 --> 00:49:01.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Dennis are in the business of getting as many patient as many appointments as possible at the lowest cost possible at the lowest cost.

565
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and that kind of made Dennis feel cheap

566
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.725
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and

567
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:13.074
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know I would probably do it a little differently where I would talk about. Oh,

568
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:15.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Dentists.

569
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:25.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Dennis love their craft, and and you know, and helping people with their teeth. What they hate is administration, and the worst of it is scheduling appointments.

570
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:31.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: They literally hire a full time person to do nothing but answer the phones.

571
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.250
Burhan Syed: Yeah.

572
00:49:32.542 --> 00:49:35.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You know we can do a much better job than that.

573
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:44.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then you can tie back to in the end. You can tie back to something like. So this is Rhonda, you know. Let's watch how Rhonda

574
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:49.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: makes more. Dennis, you know, be able to focus on the work that they love, and the

575
00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.669
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: something like that.

576
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:55.530
Burhan Syed: Okay, got it so reframe it. So that sounds less sleazy.

577
00:49:56.010 --> 00:50:04.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, it sounded kind of cheap, Dennis, you said. I think your words were like Dennis, are in business of getting as many appointments as they can as cheaply as possible through as cheaply as possible.

578
00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:05.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It just.

579
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.039
Burhan Syed: Technically, true, okay.

580
00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't, but I don't.

581
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.120
Burhan Syed: I agree with you. I I agree.

582
00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:17.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: See? See what you can do. I mean, it's up to you all of this. I want to be clear. I'm giving you my opinion.

583
00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:22.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And you're gonna get, you know, if yes, 10 people, you get 20 different opinions. So I'm not saying my opinion is right.

584
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:26.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Take from it what's valuable leave on the table. What is it?

585
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:34.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's up to you guys to do something that is authentic to you that you're passionate about, and that you're going to feel really great about when you get up there and pitch it.

586
00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:38.390
Burhan Syed: Right. Thanks. Troy.

587
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Awesome. I will see you all soon.

588
00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:44.720
