### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Mike Rome: they all went through. Sort of this. This illustration that you see on the right, called the process and and basically the takeaway here is like, you know, you hear the stories. You see the valuations of the instacards of pinterest the Airbnb's of the world. But if you really peel back the layers like on how they got started there was a lot of willing things into existence in in the early days, like one of my favorite
- Mike Rome: one of my favorite books is this book called Traction when it comes to figuring out like how do you find channels with growth and good unit economics. They have some really cool frameworks in it. And yeah, I I will share this deck with everyone after. So you guys can just like clink up the links directly. There's a link to the traction book. But really simple framework. For how do you start to finish tasks to find, you know, marketing channels and other types of levers that have scale and and good unit economics. But both really matter.
- Mike Rome: diligence framework. They basically like open, sourced a lot of how they do diligence and how they decide to fund companies. And and they were kind of funding all types of companies at the time. So whether you're consumer company, whether your sas marketplace, whatever

### Key Insights

> "Mike Rome: And so I've been getting requests to like advise. And so basically, at the end of 2021, I decided, hey, like, maybe I'll just, you know, do this thing I've always done, which is, you know, helping grow 7 and 8 figure startups, really at the intersection of of marketing and products. So you know, keeping software startups super simple. I think they tend to grow 3 ways, sales, marketing and product. So I've spent most of my career at the the intersection of of marketing and product. Help them grow."

> "Mike Rome: So yeah, at the end of 2021 january 2022, I launched my own growth studio. It's called moonwater. You guys can check it out if you're interested. Just moonwater dot studio. So I I do the same work I've always done. I've I've worked with a small subset of startups, and I help them grow more predictably, repeatably and defensively,"

> "Mike Rome: okay, enough. Like about me. The more important thing is, I've been doing this for a while. I've made a ton of mistakes and the whole point of the stack is to hopefully like, help. You guys not make some of those mistakes. So that's kind of quick intro on me. I'm gonna talk through like gosh, I don't even remember how many there might be like 12 or 13 principles around growth."

> "Mike Rome: Again, I I tend to work with more post product market fit probably a little later stage than than where some of you are at today. But I've tried to adapt a lot of those learnings and advice around growth to like what were the most important things. When I have done the earlier stage stuff that I wish somebody like told me so I could avoid, you know, some heartache and certainly save some time and stuff like that. So I'm gonna go through those now."

> "Mike Rome: But I think, actually, what's even more important than speed is stamina. There's this really cool Ryan holiday quote, that is not who is the fastest. It's who slows down the least and I think that's that's very true. True for startups. There's too many startups that kind of fizzle out because they burn out. They go too hard when in reality, like, you know. You know."
