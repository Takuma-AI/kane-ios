### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Brent Hasse - Flat: direct to consumer. And this was pre-textars, but still getting into techstars and kind of where we were approaching it. When we got into techstars we were still had the same approach.
- Brent Hasse - Flat: have that self doubt. It's like, Oh, my gosh! Is this working? And someone in the class? That you know when I was with Neil, you know, asked me. It's like, How how did you keep going? And I I didn't have an answer really caught me off guard, because there's those times where you're what you know. Hey? I just need to take a step out and walk around
- Brent Hasse - Flat: I ended up just scrapping. It's kind of like a financial model. Where if you get it from someone else, you think you're you know, it's gonna make life easier. It just doesn't work. You have to do it by yourself, and it takes so much time to actually go and research these people and find out who should talk to and find the warm intros and then, anyway, so went through. This process. Probably had 60 to

### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: This is a a first time Techstar's workshop session. We've never had somebody come and speak in this way. I had the pleasure to see friends in my classroom a few weeks ago. I tell Bob Chicago, and when he kind of gave her story of the journey so far it was I? I totally not right away, I said. We gotta schedule Brett for the final week program."

> "Brent Hasse - Flat: But these small little turns each month. That we took to kind of get to where we're at today and never felt like a massive pivot or anything. So that's where I went to Neil's class. To talk about."

> "Brent Hasse - Flat: and she goes, oh, my God! I've been waiting for this! Let's set up another call. And he was just sitting there like, wait! What the hell was that like this? That was your first call, like you've you've got something here. Turns out if you still never signed distribution channel didn't work, but it helps you to have that kind of support system through that. So we would just really sit there. It takes 30Â min to kind of go through and just get you going. It forces you to do it like, I said, good self accountability for both sides."

> "Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, Brent, there's a pattern here, though, because in addition to this slide, I don't think you have a slide for this, but you have a very similar journey when you were trying to fundraise, which I never."
