### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Kevin Kaspar: was around jobs to be done, which I think you'll probably did in your application process. And then you really dig deep during the program itself. And we went really deep into jobs to be done. So all of our content marketing any like all of our strategy around how we show up with our customers. We literally use the words that they use and jobs to be done. Interviews. So what we're doing now is resonating with them. We actually did pivot during techstars right before we finished
- Kevin Kaspar: yeah. So we actually had no secret. We had some of the alumni help our team grade. Your selection process assignments. We do it every time. So we pick founders who were really strong in certain areas and have them come back and evaluate.
- Kevin Kaspar: it. It was a long process. It was a long process. Yeah. And there was a lot of grading and a lot of time and effort that went into picking hand picking all of you

### Key Insights

> "Kevin Kaspar: yes, this is true. When we joined Neil told us that they never invest in travel, and they never do travel tech specifically unless it's like maybe B to B, there'd be an exception. And so we were exception to the rule. And since going through text search all the things that you're gonna learn. So so useful. One of the most impactful workshops that we did throughout the whole program"

I'm interested in you. Kind of explaining why you wanted to do this workshop. And why that's important. Yeah. So we had a super cohort, which was,"

> "Kevin Kaspar: And so he was like, Jlo, whenever you start program you like, make sure you like, build a Whatsapp channel like, figure out your communication because that's like the thing that made us not as close"

> "Kevin Kaspar: And so I think, like that, having like that intentionality behind, like showing up with your superpowers, and helping each other out and getting each other feedback, and telling each other to shut up every once in a while is important, so that, I think, is like a good tip to remember. I forgot to practice, to prepare you for jail. So with regards to communication"

> "Kevin Kaspar: so much. And then there were other people that were like. Oh, I don't know. I never talked to Neil, and like that's on you. You can box your meal as much as you want. You can box room late in the night. You can Boxer early in the morning. He literally never sleeps. He wakes up at the corner. He works out, doesn't eat, and then just works all day. So"
