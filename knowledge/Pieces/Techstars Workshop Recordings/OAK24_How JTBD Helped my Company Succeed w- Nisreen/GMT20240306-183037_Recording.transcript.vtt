WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Point for this, and then, so you know, I'll be

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:14.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: video offer part of it. I've gotta walk to the Oakland office from where I'm at and like, receive them like furniture, and like supplies and stuff to prepare for all these folks to come through next week.

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm getting all that ready?

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.829
Nisreen Hasib: Where's the Oakland office?

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's do you? I don't know how. Well you know Oakland. But you know Lake Merritt.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.220
yeah.

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:34.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. So it's like downtown Oakland, right like across the way from Lake Merritt. You can like see it. We've got like a nice little group talk and see the lake. It's pretty nice.

8
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.150
Nisreen Hasib: Exactly college location.

9
00:00:38.670 --> 00:01:00.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, yeah, it's a good spot. You know, there's it's it's actually funny, like they're they're gonna learn this in the tour next week, but it used to be a mall like a shopping mall. So it's like a weird place. You have to take this long escalator up when you walk in like, it's pretty but it's really an interesting lots of space. So if you're in the bay, you got a place to work.

10
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:13.590
Nisreen Hasib: Amazing. I mean New York to, I mean, since headquarters are moving to New York, I need there to be like a New York Central office, cause I'm can't be on, and we works and it's not the vibe.

11
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, that's right. So let's see, I am gonna make

12
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sophie and Chloe co-host.

13
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.829
Jeremy Banning: And then I'm gonna PIN the screen or spotlight. You all right. So now you're in the spotlight.

14
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But everyone. Good morning.

15
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Texas. Oakland crew is here, and you're going to meet one of our very best and favorite founders in the 3.

16
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.719
It's my pleasure to introduce her, because

17
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:55.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  Liliana is unfortunately out sick this morning. But that being, said, she and I had a chance to work with Nastreen in our Chicago class. Is that that was a year ago?

18
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.190
Nisreen Hasib: Yeah, it's been a year. Yeah, so

19
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:11.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think the reason we ask the screen to do this. She's done it before, but I think you've made even more progress since, and I think you made some updates to what you presented last time to our Bay Area founders. But

20
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we had so many breakthrough moments in the first half of program, Missrerina and I.

21
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:34.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He was like the number one Boxer champion in the early days she was hit me up every day. He was like, I'm gonna get the staff to be done, stuff down and get it right. And she ended up like changing a lot about her business in real time very quickly, and I think that has started to bear fruit.

22
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we are super grateful for Nasrina. Give us the time and do the prep work required to like help you all out, and then you a hand and

23
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, I hope that. you know, if there's anything more that we can do to support in a screen. I'm sure you'll

24
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: have some time at the end. This ring. Let us know more about the business in any ways. This group can, you know, be supportive to you. So let's welcome the stream.

25
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.400
Nisreen Hasib: Awesome, sweet. Well, one question that I have has program started because, Neil, you mentioned

26
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:17.099
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that folks are going to be checking out the new office next week. So is this week, 0 or week one. This is week negative one.

27
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:26.430
Nisreen Hasib: So you know, we started program 2 weeks early before we do the in person stuff. So they did. Orientation last week, and I did my 3 jobs to be done lectures.

28
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.090
Nisreen Hasib: And then Liliana did her. W. 3 yesterday.

29
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, so you're at the you're the capstone for all of that that content?

30
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:44.680
Nisreen Hasib: Oh, my, gosh, the pressure on okay. Sweet. Awesome. So, guys, I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen.

31
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.770
Nisreen Hasib: 1 s here.

32
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.170
Nisreen Hasib: right?

33
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.340
Nisreen Hasib: Okay, let me know if you can see my screen.

34
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, we can see.

35
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.680
Nisreen Hasib: Sweet. Okay, great.

36
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.180
Nisreen Hasib: So

37
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:17.650
Nisreen Hasib: super excited for you guys to go on this tech start journey. I'm gonna go ahead and start with an overview of me and what I've done before starting my company. Sign off

38
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:33.939
Nisreen Hasib: and then we'll go ahead and dig into the journey that I went through before tech stars during tech stars. And now after tech stars. So you know, for folks who have seen this talk before. This is definitely change quite a bit. I think

39
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.029
Nisreen Hasib: the thing that I really want to offer you all is just how

40
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.689
Nisreen Hasib: jobs to be done.

41
00:04:41.320 --> 00:05:09.169
Nisreen Hasib: It's in as part of your startup journey as part of your founder journey. Because one of the things that I know to be true is that when you are a founder, even if you're a second time founder, you know, like me, it's really easy, you know, to kind of like zone in on one thing, and I think a big thing for me is that there is no silver bullet to making your company get up half legs and potentially take off.

42
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.490
So

43
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.290
Nisreen Hasib: with that. I'm missing.

44
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:22.789
Nisreen Hasib: Before I founded sign off. I was a labored employment attorney, and very much expected to be an attorney for the rest of my career.

45
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:46.460
Nisreen Hasib: But then, very early on determined that that was not something that I wanted to do. So. About 10 years ago I stopped practicing and jump ship to become a product manager and a Chicago based company called Power Notes. I was there for about 3 years. Initially as the first product manager hire, I got the product from 0 to one. And then I took over business development.

46
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:56.980
Nisreen Hasib: The product was an educational and a tech product that was sold into different universities. And we started with 14, and then grew that network to over 200. By the time I left.

47
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:09.529
Nisreen Hasib: After that I moved back to the East coast, where I'd gone to undergrad, and I became the chief operating officer of unbound, which was the first venture backed Sexual Wellness company in the world.

48
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:34.079
Nisreen Hasib: I was there for 4 years, and took it from a subscription box to a true direct consumer company that operated and sold domestically to having an international presence. And then finally, before I started sign off, I was the CEO of another New York based company called Doris Dev with offices in New York and Hong Kong. We did 2 things. We were the company that's responsible for

49
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:53.570
Nisreen Hasib: making a lot of consumer brands that are marketed toward millennials agency. But and also we acquired and incubated software companies as well as different brands, consumer goods, brands. And then the software companies that we acquired and incubated had to do with the supply chain

50
00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.869
Nisreen Hasib: and manufacturing. So I've done a couple of things. Before starting final.

51
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.829
Nisreen Hasib: Some other context. You know, in addition to the stuff that I've done professionally.

52
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:16.549
Nisreen Hasib: I run a lot. I'm a distance runner, and I also read and write a lot. So

53
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.320
Nisreen Hasib: when I

54
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:29.700
Nisreen Hasib: make analogies, you know, whenever I'm talking about just being on this journey of founding or running a company that are probably gonna be some Marathon analogies.

55
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:49.269
Nisreen Hasib: But I think the more important thing for me at least, and how I look at the world it really is by looking for stories that bring people together. Using the stories identify common threads. And then, you know, using imagination to see how we can get from point A to point. B,

56
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.280
okay.

57
00:07:53.890 --> 00:08:03.560
Nisreen Hasib: So I founded sign off. I'm gonna go ahead and take you through the journey of the initial conception of sign off

58
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.090
Nisreen Hasib: what I came to. Text starts with

59
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.650
Nisreen Hasib: what I left Texas with and

60
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:16.409
where I am now. Before I get into that, I do want to give context on where I was when I first started signing up.

61
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:31.210
Nisreen Hasib: So I started my company in September of 2022, and then I got into tech Stars in February of 2023. So the company was really young. It was about 5 months old at that point.

62
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:41.309
Nisreen Hasib: I'm also still a founder. And techstars, was the very first investor into my company outside of friends and family.

63
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.899
Nisreen Hasib: So I wanted to give this context because some of the things that I talked through in this

64
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:58.150
Nisreen Hasib: presentation, they might be more or less applicable, depending on the stage. That your company is in depending on whether you have co-founders.

65
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:07.520
Nisreen Hasib: and of course, you know, depending on, like the specific business goals that you have with your company as you go through the 12 or 13 weeks at tech stars.

66
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:21.389
Nisreen Hasib: So quick overview of what sign off does sign off is in the prop text space were used by architects to hire vetted and qualified general contractors for their client projects.

67
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.539
Nisreen Hasib: So what we do right now is very different from

68
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.909
Nisreen Hasib: where I started.

69
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.140
and

70
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:37.919
Nisreen Hasib: getting to where sign-off is now really required understanding the stories of the people who engaged with

71
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:44.269
Nisreen Hasib: the platform, whether that was directly or indirectly so, it was really incumbent on me.

72
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:54.829
Nisreen Hasib: and this is something that I always said before starting sign off, but I feel it even more now. It is so important for anyone who's building a product

73
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.839
Nisreen Hasib: for anyone or building a company that interacts with the human world, which is all companies

74
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:06.020
Nisreen Hasib: to really understand the stories that drive the people who are interacting with your company.

75
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.020
Nisreen Hasib: So we're gonna go through

76
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:17.390
Nisreen Hasib: about a 2 year, timeline. I'm gonna go ahead and take you through the initial impetus for sign off.

77
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:24.459
Nisreen Hasib: I'm going to take you through the first launch of the product. We're gonna go through the text stars.

78
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.999
Nisreen Hasib: a real launch a loss which stung and then eventually the 0 to one journey.

79
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.640
Nisreen Hasib: Alright. So

80
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:44.540
Nisreen Hasib: january 2022. I was still working outdoor stab as the CEO. For me it was very much a layover job.

81
00:10:44.590 --> 00:11:08.179
Nisreen Hasib: I was in a position where I either wanted to be the CEO of a company that I saw getting enough scale to eventually go public or hit, you know, major acquisition, or you know, I was telling folks. If I think I have a good idea, you know, I'll go ahead and maybe start something, so I did not think that I was going to start anything

82
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:17.720
Nisreen Hasib: but in 2021 I ended up buying house in the Catskills in New York. It was a fixer, upper

83
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.959
Nisreen Hasib: and I was super excited, you know, about the project.

84
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:28.050
Nisreen Hasib: and ended up hiring. You know contractor can work on it. Things went well until things didn't go well.

85
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:40.340
Nisreen Hasib: and the thing that I always say is that you know, when my scary lawyer voice comes out, it's really not good for anyone involved. And unfortunately, in that instance it did come out. Fortunately, the contraction project finished.

86
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.389
Nisreen Hasib: But I think a lot of people were very emotionally exhausted at that point.

87
00:11:45.830 --> 00:12:07.730
Nisreen Hasib: So the specific problem that I experience with this renovation and some of the other renovations that I was doing in the area where that's you know, this contractor would come into the project. They had a particular budget. I had set plans for the renovation. And then, somehow, things would go over budget and over time. And I would always end up in this situation of like.

88
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.630
Nisreen Hasib: he said. She said.

89
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:31.750
Nisreen Hasib: There's like no paper trail, you know, documenting everything that we've agreed on, and the lack of paper trail was particularly egregious. If we were looking at changes to the renovation plans that would go from not just like $500 to $1,000, but maybe like $2,000 to $5,000, because that's a significant amount of money.

90
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.330
Nisreen Hasib: So

91
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:41.730
Nisreen Hasib: I was just like, alright. I need a way to manage my renovations and to keep everything just in one place.

92
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.150
Nisreen Hasib: So

93
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.499
Nisreen Hasib: in September of 2022 ended up building

94
00:12:50.650 --> 00:13:01.289
Nisreen Hasib: an initial platform that did precisely that. And I focus specifically on what are called change orders. So change orders the document that's used in construction to do exactly what it sounds like.

95
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:31.339
Nisreen Hasib: If you know the initial plans call for a particular stamp to be used in the kitchen, and that that needs to be switched out. The best practice is to document this in a document called a change order that the homeowner or other client eventually signs off on. When you get into commercial construction these documents can be a lot more complicated, and they also look like a new contracts, but for residents. Construction, which is what I was focused on, you know, like change orders tended to be pretty simple.

96
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:40.209
Nisreen Hasib: So the reason this is point that I found with general contractors is, you know, they were small businesses. They were not necessarily like technically proficient.

97
00:13:40.370 --> 00:14:08.869
Nisreen Hasib: and a lot of the solutions in the market right required people to kind of be at a computer or download an app in order to generate these paper trails and these change orders. And I came up with a way to create a change order at the click of a button through. You know, text which was, you know, what contractors use on a regular basis. No matter if you tried to get them to email, you, you know, or use some other piece of technology, they would always default to text. I was just like, Okay.

98
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:15.910
Nisreen Hasib: you know, let's let's go ahead. Take advantage of like how they actually communicate and use that to create the paper trail.

99
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.309
Nisreen Hasib: So I start working on this full time in September of 2022,

100
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:37.109
Nisreen Hasib: and then by October, you know, I had people that I knew like architects and general contractors who kind of knew I was working on this project, and they said, You know, like we wanna go ahead and use it. So about 6 weeks after I started building it. I had 40 people who, you know, like

101
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:50.379
Nisreen Hasib: started to use the product which was super exciting. They were using it for free. But you know, like, when you get your first users, that's always like something that's just like, well, this thing is now live and I'm super excited by that.

102
00:14:51.170 --> 00:15:06.470
Nisreen Hasib: So this is just like a quick breakdown of the problem that I identified in the solution that I created with that first iteration of the product and at the time the company was not called sign off, it was called Basel.

103
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:22.019
Nisreen Hasib: so fast forward to February 2023, and I started to charge for this platform, so I got the first customer. They were a contractor in Chicago, and they were paying me 110

104
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.740
dollars per month.

105
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:32.090
Nisreen Hasib: February was also when I got into tech stars and there was certain things that were popping up that I didn't like.

106
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:42.969
Nisreen Hasib: So as a reminder like my very, very first job in tech was at an edtech company that sold an enterprise product to universities.

107
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:59.560
Nisreen Hasib: So one of the things I did not like about my product. And where it was was that the sales cycle was pretty long for $110 per month, right like, you know, that gets to just over a thousand dollars, you know, per year.

108
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.560
And I was just kind of like.

109
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:13.380
Nisreen Hasib: I don't know, like the 20 the 20 days with that very first customer I got like that was someone who is technically proficient. And I saw that sales cycle getting even longer, you know, with people

110
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:27.559
Nisreen Hasib: that were less technically proficient. And I was just like any sales cycle. Why, I'm looking at, you know, like 30 to 40 days has to have enterprise numbers to really justify the time that I'm putting in, and that eventually, like a sales team would put into like selling this product.

111
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.429
But then, like the other thing that disturbed me, was okay. I made the sale.

112
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:40.439
Nisreen Hasib: We have recurring revenue which we love. Rry. Use that to pave the way with investors.

113
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:53.570
Nisreen Hasib: But the second problem that I was seeing was like, Okay, I got the credit card info. Everything's like in stripe. They have their account set up. But then there's like no action taken in the platform after sale.

114
00:16:53.670 --> 00:17:10.059
Nisreen Hasib: The reason why I didn't like that 70% of general contractors in the United States are small businesses, and you know small businesses. When things get tight they get caught. And if you're a subscription service that's used by a small business.

115
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.420
You don't

116
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:32.919
Nisreen Hasib: really want to like not be delivering value from month to month, because that means you're gonna get cut. And if no one's using you. Despite the fact that you know it's like nudging, and you know, doing all the things to try to get them to use this platform. That means you're probably going to get cut when they remember that you're there. So I didn't like that.

117
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.200
Nisreen Hasib: So you know, like, when I kind of look back on that period of time, the

118
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:45.520
Nisreen Hasib: when I look at that initial period from September through the beginning of Texas.

119
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:52.620
Nisreen Hasib: I really think, if that is like the time when I was experiencing main character syndrome, because I've come up with a solution I wanted.

120
00:17:52.770 --> 00:18:06.820
Nisreen Hasib: you know, for my specific problem, and then, like my friends, and like the community, or just like Oh, just remarks like, you know, so cool, but like queries of whether or not that was something that was

121
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:16.159
Nisreen Hasib: sustainable and actually solved a problem that consistently appeared, you know, in my target customer group

122
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.899
Nisreen Hasib: so fast forward into March beginning of tech stars.

123
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:30.969
Nisreen Hasib:  one of the great things about being a super young company is, I had a lot of flexibility, and so

124
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:39.229
Nisreen Hasib: I went in and I remember right before I began techstars. It was during the interview process.

125
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:46.390
Nisreen Hasib:  There was like a point at which, you know I like, did my panel interview, and then, like there was one on one with Neil

126
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:56.959
Nisreen Hasib: and I remember talking to him, and I remember thinking like Screw, I'm just gonna be straight up and honest about like the skill which I wanna hit with like any company

127
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.089
Nisreen Hasib: that I started and like.

128
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:14.109
Nisreen Hasib: I sent him an email, although it's just kind of like, I'm not trying to make millions. I'm trying to make like billions with my company like. And so I'm looking for a strategic partner, IE. Like you and the Techsource team to like help me lay a foundation to get there.

129
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.730
Nisreen Hasib: And so going into textiles

130
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.249
Nisreen Hasib: like there were a couple of things that I know I wanted to do first

131
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:29.039
Nisreen Hasib: was to make sure that I had identified the record problem. Second was to ensure I identified the right

132
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.400
customers.

133
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:37.360
Nisreen Hasib: and then was that I wanted to be sure that I identified the right story line

134
00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:51.079
Nisreen Hasib: for those customers that I was targeting with the solution that I had, and I was really open to the idea that the initial product that I built might be a product I have to throw away

135
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.910
Nisreen Hasib: and for me this was just part of the iterative, you know. Process.

136
00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:10.049
Nisreen Hasib: Did I spend, like, you know, a lot of time building the thing and then distributing the thing. Yes. but if it wasn't going to scale, then it wasn't going to be the thing that I was going to work on. So this is just a quick overview of

137
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:16.459
Nisreen Hasib: how I perceive my customers going into tech stars. And I

138
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:37.019
Nisreen Hasib: felt that I done a really great job doing my homework cause. I felt that I got pretty specific. And they're just like, Okay, I'm selling into general contractors who are in the residential space. They do whole home remodels, 10 or fewer employees. They use some kind of like software to run their business, and they talk together system

139
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:45.779
Nisreen Hasib: to run their businesses. I was just like, Yeah, I know who I'm selling like. right Duh, like, you know, I just need to figure out why they aren't

140
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.400
Nisreen Hasib: taking the faith

141
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:53.800
Nisreen Hasib: and using the product the way that they're supposed to, because I understand them

142
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.770
there.

143
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.810
Nisreen Hasib:  So

144
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:04.490
Nisreen Hasib: again, like going through the Pyxar's program. these are like the kind of 5

145
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:11.509
Nisreen Hasib: steps I identified, and I was very much. You just stuck on step one determine who my customers were.

146
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:17.609
Nisreen Hasib: But then I was just like, you know, let's just maybe assume I don't know who they are.

147
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:26.340
Nisreen Hasib: and, like, you know, really, really question that. So that is, when I started to really dig into jobs be done

148
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.600
Nisreen Hasib: better. So

149
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:35.470
Nisreen Hasib: you know, when I started with like jobs to be done, you do have to start somewhere,

150
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:44.119
Nisreen Hasib: you know like, because there are groups of you have to at least identify initial group of people that you want to sit down and talk with

151
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:57.629
Nisreen Hasib: and so in order to to do that, I decided that I was going to go ahead and start talking with general contractors and homeowners, where the initial, like users of the product that I built.

152
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:08.929
Nisreen Hasib:  But the key thing for me was not necessarily like locking into what I thought they wanted, based off of the initial research that I'd done.

153
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:22.920
Nisreen Hasib: But really, you know, it's here into, like the North Star that I had, or that I have, you know, for my company, and there are like a couple of really important things here. Number one, I want to build a company to massive scale.

154
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.640
Nisreen Hasib: but number 2 and more, and this is even more important. It is really important for me to create

155
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:44.510
Nisreen Hasib: a company that uses. That isn't the mechanism for ensuring. Yeah, as many people as possible have access to safe, secure, and beautiful buildings. That's really like the world that I'm moving toward, that I want to create.

156
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:47.880
Nisreen Hasib: And

157
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:56.250
Nisreen Hasib: as I went through the whole Jtvd process. The thing that became really, really clear to me is that my product was irrelevant.

158
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:03.229
Nisreen Hasib: But the stories that, like people were living and the problems they were experiencing, those those were not

159
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.830
Nisreen Hasib: and

160
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:19.159
Nisreen Hasib: helping to solve helping customers, helping users solve the problems in their lives. They're so many different combinations of like product and services that you can use.

161
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:28.910
Nisreen Hasib: but like figuring out, like the right combination that is repeatable and predictable over time, it really requires, you know, just like deep

162
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.500
Nisreen Hasib: empathy, and like willingness to listen to those those customers.

163
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:39.490
Nisreen Hasib: Alright. So I started by putting steak in the ground

164
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.399
and trying to figure out

165
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:50.660
Nisreen Hasib: what my presumptive customers were experiencing. So I started with my jobs to be done for homeowners.

166
00:23:51.190 --> 00:24:01.400
Nisreen Hasib: So I believe I interviewed about 10 total help learners about the renovations that they did on their house.

167
00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:08.439
Nisreen Hasib: So I found these homeowners on respondent I/O as well as through my network

168
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:13.230
Nisreen Hasib: and I think if you guys have gone through

169
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:25.289
Nisreen Hasib:  Neil's initial Ktb, talk you'll learn a lot about like the work that you do to like. Set up these interviews, and to, you know, conduct their interviews.

170
00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:31.589
Nisreen Hasib: So I took about 2 h with each person. That I was interviewing.

171
00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:39.660
Nisreen Hasib: and I'm a very obsessive person like extraordinarily obsessive. And so I would break down every single interview

172
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:48.780
Nisreen Hasib: like date, the interview time, because I wanted to see if responses were different. If I interviewed people like in the Am. Pm. etc.,

173
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:56.389
Nisreen Hasib: I had transcripts for every single thing, and then, like there were several other like key categories like that. I broke up

174
00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.260
Nisreen Hasib: and broke out in my Jtb breakdown.

175
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.409
Nisreen Hasib: So I use all that information

176
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:10.439
Nisreen Hasib: to start to look for things, you know, across every single one of these users that I was talking with.

177
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.120
Nisreen Hasib: and

178
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:22.699
Nisreen Hasib: there were, you know, like certain things that started, you know, to pop out. And so I, like, you know, have just screenshot some of my my notes here.

179
00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:27.699
Nisreen Hasib:  And one of the things that I like started to notice.

180
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:45.630
Nisreen Hasib: as you know, I was going through my interview transcripts, and, you know, like, you know, pulling out these details and laying them back to back with each other. I'll go back to this in a second. Is that all the people that I was talking to the the homeowners who are running the renovations.

181
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:53.310
Nisreen Hasib: you know for their house. They were all somehow the caretakers of their home.  yes, Neil.

182
00:25:54.290 --> 00:26:07.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: sorry. I just wanted to clarify one thing before you go deeper on this, which is, I think, some of the founders right now are currently struggling through the phase of finding the right people to talk to and actually messaging them to get them to talk to them.

183
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:12.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So respondent. And your network any quick tips on how to overcome having

184
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:22.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like struggles with either getting people to say yes to the conversation, or what's he like? What tactics? Even our best in your experience?

185
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:37.749
Nisreen Hasib: Yeah. So I feel like I, you know. Candidly, I had an easier time than a lot of other folks, because, you know, I was looking for people who owned houses, and I was willing to pay them to talk with me about their renovation experience. And there are a lot of people, you know, who

186
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:43.889
Nisreen Hasib: who have that experience, and you know, like they're willing to sit down for $200,

187
00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:47.670
Nisreen Hasib: you know, to do that. So

188
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.180
like

189
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:58.629
Nisreen Hasib: and then, you know again, with, like the general contractors, I knew there were like small business owners, and like, you know, the $200 like also mental pot.

190
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:23.349
Nisreen Hasib: That being said, you know, like, I think one of the other ways in which I saw you know people in my class be super successful, is like, just have them like, Be super honest and like, say, Hey, I'm thinking of. I'm in the middle of, like, you know, building a platform, a company that solves X problem. Here's why I care about it. And here's why I'm reaching out to you. And it's like a really personal appeal.

191
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:30.779
Nisreen Hasib:  and people are just like super, candid and and super honest. And you know, like I feel like.

192
00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.410
Nisreen Hasib: you know, that was something that that helped, because.

193
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:41.449
Nisreen Hasib: you know, like I think at the end of the day, if you really care about what you're building like. That's that's gonna show. And people are going to want to engage.

194
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Thank you. That was that was perfect. And just to double click on what you just said.

195
00:27:46.180 --> 00:28:01.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think the genuine ask is one of the best, and that's why I've never had to use platforms like respondents, because. I mean, personally speaking, that's what I've always done, and it resonates with a lot of people. So II couldn't agree more and just wanna underline what Missouri just said

196
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so hopefully that resonated with you all, and it makes sense. But thank you.

197
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.830
Nisreen Hasib: I know that there's something going on in the chat, but I actually can't open it right now.

198
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:20.430
Nisreen Hasib: Someone's asking if you paid each respondent $200. Yes.

199
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.760
I don't

200
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.890
Chloe Lannert: love it.

201
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:35.770
Nisreen Hasib: Anything else in the chat right now. For some reason I can't open it. I just want to make sure that's addressed. I'll I'll keep you posted on the

202
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.979
Chloe Lannert: that's it. For now.

203
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:59.040
Nisreen Hasib: sweet. Okay. So going back to these homeowners, I noticed that they were all caretakers right? Of that house in some capacity. So, you know, being a caretaker, that's that's just like a lot of responsibility. And you know, people were getting really amped up and emotional when they were talking through

204
00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.270
Nisreen Hasib: like

205
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:11.180
Nisreen Hasib: what was going on in their lives. And I think one of the examples for me that still stands out with like, you know why this became such a salient marker is because I was talking with

206
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:20.989
Nisreen Hasib: a man who's a dad and at the very beginning of our interview he said, oh, I'm really budget conscious.

207
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:24.059
Nisreen Hasib: And I was just like, Okay, cool.

208
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:34.529
Nisreen Hasib: why don't you go ahead and like, just tell me the story of of your renovation. And so this guy he renovated his kitchen because his

209
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:51.019
Nisreen Hasib: oven broke, and I was just like, Oh, what happened like, you know? How'd your oven break so the oven broke, and he discovered it was broken while he was in the middle of hosting, like a back-to-school gathering, you know, for his daughters.

210
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.260
Nisreen Hasib:  you know, like in September.

211
00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:03.110
Nisreen Hasib: and like one of the things he lingered on. He like bought the house because it had a pool and wanted to have. It's like kids have their like friends coming out with them.

212
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:20.119
Nisreen Hasib: And he also, you know, talk a lot about how like during the summers, his house is always the place where people like gather. and like. He was frustrated about the oven because he had everyone coming over, and he had to feed everyone and take care of them. And he, like specifically used the words, Take care.

213
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:28.199
Nisreen Hasib: And so I was just like, Okay, cool. So for your renovation, did you just replace the oven. which wouldn't have been like.

214
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:33.179
Nisreen Hasib: you know, $5,000 fix, because he said he wanted to like, have a nice oven.

215
00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:38.800
Nisreen Hasib: and you're just like, Hmm, no. I decided that.

216
00:30:39.240 --> 00:31:00.229
Nisreen Hasib: I looked until like just replacing the oven. And I was just like, Okay, alright, so like, tell me about your renovation. Any do. Long story short, this guy who describes himself is like super cost, conscious $125,000 on his kitchen renovation in order to get it to be like the place where people could like gather. And he could like take care of them.

217
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.230
Nisreen Hasib: And so I was just like.

218
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:15.840
Nisreen Hasib: yeah, are people driven by budget? Yes. but like they're driven by, you know, something deeper than that. They're driven by this responsibility that they feel towards taking care of their family and community.

219
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:20.879
Nisreen Hasib: and they're really into creating a space that allows them to do that.

220
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.000
Nisreen Hasib: So

221
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.300
Nisreen Hasib: when

222
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.450
Nisreen Hasib: I took all the data from the interviews that I did.

223
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:38.709
Nisreen Hasib: I overlay a whole bunch of things on each other and came up with this like combined timeline.

224
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:50.409
Nisreen Hasib: So there are 2 things that II pulled out of my timeline. The first was I wanted to understand the window of opportunity. I had to offer some sort of like solution

225
00:31:50.800 --> 00:32:03.509
Nisreen Hasib: to the people who are on this renovation journey to the homeowners who are on the renovation journey. And then I wanted to like capture, however, and perfectly, you know, like what job I thought we were helping them to do

226
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:20.510
Nisreen Hasib: so. The job statement that I came up with and this has changed over time. But at that point in my research it was when I invest my money and time into a renovation. It is because I need my house to see the functional requirements of

227
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.559
Nisreen Hasib: my to serve the functional requirements of myself and my family members.

228
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:40.969
Nisreen Hasib: as individuals and as a group. And because I want my house to reflect the aesthetic preferences of me and my family, so I can be confident I have provided for my family's previously unmet needs, and I'm able to nurture and care for my family in a beautiful haven.

229
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.510
Nisreen Hasib: So these are like the things that we're jumping out to be

230
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:58.680
Nisreen Hasib: so like big things for homeowners their time, because if they're the person who's responsible for their family, they don't have a lot of it. They feel huge amount of responsibility.

231
00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:14.769
Nisreen Hasib: and because they're in the process of taking care of so many people, it was really important for them to have their home be a haven. So the reason why this was important is because the other thing that popped out is the people who have good relationships with their contractors

232
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:33.489
Nisreen Hasib: felt as if their contractors understood all those things like instances in which, you know people displayed residents with their contractors is when they were just like Oh, the contractor really respected my time. Oh, the contractor also had kids like there was a way in which that contractor was able to relate.

233
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:46.480
Nisreen Hasib: And that relationship on a personal level between a homeowner and contractor, a lot allowed for a lot more give in that relationship such that even if there were significant changes in question and timeline

234
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:56.499
Nisreen Hasib: always a lot more easily, you know, forgiven, because there was a sense that the contractor understood the homeowner's place as a caretaker of the family.

235
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:09.299
Nisreen Hasib: And so what these contractors were doing right was, you know, kind of instinctively demonstrating that they understood the vision that the homeowners had, you know, for

236
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.679
Nisreen Hasib: their home.

237
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:24.380
Nisreen Hasib: And you know, like, what's interesting is that even when I think about you know my own renovation, you know, like, when I started renovating houses from like the house I lived in. It was really important for me to create like

238
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.960
Nisreen Hasib: that haven.

239
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.619
Nisreen Hasib: And I actually now remember getting really ticked at my contractor when he seemed to be like really dismissive of.

240
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:34.859
Nisreen Hasib: you know, like

241
00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:45.379
Nisreen Hasib: my ability to take care, you know, like up the budget and timeline, because I was heading, you know that up, for, like my family unit that was going to live in that that house.

242
00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:48.629
Nisreen Hasib: So it was interesting to see how that resonated with me as well.

243
00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:56.809
Nisreen Hasib: Alright, so I did not just do these interviews with

244
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:02.670
Nisreen Hasib: homeowners. The next group that I interviewed were general contractors.

245
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:11.800
Nisreen Hasib: and, you know, like, went through a similar process to like draw out the job statement for them as well as like the windows of opportunity

246
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:18.959
Nisreen Hasib: I'm not going to get into, you know all of that. But eventually I got to a place where, you know, I became pretty clear

247
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.740
Nisreen Hasib: that one the thing that I could help people

248
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:28.599
Nisreen Hasib: do and like make progress with is match. Their project needs

249
00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.150
Nisreen Hasib: with the right

250
00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:34.080
Nisreen Hasib: doer, the right builder for

251
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.450
Nisreen Hasib: their renovation or new build.

252
00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:48.990
Nisreen Hasib: But then and this is like, you know. when I add in the copy out like Ktb, it's a really great fit framework. It's really, you know, great, for like getting to

253
00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:57.379
Nisreen Hasib: a baseline and like a foundation. But then, you know, kind of like looking at things from a more strategic perspective.

254
00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:05.900
Nisreen Hasib: one of the things that jumped out to me with like homeowners. They renovate once every decade. If we're talking about, you know things from a business perspective

255
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:21.929
Nisreen Hasib: not great, like, you know, because I that means I have a whole 10 year period in which I'm trying to identify the point at which people are going to renovate their houses, and that I have to feel like the solution, like, you know, there were like too many variables I could not control.

256
00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:29.330
Nisreen Hasib: And so the question like that emerged for me was like, alright. I know the problem. I have a hypothesized solution.

257
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:47.279
Nisreen Hasib: But like, there's this question of distribution because I don't think distributing to homeowners directly makes the most sense because of a lack of, you know. Repeatability. And you know, like again, there are like so many roadblocks to like getting them at that exact moment to like, you know where they are.

258
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:48.840
So

259
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:57.889
Nisreen Hasib: after interviewing those first 2 groups, homeowners and the general contractors, I started thinking he had a third group interior designers, because.

260
00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:18.949
Nisreen Hasib: again, like the key thing that jumped out at me from the homeowner interviews, was this question of like vision, and designers are stewards of, you know, renovation vision. But more than that, it's their job. And so they're not doing renovations once every decade. They're doing 12 to 15 renovations per year.

261
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.360
Nisreen Hasib: and then, after digging into like the designers

262
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:31.670
Nisreen Hasib: also, you know, realize that architects serve that same role as the stewards of a renovation vision

263
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.299
and for architects.

264
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:49.209
Nisreen Hasib: One of the great things is that they're actually legally liable for any general contractor. Recommendations they make for a renovation. If that contractor makes a misstep. So that group became super interesting to me.

265
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:58.800
Nisreen Hasib: But like with every single group of folks that is adding to this storyline for every group of characters.

266
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:05.620
Nisreen Hasib: I was using Jtb. To really unspool the stories for every group

267
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.730
Nisreen Hasib: to understand 2 things.

268
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:12.399
Nisreen Hasib: How do these characters intersect with each other?

269
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.870
Nisreen Hasib: how do they?

270
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:21.239
Nisreen Hasib: You know? How's the friction between these 2 groups of people? And then how do they work together to move from point A to Point B.

271
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:30.339
Nisreen Hasib: And also, you know, like, how did their individual storylines bring up different things that they might need help with?

272
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.570
Nisreen Hasib: So though those those were always things that were super top of mind for me.

273
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.000
Nisreen Hasib: So in September

274
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:48.010
Nisreen Hasib: of 2023, so this was 3 months after tech stores ended. I relaunch the the platform

275
00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.050
Nisreen Hasib: and the relaunch

276
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.619
Nisreen Hasib: of Signoc. Very much

277
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:59.320
Nisreen Hasib: is what I said at the beginning. Of this presentation.

278
00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:07.600
Nisreen Hasib: At sign off, we match architects with the labor that they need to execute on client projects.

279
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:17.879
Nisreen Hasib: So that messaging and that positioning very much, you know, came out of that Jt Jtb work that I did, because, in addition to spending

280
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.550
Nisreen Hasib: June through

281
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:25.149
Nisreen Hasib: August rebuilding the platform. The other thing that I was doing was.

282
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.139
Nisreen Hasib: you know, testing

283
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:40.000
Nisreen Hasib: these like lines, these hypotheses that I came up with during tech stars, with architects, with designers and refining. You know my ask, and like my positioning every single time.

284
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:50.909
Nisreen Hasib: so that when the platform eventually was ready for relaunch. I was able to go into September, gather a group of these designers and architects.

285
00:39:51.120 --> 00:40:02.780
Nisreen Hasib: and be really clear on the value proposition that I had, you know, for them. and also I was able to onboard general contractors.

286
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.909
Nisreen Hasib: By being really clear with the value prop that I would be able to deliver, you know, for them.

287
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.910
Nisreen Hasib: so that once we relaunched

288
00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:23.290
Nisreen Hasib: in 24 h, we have, like the first 16 projects, get onto the platform at about just over 2.5 million dollars.

289
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:31.699
Nisreen Hasib: Which was like just a major win for us because the year before, like I said, in February 2,023

290
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:36.980
Nisreen Hasib: so sign off and made a grant of of a hundred $10 per month

291
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:45.429
Nisreen Hasib: under our new business model sign-off makes 2% of the total project value of all projects that are on through the platform.

292
00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:54.260
Nisreen Hasib: So immediately. And we were looking at, you know, pipeline of a minimum of 50

293
00:40:54.330 --> 00:41:01.539
Nisreen Hasib: $1,000, which was significantly higher than anything that was coming through the pipeline before going through all that work.

294
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:15.809
Nisreen Hasib: So the journey does not end there, because, like launch is a launch, it is a day, and then you have to continue to build that pipeline and then continue to like work to get deals to close. So

295
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.859
Nisreen Hasib: it was great. Top of funnel was coming in, contracts were coming in.

296
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:23.660
Nisreen Hasib: The value prop was resident with people.

297
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:29.510
Nisreen Hasib: but again like stories. Don't don't end there.

298
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:35.720
Nisreen Hasib: Now. People were like moving through the process that we created at sign off

299
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:47.759
Nisreen Hasib: and starting to get their projects bid on by sign off contractors. and you know, like, because we launched in September a lot of these projects started

300
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:52.240
Nisreen Hasib: to either go to war or loss in November

301
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:54.830
Nisreen Hasib: and in November

302
00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:14.040
Nisreen Hasib: I remember getting this email from an architect I had been super excited to work with, and I was so confident we were going to win for business. And then I got like the email, like 0% of humans, wanna get, which was like, Hey, do you have time for a quick call. And you like know that that quick call is not gonna be anything you wanna hear

303
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:25.739
Nisreen Hasib:  during that call with the architect, you know. She talked about how, you know, like the general contractor was bought, and she was bought in as like the architect.

304
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:39.449
Nisreen Hasib: But then she brought up something that had been a major oversight for me, because I hoped that by building sign off to be A. B 2 platform where only architects and general contractors could use it. I could kind of sidestep like a lot of waffling

305
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:46.730
Nisreen Hasib: like that. Homeowners do. Home owners control the purse strings or the purse strings. and

306
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:52.279
Nisreen Hasib: you know, like I kind of counted on the architect being able to talk the homeowner

307
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.620
Nisreen Hasib: into like using a sign off contractor when

308
00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:07.619
Nisreen Hasib: there were a couple of like things that happened. The first was that, you know, like, I thought our average project was going to be like 175 to $250,000. Average project ended up is closer to

309
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:30.269
Nisreen Hasib: are the medium project on sign off. It's between 600,000 to 1 million dollars, which is a lot of money for a homeowner, right? Like, if you're looking down a contract that's a million dollars as a homeowner, you're gonna have a lot of questions, and there needs to be like a lot of reassurance there. I wasn't providing that reassurance, and because of that, because we weren't providing that on our platform

310
00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.169
Nisreen Hasib: we like lost 3 deals.

311
00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:35.750
Nisreen Hasib: and I was pissed because I hate it

312
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:45.679
Nisreen Hasib: so. I knew the importance of continuing to dig into that story. So with every single deal that I had, I would break down the timeline

313
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:51.469
Nisreen Hasib: of events, you know, from beginning to end, whether it was a win or a loss.

314
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:56.210
Nisreen Hasib: And I would use that again to continue to like, refine

315
00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:03.150
Nisreen Hasib: the ways in which we talk to people identified weak points in the timeline when we like, needed to reach out to different

316
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:09.860
Nisreen Hasib: people, whether that was like the general contractor or the architect, and like now the homeowner.

317
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:14.109
Nisreen Hasib: So again make this as predictable and repeatable as possible.

318
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:21.610
Nisreen Hasib: So then, after you know, like November, we went into a holiday, so it was slower.

319
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:26.109
Nisreen Hasib: and then, like Q. One of this year, sign off officially became

320
00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:31.809
Nisreen Hasib: revenue, generating which was super super exciting.

321
00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.879
Nisreen Hasib:  so as of like February 20. First

322
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.310
we're generating revenue

323
00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:40.989
Nisreen Hasib: and the average

324
00:44:41.200 --> 00:45:03.329
Nisreen Hasib: money brought in per deal. Is up from the hypothesis. Size $3,500 per deal to actually $10,000 per deal with what is in the pipeline now, and I have a lot more confidence in our ability to like carry things over to close. So our win rate

325
00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.080
Nisreen Hasib: is

326
00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:16.359
Nisreen Hasib: going from 33%, which was like, not too bad. To about 50% and it's significantly better than you know, like what I had prior to

327
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:26.719
Nisreen Hasib: try to text stars where I was looking at deals that were like $1,000 for like the whole year. You know, like 10,000 versus like 1,000, significantly like better.

328
00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.359
Nisreen Hasib: So this is just like a breakdown. At the last deal.

329
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:45.899
Nisreen Hasib: That we won again, like the thing I want to emphasize is that it is so important to keep digging into these stories again and again and again and again to like, just get really clear on the path that, like people take to use your product.

330
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.119
Nisreen Hasib: So for for next steps,

331
00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.560
you know, like

332
00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.540
Nisreen Hasib: there are certain

333
00:45:54.630 --> 00:46:10.040
Nisreen Hasib: revenue goals and like user goals, and calendar fuels that that sign off has so in terms of you know, like what those goals are sign off currently operates in New York City, and the surrounding area.

334
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:15.239
Nisreen Hasib: in Q. 3, the plan is to expand to Los Angeles because

335
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:21.190
New York architects do a lot of work in LA. And La is the second biggest free model market.

336
00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:33.389
Nisreen Hasib: But in addition to that. The goal is to get 200 architects on boarded onto the sign off platform and to win 200 projects. Which would carry us to our

337
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.280
Nisreen Hasib: revenue goals for the end of the year.

338
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:43.350
Nisreen Hasib: But it's part of that process. It's part of getting more and more architects onto the platforms.

339
00:46:43.980 --> 00:47:11.909
Nisreen Hasib: We're moving from, you know, reaching out to individual firms to actually enter partnerships with entities like the American Institute for Architects, as well as organizations for owners reps. And the ability to like really go into those organizations with a really clear ask and really clear and a lot of clarity around, like the value we're able to to deliver for people is something that's going to allow us to really leverage those those relationships in order to bring on more users

340
00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:13.520
perfect.

341
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:16.490
Nisreen Hasib: So this can do quick. Yeah.

342
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.270
Chloe Lannert: without a question. Chat.

343
00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:26.520
Chloe Lannert: people would love to know, what you did to give people reassurance that they needed to get you to the 50 closing rate.

344
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:31.439
Nisreen Hasib: Yeah, so you know, like, the

345
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:35.510
Nisreen Hasib: thing the first thing we did was,

346
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:45.219
Nisreen Hasib: is not anything technical. We told architects show your show the sign off profiles of general contractors to your homeowners.

347
00:47:45.220 --> 00:48:08.000
Nisreen Hasib: because the thing that would happen, and this is very consistent with projects that had budgets between 900,000 to 1.2 1 million dollars. The homeowners would get like the bid from the contractors scroll down to the last page, and then like, see the final number without like seeing the entire breakdown which is super important. So if, like, there's one the

348
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:13.300
Nisreen Hasib: project by self architecture. The bid was 1 million dollars. The homeowner

349
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:20.149
Nisreen Hasib: freaked out and wanted to hire someone who said they could do it for 750.

350
00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.950
Nisreen Hasib: Okay.

351
00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.830
Nisreen Hasib: And

352
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.400
Nisreen Hasib: that

353
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:34.020
Nisreen Hasib: project has not gone well, and, like the homeowner, actually said, they wish they went with the sign off contractor.

354
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:49.209
Nisreen Hasib: But the thing I told architects to like do is to actually show their home runners the profiles of the sign off contractors anytime like, the homeowner said like, oh, like so and so who from my presence cabinet can do it cheaper?

355
00:48:49.460 --> 00:49:09.489
Nisreen Hasib: The architect would be like, Okay, cool. Do you have, like the license, information, or insurance information also sign off, did like a background check on all of them and verify. They've been no lost since no bankruptcy, etc. Can you pull all this information? And then the homeowner would be like, oh, I didn't even like think about all those things. Oh, I don't have time

356
00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:10.610
to like.

357
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:21.210
Nisreen Hasib: Go do all the things alright. If I'm gonna spend a million dollars like it is easier for me to like do this, knowing everyone to the background, check

358
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:27.900
Nisreen Hasib: versus me, using, like the person who like cabinets, so that, like step.

359
00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.160
Nisreen Hasib: like giving the homeowners more information.

360
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.830
Nisreen Hasib: giving them the reassurance that, like, you know, there

361
00:49:35.270 --> 00:50:05.219
Nisreen Hasib: have been background checks and there up, and that they're about to spend a million dollars responsibly. That was like one of the non pro like we didn't build anything new like, you know, we didn't even come up with a new marketing campaign, which is like, just show them what already exists. And like, make sure that's like the case. And so then, like the more scalable printed update was like in the emails, I go out to architects like when they are match. There's a line, and then it says, review contractor profiles with home owner like.

362
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:09.319
Nisreen Hasib: so that they go through. All of them.

363
00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:35.969
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So just making sure your value is fully visible to everyone involved like that, that's perfect. Another one. Which kind of overlaps. What was the adjustment you made just after November? Based on the insights gathered? Was there anything else like? What triggered that decision to start showing the homeowner pro or the contractor profiles what was like the moment there that made you think of that idea versus anything else with the marketing.

364
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:55.740
Nisreen Hasib: Yeah. So it was breaking down the timelines, cause I saw that, like the other 2 deals that were like lost broke down at the exact same timeline. And I just like, Okay, alright, once it's maybe I should pay attention twice is like, Okay, we should pay attention then 3 times. That's like, I'm not losing a fourth time like no, not acceptable.

365
00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.870
Chloe Lannert: That's awesome. Thank you.

366
00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:08.550
Nisreen Hasib: Cool, awesome. So just high level. Take ways and happy to answer any other questions. There's no silver bullet.

367
00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.350
Nisreen Hasib: you know. Jtp. Is a very good framework. It's not a perfect framework.

368
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:19.259
Nisreen Hasib: But it is a thing that I use to, you know. Put a steak and in the ground, and.

369
00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:28.950
Nisreen Hasib: you know, like the work doesn't stop after you like laid a foundation like you need to go back into those timelines, go back into the stories and like, see how things

370
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:41.250
Nisreen Hasib: change and shift and then like. Determine whether or not you and your team and your product are going to change and shift in the same way, and have like an response, for you know why you do or do not.

371
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:45.410
Nisreen Hasib: and then Don't have any for syndrome

372
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.130
like It's usually not scalable.

373
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:52.360
that is it

374
00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:57.290
Chloe Lannert: awesome? Thank you so much.

375
00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:02.730
Chloe Lannert: Alright, have any questions at the moment

376
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:29.079
Valeria Brenner: have a question, but it's more so, just like a comment of like how your presentation left an impact on me. I love the idea of breaking it down into a timeline, which I know is just like the jobs in order, but just having it phrased that way like shifted my mindset on it, and it it was really cool. Thank you for that.

377
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.300
Nisreen Hasib: You're welcome. That is how my brain works.

378
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:43.410
Nisreen Hasib: yeah, I I like to look at testing of them. I'm a very visual person, and so like the timeline very much helped me.

379
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:52.080
Chloe Lannert: We've got one from Nelson in the chat. He's curious how you kept the lights on while pivoting, if you're comfortable sharing.

380
00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:58.459
Yeah. So you know, Tedsters came along at the right time, and the advantage of being a solo founder is like

381
00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:07.650
Nisreen Hasib: there was no one but me. And so, you know, it was like the Texas investment. That helped keep things afloat.

382
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.550
Nisreen Hasib: During that

383
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.150
Chloe Lannert: awesome Kelvin.

384
00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:31.000
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: Yeah, thank you very much, Nizrin, for the excellent presentation my question is regarding one of the issues you mentioned you had in the beginning, which was the silver cycle being very long. I wanted to know if there was anything you did to shorten that cycle, or

385
00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:41.620
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: maybe by increasing the amount of money coming in that cycle. It was what it despite the long duration. Was there anything you need to shorten the cycle.

386
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:44.830
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: For yourself and for Simon.

387
00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:47.710
Nisreen Hasib: Yeah. So

388
00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:53.120
Nisreen Hasib: with the very, very first product, I tried to shorten the cycle.

389
00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:58.030
Nisreen Hasib: I don't even. I don't remember like the different ways. But

390
00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:06.589
Nisreen Hasib: one of the things that was frustrating is that like the duration of the cycle, was so out of my control, because I was waiting on general contractors to get back to me.

391
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:12.899
Nisreen Hasib: And like, you know, I think if you work as a startup or in tech, you check your email.

392
00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:29.919
Nisreen Hasib: or I'm just gonna out myself. I check my email like at least every 20 min, if not more right? I'm responding to like, you know, things like day up, or, you know, otherwise, like they're getting. But like, I have a whole system for my communications.

393
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:38.459
Nisreen Hasib: That system doesn't exist for, like general contractors. So even if they were excited. there were some people that check their email twice a week.

394
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.800
Nisreen Hasib: or, like. you know.

395
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:52.369
Nisreen Hasib: I would call their assistant like they would not get back to me. so I just like alright. It's really hard for me to like control the duration of the cycle.

396
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:57.200
Nisreen Hasib: and it's like, seems like it is naturally landing in about like 45 days.

397
00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:08.430
Nisreen Hasib: The numbers do not justify this like cause. I modeled out, you know, like hiring a salesperson. What does that look like in terms of like comp and like what that person's like able to produce? I was just like the numbers

398
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.999
Nisreen Hasib: like the math is not mapping, so

399
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:12.750
we gotta take some money.

400
00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.690
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: Thank you very much.

401
00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:17.890
Chloe Lannert: That's awesome, Duane.

402
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:45.299
Dùane | DubPrime: I just wanted to thank you for giving me an unlock to think about the jobs we've done with people being driven by a sense of responsibility towards the family community like that was a big way to reframe for B Twob reframe. How people think of things in terms of the greater organizational context. When we're having someone trying to hire a job. I'm willing to do the job in a group of contacts. You talk about the person trying to remove all their home for their family and guests, but

403
00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:46.720
Dùane | DubPrime: it really, I think

404
00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:51.090
Dùane | DubPrime: that was a big takeaway for me. So I really wanna thank you for that framing. It was awesome.

405
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.120
Nisreen Hasib: You are welcome.

406
00:55:56.330 --> 00:56:09.590
Chloe Lannert: I've got one more thing I'd love for you to expand on kind of backing up to Nelson's question about staying lean I love that. You talk about using the dumbest possible solution? Do you have any

407
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:16.289
Chloe Lannert: tips on how to sort of stay, lean and avoid an over engineering while people are still figuring out their customers and their problems.

408
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:23.790
Nisreen Hasib: Yeah, one of the great things that exists now it should not exist. When you know, I started my very first company, like

409
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:36.549
Nisreen Hasib: 8 years ago, the proliferation of like low-cost tools. if you're a not technical founder, and you're like as a product manager is like technical enough.

410
00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:44.000
Nisreen Hasib:  build dumb solutions like using those tools like use. Google, like

411
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:55.299
Nisreen Hasib: Google sheets is actually a lot more useful than I want to get Google credit for but it's like, for example, stitch fix, which is now, I think, like they're now public company.

412
00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:04.719
Nisreen Hasib: I know that the founder ran that business on Google sheets for like the first year to revenue of a million dollars like didn't build a product like.

413
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.160
Nisreen Hasib: So

414
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:07.660
you know, like

415
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:17.180
Nisreen Hasib: product doesn't matter, and I love like beautiful product. Don't get me wrong, but it doesn't matter, cause you might have to throw it away. So like.

416
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:23.710
Nisreen Hasib: you know, if you are matching service right? Which is what sign off solution is.

417
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:31.620
Nisreen Hasib: Yeah, it sounds great, you know, like for that initial bill, it's just like.

418
00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.510
Nisreen Hasib: get to like.

419
00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:44.370
Nisreen Hasib: Just be the person like as a CEO, like founder, like the steward of the budget, who is literally annoying people by asking like, Do we have to build it.

420
00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:49.200
Nisreen Hasib: Does something exist already like. be like that annoying person?

421
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.930
Great!

422
00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:55.940
Chloe Lannert: That's awesome. Thanks so much.

423
00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:59.400
Chloe Lannert:  Dotan.

424
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:07.940
Dotan Shalev/Lexir: yeah, thanks. Just a quick question. Thank you for for the presentation and the screen. It was super interesting. I was wondering.

425
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:12.510
Dotan Shalev/Lexir: after you've done the job to be done, and and sort of patterns emerge.

426
00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:39.089
Dotan Shalev/Lexir: How did you find the in practice of changing things on your side was based on the patterns you've seen emerging because I feel like one challenge is seeing the patterns. But another challenge is sort of acting on the patterns that you see, and then prioritizing why to change and and how to change it. So just wondering if I know I know it's sort of an open question, but wondering what the experience was like for you and if you can get in beat into details to sort of how long certain changes you've made took.

427
00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:42.040
Nisreen Hasib: Yeah? So

428
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:49.349
Nisreen Hasib: I'll definitely answer that question in the context is that sign-off was super young. So there wasn't like that much.

429
00:58:49.360 --> 00:59:07.490
Nisreen Hasib: you know. Infrastructure to like. It was easy to throw things away without like ruining things. And that's not gonna be the case for everyone. So I like, just want to get that context. So that meant that, you know, like when I had the insights from J, the jobs to be done, I was able to

430
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:13.280
Nisreen Hasib: essentially aren't making some of those changes within like 2 weeks.

431
00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:19.599
Nisreen Hasib: Because again, I have no co-founder like and at that time, like I've done

432
00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:26.850
Nisreen Hasib: to build myself so like I didn't have an engineer who's gonna get really pissed off at me for like throwing things out like

433
00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:31.880
Nisreen Hasib: If your company is more mature.

434
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:38.289
Nisreen Hasib: like, you are going to have to be more thoughtful strategic about, you know, like how to how to do it right?

435
00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:46.720
Nisreen Hasib: Because you might have customers already. So one of the decisions you might have to make, which I didn't have to make is.

436
00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.829
Nisreen Hasib: you know, are we going to stop surveying or

437
00:59:49.900 --> 01:00:12.669
Nisreen Hasib: significantly reduce the services we have for, like one group of customers in order to place the bet on the new product service, or like change for potentially like new group of of customers that is going to be something that like should not necessarily, like, you know, be done in like one to 2 weeks that's going to require, you know, like a lot more thought and care.

438
01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:17.690
Nisreen Hasib: So it is going to be so stage dependent for your company.

439
01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:29.430
Chloe Lannert: Awesome. Thank you so much. If we don't have any other questions at the moment. I will stop the recording.
