### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Sylvia Bouloutas: yeah, okay, cool. Alright, great. So I think this is around where we sort of ended off right around how funds evaluate deals we had sort of talked about. We talked about kind of the larger mega funds and kind of limitations, with maybe just focusing on those funds, and how it important is to run kind of this holistic process right around a lot of different types of funds and not just target the sequoise of the world.
- Sylvia Bouloutas: moving from this we're going to talk a little bit about diligence. So I'm sure you guys have. Some of you have gone through it. Some of you have performed it at different roles of yours in the past, and you've definitely all heard about it. So this will be the process where a fund is really taking you seriously. And they really want to get to know your business in a deeper way. So this is after those kind of initial meetings, right?
- Sylvia Bouloutas: And you're going to start a process that they call due diligence, where they really kind of dig through a lot of different aspects of your business. So some of it is that financial due diligence they may rebuild your financial model right, depending on what metrics you've shared with them. They're, gonna you know, kind of assess the model, and maybe put their own assumptions and burn rate and their own projections, you know. Given what they know about the market.

> "Sylvia Bouloutas: metrics that suggest that like how you used to run this process before you work with this company versus now is, you know, significantly better so. Customer calls, I'd say, are kind of a critical"

> "Sylvia Bouloutas: critical part of kind of the diligence process, Neil. I don't know if you want to add, and then we can take."

> "Sylvia Bouloutas: Yeah, I mean, from my perspective, I think it. It would be important to kind of give the customer heads up, saying and asking them. If it's okay, right? Like, we have some investors that are the diligence process. And you know we'd love to kind of like connect you with them if you could just take a 2030 min call just to talk to them about the experience with our product.
