### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Morgan Stanton: My only comment was, you mentioned that it takes like a year for your business deals to close like it's a very intensive process, would they? I feel like your turn rate would also be quite low, right, unless something like catastrophic event happens and they drop. You would also be kind of it wouldn't be super common for them to to drop you, and so I like. I would assume it would stay 0 hopefully the all every week it'd be on a
- Florence Ettlin: We base these goals actually on past data. So we took a bit of a conservative approach from our previous outreach and the conversion rate we had there. So this is how we came up with the numbers.
- Çoruh | CogniScope: So I like my thought process was on that. So it it made me a bit confused on these metrics.

### Key Insights

> "Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, I'm always available to be the human sacrificial pancake."

> "Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): they're both revenue related. Because, you know, revenue is really important for our growth and also our existence. And so the 1st primary metric is new net revenue, and I understand these are not supposed to move frequently they're supposed to be hard to move. And these are the outputs and the secondary metrics are inputs. The things I have control over. So the 1st one is new leads identified."

> "Lilliana Robinson: I was, gonna say, a a quick tip for everybody is that revenue will always be a lagging Kpi"
