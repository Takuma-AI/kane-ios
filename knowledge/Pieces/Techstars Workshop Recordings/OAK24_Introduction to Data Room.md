### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Lilliana Robinson: And some people are kind of reeling. Some people are saying like, Oh, it was great! The people who say it was great is only due to their perspective, I promise you. I've seen every single person's feedback, like everybody got negative feedback. So those who are feeling good and happy, it's just based on your perspective. Yeah, it's it's it's a matter of processing tough love and competing perspectives and people who you're like. Alright like you don't like me. Alright cool, fine. We'll just move on. It is what it is. Not everybody's gonna love you, not everybody's gonna say nice things about
- Lilliana Robinson: And at each one we'll talk about the next one. So it's just step by step. I kind of broke it down into despite size bits, because a data room is really intimidating Nicole from Jp. Morgan yesterday, if you remember, she was here, and she was talking about what a data room is, basically your whole business on paper in like a Google Drive, or some sort of Sas platform for people to view.
- Lilliana Robinson: What what are we doing like? We can't even start with that process, and you've been helping you make progress unless you've done your part of the job, which is documenting everything about your business that would be expected of any investor would write you a check after I do. Of course. Yeah.

### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: Good, important, right now? Right? So I know that there is a good number, because there's a sub group of folks who are not there."

> "Lilliana Robinson: I think it's really important that you watch a recording of that session, and what he has to say."

> "Lilliana Robinson: If you feel like you want some additional support which is totally valid. We have made a little sign up sheet, for in person meetings with Manual for 50 min slots. It's on our office store back there. You can add at the end of this you can just take a pen and sign up for a spot. People who are virtual just box us, we're always available to you guys. But some of you guys here have asked to like, grab us on the side. So we made some of the time blocks available for you."

> "Lilliana Robinson: the explanation here is, you have 4 min, although your report will no doubt have many more details. Just pick the top 3 insights like pick a cluster, or all of your clusters, but really high level that you wanna highlight. And we'll review the full reports afterwards. So that's really important to understand, especially Star Board, since you haven't gone yet."

> "Lilliana Robinson: yeah, just know that like one of the things that's gonna be important for all we need to develop a skill around is to know, like, how much time do I have? Oh, 4 min. Okay, I know what I can cover in 4 min to make my point and get the value out of this time."
