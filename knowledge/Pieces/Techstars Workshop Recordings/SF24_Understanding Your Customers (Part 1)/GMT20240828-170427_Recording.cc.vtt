WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay? No, I think those are all the questions we're good to get started. I'll hit record.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Great.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Alright! We're live!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So I've done.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Talk many times, and I always like to start it off with a conversation before I get into any of my.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Spiel.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Which I've done more times than I can count, so it's more about making sure I have a good sense of.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What would be the most helpful to share.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
With all of you, and what conversation we should have about customer, because.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Like I've said it's bedrock for us. We already put you through a lot for the application process.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I would love to get your initial.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Feedback on what you're still hoping to learn and get better at. With respect to customer discovery in the spirit of it leading to greater. You know, understanding of your customers, and more sales for your businesses.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But also your thoughts on the process. So far, what we've exposed you to the mattress, the materials.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Some of you have been through this process more than once, so you probably have even deeper understanding of.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You know what this is all about.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So with that being said, I just wanted to open the floor 1st to get any initial thoughts, questions you were hoping to learn.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yeah. Great. Dave, yeah.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Yeah, I'll I'll go if no one else. So thank you very much for the the mattress. I I love that and here's what I'm struggling with personally, which is like.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I have. I have a lot of customers, and they're all on discord, and they talk to me all the time.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But I I kind of feel like it's the same 5 customers that talk to me all the time, and so like.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
As this. I I kind of want to know.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The customers who are not talking to me, the people who are not on my discord channel the people who bought my 1st game but did not buy my second game.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Those are the ones I kind of want to get to. And so like as we start to go through this exercise. If you could help me figure out how to get to.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Not my Diehard customers, because those guys are hard to.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:07.000
There's 1 right outside my window right now, like they're they're hard to get away from, but like the ones you know, that are are not sort of volunteering their time and the energy into engaging with me. That's why I really feel like I need to understand and.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Be really helpful to understand and do that.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That's excellent. Yeah. Cause you know, Diehards are, you're almost gonna get them, you know, no matter what.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Whereas the ones that you want to learn more about to get more of you're gonna have to do some digging. I love that Dave, and I appreciate you framing that. So I'll be. I wrote that down, and I'll make sure I address that at some point.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Alright, agent, lunar team.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Hey? So we I think we mentioned this before, hey? Like we love the jobs to be done. I think that was our favorite part of the application process, because.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It. We had a very.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Clear

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Because persona in mind. But through going through that process we started to figure out, okay, there's actually some potential segments we've not thought about here that we've started to test.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But I guess where we are.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Struggling at the moment is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We, we have 4 potential segments. But.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
All 4 of them.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
From our interviews and from the using the prototype are excited. But in order to.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
How can I say this in order for them to get value.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It's it's 4 very different products and very much determines what we build next. So it's kind. It's obviously we can't build 4 products for them. But then the fear is, if we.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Don't build what they need. How can we truly test whether they.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
The right customers. So I guess we're just struggling with that like, how do we.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Get confident on that decision. Is that a fair? Yeah.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Yeah.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Yeah. Agent lunar team. I've been so excited screening committee to work with you guys. Because that is exactly what we're gonna work on in the next 3 days as well as in my business blueprint workshop. Next week I have a feeling in the next 2 weeks. You're gonna have a lot more clarity on that. And like, we've known that coming in right? That was something like our judges asked you about. So I definitely think you guys will have answers for that, or at least answers on how to approach it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Yeah.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And then you can go out and do that in the weeks, 1st weeks of program. So this is exactly where you need to be.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Okay, awesome. Thanks. Guys, super excited.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
User.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Yeah, so my question is like, we, we also really liked.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
How the.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Much sincere and digit is, you know, giving a lot of structure to things that we've.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Been used to, just, you know, throwing in on the fly.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So like. That was great. However, us being solely B. 2 V. Company.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We found it a bit.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000
In terms of, you know, like, because everything was B to C focus. And the examples were also B to C focus. We had to translate all of that.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Into the B 3 segment, and actually doing and conducting those interviews, felt a bit off.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Just solely based on the fact that you know.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Yeah.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
In those interviews we're supposed to focus on how that person is feeling or how that decision is commencing. I really like that. You're smiling. Right now, I think you have a great answer. Yeah, cool. So you know, I'm really curious about to be to be part of that.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And as a feedback doing it as A B Twob business felt a bit weird. Let's say, like we've tried to find materials on how B. 2 B version of that should is supposed to be working.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And we couldn't find that a lot. So yeah.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
No, that's really fair, and and, to be honest, I think our application process should do a better job of.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Offerings, specific advice for B to B+B to C, so that's helpful you to reinforce. I will say.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This workshop that we give every single program that is always one of the things that comes up.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And I love it because we're prepared. You know, we obviously have forks for B, Twob and B to C and tips that we have in our materials that we present now. But you're reminding me that our application process might.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Strike fear in the hearts of the b 2 b companies in the sense of how do I apply this meaningfully in my context? So I really appreciate you calling that out.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
That's really.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Morgan.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Oh, yeah. Go ahead. Leah. Sorry.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I was. Gonna say, we, we even every program. We've added more and more examples into our workshops of alumni B Twob companies who did it well to try and like kind of switch that guilt.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Or sorry that worry of the b 2 b Company.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Morgan.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I think you're muted.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Hmm.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Sorry my question is on the following up on the B to be a lot of these deals I'm trying to close is a lot of back and forth. It's not like one conversation, it's quite a few, and really just.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Hmm.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Making them shorter like closing the deal like some of them have to be drawn out. So I would love to get feedback on, you know, obviously getting all the information to the customers we can, but just kind of keeping it concise as much as as we can. So it's not just kind of waiting to see, but.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yeah. Getting the the deal done as quickly as possible.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Right. And and you know what's interesting, Morgan is. What I will continue to call out is the distinction that's super important between the discovery process, and then the sales process.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Which are 2 distinct activities that many founders in my experience tend to.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Unintentionally, conflate.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Okay.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So we'll talk about that and then work with you to expedite the sales process. The more you learn about what it actually takes to get them to. Yes, the fewer, you know. Revs, it'll take hopefully to get to that. Conclusion.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Great. Thank you.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But I'm I'm with you. 100%. Yeah.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Annie.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Yes, so I have kind of follow up to that. A very specific question. So.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
We? I had a meeting with Carter yesterday, and they are interested in our product, which is super awesome.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But it's 1 of those things where I'm like, I need to close this deal. So I think very specifically, I want to work with y'all to help me close that deal. And then the other thing is that I you know we are operating in different verticals now, and I really appreciate, you know, doing the lean canvas for each vertical.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I think something and I are talking about is.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Now that we've got our Dei product done, it's got a product market. We've got customers like Carta. What's kind of our next.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Vertical to focus on. And do we go with.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Kind of maybe the easier one which might be the social media one. Or do we go with.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:46.000
The one that might be.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Hmm.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000
A little bit bigger customers, more difficult customers, but might be like the bigger fish. So yeah, so those are kind of the 2 things I'd love to focus on.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Nick.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Excellent strategic challenges that you're facing. I would love to work with you through those. So let's do it. I wrote those down.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Monica.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Yeah. So I'm just piling on this point.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Yeah, let's do it. I love this. By the way, keep it coming.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:17.000
More of the same. But yeah, I mean, there's a distinction also between B. Twob and enterprise. B, twob, like, you know, closing a deal with a smaller business.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Is different from closing a deal with a 50,000 employee global business which can take a year right.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Or 2 years depending on their procurement process. So.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You know it'd be nice to touch on that as well, and then number 2.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Is a specific challenge that we have, and that we have a a platform that is pretty sprawling, and does a lot of different things. And they're all important.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The different customers.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Are excited about different.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Features. Right? So what we end up doing is just like.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Mentioning all of them, or all the benefits. And you know we find it hard to really like.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Understand which features which customers would be excited about. It's kind of random, you know, because the way they work is different. So yeah, just wanted to put that out there.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So. Yeah, no, it's interesting. You just said Monica. You said it's kind of random.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
My! My goal here is in the time that we'll spend together. That notion of random will go away.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And we will get closer and closer to causality.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Because.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
It's it's a safe assumption on my end, usually with the customer journey to assume that nothing is random.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But you know you never know, so we'll we'll find out together.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Great.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Telitha.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Hi, so I think issue that we face is that people are a bit too polite, so they feel like bad to say no to us, and then they give us like superficial reasons, like they'll just be a myriad of different reasons why not to work with us. And I think what we wanna figure out is, how do we go beyond that.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Fluff.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And get to something where we can get actionable insights to improve our product or.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Or whatever it is.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Yeah, I think that's something that we struggle with. A lot of people are too kind. And then, like.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Okay, what do we take away from this? How do we? What's the next step? Yeah.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Yeah couple of quick, like on the on the like off the dome, like instincts. There one is.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
We want to learn what they're saying. Yes, to as opposed to you.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And the people who originally say yes to you and say no, might give you even more insight than the ones that don't say yes at all.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So there's a few things there that we can also dig into. But I love that you have that curiosity and.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000
It's always an awkward journey to deal like we're all running businesses, and we're in the business of being rejected most of the time.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Both from investors and from potential customers. So you all are dealing with a really hard line of work.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
That you're all gluttens for it, though, because we're here, and you're in tech stars now. But we'll do that together, too.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Excellent.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Okay? Well, I have one other follow up question for you all before I get into my slides.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Was there anything that did not resonate with you? Was there anything that you felt like you had like struggled with? Or maybe some instinctual.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Either disagreement with, or something where you were like skeptical. You're like, I'm not sure this makes sense or.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I'm not quite convinced that's a sound way to approach it.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:24.000
It's it's common. So I just thought I'd welcome that because I tend to encourage it. And I question these same things myself when I was 1st getting into this.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Now, everyone's convinced, and they're all in.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Like, Yeah, we're here. This is, we wouldn't be here if we didn't agree.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Alright. Let's go. Agent. Lunar. Yeah.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I think you all are muted.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Yeah, okay, I.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Oh, you did you say?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
No, no, please.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I'll go ahead. Go ahead! I have my hand. Someone else.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
No no go ahead, please.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Okay, yeah. I think there was some.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Like skepticism when you're listening through.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Matches interview. And it's like.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Oh, what, what like milk did you buy? What percentage was the milk like? I just.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I understand the goal of trying to recreate the mindset or the scenario that they're in when they made this purchasing decision. But I just.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I think. Yeah, if I'm the 1st one to say I'm not fully bought in on how exactly useful that is to.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Kind of determine when that purchasing decision was made. And I know that might that.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Yeah, what do you think that was about? Why did he ask? Like the the like? If you remember the milk percentage, what do you think like.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
What's the deal there.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Yeah. So it was about, yeah. The guy went to Costco.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
He didn't have a plan to buy a mattress.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And then he was doing his regular weekly shopping for the kids, and he attended something about oh, I bought some groceries, and I was like.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Oh, well, what was it?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Oh, milk!

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
How much did you buy?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
What percentage of the most you buy, and you know it just went down this rabbit hole of like.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Questions. And I just think.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
For at least my user is like even trying to recreate that I don't know.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:00.000
How much of that I would wanna do without turning my.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Yeah.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
A potential users away from this interview, because, you know, these interviews are hard to get come by, especially when you're really in early in ideation, not ideation, but product, stage.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
If I'm asking. You know, when my students, for example.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Oh, what time was it when you were on your laptop searching for our product?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
What did you search for? And you know I go down.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
A whole of like.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
What Youtube videos, you're watching. I just, I'm just a little skeptical. I think that's that was a good challenge.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
You're you're skeptical because it feels like information that you shouldn't be asking for.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Yeah, like, or just.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
To what extent do I try to recreate.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
The like.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
That environment when that person decision was actually useful to.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
For us.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Well, I want to pose this question to the room actually, before I offer, because obviously I have a thought on that.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
What do people think, Dave? You look like you want to jump? Jump in here. Yeah.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Oh, yeah, I think it. I think it was. I think it was brilliant. I thought it was brilliant, because what cause you saw that the more the guy started talking about all this weird stuff.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
That was unrelated. The more he remembered about buying the mattress.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
There you go!

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:10.000
So it came in like, Oh, I just went to go buy a mattress, and then it was like, Wait, hold on! I've been sleeping on this crappy mattress for like a year, and like I've been traveling, and my wife had been suffering with it, and I even thought, you know, like it was crazy. So I thought that these small details really kicked in. Sorry, I'm yeah. I feel like I'm yelling. I feel like.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
No, you're just excited. We like it. I like this energy.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I love the enthusiasm.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Yeah, they kicked in all the all the synapses started firing. And and I think I can't wait to use that tech technique, although I think I think I understand what his point is, which is in A, b 2 b, and so I've done a lot of this for b 2 b, because I've been a b 2 b marketer, most of my career and and for b 2 b, you, you might argue, you might think that the decisions less emotional.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:50.000
But what I, what I actually I wrote an article about this where I actually think that A, b 2 b decision is actually more emotional than A B to C decision cause if you go and you pick up a chocolate bar at a grocery store, you buy it. You don't like the chocolate bar. What have you wasted? 4 95.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
But if you pick the wrong database, you lose your job.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So so my perspective is that the emotion? It's actually more emotional. And so for you to understand to what those emotional triggers are, am I gonna lose my job? Am I gonna get my next promotion, you know? And is my boss gonna like me? Those kind of things, I think, really pay, really play a huge role in this decision, making process.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Dave, I love.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Dave. I think I think we're gonna get along.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Yeah.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Yeah.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
You're already getting so much.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But I'll just offer up a quick thing. And then, Lily, I know you wanna speak in Kevin, just to clarify further.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
What he's doing there, and not to jump the gun too much, cause I'll get into detail about all of this.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Is, he's trying to get the person who he's interviewing.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
To remember.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
The the moment.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:47.000
So it's actually less about what percentage the milk was in and of itself, and more about, can this person get into that activated part of their memory of walking through the store.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And what they were there to do, because that'll help color the environment a little bit more and activate more of the things that might be more fuzzy in their mind until they revisit some of those specific details. So it's an actual interview technique that he learned from

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.000
The FBI there's more on Bob. And now he like developed the these techniques and how he's taught. You know, some of us like myself how to do them. But it's literally like actual like.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
You know, investigative techniques that are involved with that kind of questioning.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000
But hopefully, Kevin, you don't have to take my word for it. You'll have to find out as as we go and and learn from the process itself.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Yeah. Yeah. No. Sure.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Does that answer your question for now?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I also I have. I have a crazy statistic, by the way, so when you do, customer interviews like the job to be interviews for B. 2 B. There was a Harvard business School study that said that all you need to do is.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
12.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
In order to get to 98 accuracy across the rest of your population.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Which is insane.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
So thinking about.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
That's that's our magic number.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Like 6 sigma, right? Like, it's like 9 to 99%. You just let you 12. That's incredible. So that's a pretty cool Stat. They were always remembered.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Here we are!

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Dave is just doing our job. I really appreciate it. So everyone.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Yeah. Keep going.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Yep.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
As B Twob. Concerns. They've kind of hinted at that about the kind of emotional pool that actually exists within B twob, but we'll show you real frameworks that kind of like. Put that into a concrete model to understand this weekend.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:28.000
All I was gonna say for Kevin. That was a very good question, I can tell you. Have a deep comprehension of what was going on in that mattress in your view, to even ask that question. We do a mock interview every time we teach this, and when Neil and I teach this at Northwestern.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:47.000
One time we did an interview about a girl who bought some air pods. She was pretty convinced that she had bought them with her money from an internship while she was at home over the summer before she came back to school. So she finished the internship. She's at home. She comes back to school with new air pods. While Neil was asking her the questions that.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:58.000
The invasive questions. As you said, Kevin, what time was it? Where were you sitting like? Were you buying it on your phone on your laptop. She realized she didn't buy them before she got back to school.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
She bought them. Once she came back.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And it was like the 1st few weeks, and it was because all her roommates had bought the air pods she was convinced it was, her headphones were broken, and she said it was a functional purchase, but we realized it was actually a lot more social.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:33.000
So she felt like very left out, because it was when airports had just come out. All our friends had them, so she got convinced to buy them, even if she kind of was already thinking about buying new headphones. That's when she pulled the trigger. That was the purchase moment. So those kind of I wouldn't even call them invasive. I would just call them investigative questions are actually, what's gonna pull the truth out.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Awesome.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Yeah.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
No, definitely, I appreciate the insight guys that's that's helpful.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Good! Very good! Excellent! Call out!

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
You heard you had something.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I mean, I'm I'm just thinking out loud here. But this is something I've learned from this. While we were working on second analysis.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Because we want to analyze like big communities. And one thing that came up constantly across different studies is that what? When you ask someone in a leisure setting, or, you know, in a controlled environment.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
On, you know, if you ask them to tell you how they're feeling.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And the answer that they give usually doesn't coincide with what is actually happening. So the self expression of emotion on top is usually.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:40.000
You have to control for some error over there. And I I think the interview did an okay job at that. What I would like more and hopefully, you know, maybe we can, you know, do interviews that we, we can, you know, test this theory. But if the questions are more indirect, and if you drive conclusions from them, like, if you ask 3 different questions that do to.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Things.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Where.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
You know, those questions will hint at a specific scenario, and if you can verify that scenario, I think that's closer to truth.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Then what the person is. Actually, even though you're taking that person.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Like, even though you're rewinding time back in and then putting that person in that position. Even if you ask that person that, given second.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
His expression is usually.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:14.000
It tends to be messy and unreliable when it comes to the analysis.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I'm glad you called that out, and I'll I'll need your help as we go to like. Try to do more of that, because we're trying to go like.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
This is this is all.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Our history with this like framework and approach to customer discovery is.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
The original context, for this framework was not at the early stage that we were operating in.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
It was for later stage businesses.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
That ended up with heart working with Harvard, and some people introduced you to.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
To then like incorporate understanding from.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Like.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Very, very like robust data sets and access to lots of customers and demand.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
So at the early stage startup journey with this framework.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000
There's a few different kind of considerations, and and that's 1 of them. So just keep that in mind as we go that we're not just.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Imparting this information on you, or actually trying to continue to refine it as we go.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
So.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Yeah, I I mean, like even just said it. Like, when you're doing a v 2 sales, for example, like, I think this this point is even more relevant in the B 2 scenario, because, like, you know, that's where I'm.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
From. But you know.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.000
A a status. You're you're you're you're asking for money. They're giving you a no, but they're giving you a thousand one reasons why that no, is.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
But no. Well, it.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Well, then, those usually something much less fluffier, much more. But it's more real. Even when we're working at a you know role at a big corporate job, like people are usually known to mask their identity, and, you know, take on a different identity. So if you were to ask the person.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Which assumes that identity.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
It would.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
You would get one answer for why, you would get a no wall deep down. The motion that the real person is feeling is.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Computing a huge part on why, that no is that. Now.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
That's great food and one other carrot, I'll add, for those of you that are willing to go down. The journey is.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
There's a world where you can get.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
So, you know, I think it's good for us.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So good at this that the people that you ask to say yes.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
We're already gonna say yes. In the 1st place, because you had done the prep work required to know who to ask.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
So that's how well you can understand your customers if you take this process. So I'm looking forward to that with all of you.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
So excellent. Alright, I am gonna queue this up.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Let me know, Lilian, am I all good? Is it showing what I want to show.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
It's also showing your note on the right hand side.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Okay, got it?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Let's see here.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
I think you should.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
You can just stop sharing and only share the window.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
It's showing like your whole desktop like with your folders and stuff.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Oh, cool. Okay.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Let me see here, let's try again.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Share.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
What about this?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Is better.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Perfect.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Okay.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And you can pull.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Back up. We can't see it.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I think I got it.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
I'm gonna stop one more time and then reshare it.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Got it right.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
By the way, guys, we're our whole team is calling from our office today.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Yeah, we're here.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
There we go!

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Yeah backgrounds, Chloe, Neil's background. These are your.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Your suites here.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
That's the presenter display. Okay? Yeah.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Got it.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Whatever you did the second time was right. Yeah, that's perfect.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Alright, cool. Thank you.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
So

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Few things. One. My goal here is to explain how jobs to be done can help you with customer discovery. So I heard a lot about sales just now.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Sales.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Comes from a deep understanding of your customer. So while we might be slowing down for a week.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
And you all are eager to just figure out how to close more deals and get more people to say Yes.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
I promise you, if you trust our process, you'll have a more refined understanding of that discovery part which leads into.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
A better process for sales.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
And decision making. Overall your business.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:31.000
And also just compelling you to dig deeper about why people buy. And that's not just B to C, when we think b 2 b. We think entities and businesses saying, Yes.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
But at the end of the day, for all of you, it's still a human being at the end of the day that's making that decision.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Right. So you need to understand the humans that are involved in the journey within a business to say yes.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
I am not a formal person.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:54.000
For the most part, so I really have very few formalities that I'm interested in. You can interrupt. You can interject, you can disagree, you can challenge me. I am all about that.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
So just know that you're welcome to do that and ask anything.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
And then, I guess now getting into it.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
One quick question I have for you all is, why do you think it's called jobs?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
To be done.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Why not just customer research or customer interviews.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
It had to do with.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Your.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Hiring the product for.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
What you're using that pro. What job that product is meant to do.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Correct.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Right old terminology for it.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Correct. Yeah. So so a lot of people will go. Oh, this is just like another way of saving what problem you're Sol.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
And I go. No, no, no like, think about it.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
You are hiring.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
A business that has a product or service.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
To do a job for you. So what job are you hiring.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
That product or service as a very subtle distinction.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
But fundamentally important that very few people ask.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
As they're running and starting their business.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
So.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
With that in mind. We've put together some feedback that we've received over the past 5 years.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Do our mentor? Madness!

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So when you all go through mentor madness and you're gonna meet some of the best.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Smartest people that we know that we ask to help you.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Succeed.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:25.000
They give us feedback? Do they give feedback in the moment right afterwards? And and they meet with you. And they, you know, interact with you, but I have a session with each of the mentors where I get their feedback about what it was like to work with you in in your business and what they think of it. So we put together a a few snippets.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
From the feedback we've received from our mentors over the years that I thought would be helpful to share with all of you. Now.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Because this is just like straight from them. And it's something that was relatively consistent.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
And you know, we, we think is important to call out.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Use storytelling of current customers, experiences to help sell the product.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Don't chase your customers. Understand your customers.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Focus less on sales until you know your customers.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Stop building out technology focus on the business.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Stop thinking of your company as a technology and start thinking about it as a problem. You're solving.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
You're too obsessed with product.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Hit the brakes on the tech dev work on the business and storytelling immediately before continuing to work on the tech.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Sharpen the story. They didn't talk about the customer product in their intro. That's a problem.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
So my point.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Is that this has helped many of our past founders succeed, because even after we teach you all of this for the next couple of weeks.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
You're gonna go into our program.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
You're gonna meet with all these other people, with investors, and some of you are still going to struggle to speak.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
From the perspective of the customer as you talk about, and introduce your business.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
So it will be inevitable feedback that some of you will face. But our job here is to do as much work as we can to prepare you for that.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
And to give you even more awareness and ammo.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
To circumvent it.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
So I have a few examples of companies that I have worked directly with amongst our tech programs that I'm particularly proud of, and the insights that they gained.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
During the program leading into successful and sustainable businesses. This is real crafter.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
They've worked with some of the like. Most.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Prominent composers and and producers of of content on like Netflix and Amazon, and.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Things like that. And they had to do a lot of work to understand who exactly they were selling to. And I remember coming into program.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
They were at like 3 or 4 Kmr, they're more of a bootstrap business, so they're not venture back in any phenomenal way. They're a small team.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
But I think they're about to hit 40.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000
And they've done that very slowly, in a very iterative way, and I'm really excited to see they're very slow and smooth trajectory.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
But they have very low expenses, too. So that's a fun business that we helped out with jobs to be done.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Havoc. So this one's on the b 2 b side and obviously they're a bit more for both, and straightforward. But Brian, I think I think he closed his.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
7 million round few years ago.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:03.000
And seems to be gearing up for the next wave potentially a series a but on the the cyber security front he was one of our standouts on the b 2 b side with the jobs to be done. Framework.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Going back to B to C. We have Jake from zest who you are gonna get to know very well. He's 1 of our favorite founders to have come back and speak to our classes. He was actually a former student of mine at Northwestern graduated.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Quit his job, and then started a business that I then rejected. I think twice to get into techs ours and ultimately accept it. So we'll tell you that whole story one day. But I believe just closed a 2.5 million dollar round.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Made it to final stages with firms like Sequoia out here in the valley. Jason Calicanus is on his cap table twice.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:47.000
He's done quite a good job with the business that I was not excited about at all. Because you teach a college class like me. Every business at a college student wants to start is related to like food.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Or sleep.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Or you know all the things that they have life experiences with which isn't much so that was a surprise to me that he managed to get this far with business that I'm actually now pretty excited about and then there's boom filter. So that's going back to the b 2 b side but.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:15.000
I'm really, really proud of them. They close the 7 million. Last year. I shared the stage with the CEO Andrew earlier this year in front of a bunch of tech stars lps.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
But.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
He was he gave credit to. I think jobs to be done in particular is something that helped him out disproportionately during our program.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
And then, last, but not least, our big, our big fish, Nutris.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
So nutrisens, probably, at least amongst the 100 and.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
50 companies that I've invested in the the largest or most successful on paper.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
For now.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
They're valued at over a hundred 1 million dollars they're making, I think.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
I don't know 3 or 4 million dollars in revenue a month right now.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:55.000
They've got over 100 employees. They're doing quite well, and they provide software augmented with the continuous monitor to help people with their diet and health.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:05.000
So really excited about these companies, and you'll meet most of these founders and many others as the program goes on. But I thought I'd introduce you to them, because they've all trusted.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
The this process at this stage.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
And it's back when they, you know, had little to nothing with their businesses, and they're now doing all quite well.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Cool.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Alright, so I'll keep chugging along. And and I guess my last point here is that many of our past companies would have benefited from running this if they had taken it more seriously. So whenever I have to take the really.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Sad call of a company shutting down or winding down, or needing to do a massive pivot, or, you know, having to let people go to save money. And we reflect on what we've learned and what we think we could have done differently or better. And a lot of the times.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I would say more times than any other example I can think of.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
It's typically related to something on the front of the demand side. Understanding.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Of who they were selling to, and what they were selling.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And what effort they put into place to actually get to those people in the right way.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
It's almost always related to something on those end. It's less about some sort of.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Silly mistake that gets made, or, you know, one strategic misstep or feature that the product didn't have.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:15.000
It's it's usually less on the supply side and more on the demand side that a lot of the challenges come to come to bear with early stage businesses.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:30.000
So here's a screenshot of a to do list that you will have access to in permanent, and I share this upfront before I get into the overview of this framework because I want you all to know you don't have to memorize what you're about to hear.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
You don't even need to.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Take copious notes you're welcome to, of course, if that helps you. But I just want you to know that everything that I'm gonna talk about.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Is.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Very like, strongly laid out in detail, step by step, for what exactly I would recommend you do to do this right.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
So whether or not you're even available for the next 2 weeks. To take this fully.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
You will have.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Lifetime access to my exact.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Prescription for how to go about doing this in a way that I I think would be best, and that I learned from the people who taught this framework to me.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Cool.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
So.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Defining the problem.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
So a lot of the times when you all meet with other founders, or you're gonna.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
You know you're talking to each other. You all presented your businesses yesterday.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I asked people, you know. Oh, what do you do with your business? And they begin to tell me. Oh, well, we offer this, or we do that, and.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
You know, it's all about whatever your solution is.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
And I end up having to cut founders off or people off when I talk to them, and I go wait a sec. Tell me a story.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
That simplifies the problem that you're solving. And what happens when your solution makes life better for them?

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:42.000
And when I ask people that question to tell a story it slows things down a good amount, because now, all of a sudden, you're forced to.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Humanize and personalize what's going on rather than just talking.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Typically at a technical level about what it is functionally that your business does.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
So I think whether it's.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Talking to investors, whether you're trying to get new customers or you're trying to figure out what product development feature you should like focus on next.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Being able to articulate and.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Truly understand the customer's progress.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Is the most important thing that you could be investing your energy into.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
So I treat us to be done as my like product development, secret weapon.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Because, as Kevin already said, people don't buy products or services, they hire them to help them make progress in their life.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000
So the original tried and true example here is, people don't want to buy a quarter inch drill. What do they want?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Feel free to unmute.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
I don't want a quarter, but I want.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Assemble my Ikea cupboard.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:45.000
I yes, so let's go from there. So usually it's quarter. I don't want to drill, but I want a whole. Why do they want the whole. They want a whole, because they have something to.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
A symbol, or put together, or hang on a wall.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And then I have that thing to like for me. I hang things on walls like this like motivational posters.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
I have some of these for you all in this office. Ready to go up.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:06.000
But because I wanna motivate myself to get things done, or I wanna use that Ikea Assembly to, you know, put books on to read, to draw inspiration from, to serve as a zoom background.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
And then from all of that well.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
What's my motivation of wanting to have.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
A motivational poster or something inspiring on the wall. It's to be more productive to get things done.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And then the list goes on and on, so I don't know if you all have ever heard of this framework called the 5 Wise.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000
But they say, don't ask why, just one time you have to ask at least 5 to get closer to the truth of what somebody really wants.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:36.000
It gets to the point where it gets a little too deep, so you have to call it some point. So we went from a drill all the way to. I'm trying to be productive.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
That reform hanging things on the wall. Therefore I need to drill, and therefore I need a hole.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
But at some point you call it, and you have to know kind of where that existential moment would.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
You know, cross the line so.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
The way I want you all to think about it is kind of like there's this person.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000
And whether they're in a business trying to sign off on behalf of the business or a direct consumer. Still, at the end of the day. There's a person trying to get someone.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
So how do we get them there?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
So there's a struggling moment that they're going through this current circumstance. They're in.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
And there's the progress and the idea of a new way that they're gonna try to attain.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And that's all we're here to help you all for, and figure out.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
So jobs to be done, in my view, is.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
All about understanding, of.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
The Y underneath the choices that they're making.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
And that causality.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
And also, you know, the causal mechanisms might be more than one. But we're looking for the majority.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Influencer. So the Pareto principle, the 80 20% of the effort produces 80% of the yield.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:45.000
So that that whole notion of what is the most sensitive aspect of the causal inputs for someone to make a decision.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And then, lastly, on a point of humility for us.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
When you think about that customer and where they want to go.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
We are merely the bridge to getting them there.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
I think a lot of the time we think of our businesses as.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
The most important thing, because it is the most important thing to us.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
But the customer just treats us as a pathway to get to what they want.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.000
They're not necessarily betting at all on on who we are, what we're about, and if a better us comes along, they're happy to switch.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
So we have to keep that in mind throughout the entire journey.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Also.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
There's what I perceive most people to address which are typically symptoms and speaking on problems.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
But we're here to also dig into the root causes.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:32.000
You know what are the things that are actually underlying the behaviors that are more obvious to us? And how do we get down to those to better understand.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
How to help our customers succeed.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
So with all this in mind, I have a quick fun side track journey to share.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
With you all.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Has anyone seen this video with Professor Clay Christensen.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Yes.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Vdi.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Have you all seen it?

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Let's see.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Is, this is.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
It was part of our homework actually.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Okay, got it. Okay, good. So let's talk about it. Then, if you've seen it, that's great.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.000
But you guys are just awesome. Cause it wasn't part of the homework. It was like Linkedin, the optional optional resources. That's why you're all here. I'm very.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Hear that!

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Built next.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
They did. This is great. So has anyone here not seen this video?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I did, I saw a couple of mouths of not seeing it.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Okay, all right. So if you all don't mind, it's 4 min long.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Is it okay? If we watch it.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Is that okay?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Yeah, it's awesome.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Okay. Cool. Cool.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Let's do that.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000
I'm gonna switch it up.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.000
4 min, and then we will jam, share, sound.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Cool. Let me know if this comes through properly.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Good.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Hi! My name's Clay Christensen. I'm a professor at the Harvard Business School.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I'm proud with me. A set of puzzles all related to innovation.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
We decided that the way we teach marketing is at the.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Of what makes motivation difficult to achieve.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
The most helpful way. We've thought of it so far.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Is that we actually hire products to do things for us.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:23.000
And understanding what job we have to do in our lives for which we would hire a product.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Is really the key to cracking this problem.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Of motivating.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Customers to buy what we're offering.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
So I wanted just to tell you a story about a project we did for one of the big fast food restaurants.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
They were trying to goose up the sails of their milkshakes.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:48.000
They had just studied this problem up the Gazoo. They brought in customers who fit the profile of the quintessential milkshake consumer.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000
They give them samples, and ask, Could you tell us how we can improve our milkshakes? So you'd buy more of them.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Do you want a chocolatey, or cheap, or chunky, or chewy, or.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Make it very clear feedback. They would then improve the milkshake on those dimensions, and it had no impact on sales or profits whatsoever.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Okay, yeah. You might want to guess what business.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Place, talking about.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Mcdonald's.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Mcdonald's.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
It's Mcdonald's. It is Mcdonald's. That is the so he's from Harvard Business School. They're dealing with the.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
The largest and most successful fast food restaurant.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Company of all time.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
He's very politely alluding to them in a vague way, but he's being pretty obvious and clear.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Now the process he just described that they were going through to get feedback about their milkshakes, I think, should sound familiar to many of you about.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
How you all, or some of you, have probably tried to get feedback from your customers or potential customers.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Right you. You present them with options, you ask them for feedback. Ask them which ones they like, and then they tell you, and then you do those things and.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
You're like, why am I not selling more.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Why aren't they paying me more.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:03.000
So, although we're talking about milkshakes, I hope you can see the parallels to any of your businesses, because it's gonna continue.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
So one of our colleagues went in with a different question on his mind.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:16.000
I wonder what job arises in people's lives that cause them to come to this restaurant to hire a milkshake.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
So we stood in a restaurant for 18 h one day and just took very careful data.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:31.000
What time did they buy these milkshakes? What were they wearing? Were they alone? Did they buy other food with it? Did they eat it in the restaurant, or drive off with it.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
It turned out that nearly half of the milkshakes were sold before 8 o'clock in the morning.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
This is my favorite part to pause that so, for those of you who have not seen this video.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
What do you think is happening.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:55.000
At Mcdonald's for people to buy milkshakes before 8 o'clock in the morning.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Any guesses.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Because that's pretty weird.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Breakfast.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Somebody said breakfast.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Yeah.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Okay. Milkshake for breakfast.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Karim, did you wanna say I saw you on mute.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Are you?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
I was. I was thinking about the same as well. I mean, I've had ice cream for breakfast before.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Alright!

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
The start of.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Are they playing for their kids?

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
What Nick.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Are they bang for their kids on the way to school?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Hmm.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Hmm, interesting.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Something to eat during their brunch or something during the office hours.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
So that they could get it earlier.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
During.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Like. They buy it early to work to eat at the office.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Got it.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Think like a snack in between.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Morning time they can have during their office.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:04.000
It's so interesting to deal with professional adults, because sometimes when we ask our college students this, they're like, Oh, obviously, they were partying.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Yeah.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
They were out late. Yeah, this is a late night. Milkshake. Any other.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Quick hunches, ideas.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Or hit, play.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Merry day.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Like Frappuccinos, or something.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Okay. So I mean, obviously, I don't know if you can tell by the dated Imax in the in the video here. But this is a long time ago.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:32.000
This is recorded. So Mcdonald's is clearly changed. A lot of what it does and what it offers. Since.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
You know you're about to learn a little bit more about why, but I'll just say that at the time.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Finding out, by looking at the data that half of their milkshakes were being sold before 8 o'clock in the morning was.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Like jaw, dropping.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
It was like what is even happening here, and there is a possibility that some of you.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
With the right set of, you know, research steps and questions. You might learn really surprising things about how some of your potential customers.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Are, gonna use your products.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
So let's find out.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:06.000
The people who bought them were always alone. It was the only thing they bought, and they all got in the car and drove off with it.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:17.000
So to figure out what job they were trying to hire it to do. We came back the next day and stood outside the restaurant, so we could confront these folks as they left milkshake in hand.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
And in language that they could understand, we.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Excuse me, please, but I've got to sort this puzzle out.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000
What job were you trying to do for yourself that caused you to come here and hire that milkshake.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Indeed struggle to answer, so we then helped them by asking other questions like.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Think about the last time you were in the same situation.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Needing to get the same job done. But you didn't come here to hire a milkshake. What did you hire.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.000
And then, as we put all of their answers together, it became clear that they all had the same job to do in the morning.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
And that is, they have a long and boring drive to work.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000
And they just needed something to do while they drove to keep the commute had to be on the wheel.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
But somebody given him another hand, and there wasn't anything in it.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
And they just needed something to do while they drove.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:21.000
They weren't hungry yet, but they knew hungry by 10 o'clock, so they also wanted something that would just pull down there and stay for their morning. Good question, what do we hire when they do this job? You know I've never framed the question that way before, but.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Last Friday I heard a banana to do the job.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Take my word for it, never hire bananas.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
They're gone in 3 min. You're hungry by 7, 30.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
If you promise not to tell my wife. I probably hire donuts twice a week, but.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
They don't do it well, either. They're gone fast. They crumb all over my clothes. They get my fingers.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Sometimes I hire bagels, but, as you know, they're so dry and tasteless.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:53.000
And I have to steer the car with my knees while I'm putting jam on them. And then if the phone rings, we've got a crisis.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000
I remember I hired a snickers bar once, but I felt so guilty I've never hired snickers again.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Let me tell you, when I come here and hire this milkshake. It is so viscous.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
That it easily takes me 20 min to suck it up. That thin little straw.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Who cares what the ingredients are? I don't.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:23.000
All I know is, I'm full all morning, and it fits right here in my cup, holder. Well, it turns out that the milkshake does the job better than any of the competitors.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Which in the customer's minds are not Burger King Milkshakes, but its bananas, donuts, snickers, bars, coffee, and so on.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
But I hope you can see how, if you understand the job.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:44.000
How to improve the product becomes just obvious.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Okay, so let's do a quick debrief on that. Thanks for humoring us again for those who took the time to watch it already.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
But I'd love to discuss this a little bit further, and just anything to sit out to you.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
That was all. Intuitive.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000
And and maybe what you learned, and then I have a quick exercise for us to go through about that.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
The initial reactions or feedback.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Yeah. Agent. Lunar.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Oh, I'm smiling. I mean, this is one of my favorite interviews. I've read the book about it, you know this. It gets me really excited. So I'm glad that you shared it. But I think for me the biggest standout moment, and it gets me every time is when he mentions that the biggest like the competitor. It wasn't Burger King, or I can't remember the other ones that he mentioned now, but it wasn't fast food, restaurants, etc.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
The donut or the snickers bar, and that's the bit.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
I have. We have to remind ourselves all the time. It's not always.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000
The competitors that come to your mind. In your customers, mind, and I think that's just so valuable.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Just yeah, initial reaction.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Yeah, I I couldn't agree more. It's it's all about the the true competitive set, not just the direct competitive set.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And when I meet most founders, and the reason most of them don't get investment from me is because I hear so many of them say, well, we don't have any competition, or our competitors are these companies that are doing the exact same thing as us? But we're better. And I'm like, yeah. But who else.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Because most of the people you want to serve are already doing something, and it's none of you.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
So tell me what they're doing, and very few people do that well, or understand that. Well.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Morgan.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
For me, it was kind of the realization like cause I never. I mean, I love this video. I never would have guessed.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000
That people were using it. I find people put some comments in the chat. I find it kind.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Gross to drink a milkshake at college for me was a long time ago, so it wouldn't have come to mind. So, remembering to be like.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Humble for what your customer wants. So even if it's the top of my mind, I think this is what people will love like to remember like that might not be true. And to to really get the feedback from the customers. Make sure you're building a product they will want. And maybe you know.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Take yourself down a peg about what you think will be the ultimate.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Well, well, let me ask you this, Morgan, have you ever had cereal for breakfast?

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Yes, but yeah, not not too.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Have you had yogurt.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Yes.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Okay. So now we're trending in the direction of would before Mcdonald's.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Had the things that we now know that they offer.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Or smoothie.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
They didn't have these same things. So when you don't.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Yeah.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Right or smoothie. Right? So so there's these things that there's the job of what needs to be done. And then, because.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Mcdonald's has a drive-through.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Right. I can go there to get an adjacent like.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Replacement for the thing that I probably would want instead, which might make me feel less guilty. Right milkshake sounds a terrible thing to have for breakfast, but when you go to yogurt, or it's a smoothie all of a sudden. It doesn't sound so crazy right.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
So we're actually jumping the gun to my exercise. This is perfect.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
What I wanted you all to do is put yourself in one of 2 camps.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
You're at Mcdonald's on the executive team, and you're.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
On the marketing team.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Or you're on the product team.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:15.000
And I want you all to tell me as an executive on the marketing or product team, what you would do differently with these new insights that we have with this Harvard Research team that we employ to help us understand why our customers are buying milkshakes before 8 o'clock in the morning.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
So any marketers or product people in the room want to tell me what you do as an executive at Mcdonald's.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Now that you know what's going on.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:30.000
I mean, like, what comes to mind is, I'm a marketer, or, you know, product, person.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
But does that data dude.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
What comes to mind is, I would try to collect.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
The average distance of.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
The drive that these people are making.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
And then somehow try to figure out the average or median.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Milk intake per kilometers and then try optimizing my portions around that I guess.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Okay.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Help me understand this more. I wanna make sure, because I I've never heard anyone say what you're saying right now. So I'm having a great time. This is like new content for me. So yeah, I'm like, I, I want marketers. And for product people, you're like, I'm the dude. What's the distance in the media and the consumption. I'm like, all right. Bro, let's go so tell me what you're trying to solve, for by calculating that.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Well, the problem is, if you're buying a milkshake, and if it's and if it's if you're hiring the milkshake, solve the problem of keeping you occupied while you're driving to work.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
That means that if that shake is.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Too early gone down then. That's a bad thing, because you know the human mind things, and you'll be like, oh, I had the milkshake before, and now I don't have that.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Alright!

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Or the option B is, if that if the if you can't consume the milkshake.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Since it's a multi team to have a milk check for breakfast, and you'll be judged by, you know.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Yes.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Workers or the office people that you're in. You don't want to walk into an office at 8 o'clock with a milk shake in your hand.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
So it's like, you know. I would want it to be gone.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
How do I finish this before I'm there? Yeah.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Umhm.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Okay.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Thanks.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
So so my question for you is, I'm putting you on the product team. Mr. Data. So what do you change about the product, to optimize for that.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Well, I recall.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Reading something else about the same thing.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.000
On a different resource. I'm a bit influenced by that, but I think they've experimented with the straw.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000
And how that is influencing the intake. But that's not my original idea.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Correct.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Yeah, maybe.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Yeah.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Well, they they did. They did do that like. What you're saying is exactly what they did. They changed the straw, they made it larger, and then they also changed the viscosity of.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
The drink itself.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Yeah, I I've read this before.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Right so they could adjust how quickly it's consumed. That's right. You got it. That's a good product changes to make.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Dave, I'll kick it to you.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Yeah, as a, as a marketer, I I rebranded as a breakfast.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
And then I charge extra for it.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Very good.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Kevin.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Yeah, I'd start expanding into.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Different little breakfast items that serve that same.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Purpose as what the milkshake is being used for. It's a little like.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Pancake bites I don't know. Cut the.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Could the sausage me muffin in half, make into a wrap? I don't know like anything.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:24.000
That people were looking to do with the milkshake they can now do with other menu items at Mcdonald's.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.000
That's right. That's right. You're thinking precisely around the job. That's good.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000
I think because the problem statement revolves around the commute.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
So what I'll have to do is all the packaging to reduce condensation. Perhaps.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
You're at.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:47.000
That would be something that makes it a little bit more price, more sales. Because okay, the Mcdonald's milkshake is packaged in the way that it makes less of a mess in the car.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
So I perhaps look to optimize for that.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:56.000
That's 1 and then the other one, because, like just hearing feedback from people that have been.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Opposition to milkshakes of breakfast. Perhaps, like the breakfast milkshake, makes a lot of sense like, just different from the regular one.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000
And then become something that we branch off into.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Those would be the 2 things that come to mind.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Yes.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Content and the nutrition facts.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
It's similar.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Not too different.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Alright, Cesar!

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Yeah, I guess one of the reasons big shakes are preferred is also that they are called.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000
As opposed to hot, which is a which may be incumbent to have while driving so.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000
And probably after a while people will get bored from.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Having milkshakes every morning, so.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000
I would have more varieties in cold products, like.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Drinkable or eat all but yeah.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Great.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Alright!

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Kind of am I saying your name correctly?

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000
It's true.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Choru.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Yeah.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000
And so I would probably like associate with the breakfast items as.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Andrew.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Idea, but.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
I would like make them.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Comparable.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Like.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000
With a marketing like.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Here's a bacon, egg calories, and the nutrition counts, and here is our mix.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Nutritious properties. So PI would just like to make people feel less guilty to have a milk check instead of having a breakfast.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Got it. So addressing the the guilt factor, then for those. So it's it basically to bring in potentially additional consumers.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Yeah, like, I was promoted a bit more like a healthier option rather than having a breakfast like cooking all those things, and.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Like having.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Just like a condensed version.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Of bacon and eggs, or.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Something else.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Maybe like.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Play with the.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Taste a bit like to, so they can.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Maybe have.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Like a serial taste. They all love, or something else.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Great.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Let's keep going, Annie.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
I think you are muted sorry.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Sorry. I'm curious if Mcdonald's did this because of this study. But I know Mcdonald's now offers like competitive with Starbucks and those sorts of things. So I think.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:39.000
I would be, you know, I'd be interested to see if that was a direct response to this type of study.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Right.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Well, it. It kind of opened the floodgates to a lot of changes, right? So I I can't give all this one story credit for everything that they've done.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:52.000
But it was in the early stages of a deeper level of understanding of what actual consumption is is caused by.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Right, and that can lead to an organizational kind of paradigm shift, if you will, as far as how people think about understanding what their customers want.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Interesting. Thank you.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Alright, agent, lunar team.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Yeah, I'm just thinking through the lens of a market something.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.000
That Mcdonald's may not have thought about prior to these findings was.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Advertising where their customers are, and one of the other insights is that their customers are actually commuters. So putting ads where the customer is so.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Yes.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Billboards on the side of the road which we see now, but perhaps they forgot to put.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
One didn't think to put.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
A milkshake at 7 or 8 am.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000
So that could be a.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Yes.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Take away!

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000
And acknowledge their commute, meet them where they are, acknowledge how bored they might be.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
And maybe target those ads for those peak traffic.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Areas where you're slogging through and rush hour. And you're like, what am I gonna do? So you you there's a lot of detail and thought that can go into where to place these things. Once you have a better understanding of what they're going through right.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Yeah.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
For sure.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
So I love this example everyone, because.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000
I think most of us can relate to at least one or some of the products mentioned.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000
You know.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Bananas, donuts.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Candy bars, milkshakes, Breakfast Mcdonald's.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000
These are all household, familiar things. We all eat food at some point in our lives.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Hopefully daily, most of us, but.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000
That being said, I hope you're seeing a hint of a parallel.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Whether it's software, whether it's something highly technical, whether it's.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:41.000
You know, some deep tech, you know business that you're you're building. There's still a connection here to the theme of.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:48.000
What someone's hiring it to do may not be always obvious or directly related to what you're assuming.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:56.000
And that is the lesson that I want to keep going down the road with. But also, I think in just 15 min.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
We did essentially what I'm hoping to teach you all in over the next couple of weeks.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Which is, we got an understanding. We talked, they talked, play, talk to these customers, figured out what job they were actually hiring it to do, and based on that, we put ourselves into the shoes of both.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Marketing and sales and product development. And we asked ourselves, what can we change? Given what we now know about what our customers actually want.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000
That is what I want you all to do. That is what we're gonna help you all do in perpetuity. And, by the way, you don't do it once.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
You do it throughout the lifecycle of your business.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Because as you grow and as you scale, and as you acquire more customers.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
The needs will shift, they'll change. They'll evolve and expand.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So you're gonna have to integrate these types of into the DNA and fabric of your business, to continue to innovate and be successful and competitive, as more people realize that your business is doing well, and they want a piece of your pie.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000
So just keep all of this in mind as we go, but I hope that was a useful kind of exercise for us to initially go through here.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
All right.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Any last questions before we move on to the rest of my content. Here.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Alright so clay, you may know from something else.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
He wrote a book in the.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Leave late 80 s.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Called the innovators. Dilemma.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:28.000
So some of you may have read this if you either went to business school, or you're like one of those cool business nerds like myself.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It's a phenomenal resource to understand the origin of innovation. Clay was actually the academic who is credited with and coined the term disrupt.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
So I know when we say disrupt, especially in Silicon Valley. It's like almost like a cliche.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
But in this book the innovators dilemma.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000
He actually coined the term disruption in the context of small upstart businesses, disrupting larger and more entrenched.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Corporations with technology and business, and in a way that actually gives credit. And you know, meaning to the term, it's not just.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Use in a superfluous way. So when I use the notion of disrupt, I'm not really.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Against using cliche, or more commonly used terms or phrases, if they have meaning. And this one means a lot to me, because the disruptive businesses are the ones that tend to be the best investments and the most valuable.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So I want you all to be comfortable, thinking of.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Being disruptive within your, you know, respective industries and markets, because if you do, you're more likely to succeed.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
But there's another book he came out with. Believe this was over the past. Let's see, it's 24.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
When was it Liliana? Like? Maybe like 20.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Yeah.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
16 or 17 when he came out with this book, like I I at the point he wrote this book, I knew him.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And and had had interacted with him and a few others in this world. So

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:05.000
The bob, the person who I'm also gonna introduce you to. Who was the person who conducted the mattress interview. He's also mentioned in this book. But it's basically the follow up from the innovators dilemma to talk more about jobs to be done, and the notion of competing against luck.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
By actually developing an understanding of your of your customers.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
So

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Couple resources that I know you all are familiar with, but I want to revisit, because these are the most important ones. For the next couple of weeks, as well for us.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Before the program officially starts.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
One is this timeline.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
So.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
This is what I have pulled up in front of me whenever I am conducting a customer.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I treat it kind of like a game. I have a template that's blank. So meaning. I know these fields, but there's space for me to fill in notes and details in between them.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
But the notion here is that as you're having your conversation to get to know your you know customer.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Or the person you're interviewing.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
There's a pattern that tends to fall into place, and it's not precisely.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:58.000
This number of of of spaces there could be more or less depending on who you're talking to. But for the most part there's a phase that people go through of.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Passively thinking about making change.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000
There's something that activates them into a phase of. Now I want to make a change. There's a moment where a decision gets made and a change.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Happens. And then there's the consumption post change. Meaning, how is it going? Is it working, is it not? And do I change again.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Or am I happy?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
So this is a loop.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
This is a time. Loop.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And this is relevant both for B, 2 B+B to C.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I promise.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000
And this is relevant both at B, 2 B, with the smaller medium sized business, or at the Enterprise level.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Because there's just multiple forces, hierarchies, and people involved in those in those journeys.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000
But this timeline has been tried and true, for I think a couple decades now, as far as this framework is concerned.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Secondly.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
After the interview is conducted. There are now the forces of progress.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:54.000
That we have to evaluate and analyze. So during the interview itself, we're mapping the timeline and make sure we have it down.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Host interview. We're then asking ourselves.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Okay. What were the forces?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
That were identified in this conversation that drove them to either make a decision or.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
You know, kept them from moving forward towards a new behavior.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
So.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000
The way this kind of goes is, I go? Okay? Well, what were the pushes? What were the things that were driving somebody to make something better.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And what was drawing them to it. Instead of that. So a push is something like.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I'm driving my car, and I get a flat tire.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
My push is.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Well, I I need to get my.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
My wheel fixed so that can keep driving my car.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Can anyone think in my car analogy, example, what a poll might be.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Compared to the push of the.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Flat tire.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Maybe better tires for driving through snow.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Oh!

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Have been invented.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Interesting. Yeah. So the notion there would be like, Okay, this will. This will help me be more performance oriented. And within a particular context.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
But.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Yeah, in Montana, they think about that a lot. Whenever a new type of tire, everybody's excited.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Yeah. Got it? Any.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Perhaps, going downhill, or.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Though I have a more indirect example to share. Cause, I think it's relevant. Given that we're in the Bay Area.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I don't need a new car, but I really like the Tesla.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Right, and what it would say about me being here and fitting in.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
So.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I know it's not a tire. So just I know I'm taking a little bit more of a leap. But the whole notion is that there's problems that people solve by either buying new cars or upgrading their cars or replacing things on their cars that break.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And then there's a whole notion of like.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I don't need a new car. I already have a car. It works.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
But.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
This car is going to make me feel differently or better, or has a promise of something that I'm excited about and drawn to.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
So understanding the difference between a push and a pull with your customers is really important.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Because some of you had businesses that are inherently.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Can can live in the Push quadrant.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And don't even need many other forces to be at play to make progress, because you're dealing with someone who has an acute problem that you directly solve. And there's a functional, the relationship that you have with them that you can kind of bank on and and focus on. But more often than not all 4 quadrants are active for certain people in the sales and decision making process.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
So the poll contrasts to the push.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
You want to have in combination, right? So you don't want just people to have problems. You want them to get excited.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000
About becoming a better version of themselves by becoming your customer.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Right. What else is that going to help them become, rather than just addressing the issue? Will this make me happier, healthier? And what have you.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And then, when it comes to the forces of resistance.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
So the habits and anxieties.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Another analogy that I really like to use. I like to talk about.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Switching operating systems. Anyone ever had to switch from Mac to PC or PC. To Mac.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000
If you've had to do that, then you probably understand these forces quite well, because for me.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I remember I was like this, really obnoxious, hardcore, PC. Nerd.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
You know, as a kid.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:26.000
And going into college, and I just looked. I frowned upon people who thought Mac was good, cause you couldn't change anything. You couldn't customize anything, and you know there's you had to pay a lot of money to have some fancy, shiny looking thing, and it just didn't. It wasn't as powerful as anything I could build. And I was just like this, totally judgmental kid.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And then.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I think in when I was in college. That's when the 1st iphone came out like, right when I was a freshman.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And I remember I got the iphone, even though I had a Dell Xvs laptop.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And I had to ask myself.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Why is my phone.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Better and faster to use in my laptop.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And then, all of a sudden, a year later, I find myself with a macbook.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
So I just remember going through that journey, and being a total hypocrite, is switching the back and never looking back.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
From having this like phenomenal initial product experience with the 1st iphone.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So I say all that to say. There's my habit of what I'm comfortable with in the present of. I know windows. I know the shortcuts. I know how it all works, and there's the anxiety of a new solution meaning like, I gotta learn a new way of doing things. There's a different button. There's new stuff to learn like. I don't have time for that. I'm just trying to pass my university classes.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:23.000
So. And there's many other examples of these, but I just use those accessible ones, because I I think many of you all can relate to them.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
But the journey for all of you is one, the 1, 2 punches.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
What is going on in this user's journey and timeline. It will teach you to ask the right questions, to fill this out, and then 2.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
What are these forces that are both promoting progress and resisting change?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
That my potential customer is experiencing right now, and how can I better understand that.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Once you are able to document these.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
2 things. Well.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
With well defined.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Individuals who fit the right criteria that you're trying to learn the most about.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
To Dave's point earlier.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
You only need about 12 of these.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
To get to some phenomenal insights that I would actually back you in making.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Substantial changes to either your product.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Your marketing and sales process.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Or your business overall.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And its direction.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I've.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Coach founders to make significant changes to their business.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Just with 10 to 15 of these high quality, because the patterns that will emerge will become very evident over time.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
In the process of conducting these interviews.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So much, so.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
That by the 10th or 11th conversation.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.000
It's almost a formality that you're conducting it, because you can predict what they're going to say.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Because they fit into 1, 2, or 3 different categories that you've already uncovered.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
From a set of jobs that they might be hiring you to do.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
So that's.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:00.000
The magic process that I'm alluding to. I can't guarantee or promise it, but I can absolutely, you know, provide you all with the best possible pathway to try to get there yourselves.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Alright. We got 2 questions.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Hugger, and then Kevin.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Yeah, quick.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Quick one. Can you go back to a slide where you have these looking, active looking thing? This is something that we've.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Struggled with. While we were conducting our interviews.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Application process. But we found that this, like I want to ask, is this set in stone like these steps that you know we have to take like, because usually, maybe it's because of the nature of our business.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:42.000
The interviews that we conducted were okay. I wasn't thinking about this at all for a very long time, and then suddenly something happened. And boom. I have to think about it right now. Possibly look at it. I have to look at it, decided all at the same time.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
So it was really hard to.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
All of these different things.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And like I remember we we had an interview where you know the dude was like, well, we didn't care about this issue at all at all, or like we didn't think that this was a thing to be looked at. But suddenly.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:13.000
People give us feedback from different channels, and we weren't able to look at them. And then, like suddenly, we have the really big deal to explain to our investors. And you know, we we have a lot of churn. So we immediately needed something to fix the problem.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:27.000
So like I'm I'm really wondering. Are these steps set in stone, or you know.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Yeah.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
How does this look like in the time window that we're trying to? Is it because some of these steps can simultaneously act at the same time.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
At least to my experience.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
So I think I really appreciate your question, and what I'll say is.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
No, they're not completely set in stone, but they might be more.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Persistent than you might imagine. Given what I just heard you say.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
So, even if there's a more expedited timeline for these events to happen.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
It's still largely maps to these steps.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Some have a more condensed timeline, but more often than not.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
That first.st

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Happens a lot sooner than you may think.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And when you're having a conversation with someone, they might think in their mind that something was an immediate.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Choice or decision that happened out of nowhere, and it was a rapid process.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:18.000
But if you dig enough, you might realize that there were more inputs leading up to their readiness to take action. In that moment.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
But like you said like, I'll give the example right. I'm driving my car.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I get a flat tire that that's not really.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
There's not a very like.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Long turnaround time from a moment where I need to make progress and the decision I have to make about what I'm going to do about it? Right? So that's the example that would, you know fit into, I think, what you're describing. But my only ask is that.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
You.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Give this a little bit of time to settle in with the people you talk to.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Because I do find more often than not.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
95% or more of the time when I'm doing this with all the companies that I've worked with.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.000
There is more than enough to not only fill in the information presented here, but usually more.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:04.000
So this is just a starting point for most of you. Some you may have more condensed, but many of you will have more expansion.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Around.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I think Kevin had his hand raised, and then Monica.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Yeah, I think this question is slightly more specific to.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Me and Nick.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Our purchasing.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Our buyer is unique in the sense that students use it.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
But parents make the final.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Make that make the actual purchase.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Or so we think, and I think in the process of.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
When we do these interviews.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
How would you.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I guess decide.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
How many students, how important this interview to students, how important to interview.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
The parents at Maket final purchase our assumption. And maybe it's a risky assumption is that.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
If students do, the research, parents always say Yes.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
But I think.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.000
That assumption would be dangerous, because with the parents I had said no, they probably had their own decision to say, no, they don't.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Buy this product. Well, we would never hear from them, because.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
There. We didn't have input from.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000
The students that asked the parents and their parents know if this, if this question makes sense.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
No, it makes perfect sense. So there are plenty of examples where the customer is different than the consumer.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Yeah.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And this is also related to B, 2 B. So good example for B, 2 B. Right, because you have the person who decides to buy. But then there's the people who actually have to use it. And those are 2 different groups of people.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Right.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:29.000
So does anyone have any thoughts or gut instincts about what would be recommended for Kevin situation, or others.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Actually, my question was identical to Kevin's.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Perfect.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So I don't have recommendations.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I usually have been targeting the decision maker. Like it depends on the company size. Right? You just have more and more stakeholders as your prospect gets bigger and bigger.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So for these. When I did this interview, I for the for the smaller companies I just picked like.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000
The main business group decision maker. But yeah, I still have the same question.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Excellent. It sounds like either Dave or George want to chime in.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Yeah, I was, gonna say, usually, what I do is particularly with B. Twob, I recommend that you. I just establish a buying center.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And a buying center will have personas for people who are making the decision using the product. Even gatekeepers, people who are gonna say, no.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And then and then interview all the different sort of personas that you're dealing with.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Because, for example, a lot of times people don't realize like.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Yeah, the Cfo actually gets involved in this decision, right? And even though the Cfo doesn't really is not the primary user, they could say no. And so you need to figure out.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Why anyone could say yes or they could say no. And then, oftentimes marketing, typically what we'll do is we'll create marketing collateral specifically for the Cfo.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000
So that we can answer their questions differently than someone else. The Siso now is really important.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
So, having understanding what the size about is also very useful. So that's.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
My thoughts.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Excellent.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
George.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Yeah, no, basically, I was gonna say that I did the same thing is interview the multiple personas.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
That would be.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Yeah.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Necessary for the process.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I am really digging the vibe of this group sounds like we're all in alignment on the same page. What we like to think about how we can help each other. So I'm grateful for everybody chiming in and helping out here. So I'm gonna wrap up here a few more slides, few more things to share. And then we can conclude questions and allude to the coming days. And what else? We're gonna cover.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Cause. This is just. Part one.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
But

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I don't know if you can tell by now, but what we're talking about is energy.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Essentially. And that's what we're trying to dig into when you're doing these interviews and trying to understand your customers. Where is the energy coming from, and what kinds of energy are we trying to understand and deal with.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
So there's a few layers and types of energy.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
That are here.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
So there's the social energy which is.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
How do others see me?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
In this decision that I have to make.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.000
So I think someone else gave an example earlier, when we were having the b 2 b conversation.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000
About. Well, will this help me? You know, with my job? Or if I make the wrong decision here, will it.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
You know, end my opportunity for employment or promotion.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:20.000
So there's a social energy that is at play both with that and the example that Liliana shared earlier with the air Pod interview that we did at our university course, that we teach.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
So.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:28.000
There's a notion of social kind of awareness and impact and pressure that goes into certain purchasing decisions that get made.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
There's the functional piece which.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Is arguably like one of the most fundamentally important which is, does it actually.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Get the job done.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Right? Does it do it well relative to others?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Is the function. There.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Sometimes.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Something can be sold.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Without the function.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
But that is a very, very hard thing to do, and not recommend it.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
That's usually when you're buying something for.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Some other reason.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Rather than the actual functional need. There might be more social and emotional forces at play, but you end up not using it. So I don't know if any of you all have paid for apps that are on your phone, that you've never used or have only used once and never gone back to again.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Or maybe there's a product. There's something that you have in your home that you bought because you thought you were. Gonna use it all the time, and then.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000
You realize that it either didn't work or not nearly as good as something else that you're able to do.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000
But that tends to happen a lot when we buy things on the functional dimension. And then, lastly, the emotional piece.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Which I think is arguably the most powerful and.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I think from an advertising standpoint, it's 1 that you know many

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Businesses have learned to prioritize more in recent decades. But it's all about me.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Right. How does this make me a better version of myself? How does this give me the self-efficacy and excitement about that new and better way of living that I want to be by purchasing and consuming these sets of products and services that I'm paying money for.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It's all about the individual and how they want to feel about themselves.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:01.000
So, understanding these 3 layers of of influence from an energy standpoint, as you do, your discovery and research.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Is is super important. And again, I can't emphasize it enough.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Very intuitive.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:14.000
When we talk about direct consumer purchases, because we all do that as individual consumers of things every single day.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
But I can tell you with full confidence that.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
These are all at play.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Within a professional business context for those purchasers and decision makers arguably even more so than the individual like they've mentioned earlier. Liliana, you wanted to chime in.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:43.000
When we teach this, I like to make a point that these energies, the different categorizations here sit on top of the 4 forces. So the timeline is completely separate.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
The 4 forces.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Are part of this, but.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Everything can be

01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Categorize as any of them. So for social it could be a push, pull, habit, or anxiety for functional. It could be any of the 4 same with emotional. So a lot of people get stuck and think emotional is only pushes or functional is only polls, whatever it is. These rather just sit on top and are like a completely separate axis.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
To categorize every single set of energies or.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Feelings that a customer could have.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And then the timeline is something that you're filling out during the interview, and the energies here and the forces are things that you're doing during the debrief, and we'll get into how to interview and what the debrief is tomorrow.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:43.000
But just know that this is something that is very similar to the forces, and it's like a complete different axis. So you can start thinking about the mattress interview. And in your head categorizing. Okay, what did I see? That was social, functional, and emotional. And which of the 4 forces, each of those things.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
If that makes sense.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I think that was very well, said Liliana, and and I guess, just to reiterate one other thing.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I know it says I realize like I look at the bottom of the footer, and then it says, tech stars.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
We're very proud to be at service, but I will say that we are the only program that.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Teaches this.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:12.000
There's a different I guess overall like kind of teaching and framework. That's I. I would argue a bit more like straightforward and simplified.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:24.000
That is more widespread at techs, and that's all good. And we support that, too. But we have a specialization here that we're really proud of, and that we like to go deep and dig in before program starts. So that's what you all are getting from us.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Okay, so.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Few final things here. One is understanding supply side. So I think this is the point we've been making the entire time. But just to bring it all the way home.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Most of the time I am dealing with founders and investors and thinkers in business in general.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Who default to supply thinking.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000
It's always about what you're offering and what you're providing, and and whether it's working or it isn't, and why.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And that's where most of our time gets spent with who we talk about where we get advice of the mentors and investors you're gonna deal with. There's gonna be a lot of energy around the how and the when and the how much.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
You know about what it is you're supplying.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
To the customer, and what works and what doesn't.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
So what technology you have.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
How you make money.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
You know what matters to you with your strategy and your business.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:22.000
The most impressive. Both investors and founders that I have worked with and perceive are the ones that do not default.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
To supply commentary, or thinking at all.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And they always frame what they're doing and why they're doing it around.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
The customers that they're serving and who they're helping.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
So say what you will about, you know, liking him or not.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
There's a person by the name of Steve Jobs who.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
In many respects with business. I admire, and have learned a lot from.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
And.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
If you watch any or all of what he says. When he was speaking.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:24:00.000
His demand. Side, like way of speaking, is like very prominent, and it stands out to me. And it was clearly an influence, I think, to this overall framework, and how it came to be.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Because when you hear him speak, and he talks about apple, and how they try to.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Design and build things with the customer in mind.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
It was. It was clearly in the organization's DNA.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:20.000
At the time when they were rolling out a lot of their innovative products. And I remember, just as a young person learning about business at the time.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Being really enamored with their way of thinking in their approach to both advertising, marketing, and sales.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And technology overall and what to build.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
So.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Keeping that in mind. I my dream is for all of you coming out of this program to be armed with the demand side.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
A way of thinking and framing what you do, because I do think that.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
From an investment standpoint.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
The pattern recognition for an investor to see a founder or CEO.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000
That can tell a story, not just in the spirit of how awesome their business is, and how exciting and investable it's going to be.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
But also just how successful.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
They're going to make.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Individual. Consumers and businesses in the world!

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Better off because of what they're here to do with the vision they have for their business.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Alright! So now to get even more nerdy.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Liliana promised that what we were talking about would map to company systems.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
From A, b 2 b standpoint, and here it is.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
So that timeline that we just spoke about.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:31.000
The reason I am was trying to tell you that it's more relevant than you might think is because it was actually designed with these company systems in mind.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:39.000
So at any given company, you're gonna have marketing right where you're gonna have to make people aware of what you're doing and to get them interested in what you're doing.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
And then once they're aware and interested.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:53.000
There's a conversion that happens where now they're ready to become customers of yours. And now there's there's a conversation that happens about what decision to make and what to pay, and whether to pay, and what they're getting for paying.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And then ultimately, once they've paid and they've become your customer. How do you make sure that they're successful? How do you retain them when you lose them, how do you make sure you build in ways to either get them back or learn from their, you know, experience, and why they're no longer interested in being a customer of yours.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:16.000
So all 3 of these, like layers of organizations, journey and dealing with the customer connect to that timeline.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So I know the visuals might make it seem a little bit more.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:28.000
You know, cartoonish, if you will, but these are processes that connect to like large enterprise companies, and how they operate.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:34.000
So I hope that resonates a little bit for those of you that are thinking about this framework in the context of B, 2 B.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:41.000
But just everyone in general. These will incorporate into your into your company. I think in a really.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Seamless way. If if you, if you take a.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
The approach seriously.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Cool so I wanna wrap with questions. But I also wanted to just mention a few more things. So I mentioned that I know clay clay the number of years ago passed away.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
But before he did Bob, who I'll also

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Explain and share more about and introduce you all to now. Brought me to Harvard Business School to work with Clay on a few things, and Clay helped me out with a project that I'll share more about in my founder story. But he is extremely tall.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Like I'm I'm a short guy. I'm 5, 8, but like play is like, I don't know. 6.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
7. Something like that giant Dude.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:36.000
But he did this one thing. He gets on one knee, and that's just like a humility exercise that he I don't know how he described it, but it was kind of cute. But yeah, I'll forever appreciate, admire, Clay for everything that he's done, both for business and.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
For us, and and.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
For for Bob here, so.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
This is the mattress. Interview. Guy.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:51.000
This is the guide that you all heard speak and and dig into things, and he's the guy who introduced me to jobs to be done out of a base camp.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.000
And I want to tell you Bob's story. Really fast. And then, Liliana, how am I on time? I have like 20 min.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Oh, yeah, we're doing well.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
A.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Okay, we're we're doing well. Okay. So to tell you, Bob story, I wanna talk about these 2 things.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
They might know what these are.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
What's on the top? What's on the bottom feel free to unmute.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Is it a Mars and a snicker.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
No.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I could be wrong.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Wait!

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I'll say it's a Milky way, and.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
There's twix and snicker. Yeah, snickers.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Dominic was correct. It's just different in in Europe.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I think.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Wait, so wait.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Wait, Dominique, what are you calling the one on the top.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I think it's a more. We call it a Mars Bar.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
And.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
It's the same as an okay.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Yeah.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Oh, so Mars Bar is Milky Way. It's some, and okay.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Chloe confirmed. We have our European.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Wow!

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Okay. Milky Way.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Well, Mars is the name of the company. Mars is the name of the company. So that's interesting.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
And we provide.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
But they're they're branded as Martha's. Yeah.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Interesting.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
A Milky way in England doesn't have caramel. It's just.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I'll bring them to Sf. Anyway, we digress.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Hey? Musketeers.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Well, I mean look, I'm I'm just enjoying this.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Yeah, exactly. We have both the Milky Way and Mars.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Yeah.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I just know how universal food and and snacks are to people so like. These are perfect examples that just bring us all together.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I agree.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000
So alright, and Dave, I think, got it, too. So it's a milky way on top, and the snickers on the bottom.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Alright!

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
So this is where the story with Bob begins.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
At least the one that I'm familiar with.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
So here in the States.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
They're.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000
You know, we're we're Western advertising has its own like kind of way of doing things.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:41.000
But there's this, I think. I believe this was a super bowl. Commercial. I I need to verify, for sure. But this is at least a commercial for snickers. But I want to share with you all the stickers. Commercial. That's very brief.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
But we're gonna have a quick conversation about it, and then talk about a few

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Other development, here.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
So let me make sure this works.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Can I hope you enjoy that snickers.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Does it sound working?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Happy peanuts.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Over chocolate, covered mountaintops.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Don't want to fall.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Prancing no good in the meadow, sings a song of satisfaction to the world.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
That's right.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Alright, so.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:29.000
What's going on here. You're at Mars. You're working on the snickers team, and you're coming up with a very expensive commercial to run.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
What do we? What are we selling.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
What's our message?

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Focusing.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
They're focusing on the features of the of the.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Snickers, bar.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Man.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Describing exactly. It's made of.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Yeah.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
They're selling joy.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Yeah, they're selling an experience rather than a product.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Okay. Morgan.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Feel like it's just workloads, but work looks boring like it's like a drab carpet shop. And now he's got this like a little minute in his day. That's bright and nice.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Right? Right? So it's like, maybe the.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Dealing with some sort of mundanity, right?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Anything else.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Because they spend a lot of money to to run this.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Add.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
It's kind of like the.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And I used to look at. I used to have one of the large corporations and I would often stay late in the office, and

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And one of the higher floors, and the only thing we had on that floor was a vending machine, and snickers was actually the best thing they had in that vending machine.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Oftentimes I was quite enjoyable to have a snickers. I think.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I could resonate with what's going on.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I can. I can hear you, man, I can hear it. I'm sorry I I can't relate to what you guys are describing, but I can imagine, you know, like.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Just we need something we need something to deal with, just having to sit around here and not do much. So I guess that's what? Yeah, I think that was the intent behind this ad. Now, my other question to you all is,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Why wasn't this working.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Because when I'm sharing with you is.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Is pre-progress. So Snickers was in a position when they were running this ad where they were at risk.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:15.000
They were struggling as a as a product, and Mars the company that owns snickers was essentially considering. Sun setting.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
The the candy bar at the time.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
So we're like, this isn't working out like we're not selling. And we need to do something.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
So one of Bob's.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Friends.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Worked at Mars.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And called Bob up.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Because Bob was already doing a lot of work in in products.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And consumer products, but in a very different context. And they flew in Bob, who's from Detroit?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Into New Jersey, where the Mars kind of headquarters is.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
To come, investigate, to figure out what was going on.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:56.000
So Bob comes in, sees the ads that they're running, sees what they're doing, and Mars had an interesting dilemma where they're like, well, Milky Way.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
You know, and snickers.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
They're.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:08.000
We were trying to figure out what the difference is between them and why people are consuming them. There's not much of a difference right now from our our research and understanding of what's happening.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:16.000
So Bob, even in his journey of visiting the Mars factory, found himself still questioning what was going on, and not really clear.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
On finding a better way.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
To help sneakers succeed.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000
And understanding what the difference between stickers and Milky Way even was.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:34.000
So, from what I can tell, sounds like some of you all might know, because we've been in the world for a few decades. Now, most of us, and you all might have a better understanding of these products. Now.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
But I have to tell you back then.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Around the same time the clay was dealing with Mcdonald's.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Bob was here trying to figure out what was going on with these candy bars.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And he found himself heading back to Detroit.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
In New Jersey airport.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
With these same questions on his mind.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
So he's at the airport still, unclear. What.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:59.000
He even experienced and saw from having these conversations with these executives and marketers and product people.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:05.000
And he chances upon someone who goes to a kiosk at the airport and.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
A snickers.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Bob told me this story when I 1st got to know him, that his mother, when he was a kid, gave him a 3 foot.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Meaning. If he's within 3 feet of you, he can talk to you.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
So he followed this man to his.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Gate in the airport, and he sat near him.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
He observed him, and what he did with his snickers bar.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
This man proceeded to sit down, open up his laptop.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
And before using and typing on his laptop he ate the snickers bar and then started to send emails.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Bob introduces himself, and has a conversation with him to ask him.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
What job essentially, he was hiring that snickers bar to do.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And the gentleman proceeds to tell him that.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
He.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Would like.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
To sleep on the airplane.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.000
And wanted enough energy to power through knocking out his work before he had the board.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:03.000
This was interesting to Bob. So then Bob goes back to the same kiosk area. And what do you think he does?

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Follow somewhere.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Any guesses.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
What's that?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Follow someone else.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Exactly. He waits.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
He's like, all right. Who is gonna be next.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Who is going to buy.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
A Milky Way.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I've seen a snickers.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.000
But what's happening with the Milky Way? Because that was the job I flew out here to do. And now I'm heading back, and I still don't have an answer.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
He waits, and he waits, and he waits.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And it turns out, when he spoke to the cashier.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000
That they are flippingers like hotcakes. There.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
But they sell very little.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Any.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Milky Ways.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
So Bob proceeds to continue to have this puzzle on his mind of what's going on.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
So he goes home.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.000
And now he's wondering. Okay, I've seen snickers in real time myself, directly get purchased in the field.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
But I'm not sure who's buying milky ways or who's consuming them.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Comes home in Detroit. Puzzled.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Explains the story to his wife.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Who the heck is buying Milky Way, and when are they buying them, and why are they buying them.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
His wife looks at him.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Smiles, stands up.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Walks over to the kitchen.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And goes.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I have a Milky Way.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
She reaches behind.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
The fridge in a cabinet, pulls down a bowl.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
And out comes a snick Milky Way.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
This gave Bob a hint.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
He went back to Mars.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Looked at the data.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
And it turns out.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
That.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
The consumption context.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
From Milky Way, and snickers were entirely different.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000
And far more people were consuming Milky Way.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
As a replacement.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Or dessert.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
For extended consumption. Times.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Relative to snickers.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Turns out, even at the time that more women were purchasing bars than men based on the data that they had been gathering.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
And.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I believe the snickers is consumed to anywhere from 60 seconds to 90 seconds.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Whereas the Milky Way consumption time was anywhere from 10 to 15 min.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
People would even put their handy bars in the freezer.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:21.000
To make them colder, to last longer, and to be a replacement for things like ice cream.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:29.000
So when they looked at the data and they did the research, and they figured out that the competitive sets for a snickers and the Milky Way were so fundamentally different.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
It opened up a whole new world.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Of how they could think about both marketing.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
And selling the product as well as how to reorient the product, to address the jobs.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
That they need to be done.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
So here's what came of it.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Put here.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Oh!

01:37:51.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Mike, what is your deal? Come on, man. You've been riding me all day. You're playing like Betty White out there, girlfriend.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Better.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
About that.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000
That hurt? You're not. You're hungry. Snickers satisfies.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
You're not you when you're hungry.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
So.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
You all probably remember this because we came up in the era when snickers.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Came to prominence and became the number one candy bar in the world.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:32.000
So again, can't give all credit just to Bob and this insight, but certainly set the company up to have a new direction for their understanding of.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
The job that the product was being hired to do.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
So.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Thought I was.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Give you all that that context. I don't know if you all have any questions or comments about it.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.000
But I do know that the big question that comes up next, usually when I'm dealing with this, what is a candy bar have to do with building.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
A new startup or a business, especially ones that are in tech or deep tech.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
But before I move on I thought I would give you all that.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
I mean, I have us.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Yeah, please.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I have a simpler question.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Does these 2 bars actually taste the same in the Us.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Tell me, everybody? Do they taste the same.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Yeah, what's the difference?

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I'm allergic, so I have no idea.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I I think snickers is a peanuts in it. And.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
That's the difference.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Mockingway does, does not just like Carameli.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I don't even know it's caramel, but it's like fluffy.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Nope.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
The inside.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Arama and Nukat. Yeah.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Okay. And and this.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Yeah. Go. Ahead. Sorry.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
But no sorry I nothing else. After that.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Yeah, my, my second.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Quite interested.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Main.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
And.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
You know.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Speakers should be the name of a racing horse that the Mars family owned back in.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:54.000
So it has something to, you know, being active while milka sounds a bit more like, you know. Milk is more.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:02.000
You know, closer to sleeping, etc. So maybe that was the initial goal itself, or.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Maybe I'm off shooting too much here.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Yeah. And I mean, I'm not the professional either. Here I'm I'm selling. I'm I'm sharing an anecdotal story right? Obviously from from someone who I know and work have worked with. But I would describe a Milky Way as smooth.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yeah. Then sleep packed.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Whereas a snickers bar comes off as very like, almost like a power bar or an energy bar. Right? There's like a chunkiness to it. It's satiating. It feels like you're eating a meal.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Right.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Yeah.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
That's right.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
George.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Yeah, okay.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Oh, no, I was just gonna say it's kind of interesting, as like a prelude to the whole focus on high protein.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Yes.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Snacks and all that. Now, like it's sort of like a.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
So, like, yeah.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Yeah.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Pretty cool to that.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Quite interesting. Yeah.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:54.000
So so. And and these are old stories, right? So I know they're not as modern or as relevant as some of the examples that we're gonna share with you going forward. But I always think it's fun. Given that I knew the people who.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.000
You know, kind of began these journeys and their respective stories. I always like to share it as the 1st phase of introducing jobs.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
To the class, but.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Again.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
You all aren't selling candy bars here.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
So.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
The main thing that we're gonna be able to derive from this is.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.000
The languages and the processes, and the domino effect of what's going on from the consumer journey from the beginning.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.000
In the chain of events that undeniably cause the problem. So I thought I would like.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Give you all the origin story and the foundation. We've learned a lot more as time has gone on about how this impacts early stage startups in different industries and technologies. But.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
From Mcdonald's to Mars and Milky Wayne, snickers to milkshakes.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.000
I think we're now in a place where we can move into. You know how this is relevant to all of you.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:50.000
So one thing that I always like to make sure that you all understand is the difference between what we call a big hire and a little higher.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:59.000
So a big hire is the point of commitment. That's when you know consumption is actually happening. From the onset. When I make the purchase decision.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
A little higher, something else that might happen, which is.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Once they purchase the product or service. And there's these little.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Points of of utilization along the way.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
That are slightly, you know, different.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Then the original expected utilization.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
So this can offer pivots or forks in the road, or.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Additional features. Other things that you can do to shift or enhance. You know your product offering.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
And it's really helpful to keep that in mind as well as you go, because.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Entire businesses can be developed.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:40.000
From those little higher examples. So one another example that I know Bob worked on early on was.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Does anyone familiar with.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Nyquil.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
You won't ever use Nyquil.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
So nyquil.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Is helping you when you're sick, right? It's helping you with like, basically the cough cough medicine.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:04.000
There were 2 other jobs that ended up emerging from the Nyquil use case because people were hiring Nyquil. Even when.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
They weren't sick, and people were hiring Nyquil, even though they didn't want to sleep.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Does anybody know what products may have been forked off from Nyquil.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
To address those.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Needs.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Sequel and Dayquil.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Exactly.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Disease quill is to help you sleep, even though you're not sick.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Dayquil is to help you when you're sick. But you're not trying to sleep.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.000
So they didn't come out with all 3 of those at the same time.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Nyquil was being hired, and the little higher for it were these other use cases that were less relevant for helping me sleep or helping me with sickness.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:49.000
So these are the types of examples and references you all can keep in mind with some of your consumers to understand. Okay, what are they hiring me to do, and is it everything, or is it part of what I'm offering.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:55.000
As far as, like my enjoyment of jobs to be done, it helps with a lot of organizational.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
So it'll help you with decision making.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Right. So if you have a debate, or you know you're unclear on what the right path to go down is.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Going back to what our jobs to be done are, or which one that we want to actually accomplish or achieve.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Helps Ground the conversation and Decision Making Process.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:16.000
It also helps with optimizing our resources. Are we directing our energy towards doing the job.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Or are we distracted and working on a few other things that we're unclear on, whether it's important or helpful to address.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:30.000
It's also inspiring. It means so much to know that you're actually solving the customer's problem and addressing what they truly need. Your help with.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
As opposed to things that you're either hoping or guessing.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Might be important to them.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And then, last, but not least, it allows us to more objectively orient.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Our success metrics and how we're actually evaluating our business to know that we're actually.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Customer centric and what we're doing and how we're helping our customers succeed.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.000
This last one I can relate to personally right now, in the sense of being a tech.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000
One phrase that is more prominent now than ever before is.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Bigger, isn't better, is better.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
So when we think about our business of investors.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
For many years in recent years at least.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:19.000
There has been an effort to raise lots of money and to scale and to invest in more and more businesses.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
What we're now talking about, which I'm very proud of.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Is.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
We don't need to invest in more businesses.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000
The businesses that we are invested in. We need to do a better job.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:37.000
So I'm really excited about the current direction of of where all our conversation is happening as a team and as a company.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And it's absolutely oriented around success with their businesses and their satisfaction of our program experience and our role as their early investors.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:46:01.000
So the overall process for you all that you're gonna learn in the coming days and over the next few weeks is how to frame the learning questions. What am I trying to learn by conducting research and doing interviews? In the 1st place.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Who should I talk to? How do I screen for the right people to recruit, to speak to an interview.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:15.000
How do I conduct the interviews in a way that gives me the information I need to have the better understanding that will help me orient my business successfully.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:25.000
How do I then, once I conduct the interview, have a debrief that actually allows me to derive the forces of progress, and understand the energies and motivations that are involved.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
In that.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And then, once I have that data set at least 10 to 15 of those.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
How do I analyze it? To understand what pat underlying patterns exist.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
That have a causal.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Connection to the consumer behavior and the decision to purchase.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Once I have that information. Now I can detail what I believe the jobs to be done might be.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
And once I have those jobs bucketed and defined.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I can understand what the implications to prototype and change my business would be.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Both with respect to marketing and sales.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Product development and overall company vision.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And strategic direction and technology.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Liliana.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I was gonna say that I think the one that is extremely underrated here, that most of you, probably even reading this glossed over is framing the learning question. So like a lot of people want to get right into. Okay, who do I interview? How do I find those interviewees and all of that.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000
We focus a lot on getting the learning question correct.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
And I'll work with each of you on that.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:53.000
So that the Jt. Round that you're doing in this group, like group exercise will do over the next few weeks has a purpose. So that'll be different for each of you. I've already heard some of you put out ideas of what you kind of need right now, what you need to figure out. But the every other step here will be useless or futile. If you're learning question is not framed specifically and correctly and geared towards something that.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Actually valuable for your business to learn. So some people will come out of you know, having a good screening that's nice and narrow and doing a set of jobs to be done interviews with us, and they'll tell us I didn't really learn anything I didn't already know, or that wasn't useful.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:33.000
And then I asked them, Well, what did you set out to learn? And so they hadn't thought about it, or it wasn't something that was actually useful things like that. So start thinking now about what learning, question, or learning objective you might want for this round of drops to be done, and remember that you can always do more in the future. We're just all gonna do one together to to learn over the next few weeks.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:40.000
So the typo on this conversation, and then final, wrap up with a few questions before we conclude.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
In summary.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.000
What we're also doing is you're just simply interviewing people who switch from one thing to another. Right? Usually it's a switch. There's other criteria sometimes, but that's.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Very simplified way to put it, understand their decision making process. And you analyze the forces that make them switch.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:04.000
So that's what we're here to help you all do over the next couple of weeks. We do this before the program starts, because it's our bread and butter, and by understanding this framework well.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Once the program starts in September 9, th you're gonna have wind in your sales. You're gonna have a better understanding of who you're helping. And you're gonna know how to take advantage of the community that we're getting ready to introduce you to here in San Francisco, and well, beyond.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
So.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:28.000
That's part one.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
The people you interview have to be.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
People, that.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Are, con like considering your product, or when you're saying switch from one product to another.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Great question.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Does it. Could it be that they switched from.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
One competitor to another competitor.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:50.000
It's much more important to interview people who, I would say, are not.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Nearly prospective customers, but people who have.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Had some sort of switch moment occur.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Okay.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000
So we're gonna talk more about this in the next few sessions. But what that means is.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
You want people who within the past.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Ideally 3 to 6 months, if not more recent.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Have made a switch.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Either they fired a product or they've hired a product.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:21.000
They've done something that indicates behavior that you want to better understand. That tells you more about.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Who you want to help.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Great.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000
So one mistake a lot of people make when they do. Customer interviews is they try to talk to people who they think.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Could be their customers.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
But they're just talking to them, and they don't understand the timing.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Or the placement of.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:41.000
What behaviors or actions they've taken recently that would even indicate that they would be a good person to to learn from.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:45.000
So basically, Annie, if you have someone who is hired.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Either a director indirect to reliable.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000
That's who you want to talk to because you want to go. I want to understand your decision to to sign up for this product or service.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Right.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000
So let's unpack. What led you to do that? Because by me, learning that.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I know what you're looking for, because I think ultimately.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:10.000
I might be the right answer for you, but I'm not sure.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Correct.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Cool. I love that. That's cause. That was where I was. Getting stuck is like how to pick the right customers. So that's that's a huge answer. So thank you.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:20.000
One other thing, though, Annie is, I know you have customers. So the other thing that's helpful is, once you get a customer.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000
You can wait a few weeks, but not too long.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Interview them.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
And go. What got you here?

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:35.000
You know. Let's talk about what got you here? Not about, because a lot of the times, a lot of my founders. They want to interview customers that they get to to basically feed their ego.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Yeah.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
And go. Tell me how great I am. Tell me what you like about me, and tell me you know.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Why do you like us like? No, no.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
You don't want to talk about.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Now you want to talk about before they found you, what they were dealing with, and how they got to.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
That's the journey that we want to understand here.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Okay, great. That's awesome.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Phyllis.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000
So it's kind of a like general question.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And maybe the basics. But.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Like I'm thinking about in the Mcdonald's makeshake. Example, we.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Heard that, like the health.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Of the makeshake buyers by. It's like before 8 am. And.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.000
I'm just curious about like the how we're not focusing on, because maybe we can.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Maybe think of some things to also include them. But perhaps we're not doing it because we don't have the like common.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
The aspects of them.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000
But actually, this is something I have in mind to understand like.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:38.000
We have the people we can like connect to with the things we know about them. And, like the other.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Kind of gray area that we don't. And I'm just curious how to like maybe reach out to them or.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Should we? Should our priority be? That's for, like the 1st one.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Right? So one thing we're also gonna get into in the coming days is how to have a well defined screening. Who do we talk to? And how do we get to them?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
So we will dig into that in the next couple days.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.000
So if I don't properly address what you're asking by, then let me know.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Okay. Thanks.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Couple minutes left any other.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Bonus round questions or feedback.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Hope this has been helpful and good use of your time.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.000
That's great!

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Neil and I were thinking, what next steps do we have for them for tomorrow? And I was saying, Digest. So that's your homework. Just reflect.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Just take it in. Yeah.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Tomorrow. I'd love to hear any kind of like insights or thoughts that you guys had as this marinated for the rest of the day before we start tomorrow, because.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Obviously there was so much thrown at you, and I'm very interested to see how that settles into your into your brains.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Yeah. And for some of you I know that this is a reinforcing mechanism, meaning you already intuitively understand this, or have your own experience.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:01.000
That, you know, connects with these ideas, because this is not proprietary information.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
These are things that.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Successful businesses and people in the world have figured out in their own way.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And we're just giving a little bit more color and maybe framing.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:20.000
To understanding this in our own in our own way. That hopefully applies to to you all. But, I'm really excited to to go down the journey of learning this together.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:28.000
One thing that I always take pride in is every founder that I invest in to some extent those jobs. And when you hear other people say that they know jobs.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000
And you spend 5 or 10 min talking to them about what they understand about it.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000
You'll know the difference in our training relative to where you can learn this anywhere else.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
So really proud of that.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:51.000
But yeah, with that, let's give you all a minute of your life and time back. We'll hang here in case anyone wants to talk further, and then, Agent Lunar, I know I'm doing a product, Demo, with you all right after this, right? So.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Looking forward to that.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Thanks, and.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
But I'll see you all tomorrow.
