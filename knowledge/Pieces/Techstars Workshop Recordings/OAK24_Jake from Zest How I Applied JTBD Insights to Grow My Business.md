**Type:** Customer Discovery & JTBD  
**Tags:** #jtbd #customer-research #product-market-fit #churn-analysis #system-thinking #demand-side-thinking

## Speaker Background

Jake Gutstein is the founder of Zest, a cooking education app that teaches people how to cook through a gamified, structured approach. He went through Techstars after achieving viral growth but struggling with retention—describing it as "a leaky bucket... we were like a pipe, just sending people literally through our thing, couldn't retain anybody."

## Core Philosophy: Systems Over Dogma

Jake opens with crucial context: "I view Jobs seriously... but I'm also humble to the fact that I'm an end of one in this experience. You put 10 of us in a room, and we have 25 different opinions."

His key insight: **"What I really care about, what Jobs really is a question to me, is systems and foundations for creativity and foundations for work."**

The critical requirement: "You have to be intellectually honest with yourself and humbled to the fact that you need systems in place that at least simulate what Jobs are trying to do."

## The Five-Step JTBD Process & Efficiency Loss

Jake breaks down JTBD into five concrete steps:
1. **Screening criteria and learning objectives**
2. **Sourcing interviews** based on those criteria
3. **Conducting the interviews**
4. **Clustering** the insights
5. **Actually building** based on findings

**The Efficiency Principle:** "You lose efficiency at each step in the process... I almost view it as a product. The ability to do step 1 × step 2 × step 3... each thing runs up below an efficiency of one."

Common failure points:
- "We really should have focused on this area" = screening criteria wasn't tight enough
- "It took forever to source" = efficiency loss in step 2
- Each inefficiency compounds through the process

## The Critical Pivot: From Users to Non-Users

### The Fatal Flaw
"We were speaking to people who were using Zest, who were paying for Zest, about their journey... In reality, that was a really bad strategy."

Why? "We were talking to people who had never successfully learned how to cook, and with an extremely high probability would fall out of our system, about their experience successfully learning how to cook."

### The Solution
"We decided we needed to remove Zest from the equation entirely and speak to people who had successfully learned how to cook without us."

Specifically targeting: People who learned during the pandemic when "they had way more time than they do right now."

This revealed:
- The forces (pushes and pulls) that actually drove cooking adoption
- Inefficiencies in their process where Zest could save time
- The true "why behind the why"

## Building a Knowledge System: The Zest Wiki

Jake reveals their internal infrastructure for systematic thinking:

### The Wiki Philosophy
"If you do something more than twice, it gets its own article. Things live inside of this, and it essentially details how we work."

Within the wiki: **"Thought Playbooks"** - "Essentially like, 'Dang, I'm dealing with a really difficult problem. I wonder if I could throw a process at it to solve it.'"

### The White Stripes Analogy
"Meg White is railed on for being a terrible drummer... But if you ask Jack White, his entire success is because Meg creates a structure that he has to function within, and that allows for his creativity to blossom, because it creates constraints that force him to work effectively."

**Key Insight:** "That's really what all of this stuff is" - constraints that enable creativity.

## The Wall: Demand-Side vs Supply-Side Thinking

Jake introduces a critical mental model:

### The Two Sides of the Wall
"There's a wall, and you have 2 choices:
1. **Demand side**: Understand latent demand in the market and look over the wall at supply side requirements
2. **Supply side**: 'Our camera is the best at focus, zoom, shutter speed XYZ' and look over at demand side

The difference is subtle but big—it's the difference between the dog wagging the tail and the tail wagging the dog."

### The Implementation Challenge
When asked how to help founders overcome resistance to demand-side thinking:

"You have to actually be [committed]. To say that you're down to do it this way is different than actually conducting and behaving this way... A great way to waste a lot of time is if you refuse to truly accept that you're doing demand side and then maintain a supply side attitude, because you'll essentially stand on the wall."

## Practical Application: The Churn Analysis Framework

Jake shares their actual churn analysis, revealing five reasons people leave Zest:

### The Five Churn Reasons
1. **Complete all levels** - "These guys have nothing more to teach me"
2. **No longer anxious as a cook** - Moved from incompetence to competence
3. **"I saw it on TikTok/Food Network and you don't have it"** - The recipe problem
4. **"Tired of seeing the same finite set of recipes"**
5. **"You're too rigid for me"** - Forcing conformity

### The Recipe Insight
Customer: "I left because you don't have enough recipes."
Reality: "If you cooked one Zest recipe a day for a year and a half, you would still have more recipes."

True meaning: "We don't have the right recipe for you in a moment. I'm on TikTok, see something I want to cook, go to Zest, you don't have it. 'God, this app doesn't have anything!'"

### Trigger Events vs Root Causes
"Two things trigger people to leave, but they're not the reason:
1. **Budgeting event** - Major life change
2. **Trust violation** - 'These guys can't even scale a recipe properly, how can I trust them to teach me cooking?'

But they've already essentially decided they were going to turn before that."

## The Implementation System: Shape Up

Jake's team uses a modified version of Basecamp's Shape Up methodology:

### The Core Principle
"You have 2 control factors when building:
1. You ship something
2. Time dedicated to the project

Most people hinge on shipping something... Shape Up flips that. It says, 'I don't care what you put out, but you got to put it out in a set period of time that addresses this problem.'"

### Creating Contrast
"We have an issue with activation... I think we should create a small mini experience at the beginning that teaches them something."

Jake's requirement: "What are 2 to 3 other ways that you can solve this activation problem? Even if you end up coming back to the first way, it will be sharper for your having created the contrast."

## Turning Insights into Product

### From 0→1 to 0→1→2→3→4
Original model: Moving people from incompetence to competence
New understanding: "If we can in a process bring someone from 0 to 1, then we can essentially copy and paste that process moving forward."

### The Loneliness Factor
"Loneliness and getting people to hang out with you is a big part of who we are as a product... Our brand is a friend in the kitchen. A knowledgeable friend who helps you through this process."

Triggers: "I go from a heavily socialized environment to a less socialized environment. I was in a dorm, now living off campus. I was in college, now out of college."

## Research Operations: The Spike System

Jake reveals their ongoing research process:

### Current Research Projects (Example)
- **"Duolingo for Cooking"** messaging research
- Understanding who resonates with this positioning
- When and why they decide "this makes total sense for me"

### The $30 for 30 Minutes Strategy
For churn research: "When somebody spends all that time in the app and then churns, we'll email them $30 for 30 min... We essentially just beg churned users to get on the phone for money."

Why? "It's way more valuable for me to pay $300 to find out the information I just shared than to pocket $300 and eventually give it to Amplitude or Meta."

## The Prioritization Challenge

### Managing Multiple Research Streams
"There are like 3 active areas of research going on right now. That can get confusing, so you want to keep it straight. But it's important because we'll find out the answer to the Duolingo for cooking thing much quicker than the next churn research."

### Prioritization Factors
1. **Ease of getting people on the phone**
2. **Importance to the business**
3. **Speed of learning**

"Bad churn is something we really want to understand. At the same time, it's really hard to get churned customers on the phone."

## The Power of Systems in Practice

### Internal Benefits
Jake's CTO, initially skeptical: "He's like, 'Oh damn, we sound so unbelievably competent' because once you have this..."

### External Perception
"This [the actual product] is the maximum that anyone ever will be exposed to. They're just gonna look at it and be like 'they have a good brand.' And you can just sit there and laugh and be like, 'Yeah, we have a good brand.'"

### The Sequoia Pitch Story
"We pitched with 6 or 7 other companies... They literally ranked the companies. Everybody got an honorable mention other than us and one other team. We were the ones who could articulate what we were trying to solve."

## Key Techniques for JTBD Interviews

### The Timeline Mapping
Jake draws a progress timeline during interviews and marks:
- Where people are in their journey
- When they say "weird words" that need clarification
- Transitions from passive looking to deciding

### Seizing on Relativistic Language
Customer: "I wanted to cook healthier food."
Jake: "Healthier than what?"

This creates context and reveals true motivations.

### The Intentional Error Technique
"I'll purposely get a very minor detail wrong, or a couple things wrong when repeating back... That forces them to be like 'No, that's not right. It was this thing because of this,' and then they'll expose more information."

## Warnings and Wisdom

### The Growth vs Fixed Mindset Challenge
"Typically high-achieving people have gotten where they are as a result of having a fixed mindset... That makes it really hard to build compounding successful systems within a company. You have to acknowledge that you're gonna suck at first."

### The Plateau Problem
"So many people end up plateauing... 'I worked at Meta, made it to VP level, founded my own business, immediately closed clients, and now can't understand why they're continuing to pay me.' That's like 'I raised a Series A and completely tap out.'"

### The Protestant Shape Up
"Our version of Shape Up is like the Protestant version to the Basecamp Catholic version... We don't do it the exact same way. We evolved over time to have it fit what we needed."

## The Meta-Lesson: It's About Having A System

Jake's closing wisdom: "You need something. It's like, you gotta have something, or else you will be building [blindly]."

The choice: "Yes, learn from the people that know [JTBD]. But if you want to go out and chart your own path creating these systems for thought and how to work, that is also a viable alternative. It's just like... you need something."

## Practical Takeaways

1. **Your product doesn't matter to people** - "The fight I got in with my sister yesterday matters to me. Your product doesn't matter to me."

2. **Interview the successful, not the struggling** - Don't ask failing users about success

3. **Build infrastructure for thinking** - Wiki, playbooks, consistent processes

4. **Create contrast in solutions** - Always generate 2-3 alternatives before deciding

5. **Pay for truth** - $30 for 30 minutes of churn insights is cheaper than guessing

6. **Systems compound** - Initial inefficiency leads to long-term competence

7. **Constraints enable creativity** - Structure doesn't limit; it liberates

As Jake summarizes: "What they're benchmarking behind is traction. And how you get that traction... are you trying to diet and exercise? Or are you trying to just stop drinking water for a week and a half? You'll lose weight both ways. But one way you're gonna be able to keep it off."
