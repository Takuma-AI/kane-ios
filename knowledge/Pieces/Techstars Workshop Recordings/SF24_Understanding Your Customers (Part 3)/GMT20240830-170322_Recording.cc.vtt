00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Who digested and marinated on the subject yesterday, and had any sort of questions or comments they wanted to share.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
On. Everything that we learned yesterday was pretty dense, as we promised.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Today will be less dense.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A lot more application.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Does anyone want to share anything they learned?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I had a quick question.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
When. So it's starting to put my list together for folks I want to reach out to. I was just thinking, like, what's the best way to ask them. So.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Is it good to make clear that this is not a.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You know me selling you call. This is just.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
To get customer research. Do you guys have.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Templates that you've used for email, outreach or best practices for.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Reaching out.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I think we can get some some templates for you, like maybe a few examples from some previous companies. And what people say. Now that's something. We can make a note, Liliana, to to pull together.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Nothing in particular, because these are fairly smooth, and that all you need to do is just be honest with them about what you're trying to do, and.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Also be complementary, you know. You're you're trying to get to know them because.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You want to find more people like them.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Right. So a lot of the times people really appreciate like just authentic.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Expression in that regard, so.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So long as you keep it real and you give it your own voice it'll it'll be fine, but we'll give you a few examples, too.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Okay. Great. Thank you.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's the least salesy. You can come off the as possible. I think I said this yesterday, but you might have been gone any, but like coming as kind of like a student perspective, you're just eager to learn.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Yeah.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That'll make people more interested in talking to you, and there's always you can go down the incentives route to. But you can try with that first.st

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Yeah, and I know it like, for for many of us, this, along with sales in general, might feel like a bit like a chore or slog.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
To some. Not all. I'm sure some of you enjoy it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But to whatever extent you can find a way to.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Gamify it, or just mentally convert your energy into enjoying it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And approaching it with enthusiasm.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It just really makes things smooth like you'll you'll have a great time.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Because this is truly a fun thing, because if you do it right.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You're learning things that will help you shape your business in the best way possible.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So it's all just like Upside. If you do it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Cool.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So remember, I put in the chat. But you guys are, gonna submit your screening, and then Neil and I will go into base camp, and asynchronously approve it, or tell you to rewrite it. So remember that you're not reaching out to people until we have that extremely narrow.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And approved because we wanna basically not have to do it multiple times.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So once you submit it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
In the thread below in your task. You can just tag us, and we'll take a look at it.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Yeah, we have a quick question like, might be a bit niche to our situation. But like, we don't know if we should develop our screening for the students, which are actually our end users.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Or the parents who probably are the decision makers.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Cause. It's it's probably hard for us to get to the parents, since we have no communication with them.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And we don't really know.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Like which one to focus on here.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Hmm.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Well, it depends on what your intent is.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
What your goal is right.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Cause. My instinct is that it sounds like you want to.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Speak to the decision Maker.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Yeah, it's also.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It just is an assumption here. But.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Like. Given the background of like a typical Ib student, a lot of times like the student might just be able to convince their parents without.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
They're the one promoting it to the parent to get conversion.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Get.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Do you know that, or is that a hunch.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Okay.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It's a hunch based on my own experience, and like.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Yeah.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So let's find out. Let's talk to students first.st

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Okay.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And then, once we figure out the origin of their awareness of tutor me, or other things in the competitive set.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Okay.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Maybe you'll realize we have to talk to parents because it's clearly coming from them to the students.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Okay. Cool. Thank you.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Yeah.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But that's what we meant yesterday about like when you do a few of these.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:22.000
You'll learn really quickly. Okay, maybe I need to adjust my criteria or adjust who I'm talking to, because it's already clear that we, you know, we have a different group of people we need to engage with to better understand what we need.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Also, Nick, remember that.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Everyone who has.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Customers different than their users will have to do. More than one set.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Just like everyone who's part of a 2 sided marketplace will also have to do more than one, and everyone who has different will also have to do more than one.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So you pick one, and then you'll have to go back and do the other as a separate job to be done. Set.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Great.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I guess we're good.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Yeah.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
That's it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Okay. So the agenda here is I. I wanna give you a few examples.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Of you know what this looks like, and how it manifests you. A couple of stories.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And then I'm gonna bring it home just some some closing thoughts, and maybe we'll do a.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We'll have a quick conversation about some of your respective goals with how you want to approach this.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And we'll wrap up this time. We'll probably end early, but we'll wrap up this time by doing a live demonstration of an interview.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
With one of you as a subject.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So I'm looking forward to that. What my ask there is keeping the back of your head.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Any recent purchases you may have made.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
That you struggle to make.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Not a potential purchase, an actual one. So something you spent money on.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
That you've done in the past. Let's just say 3 ish months.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And it was a struggle.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So I want to hear from those examples. I'll be asking you all for those in a bit.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Great.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I am gonna screen share unless there's any other questions about the process. So far, what we've asked or shared.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Anything else you already for me to start.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
They're good.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Alright!

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Part, 3.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
That's my whole screen, isn't it?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Yeah.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Let's see here.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Let's do that.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Boom.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
That's good.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Very good.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So I wanted to start because we were talking about interviews yesterday. Now I'm talking about the end product. But I did want to share this list of questions to ask during the interview. So even though I said, we don't have a.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
A script.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Here are some example questions that are going to be a helpful kind of springboard, as you have your conversations.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
With your interviewees.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And you might be able to pick up on a pattern here, and they'll also sound very similar to what you heard from Bob.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Good.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
In the mattress interview, and maybe some other examples of references.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
But.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000
The notion here is that you're trying to do that detective work where you're coloring the situation. You're asking for specifics. Who was with you? What were you up to.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:13.000
You know, where were you sitting like? There's so many interesting things to place someone in that moment and what they're they're looking at what they're doing and what contrast to provide. So just take a skim of this. I'll pull it up again.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
At the end right when we before we go into the live demonstration, and then we'll make sure you all have access to these slides. And you know this list and everything.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But this is usually like the most that I'll do to prepare when I think about what I want to ask, or what I want to have handy.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Next to me.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Anyone have any questions about these questions?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Yeah.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Absolutely. Yeah. So the other thing that I like to say is like nothing's proprietary with me.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
You know I don't have any secrets, you know. There's nothing I need you to lock away.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And this will be available to us as well, like a file or whatever. Okay.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I want the whole world to have access to this if they're gonna use it properly. So.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I got you, Dave.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Great. So there are a number of methodologies to bring things home and articulate what we call the job.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I. I mentioned this thing yesterday called the Job Story, and I also said that it encourages context, causality, and motivations as opposed to the subjectivity, the assumptions, and the personas.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I don't think this actually came from Bob. I think there was someone else online back when you know, jobs originally emerged who invented like this formula or structure for a job story. But I really appreciated it, because at the time I was still like a budding software developer and the format of user stories used to make sense to me a lot. So I really, this this approach resonated with me, and it gave me.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
More structure.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
To help other people and teach other people how to do this. So.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Situation.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Motivation.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And expected or desired outcome.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
This is the format.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
That someone cleverly constructed for a job story that I find to be helpful as a baseline for coming up with job statements.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
It's not the only way to do it, but for me, I think this is gonna be helpful to you all.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
What is there? A situation?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Right. What's what's the circumstance that they're struggling through.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
What kind of progress do they want to make.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And then what are they ultimately seeking as a better version of themselves, as an outcome, that light bulb across the chasm with the bridge I I visualize on day one.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
One mistake that always happens.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Is with this middle block, and Liliana is so good at calling this out whenever she sees it.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
People tend to just jam into the. I want to.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Their product, features.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So that's your opportunity to go. This is what our company does, and that's what the the customer wants. Therefore their motivation is to have access to our functionality.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I'm gonna caution you right now.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
That usually what you think you're so I can. Is your expected outcome.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Is usually the motivation for the customer, and there's a deeper.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Expected outcome that they want, that you haven't probably thought through or conceptualized yet.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So I'll show you a few examples of what this means. But I wanted to call it out going into this because you'll be going back to this statement a lot and this framework a lot as you start to analyze your patterns and try to articulate the jobs.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And you can even use this format.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
For each individual interview.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And you can have a more verbose version of the statement, for every single person.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
That you you talk to in your debrief.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And then you'll have a series of 12 to 15 of these that you can then consolidate.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And combine.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Couple examples. This is Jason freed. So Jason's a good friend of mine. He is the founder of Base Camp.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
CEO of 37 signals.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Been in the software industry for over 25 years.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I think his product base camp has been around for 20 years. So it's it has a lot of longevity, and they have a pretty.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Substantial reputation in the tech world, given that they.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Not only have built a lot of software and have been thought leaders, and, you know, been selling, you know, all these bestselling, you know books and whatever, but they also invented the ruby on rails, framework.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So that was a big deal for me, since that was the programming language and framework that ultimately I started with Javascripted to Python, and then found my home with Ruby.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And so with all that being said, when I got to know these guys and they they were, they're based out of Chicago.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
They became my one and only investor.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
In in my company.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So it was the 1st time they ever invested in a company, and the 1st time I ever.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Really. No, it's not the 1st time I had an investor, but it was like my 1st strategic investor. I should say.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Says we didn't need the cash, but we wanted their expertise.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000
So, all that being said, I I'll out myself for a hot second. Some of you might know this, maybe many of you don't. But I actually ran for Mayor in Chicago.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Years ago.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And when I did that I use basecamp. So this is a fun little.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Screenshot from back then, and how I ran them a campaign through it. But base camp as a product and tool, we went through our jobs to be done.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Project. So I actually work with Jason and Bob.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And another person at the company named Ryan, who you'll learn more about later in the program. When we talk about product development.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And we did a round of jobs to be done for base camp. He does them once a quarter.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So every 3 months he'll do a round of jobs to be done. Interviews.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And we came up with 4. This was, I don't know. Probably.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
6, 7 years ago, I think.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
We did this.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
But here are the 4 job statements that he came up with. And, by the way, we didn't refer to them as job statements.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
These are just.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
What I think Jason calls it the why before the why.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So I'll show you these 4 as a means to.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
As a north star for you all to aspire for.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
For each of your businesses, and for what you want to present to us, and to.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Others.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So this is number one. This is what we learned, as you can imagine, like the the visual itself is kind of speaking to this, but.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
What we heard was, we can't keep working like this.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
That's what came out of that was the number.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Screaming cluster like, How did you find yourself at Base Camp? We spoke to people who had recently signed up, and are paying for the tool. Now for at least a few months.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And what we heard was they were being overwhelmed with notifications and email threads and.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Conference calls and keeping track of information here, there, and everywhere else.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And something was broken, and they had to find a way to fix it.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So people found themselves in a position where it was like a hair on fire. I can't take it anymore.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And they found their home in base.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So that was the 1st cluster of people that we identified.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The next one.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Was. We can't mess up like that again.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
These were people who.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Had some sort of bad event that happened with a client or with an interaction with one of their users or customers, and in screwing up, they said, you know what we need to not only tell them that we'll do better next time, but that we've already taken a proactive step to be better.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And here's how we're gonna more properly structure our work and communicate our progress and demonstrate that we have our act together.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
This is another group of emotional energy for folks, and why they found themselves signing up for base camp.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And base camp at the time.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Had different pricing structures, and I'll explain more about that in a minute.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But there were significant changes that we considered making to base camp. The product.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
In light of these. These examples.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
2 more left.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Another one was, this project isn't getting off the ground. So people were toiling around either in Google docs or in email threads. And they're trying to get started. They're getting excited about either starting a company or working on a new project or getting, you know, some sort of new initiative started either at their business or with the new business, and they needed a way to formalize things and say, alright, now it's serious.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Like, now, it's time to actually get started. We're gonna put everything in a place. We're gonna sign up for this tool. And we're gonna make things real.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And last, but not least.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
How am I going to pull this off.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So this one is.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Anticipating a major challenge coming.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Right. So maybe your company announces a new set of goals or kpis. Maybe there's you know, a deadline on the horizon, and now you're it's it's crunch time, and you need.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
You know your ironman suit to to pull through, or something special that's gonna help, you know, juice you through the next phase of progress.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
People with that kind of.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Motivation, and even fear.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Would hire a tool like basecamp to overcome.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So with these 4.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Insights.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
There's 2 buckets.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Most of the jobs insights lead you to.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Like, I said. One is with marketing and sales, and the other one is with product.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Bringing all that together. There's a north star.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So the way this originally manifested, and this is years ago. So obviously the the company has gone through lots of other changes since.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Is this is the homepage.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000
That ended up getting implemented after those interviews that we had conducted, and having these conversations, so it was the notion of addressing.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
This pain that we identified from the more recent customers who have been signing up for it.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So this is a helpful way for you all, as you have your conversations about like.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Go to your homepage now and compare to after you have these conversations? And are you potential customers right front and center.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Right.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So they use all the language and all the kind of marketing techniques. And they they weren't advertising much back then. But.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Even in wherever they were communicating about their business, they would leverage these different jobs and buckets to reiterate that they understood who they were talking to, and who they were, appealing to.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
So that's 1 bucket right marketing and sales the other one.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And this was actually even more fun to me.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Product.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:51.000
So the tool that we've been using this was years ago. So it's funny how it's like largely unchanged, even though there's been many different improvements to the product over the years. This was what it was like 7 years ago.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And here we are with the similar structure, just like like a very different ui, I guess slightly different.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
But if you look at the identification of each of these cards.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
These were all words that came out of those 14 jobs to be done, interviews that we did.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So when we spoke to people they were talking about Slack and hipchat.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And status, meanings and.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Like having their personal calendar get overwhelmed. They're stacked over and being micromanaged and having messy email threads or having lots of different file management tools and systems that they hop around and and over to.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So by calling by like not having to conjure your own terms to resonate with customers, but instead using their what they say to you in these interviews and conversations.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
All of a sudden it becomes easy.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
To, to effectively communicate and decide on product changes that you want to make.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Liliana.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Yeah, I'm gonna put George, our team member, George, on the spot because he asked me a really good question this morning.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Okay, and, George, I think it would be good to share with the class. Do you want to.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Like quickly.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Reword, or summarize what you were asking.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Sure, I basically thought about.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Yesterday, and asked Biliana, you know how.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Does what we're learning here apply on the outbound sales.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Side of this. So email campaign.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Cold calling sales cycle. How does it affect.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
You know that process in attending materially changed because of.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Understanding, your customer, better.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Here and get a good answer for me.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Yeah. And I answered it in like multiple parts. So one, you know who to reach out to so like your actual segment is like targeted, and you and you get more hits on the bullseye.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.000
2. When you're talking to them you can ask them a couple of questions, and as long as they were already in the customer segment. You have decided it.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Is your one to go after your good Icp. You can quickly realize which of your 3 or 2 job statements they fall into, and then you immediately know their situation without having to go into it. So it it will feel to them like you really understand their problem. 3, rd you all also be able to send out ads.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:20.000
You'll know exactly who to paint a target, and the ads themselves will have language that your customers use, so it will resonate with people and people will start coming to you. So a good hack for the marketing ramifications here are to take.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Direct quotes from your interviews, and use them in your advertising and your marketing and your outbound.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And then the last thing I told George is the product changes and implications that come out of the insights that you make directly.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Help make your marketing more successful. So when you're doing all this outbound, not only are you having better hit rates to get on the call with them, but your product addresses the needs that they have, so you can be more confident selling it and.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
The product kind of speaks for itself because it feels like you know them in like a.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
A very fitted glove way.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
So I really liked that conversation we had this morning. I'm sure other people were wondering that, too. Did you want to add anything, Neil?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
That was great.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
So.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:15.000
One other example I have to share. Now and then we have more. So we have founders that are gonna come back and share some. Liliana has a few loaded up as well.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
So I'm excited for you all to see what it's like today as we work with founders through techsoup and what those references are. But.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
As old school as I am. I like to kind of use my own data first, st and

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Another piece of my lore is that I did this coding school thing so.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
One of the frustrations I had when I was running my school was.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Learning, management, systems.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
So I tried to use.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Base camp for it. I tried to use apps like blackboard, and then another app called canvas came out not long after, but these were all like really beefy tools. And then there was even this software called Google Classroom. I don't know if anybody remembers Google classroom. I think they ended it, or it's no longer in the what it was. But I tried all these different learning management tools, and and none of them did the job for me. So I ended up like rolling my own product, and I built a an app called lantern. This is a long time.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:20.000
But I built my own Lms for my school, and then I realized that I could actually start selling it to universities. So I started getting a university professors onto the platform, and I ended up having a little bit of traction and made a little bit of money. Not a lot. But it was a fun little like.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Tool. I called it base camp for classrooms. That was my high value concept, for it.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
But I wanted to share. The more traditional formula.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Of when I want to. So I can. And what that job story manifests as just to give you all another reference for it. So as I did jobs to be done, interviews for lantern.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Here are the 3 that kind of came out of it.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.000
One was, I've got a week before class starts. Let's update the curriculum in syllabus. So this is from the perspective of the professor.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
And this is exactly what I was going through as a teacher.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
So when I'm preparing for my class for next quarter. During the break.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:06.000
I wanna make changes based on what I learned the last time. So I can have a plan and stick to it going into each class. So this directly led to a feature that we were building out, which was essentially a syllabus builder.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Right? So you take a syllabus for a class and you want to refine it and update it based on what you're gonna do next.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
So that was leading up to the class.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
There's 2 more. One was. This part of class isn't going as planned. I need to adjust what we're doing.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:32.000
So this happens in real time, as you're having a session even like this one right here, or when you're teaching something you need to call an audible every now and then, when you know things either go in a different direction, or someone asked in an interesting question, and it opens up a cascade of conversation that you hadn't anticipated.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000
So when I'm teaching and something doesn't go according to plan, I want to make an adjustment to class in real time. So I can keep my students and not feel disorganized.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
So that's another version of something I can both advertise and market around.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Connect with certain professors, but then also, build features around as well.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:02.000
And last, but not least, did I teach a successful class today. This is that long drive I have coming from Evanston, Illinois, driving back down to South side of City of Chicago. And I'm thinking for those 45 min.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Did I say the right thing? Did I ask the right question? Were the students what do I need to do next week?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
How do I remember teaching this class better for the next quarter? I need to teach.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
So when I'm done with class, I want to know what went well, what could be better? So I can make adjustments.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So these were those big buckets.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
And the way to kind of like bring this all home from a product. Standpoint is.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
We're understanding the job right now.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
And then there's patterns in the world of who does what? So any.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Given feature, functionality, or button press or ui element, you see, is borrowed from someone else in large part.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
So even the elements in base camp. I remember I was talking to Jason about implementing his jobs when he was building the next version of it.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
And I asked them like, Okay, well, where did you come up with this layout for your messages in this inbox? He says. He pulled up Gmail.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And he goes. You see these.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Like lines here like, that's where I got the inspiration from. So I think it's really cool that it's not a big deal to draw inspiration from what you know and what resonates with you, and so long as you're being respectful and not explicitly, you know.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Copying and pasting.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
You know. Just look at the world and understand the patterns, and implement them yourselves in your own way, for your customers.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And that leads to your product concepts. So.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Final quote from Bob.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
The struggling moment is the seat for all innovation. Find where people struggle, and if they're not struggling, they're not buying.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Bob and I have had a lot of time together over the years, and.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I I gotta say I'm looking forward to you all meeting him. He's gonna be, I think, joining us in a month or 2. So that'll be a little bit of a master class to hear from him, and he's gonna interact and work with all your businesses.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
But just to like kind of conclude here.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Your business decisions can be informed by this, you can change the way you market your company.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
The language you're gonna use to, you know. Describe your products.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Where you're choosing to advertise what channels you're leveraging for. It.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
And who you're even selling to.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
It's not about a particular industry.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
It's not about demographics like we talked about.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And it's not even about your competitors before it's about the job that the people you want to help are hiring you to do.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
So think about their situation.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Think about the reality they're trying to wrangle.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
And the progress that they're trying to make.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.000
That's it.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Yeah, we should pause here for questions, cause we're gonna go into.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
A separate thing. Does anyone want to ask anything about.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
These base camp airline turn examples.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
This is a good.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Preview of what you guys are going to be doing in week 6. You're gonna present this. It'll kind of be the capstone of your whole jobs to be done.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Learning here.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
I know we've we've kind of hinted a little bit at the changes between B to C and B to BI.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I. I'm curious how if, like any of the questions you mentioned for, like larger purchases, right like if you're not buying like a small like $8 thing versus like a 50,000 thing.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Yeah.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Like in my end. People are trying to do these like bigger costs. It's like you would kind of phrase it differently, or changing with the way you're asking questions.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
For sure. Yeah. So you yeah, it's definitely gonna be. You will.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Have fewer inputs regarding some of the more personal narratives that we get into right like.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000
We're not asking. You know who you were at home with on your kitchen counter, having an argument with about making a purchase on an Amazon. You know, shopping list website.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:48.000
So there are some subtle differences there. Cause the work context is gonna be where more of the conversation centers? But even then.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
There is a lot of consistency, though, with the the.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
The the notion of needing to color the environment.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:07.000
So what you'll have to do on the B Twob front, which can be frustrating is you're gonna have to have multiple conversations with different people at different levels, who are all influencing the decision rather than the individual purchaser.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:16.000
So, Morgan, as you as you go, and as you formulate your screening, you'll have to be a little bit more robust, and maybe the different subgroups that you break down.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
But then we can help prepare you a little bit, and coach you directly on.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
You know, ways to approach those conversations where you get the most value from it.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Thank you.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:37.000
I have a follow up question on that. So would those be considered different jobs to be done sets because you're speaking to different decision makers? Or can they be part of the same.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Set.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I think you can start with it as part of the same set.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
But if it's very clear that there are.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Extremely different needs.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
You will intuitively split them up.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Right? So different stakeholders are gonna have different criteria.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
But I've also learned at the b 2 b side that.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Different companies may have.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Different levels of influence between the champion and the person who's signing off.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
So they may have alignment versus some others who may have very different motivations.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
And it'll take more time to identify the pattern.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
But I would start with it as a 1 group.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Annie.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
How do you? How do you.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Determine, because I know with when I do customer feedback.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Got it? Thanks.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:37.000
You know. Sometimes it can be all over the place, and you have to kind of decide what customer feedback to really absorb and what customer feedback.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Yeah.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
To kind of toss out as a 1 off.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Is that with.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Is that where the patterns comes in? So if, like a feedback comes up over and over again, you take it. If it only comes up once you kind of ignore it. How do you weigh between.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Feedbacks.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Excellent question. So you treat it kind of like a heat map.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Okay.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000
So what you'll see is, there will be certain things that come up over and over again, and there's a few outliers that we like to call out as well.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And every now and then an outlier might be worth digging into meaning like you only heard one person say it, but it resonates with you, and you want to dig in more.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:35.000
So you may do another round of interviews centered around that outlier example, just to validate whether there's something there or not. So you might get a hint with an anecdote like that. But yes, you are looking for the heat map and the patterns, and it's kinda hard to just for you to take my word for it. But I promise you that with the right screening, it's it's almost gonna you're you're gonna feel like you're wasting your time.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
By the time you're you're doing it right. So you're on interview 10.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
And you're like

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
I know I already know where this is going.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:54.000
And then you end up ending the call early. So it's a 15 min interview instead of a 30 min interview, because you kinda you were able to guess at every step what they were. Gonna say. So that's when the patterns emerge. Annie.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Okay. Great.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Cool.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Yeah, I have another example of screening this time. It's from cicada.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
I'd love to pull it up, and then you can like talk through what you think. There.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Be this.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Like b to b but

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
The businesses they're selling to are independent artists.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Let me share really quick.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
This is good.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Yes, and Mitch was a standout from the last program, with jobs to be done as well. He had some significant breakthroughs that changed the direction of his business. It's a good example.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Professional musicians. This was a scary business. Y'all just so, you know I I.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Live music. It's it's there's a lot of money, but it's it's a very hard business to make work, especially with tech.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Change their talent. Manager, booking agent, recording label or merchandise provider, again boiling the ocean.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Alright!

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
All like 4. So only thing I critique here is that he's trying to.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
More stuff in with his criteria. Then he probably should, with starting.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Because I believe where we landed with cicada, if I recall correctly, was the talent manager.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
It was talent, manager and merch, provider.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
So they went downwards and.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Yeah.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Right. So he ended up not needing the booking agent or recording label.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
But because he cast a wide net. In the beginning he found out that the booking agent and recording label weren't relevant.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:46.000
And that the talent managers and merchandise providers were the ones that he wanted to ultimately serve, and he ended up having to split up talent, management, and merchandise providers as different sets of interviews.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
That he conducted.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
And we helped him through that.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
So.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Yep.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
And then you have different product ramifications from both sets that kind of changed and led to what? Where he was at Demo day.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
But do you guys see how specific this is? So he might know I'm.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
It was, it was probably difficult for him to find 15 people who specifically fit this exact set.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Well, what I'm struggling with, though, is the or it feels like the org just opens it up considerably. So you would. Shouldn't that be an and or why did he go with the or customers.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Who have recently signed up for one of the case plans. It's like.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Well, but he's he's including his customers, along with other like potential competitor.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Along with it.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
So he. He conflated the.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Exactly.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Probably because he didn't have enough customers for to do his own research on his own.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000
He had only 3 or 3 to 5, I remember, and so he couldn't do a full set with that. And so he did. People who hired a competitor, or who hired his.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And it ended up being the same moment for both.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I see. Okay.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
What he was currently offering.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
And.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
I'm.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Yes.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Ask you a lot of questions, so I'll make sure I do this right? So.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Good.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
If if

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Cause for ours. There's new regulations coming out right? So they might have not been using something before, so it might not necessarily have been a switch, but they've started doing something. It does that go into the same category as a switch. It's so.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Specifically like.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:20.000
They've never collected Dei data. And now they're collecting Dei data.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Okay.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Yeah. Switch from non-consumption counts. We just call that a hiring moment.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
So hiring, firing your switch.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Just another.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
All, all, count.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And I like your question, Danny. They're very helpful to the group.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Agreed.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Thank you.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Anything else to note here.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
I like this part.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Like qualifying it to make sure that not only have they done this like one of these things, but they're of quality for me to talk to.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Because it would be a waste of his time. If they don't do at least 15 performances, they're not going to make any money.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
From Mircha's platform. Cicada, if they don't make.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Or do that many performances, so it just wouldn't be mutually beneficial. So don't even talk to the people who aren't.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Going to benefit from your product.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Cool any other questions here before we move on.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Just want the like learn about. How did he.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Exactly find find these people.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Like. How did he search for these people? Because.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Like sitting down comfortably narrowed lists, like narrows.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Aspects are a thing but to find and reaching these people.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
It's it's a whole. Another story.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Because you cannot.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Get enough data to make sure those people did. He just like.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Try to reach out.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
I'm a massive group, and like collects.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
When he gets the proper responses, or.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Something else.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:19.000
So there were a couple I know he did go on some like Facebook pages and things like that of musicians, but he also mainly got them from the network of his network. So he asked his current customers for referrals to other musicians, because they all know people. He also asked musicians that he knows that maybe aren't customers about.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Referrals to other people.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Those are the main ways that he found other businesses to talk to, I would say for you, it's like, you guys are all gamers. You can talk to people like Dave. Get Dave to give you referrals. You like. Current customers can give you referrals to other customers like people know people who are like them. So that's like the best way to start.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Do you have any more advice about the hunt? Now.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Because I know it's kind of tricky.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
It is, but you have to get.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:01.000
You have to be those weird founders that just get really creative and crafty how to get in front of people. You know what I mean, like, this is the game.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
I think I said this to some folks who hung out for overtime yesterday.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
But, like the whole idea here is.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
If.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
It's hard to find them.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
You should be excited.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Because that means that of your competitors are also having a hard time getting a hold of these people to get these insights.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
So if you do the work and you get, you know you get in front of these folks. You're you're getting access to information that sets you at an advantage.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
So when you like, I I also love from a fundraising standpoint, because then, when you end up talking to investors.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
It's almost like you're sharing like a secret.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Yeah, like, we're onto something like, we have something really interesting that we figured out about what's going on here and why we build our product in a certain way, and it's not like by saying it out loud. Someone could steal it.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Because the level of depth that you have with understanding and unpacking these people's journeys and their stories.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Cannot just be easily written down and shared and understood.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:08.000
So again, I think it's a secret weapon for you to figure that out, and as you struggle which you will, I will get creative in helping you think about ways to identify the right people within your particular industry or segment.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Yeah, I was telling the team at our off. Say, this is one of the easiest ways to make a moat for your business.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Like, Neil was saying. You don't have to worry about any sort of product info being stolen or anything like that. This is a true, unfair advantage that you can show to investors and also win.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000
So. So one question I have like for my particular characters is, am I looking for people who are currently bot playing my game?

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Or who have currently purchased my name. Is it? Am I.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Hmm.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
In in my focus on people who are playing or purchasing.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000
That's interesting. So I would be interested in both groups eventually. I don't know which group we should prioritize right now.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
But one group is you. You purchased my game, but you're not playing it anymore.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
What's going on right.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.000
The other group is, you're an active player of my game, and you purchased it. I want more of you, and I want more people to be like you.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
So that latter group is interesting.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:11.000
But the question the question is, is, do I do I recruit based on play, or do I recruit based on purchase because there could be people out there that are playing it, but have never purchased it.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Or and so am I focused on the playability. Am I focused on the purchaseability.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Well, it depends on your learning objective. So I can. I can derive 2 learning objectives from those 2 different things, a lot of people that go through people who have purchased, but they're not using it. That's like I wanna make my product better. Why aren't people using it? If you wanna talk and get more customers, and you're just worried about them paying and getting in the door. You probably wanna talk to the people who have purchased it like.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Period, end statement just purchased.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Okay.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
So it's what you're learning, right? So like.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Some of our companies have already gotten a lot of customers, and they're just having like conversion problems like maybe they purchase it. They get a lot of people through the door, and they realize their product isn't good because they're losing people. After the 3rd month.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Yeah.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
That would be like. Why, you would do the users.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Jobs to be done.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Yeah, I mean, before the live demo. This is what I had ready to pull up to talk about briefly, as a group.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
For anyone who's thought about it? Or was it willing to share.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Right? What? What would make this a success for you?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:25.000
To take this seriously, because one thing I really don't want is for this to be a waste of your time. So if you feel like you've got it dialed in, and you know the jobs, and you're ready to, just, you know. Hit, go and take all our money and drop it into your sales strategy.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
There's a case for that. It's probably rare. But if somebody wants to make that argument with me, I've I've fielded it before.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:49.000
But otherwise I'd be curious to know other people's learning objectives.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Go ahead, George!

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Oh, cool. Thanks. I'm happy to go. Yeah, so.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
You've probably noticed through the interview process that

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I have one kind of vertical.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Kind of well defined, but that one super vague where I'm sort of talking about the buyers of market research that I want to target.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
And so that's something that's been causing a fair bit of anxiety about. How do I approach.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
This massive sort of segment and.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Sort of.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Divide those up, and.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Prioritise those so.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Definitely my objective there is to.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Understand that sort of.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Number of verticals.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Great, and and.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
I'm so I'm paying hugely, like, I'm really hugely focused right now on this.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
This is setting off all the flags. Yeah.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:43.000
No, that's awesome, George. I actually wanted I wanted to get your comments on this actually, because, given what you do with your business. This is like the almost like I feel like a precursor to hopefully what no edic becomes.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Yeah, yeah, so interesting, like.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
You know, I've spoken with so many market research companies. And what you guys are doing is like.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
I would say, of a higher quality than.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Any of them. Do you know what I mean like, this is the foundational stuff that none of them get right? Basically.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
I think the only company I've ever spoken to that does.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Something of this size, you know, Gartner.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Yeah, I do.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
They do the hype cycle.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Yep.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Yeah, God, no, yeah. So I'd say they're the only research company I've spoken with on this level of quality.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Well.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
I.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
To be honest in this foundational approach, so.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
No.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:23.000
It. It means a lot coming from you, sir, since this is your world of expertise, and I'm just moonlighting here for the past decade for startups. But thank you for saying that.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Needs a lot.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
No super impressive. So like, yeah, for everyone who's here as well.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
This is setting up all of the sort of all the neurons at the moment for me, where I'm like.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Okay, these guys know what they're talking about. I've got a seriously.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Focus on this and take it seriously. So.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Yeah.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Hmm.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Let's go. Yeah, it helps. It helps when you're with like the the people who do it for real, you know, like the professors in this universities and stuff. And then you then you see that they're behind, like a lot of interesting products like I can't say who and on what, but.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
I've said, Apple, I've said, you know.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:07.000
There's intercom. There's sonos, there's a lot of products. Instagram.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Yeah.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Whoa!

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
So this is the stuff that they're doing behind the scenes at these companies that they're not promoting or talking about. But these are the ideas that they're leveraging. So our mission has been to bring it to the early stage Startup Land. As we are right now, so I'm glad it's it's connecting.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
It's amazing. Thanks.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Alright!

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
William.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Yeah, look, I am echoly. All those words. It's it's a much, much deeper dive than we've ever thought about tackling this, and I think, as you guys know, the text, Us team, we're.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
We've been.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Exploring a few different verticals, a few different industries. But the big kind of reflection and takeaway from this for us is.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Messaging and language that we're using when we're gonna be reaching out to them, and even pages actually going back to the drawing board and.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Really tightening up the language to make it really resonate with what we.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Believe is the the problem that they're that we're trying to solve.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
At the moment. It's far too generic. With a few little sprinkles, but it needs to be.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Yeah, completely.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Ripped up. So it's

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Yeah, something that I like the base camp example with.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
That that landing page with the hair on fire.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Yeah.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Well, you know this is, it might surprise you all. But when I started at this job 5 years ago.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
I I no jobs, and I was teaching it and stuff. But.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Coming in as a managing director for techs. For the 1st time.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
I had.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
A lot of imposter syndrome.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Cause. I was fairly young. I think I was the youngest to have been ever been hired to do the job. And I was like, okay, I'm not gonna tell anyone what to do. I'm just gonna offer up things I think are helpful.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:07.000
So I just like floated these ideas to that 1st class of founders. I didn't prescribe it. I didn't have exercises or activities. I just said, Hey, here's the thing I know, and if anyone's interested I can help.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
And as every program went on.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Liliana, and I got more and more confident.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
About how important this was, because we saw the difference between the companies that took it seriously.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
And their performance, either from fundraising from profitability.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Being alive as a business. Still, the ones who took jobs during the program of their own volition, where there was like there was a correlation.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
In their in their trajectory. So that's why it's like so heavy.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
In this current, like form.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
For you all. So just understand? Like it came from a lot of iterations and feedback.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Neil, can you go back to the job statement? I wanna run through. Okay, perfect.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
What Neil was saying here earlier. I'm sure a lot of you are still going to do it.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Like the little pitfall that happens here. So I thought it would be helpful to visualize or to demonstrate with an example. Think about the Mcdonald's milkshake example that we went through on Wednesday.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Does anyone want to take a stab at trying to write a job statement for what.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Clay would have used after all of the interviews he did, talking to all the people who were drinking the monks before 8 in the morning.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
I will give you a hint.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
That I want to is not. I want to drink a milkshake.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:38.000
That is what we mean by like inserting your your product in there. I promise you. The 1st thing that a lot of people will think is like when I'm driving to work. I want a milkshake that.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Filled me up so I can be full for work and be occupied on the drive.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
That's exactly what kind of like a 1st time.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Attempt at making a job statement looks like, and that's fine, and a lot of you will do that, and you'll do it withouticing, and we'll critique it because.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
The job statement is supposed to be separate from your product. The product you have right now may or may not.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Be. The answer to what this job statement is. The whole point is that we want the truth. We're not tailoring it so that the product you have right now.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Fits this. We want the truth of the customers so that you can change your product to exactly it. It's kind of like useless if we're just gonna.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Meld it to fit whatever we have already.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Same with like the snickers when I'm in a rush. Neil gave us the when part when I'm in the rut in a rush I'm starving, and I don't know when the next time I'm gonna eat is I want to buy a snickers on the way to my gate so I can be.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Satiated during my flight. That doesn't work as well. They don't want to buy a sneakers they want. I want a quick snack that I can buy on the way to my gate.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
They want to stave off hunger.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
One hand, yeah.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
So they can sleep on the plane after they get their emails done before they get on the plane.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Exactly.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
So you don't want to insert your product.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Does anyone wanna try.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
With the milkshake. Example.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
What those people want, what those commuters.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Job statement would be.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000
When I'm on a long commute I wanna do something with my hands.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Yeah.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
I wanna occupy myself.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
So so you can. What's the rest, Dave?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
So I can. What.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
So I could not be bored. On my way to my job.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
There we go!

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:30.000
And I think I think that's totally valid. I think there are probably like 2 or 3 that come out of this video from client, and that was definitely one of them.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Caesar.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Yeah, it was pretty similar, like, when I'm driving, I want to have a distraction, so I can enjoy the road a bit.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Exactly can anyone think of I can think of like one more? That also came out of the.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Video. So we have the people who want something in their hand.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
But.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.000
There's also a more general one.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Think of the competitors they were buying. The job statement should fit across all the things they were hiring. So they were hiring bagels.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Bananas, donuts.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Were those all just to have something in their hand? Or was there a group that also wanted something else?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Yeah, I guess to be satisfied. They've they've got some form of hunger, but not.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Yeah, they've got a few different options to choose from.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Yeah. So do you wanna try a job statement? William.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:39.000
So when I'm driving to work I want to in the morning I wanna relieve my hunger.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
No, that's perfect, so I can.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Is that hang totally messed up? So yeah, so that I can feel energized for work.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Yeah, for when I get to my job exactly.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:56.000
I. And I can imagine that if we ask them about what happened before they started doing that they might arrive like a zombie, or like in a slog, where they arrive in their.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Starving, and they just eat the 1st thing from the vending machine. I mean, that's those are just speculation. You would have to ask the customers. But that's exactly right. So those would be the 2 I would say, I got from the milkshake interview. That is exactly right. And you guys did it perfectly. So does everyone see how the motivation is not? You're not saying.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.000
The product that you want. It's what you want to accomplish, so that you can get your expected outcome.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
So that's all I wanted to say. Here, now.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
No, that's a great point. And it reminded me to mention one other thing which.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
The other reason why we've incorporated so much of this jobs training before the program even officially starts.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Is.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
We find that you all go into mentor madness in particular.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
And when you end up meeting with the mentors.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
They start to grill you and ask really tough questions, because they're very smart people.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
They!

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Will kind of.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Run you in circles a little bit, and then people come out of mentor madness, kind of overwhelmed and exhausted because you've been answering tough questions for 2 weeks, straight.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000
And it feels like you weren't even able to effectively.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:16.000
You know, defends yourself in your business in some respects, because their job is to poke holes in it the whole time, so it can be very draining. It's kind of like raising. It's it's almost like raising capital. That's how much strain can can be put on founders when they go through it.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
So what gives you like true.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Like armor going into that.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
That journey.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Is not just your own opinions about the viability of your business.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
But no, no, I've spoken to.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Customers.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Of these products which are in my competitive set and my own, if I have them.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
And here's what they say.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:48.000
So it's less about you having a disagreement with an investor or a mentor about what you both think is right or wrong about what the need is. And instead, it's literally using the demand side validation that you have.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
To like. Say, here's what I'm hearing. Here's what I'm learning, and here's what they're saying.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Because it's a huge like.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
UN unfortunate pattern within venture.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
For us, investors.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000
To think we know more than we do.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
And I can't.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Tell you how many times I've heard investors.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Try to like personally, connect or relate to the problem that you're solving with your business and make claims about their understanding of it, based on their own anecdotal instincts.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
And experiences.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:25.000
So it's not a particularly sophisticated or impressive thing, but that is unfortunately how the game goes, and people will make decisions.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Based off of those personal anecdotes, especially if you, the founder, don't come back with your own.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000
A set of of insights and data that you can point to.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.000
So that's the other thing we're designing against by having you all get ahead with this information.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Cool.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Alright, I promise to do it. Live do you all want to?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Ask anything else before we dive into this. Is there any other final things? Because once we do this, we'll probably conclude.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:00.000
We'll do one or 2 sets.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Alright cool

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Do you all need a break before we start this? Do you need like a 5 min bio break, or something like that? Are you ready to go, and you just power through and end early. I saw a thumb went up.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Bio break. Yes.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Alright!

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Take 5.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
We'll be back in 5.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
1111 sharp will start.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
We'll start at 11. Pst.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
You're you're gonna want to be extremely focused for the next 30 min to hear this interview.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Perfect.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Are you, gonna Djulian? Even Djing.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
There we go!

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Yeah, I can. I mean, it's just my local.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000
So when I play.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
I mean, it's better. It's better than all my random stuff.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:48.000
I play this all day in my house.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Play it. Take 5. Since we're taking 5.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Yeah, sorry I didn't. I just saw it. Sec.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000
All good.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Alright!

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Let's do this.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Okay, so.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000
I gave you all assignment at the top of this call.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Who's been spending money.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Knee takers.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000
I'm happy to all.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:55.000
I mean, I've bought stuff, but I don't remember anything.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Yeah, I want struggling purchases. I want purchases that took some effort. Yeah, George, what's 1 for you?

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000
I'm a pretty good. Yeah.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
They were really quick, so they might not contain much information.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Oh, what's 1? 0,

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
This right here. Oh, you can't see it. It's a.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.000
You backpack. It was expensive, but there was a lot of consideration that went into it. So.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
How much.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Money.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
It!

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
200 8,300 pounds.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Okay.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
That's a lot.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Yeah.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
That's yeah, okay. And then you struggled. How did you struggle to buy it?

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
I went back and forth with other products for quite a while.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000
And.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Trying to choose between the different sizes of the same product or.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
A new one. All that kind of stuff.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Trying to watch, really reviews and zoom in and see all features.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Okay. Okay.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000
That kind of thing. So.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Good, all right. So I got a backpack.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
What else we got. Y'all.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000
What are some other purchases?

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Maybe what insurance health insurance to get for coming to the Us.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
For 3 months, and kind of deliberating and.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Learning about all the different conditions. That was quite the struggle.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Okay. And then where did you end? Up?

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
What did you choose?

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:20.000
So ended up using like an insurance marketplace that was recommended by someone. But then the Crm on that to use so.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Ended up using the one that matched. What most people said would be would be helpful for us during that period.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Yeah.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
That was.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Quite a lot of time in like looking into the different contracts and conditions.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Okay? And then what? What was the ultimate cost of it?

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
What's the rate.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Conference.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Quote is $300.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Yeah.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000
300. Okay? And then is that like a recurring, it's some cadence. Is that monthly or something else?

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
So it's that's a 1 off fee for the 3 months.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Okay, got it, got it.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000
What else we got.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And a backpack. I got insurance.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
No one's spending any money.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
What's the one.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Can it be for work, or does it have to be a personal purchase.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I mean it could be either personal is usually juicier at this phase, but it doesn't matter.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I had a struggle. I had to buy a.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Kind of like a document for our our cell culture work last month. That was hard.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Okay. How much was the document?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Was 5,000.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Woo.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Alright, okay, and that, and that's on the business end. But that's that's still real like.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Yeah.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
You could take that personally.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Okay.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
It hurt a little. I didn't want to.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
But you did.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Yes, yes.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
That's a good one.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
What else? What else?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Backpack insurance and a document.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
We just found a place to stay in San Francisco to attend this program, and it was a really.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000
By the process, because we do not know anywhere. To like live where to live would have to go to the.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Office.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
What to do in San Francisco, and how to like perfectly.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Without like x.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Feeding our budgets.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And where did you land? How much is the place that you signed up for.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
It's around 5 grand.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And it's around. It's at mission district.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Got it. So it's and it's how many of you all.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Saying, there.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
4.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
4.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
So 4 people, 5 grand! That's that's actually not crazy.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Yeah.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
All right.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Hopefully.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, we'll see.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
That's hair.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Alright. So we got a couple 5 granders. I like that big money, big money.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Anyone else.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Nobody purchased anything on Prime Day. That was like over 100 bucks. I bet you some of you did.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I didn't even know it was prime Day. That's a.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
That was the thing.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
In July.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Oh, okay.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Not a fine day, or anything, but like I go to.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Shoot boots.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I wanted.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Hiking boots.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Yeah, I wanted something that will be like, repellant, repellent. And I bought a bit of like $60 or something.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
But.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It took a long time for me to decide. I can.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Hmm, okay.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:39.000
60. 0, I can! I can move, can get expensive. I bought my 1st pair for the 1st time ever in my life earlier this year, and I was like Oh, no, you could.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
You can spend a lot of money on shoes. I was like jeez.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
They're gonna get dirty right away. What's going on.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I bought. I bought my mom a set of dog training classes.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:01.000
She got a new dog. It was for her. It was her birthday present, and the dog training classes total was $1,200.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
So, okay, so tell me, this is interesting.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Did you struggle to buy this for your mom?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I did. Yes, it was very expensive, and.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I I got to a point where my mom was driving me crazy about the dog, so.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Yeah.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Oh, okay, she was driving you crazy. So this was more like you. I need to spend this money to.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Yes.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
This is, there's more than just your benefit. This is about my benefit, too.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yes.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I like them.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
1,200 for dog trip. That's crazy. How many classes is it? I'm curious now.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It's total. 8 classes.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000
But yeah, very fancy dog trainer.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I don't know guys. I think we have a winner.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Yeah, I wanna know.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Oh, no! Really.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I think the fancy dog trainer might be the one. Yeah, that.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I need to know the story behind it.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I want to know.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
This is.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Oh, you'll get so much insight into my family life. This is gonna be exciting.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
That's what I'm here for. This is good.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Let's do it.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
William, did you wanna say something?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I mean looking at the price. This is probably since our 1 million or something.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
That.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
William, were you gonna say something?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Yeah, I was. I was gonna volunteer, Dominique, but because I haven't been purchasing. But.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000
She recently moved away. After about 10 years.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
From using an iphone, and she's bought a Samsung flip.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Whoa!

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And I can tell you that was that was like at least a 1 year purchase decision.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Because she's she uses every other.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Mac product. So she's like.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Wow!

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Away from the ecosystem. But I'm sorry she's she can't join tonight. But yeah, that was. There was a lot of struggle in that decision.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Well, William, you have some homework now.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Yeah.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Yeah.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I'm gonna do the.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You have to do the interview. You have to come back to us. We need to know, like, how does that go.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Title.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Yes, take what you've learned.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000
But no, I'm loving. I'm loving these other examples.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Lady.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
All right. Annie, I think we're gonna have to go with it.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Yeah.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Alright!

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Liliana, are you gonna join me in this.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Alright!

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Get ready for an in-depth. Look at me and my mother's relationship. So.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Let's go. Okay. So everyone's in on this. By the way. So Liliana and I will drive it.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But we have this thing called game off.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So if I say game off, that means that we'll pause. The interview itself.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Come to the room and like, talk about what we're hearing, you all are. Gonna help us identify the questions we need to ask.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
So I'm never perfect at this. So it's always a learning process for me, too.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
So remember, it's not about the script.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
We're looking for functional and emotional forces at play.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
And for the interview itself.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Try to think about what you would ask.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Instead of one of us.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Right as we go.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Listen really closely.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Try to identify the forces of progress as they come up.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Try to map the timeline as we go as well like. Treat yourself like you're our co-pilot.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
In this conversation.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
With Annie.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And if there's any questions that we don't ask, that you think are important, write them down so that.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
You'll have a chance to ask them at the end if we have time.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Cool.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Alright! So here's a quick reference.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Just for you to kind of have that in. Maybe I can take a screenshot of this and drop it in the chat.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Because I don't think we need it up. Live right now. But I'll just go ahead and do that real quick.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Go.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And here.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Alright, it should be in the chat.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Now.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Great.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
All right. So Annie.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yes.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Thank you for joining us. Do we have permission to record this conversation.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
You sure do.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Okay, thank you. Well, we're gonna ask you some questions, and.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
You know. Forgive us if I ever interject I. I'm not trying to be rude. I'm trying to respect our time.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
And you know, sometimes we'll end up asking very specific questions, and they might come off strange, but.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Just know that we're trying our best to color the scene and just get to know you better and understand.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
These classes that you purchased for your mother recently.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Cool. Alright, so if you don't mind starting when did you make this purchase?

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I made this purchase in June of this year.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
June of this year. Okay? And.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Yeah.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
So that was, you know, a few months ago. It was it.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
A particular time, like what was going on in June.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Well, so it was.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000
My mother's birthday coming up her birthdays June 4.th

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And I was trying to think of a gift. I hadn't really come up with anything like too significant. It was her 70th birthday, so I wanted to give her something very nice and meaningful.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And then it was also around that time that her and I were planning.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
To take a summer trip to Montana. So we were driving together to Montana.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Yeah. And and we're just doing a lot of planning ahead of time. So I was also communicating with her a lot during that time.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Okay? And so you were planning the trip. Is that what you mean?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Yeah, planning. You know, I was gonna drive down to San Diego, and then we were with, all of our pets. Gonna be driving up to Montana.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Okay, all of our pets. So so, Ca, can you help me understand? Who are these pets?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Yes, so.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Who's in the roster here.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
The roster is my cat Ozzie, who you all have met.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And then she has a very large cat splotch and then she has a 9 month old puppy with 9 months old at the time. That she had recently gotten she actually got the dog for the cat the cat needed a friend and was a very big kind of rough house type of cat.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:14.000
And so she thought, a dog it would get along. And they are. They're like the best of friends. But it was definitely a new adventure, traveling with a dog.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Okay and had, had you ever.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Done this before, or is this the 1st time you are traveling together with your pets?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
1st time.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
1st time.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Okay, and and the purchase that you made for her. So her birthday was June 4.th Did you make it before June 4, th or after.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Yeah. So I made it actually, yes. So I guess I made the

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Purchase in May. Like end of May.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Okay, and and.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
How long had you been thinking about these classes?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Probably.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:59.000
So I've been thinking about getting her classes, but I was on the fence because they were so like, I knew that classes were expensive. I hadn't done like a ton of research on them. But I'd been.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Probably mulling over.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Getting her classes.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
For like 4, 4 to 5 months.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
At that time.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So she bought the.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Puppy 9 months.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Prior.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And you're saying 4 to 5 months.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Into. That is, when you thought about it. Did something happen that triggered your curiosity about classes.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Yes,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
My mom was.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:37.000
So my mom is an anxious person, I would say. She's also she has a bit of Ocd.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And so.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000
She's she hasn't had a dog since she was a kid. She's always had a cat.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.000
And I don't think she fully understood the amount of work.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
That went into having a puppy.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
And so.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Pretty much every call I had with her.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Was some sort of.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Like breakdown about the dog like, and it got to the point.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Of like.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
This buying this dog was a huge mistake. I shouldn't have gotten the dog.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
You know there's nothing I can do. This is ruined. My life like just you know.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Yeah.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
She tends to

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Like catastrophize, I guess.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And it made me sad whenever I had those talks with her. Because I love the dog. It's like the sweetest dog on the planet. She's so cute. I'll send you guys all pictures of her.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
You know, and I knew.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
That she was catastrophizing. But yeah, so it got.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
It got really bad pretty much. Every call was something about the dog, it was so awful, and she just.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Seem very sad about it.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And and then towards May it started to get worse. I would say.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
What made things worse in May.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Well, the puppy hit this

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I guess, like every puppy goes through a little bit of like a teenage.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Phase.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Do research what I'm not doing startup stuff. I'm doing like pet research. So I was doing some research. And I guess, like the puppy had hit this teenage phase where.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Even the training up until then. So my mom had purchased

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Petco training. She had gone to other dog training schools.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Made a little bit of progress, but things like you know, whining whenever my mom just even went downstairs.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Accidents in the house.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Going like barking at other dogs on their walk, just started to get worse.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And so my mom started to get a little hopeless. I guess that it was just gonna keep.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Keep getting worse.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Got it. Okay? Well, I'm sorry to hear that. And, by the way, what's the name of of the dog?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
The dog's name is Cindy Lou.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Cindy, Lou.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
All right.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Yeah, like, after the Grinch character she got around Christmas. And so that was actually the name. She was a

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:31.000
It's this really cute adoption place called Mission Bay Rescue and they rescued her, and that and her name was Cindy Lou, and my mom loves Dr. Seuss. So my mom just made Cindy Lou who and she's got.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Grinch pajamas, the whole thing so.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Was there. Had you noticed anything up till then? That was positive.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
About your mom having Cindy.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yeah. Well, I just like, you know, my mom loves to hike, but she sometimes is nervous to hike by herself. In Montana there are bears.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And so like having a dog, she felt more comfortable, like with the idea of going on long hikes by herself, with the dog.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Her and the dog are so cute together like, you know, they almost look alike.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
The dog loves her unconditionally.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And she loved the way that the cat and the dog got along so well. So there was a lot of positive.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It was. The problem was, is that my mom.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Like, was.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Like not.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Seeing the positive because she was like hyper focusing on the negative.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Got it, and and you mentioned that every conversation you had with your mom was essentially about the challenges with the dog.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Yeah,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
So were there.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
So when when things kind of came to a head in May had you had.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Had you ever purchased classes like this before.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
For any of your pets.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Nope! Never my life!

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Okay.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:56.000
We're we're definitely a cat family. So like, you know, cats don't require a lot of training. You just kind of get what you get with cats.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
So this was.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Dog stuff was definitely new to me.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Okay. And were there other people that you were able to talk to get advice about what to do?

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Yeah, so my little. So my little sister has a dog and.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
She.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
She wasn't the most helpful, I guess, because she just I think.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Was of the mindset, like.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
You know.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Accidents happen, dogs misbehave.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
You know, investing in classes, maybe isn't the best.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
The best thing to do.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
But I think what really.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Kind of push me while there was a few things that kind of push me. But I think one thing was just knowing my mom, so well, that like, if.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
She was gonna have her a dog in her life. It needed to be a very well behaved.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Dog.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
This is something that you learned, or something that your mom said to you.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
It's something I interpreted. I think.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Okay.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
From her like just.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
You know, knowing my mother.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
She just needed a well behaved dog, and and that's why I.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:18.000
One of the reasons why I chose the one that I chose and why it was so expensive is because they actually train

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
They. They specialize in training like service dogs and and dogs for disability.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Use.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So like, you know the dogs are.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Very well, like.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
They are like.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
They have to be well behaved, and so.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
That was.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:41.000
One of the one of the reasons why I chose the one I chose, and then another reason was,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
The.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
It.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000
My mom had complained in the past.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
About the.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Trainers that she had signed up for all treat, or like

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Reward focused.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
And she just didn't feel like that was.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Super.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Great so this one didn't focus on treats. But it also didn't focus on.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Punishment it was. It was kind of it seemed unique to me.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Did you help your mom sign up for the previous.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Trainers.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Sort of, yeah, so.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I I helped her sign up for the ones at the San Diego Humane Society.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And she had paid for those

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
She!

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
And the lady was nice.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Like it was fine, but there wasn't I. I was there when the training was going on, and.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Seem like there weren't a lot of

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Immediate results. I guess.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Liliana. Sorry? I know you had a question.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You said, your mom is the kind of person that would need a a well trained but your sister isn't. I'm I'm just curious like. What? What are the main differences you see between the 2 of them that makes you say that.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Is it like their personalities, or what about them?

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Yes, it's a great question. Good makes me think about my family dynamic. So I think, my mom is.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Very organized like. If you walk into her house like.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Everything I can show you guys. She lists her house on Airbnb so you can see it. It's like everything's in a very pristine spot. Everything is a certain way, like when I go to visit, like, if I'm watching TV.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I have to fold the blanket up.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Put it in, put it in. It's saying, like I can't leave blankets and pillows out. You know it's like.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
She in order to and I and like.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
You know, and I get it because we've talked about it. And it's just like in order for her to feel.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Relaxed in her space, and also she's retired.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:53.000
You know she it's her 1st time owning her own house and being in her own house without kids or a husband, and so.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
She feels like.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Okay, this is my time to live exactly how I want to live.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And so, yeah, so she's has a very pristine.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Space. So I think it's actually like a lot of it. Now I think about it has a lot to do with like her space, her home.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And then my little sister

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Like I would equate her living style to like a hobbit like, you know, she kind of lives. She lives in Washington State.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000
She kind of lives in like this like.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
The shire.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Little hut. Yeah, like, exactly. She's got a very shy vibe. There's like plants everywhere. There's like.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Stuff everywhere. It's it's beautiful, but it's very chaotic.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And like, it's a bit messy. So yeah, just kind of opposite ends of the spectrum, as far as like minimalist versus like Maximalist.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Types of living and like.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
One being okay with like.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Chaos in their space.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And another one not.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Not so much, and I think also.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Yeah, just like.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Brothers, probably. Just yeah, more tolerant of mess, more tolerant of like accidents.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Destroying furniture stuff like that.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It's.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Got it so. Oh, go ahead, Lilian. Sorry.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Your sister, have children.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Nope.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
No kids.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And is she a 1st time dog owner with the with the dog? She has right now.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Yeah,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Okay.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Yeah. She's

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
How old am I? She's 31.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
So.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
When you started looking up additional classes in May.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Where did you start? Did you get any referrals? Or did you start with the search online?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I tried to search online.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I think I went. I think the thing I typed in was like best.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Dog Trainers.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
In San Diego.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
So just kind of seeing. Like, okay, what?

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:13.000
What are like the fancy dog trainers was kind of my thought. Like, you know, we've gone with like the Petco we've gone with the Humane Society. We've gone with the more affordable options. Those don't seem to be working so like.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
What like? What are the dog trainers that the.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
The.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Yeah.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Fancy people with these like fancy show dogs, and you know, and just like, what are they using to train their dogs with sort of the search hole, I went down.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And just to be clear what wasn't working up until then, because you'd had these multiple training sessions that had happened.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Yeah.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
It sounds like you had alluded to certain behaviors that were persisting. But I just wanna make sure I understand.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Yeah. So I think,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Like.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I think one thing was not like.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
She was barking at other dogs a lot like when she went to puppy school.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
She is fine, she's friendly. She's the like.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:09.000
The bell of the ball at puppy school, but then she would go. My mom used to go on really long parks down at

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Mission Bay, which is this really beautiful area? It's 1 of the reasons why she bought her house.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
But I had learned that she had actually stopped.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Doing those walks.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Because there are a lot of other dogs down there, and Cindy Lou would just like bark at.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000
All the dogs, and so she just sort of gave up walking down there. And I I started. That was affecting her.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Mental health, because like those.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Walks down by the bay would always make her feel better.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000
So that was one thing. She was also whining a lot every time my mom even just left the kitchen.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000
So my mom was starting to have to like stay in the kitchen all the time, just to avoid her from.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Avoid sending, from being anxious.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And then she'd also have like.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Accidents in the house, not all the time.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
But like.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
You know more often than.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Yeah.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Was okay with my mom, which means, like, even one accident, you know, is not okay with my mom. So

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
So yeah, that was.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Those were the 3, I think. Key.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Behaviors.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
That that we're kind of.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Bothering my mom, the most.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Right. And was there a particular phone call or conversation where you're either on the call with her or you get off the call. And you're like, all right.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Time to get serious.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I'm Googling for fancy dog Trainers.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Yeah, so.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000
So well, there were 2. 1 was

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
One, was.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:52.000
She told me that she had stopped going down to the bay for walks. I think that really had an impact on me.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Because that's a whole reason why she lives in San Diego is to get out and get that that beautiful scenery.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And then, and so that I think maybe start looking. But I think I really got serious.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
When she was talking about.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I made a mistake.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I like. This is a bad idea to get a dog.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I don't know what to do, and a part of me like.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Thought that she may like give the dog.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Back, and that just completely broke my heart. I was like, we can't do that like.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Cindy Lou loves us. I love Cindy Lou. My mom loves Cindy Lou like that's just gonna like.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:37.000
That's going to be traumatizing for everybody involved. So that's when I like. Became very serious about looking.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Got it, and and this search that you conducted were you.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
It sounds like you spoke to your sister about it, and she was she against it? You said.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Yeah, kind of. I think my little sister was kind of like.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
You know. Don't get involved.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
If she gives away the dog, she gives away the dog, and.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
You know.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Like. Don't spend a ton of money on.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
On dog trainers and stuff

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000
So she wasn't very encouraging of the of the purchase.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Was there anyone who was encouraging or supportive.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
No, I think I kind of, went on a gut.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.000
A gut instinct that, like this is something I had to do, and at least try cause. I think I would have.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I would have been mad at myself if I didn't.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Try to help help the situation.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Got it.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
So.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
We let Google take the wheel.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Yes, I did. Well, I let Google take the wheel.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
What I'm trying to think. I.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I think I.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
So I do

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Like.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Natural stuff. I do holistic medicine. I'm I'm Vegan. And so there was one that popped up that was.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:22.000
John's natural dog trainer and so just the word natural got me, I think, and so I I saw it, and I went to the site. But actually, before I even like start browsing the site, I went on, yelp so yelp was a part of my decision, making process to read reviews, because.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
I think

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:33.000
When I'm making a decision on purpose, like I'll read the reviews on the site, but I don't necessarily trust them, so yelp is like a place where I feel like I can trust.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
The reviews more so.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
That's that's the one that caught my eye. I compared it to.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.000
A couple of others. I even looked at one in Montana since we were going to Montana, but.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:55.000
That one was a little scary to me, because it was for big dogs. It was like for cattle dogs, and they used the shoplers, which was very not cool with me.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
So

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
That's.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Yeah. So it also, comparing to some of the other ones that I saw the more expensive fancier ones I saw.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
This one stood out because they were very against using.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Like pun, like shock callers, or any sort of like harsh punishment.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Got it. Okay.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
So you you landed on the right one from the yelp reviews.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
And you.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
You were aware of the price tag for the classes.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Yeah.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:32.000
And and ultimately like, when you searched and you found it. Did you make the purchase in that same moment, or did it take you time to consider it.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Yeah. So it took me to consider it. I actually had 2 phone calls.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
With them, before.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I made the purchase so.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
1st phone call.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I talked.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I talked to the woman.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Asking about the different packages. I asked if, like, it could be customized like.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
How customize the packages could get. I also asked about.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Their methods.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I talked to them a little bit about my mom.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And then the second time.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I called them. I just had more questions about their methodologies.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:18.000
And also gave them a little bit of background on our story. How I got to this point.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Just to make sure that they would be also patient with my mom, too. As, and work with her.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Yeah.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
To train the dog. So it's like.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I was also trying to see like, can you do a little like dog therapy with my mom to help my mom understand? Like the process of raising a dog, and the woman I spoke to was like really nice.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Very open, very understanding. I like that. They were.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.000
That they would customize it so they would actually come to my mom's house, because that was another thing. My mom was.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Stressing about was like going to all these classes and trainings, was taking up a big part of her day.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
So like. I like the fact that they came.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
They would come to the house to to do the training.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And they did have a free evaluation session.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
So.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Basically like I they did. So I gave my mom like in an envelope, a printout of the website. Their philosophy said, You know I'm getting this for you. They do a free.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Consultation, class.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And then, you know.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
They wanna make sure they can work with the dog before they.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Sign anything.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:41.000
So I didn't actually like make the purchase until after that 1st consultation class. But I was, you know, I gave her the President was like, I'm gonna make this purchase. If this looks like it's gonna work.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Great, and you ended up moving forward with it. And how did it go.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
It's gone, really. Well, everything has.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Changed

01:29:50.000 --> 01:30:00.000
My mom is so much happier. She sends me photos of the dog all the time, because that was one of the things that the the dog trainer said that this class really does. It is, it helps.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Bond, the owner to the dog as well, because, like.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
That's really important for dogs to have.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:16.000
An owner that they understand like and basically building a language between the 2. So they understand each other. And they've done that.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:25.000
My mom actually called me the other day and said, You know, I'm just so grateful for this gift. It was such a thoughtful gift, and.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:32.000
She's like, really. She's going back to Montana. Back to our cabin, and she's driving up with the dogs, and she's like.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Excited now. And she's like showing off the dog, and how well behaved the dog is to like her friends. And her friends are all impressed. So yeah, it's it was probably one of the best.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Purchases I've made in a while.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Wow! All right. Well, there's so much more I want to know, Annie, but I'm gonna call it there for the sake of time. That was fantastic. And what a great way to end the story.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
So thank you for sharing.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Oh, good! Well, I hope I hope my answers were.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Were helpful in the example, was helpful.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Yeah, I was.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I don't know. What do you all think? Yes, do we? Did we learn some things.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Okay. Good.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Nope.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I was. Gonna say, we were so enthralled we never went game off on that one which we normally do love to just open it right now, for, like 2 or 3 people, were there any questions you guys had in your mind like, Oh, we should ask this.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yeah.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Like I thought.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Share them, now.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I would love to know what your sister thinks about it now.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Well, my sister

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I've.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I don't know.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:46.000
I don't know if I've ever heard my sister say. Oh, you were right. So.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:52.000
So I think I think she's happy, because when my mom is more calm, we're both.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
More calm.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So I think she's she's happy that that my mom's not calling her complaining about the dog anymore.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
But I think you know.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
My my sister, I think, still sort of thinks. Oh, well.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
You know we could have.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Figured this out without paying $1,200, but in my book.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I'm fine to part with that $1,200 for the for the peace of mind. It has brought our family so.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
That's awesome.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Maybe one more question from the group.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:40.000
I mean going forward. Are you anxious about like any potential relapses, or you know, what do you have on the back of your head. Now that you know the whole process is completed, then.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
You know. Now you.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Of a different.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Circumstance, but you know what comes up in terms of like the consistency of the process.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Yeah, so.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
One of the things I asked when I was researching was like.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
How do you guys do as follow.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
They offer

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:10.000
So they they part of the package comes with unlimited access to their dog training like.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Open sessions. So my mom could go to those sessions.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Talk to trainers, but then also you can buy one off classes. She actually hasn't finished the package yet, so she's only done 4 sessions. She's going to Montana.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Trying everything out, and then she's gonna do the last sessions.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
When when she gets back. So like.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
You can kind of spread it out.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
So.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
In my mind.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I feel like I've connected my mother with a problem solver, basically long term problem solver.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
So.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
If things do come up in the future, she can reach out to them.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Buy another one off class.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And just feel like she's.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Got someone in her corner that can help her.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Okay, so let's talk about the forces. Do you want.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Do you have? This slide that shows the forces a little bit more in depth than the one you put in the chat. Now.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Yes.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Like the black one.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Yes, I do. I'm gonna pull it up.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
So remember, during the call, we wouldn't be on video.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:28.000
This would be recorded just like it is right now I would be taking notes and trying to fill out the timeline. So then we'd go into this debrief.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
So the 1st thing in the debrief would be like.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Okay, did we fill out the timeline? And for the sake of time, right now, I'm gonna skip that. But just know.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000
You guys should probably think in your own minds what you would put for each of these.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:35:04.000
And then we get into the debrief. And we say, Okay, one. Are there any questions we wish? We would have asked that we need to like Clarify. It's okay to have to call the person back in the next few days. If you realize that you forgot to ask something. Or you guys kind of can't remember, or there's a discrepancy between, like, if Neil and I were having an intellectual disagreement like no, this is why she did it. It's okay to just call up the source of truth and say, Hey, we have one more question for you.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
You know. What does your sister think now? Something like that.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
So you go through and you start.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Plotting the forces.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:21.000
So we're gonna do that together. I'll probably take like 2 people for each 1, 2, or 3 and I'll remind you what each one is, so we'll start with the ones that are pushing.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Any toward the new behavior.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
So push and pull.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Are bringing you toward the new behavior. So let's start with push.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Push is like a pain that you should think of it.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Similar way. The pain doesn't have to be physical, but it should be something that makes you uncomfortable that pushes you toward the new solution.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
So. Yep, Telitha, you have a push.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Yeah, it would be that she was receiving a lot of calls with her mom, complaining about the dog. And the mom was hyper, focusing on the negatives, and like another one could be that the mom's mental health was being affected, which, of course, as a byproduct, was also affecting Annie as well.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Yep, and I think that mental health was at like one of the final straws. Right? So I would even say like that. Put Annie into active looking.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Or maybe even deciding. That was like a really big one.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I think one of the push was.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
2 cheaper classes didn't really work well.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Yeah. So the one.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
So it pushed her into a more expensive but higher quality class.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Exactly just like in the mattress interview, right past, like prior experiences.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:41.000
We'll kind of like make you go into a higher price if it if it didn't work out before completely.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
There was also the specific event that.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Her mother didn't go used to the bay anymore, like.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.000
It wasn't like 3 that she liked, but it wasn't occurring anymore.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:59.000
And that, and like the push, was kind of like the worry that Annie felt on behalf of like her mom changing her lifestyle.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
So like.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Seeing visible lifestyle changes for a loved one could be the push.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Float.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Yeah.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
The fear of actually losing the dog like her mother returning, the dog.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
That's huge.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:24.000
And he said that she feared that would be traumatic for all of them, like all of the family members. That's a huge push. I don't want that to happen. I need to do something about it. That's so true.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:36.000
So things are kind of different. Like every single interview. There will be like more heavily concentrated forces in one of the 4. So I would say this one was like a very heavy push interview, but.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I would challenge you guys, can anyone think of some polls.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:48.000
So poll should be synonymous in your brain with like an allure. It should be something that allures you toward the new solution. You're not necessarily feeling pain. You're getting persuaded.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Yeah, sure.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Maybe because she was actually looking the natural treatments and the.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Not taking it painful and like.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Punishments.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Way of think education.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Actually loads her in.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Yeah.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Yeah, absolutely. No, I didn't mean to meet you accidentally.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
That's okay.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Absolutely. So I was, gonna tell you guys, you can kind of see it would be so far fetched to just think of this off the top of your head, but through jobs to be done.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Veganism might be a way that this man needs to target customers. This natural dog trainer he would have had no idea. But maybe he needs to put.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Flyers, in vegan restaurants.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Like the connection would never be clear. But this jobs be done if if more patterns emerged. Of that, I was so interested in the fact that that identity, the Annie's made her interested in this training session.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Ur.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Yeah. The fact that she was connecting her mother with someone that could address any potential issues that might come. In addition to the.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Issue at.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
10 to the.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Right. So she's reserving peace of mind for the future as well as today by that 12,000 that she's spending.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.000
That's true. The allure of peace of mind is definitely huge. Here.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Morgan.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I don't know if this counts as a push or pull like it's just birthday like. Is that a pool like I need to get a present kind of thing like this would be a good one, a high end present.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:33.000
It's true, like matter of circumstance, I think it depends. If you have a parent that gets upset when you don't buy them gifts, it might be a push like you're afraid, but if it.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Got to get a birthday gift. Otherwise it's going to be a problem. This.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
It's, yeah.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Yeah, I would say, for any it sounded like from love. I don't know.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:53.000
It felt it felt like a pull. But that was just. That's this is the debate we would have. We would, as team members go. What did you hear? I thought, that's a poll, right? I put that in the poll category. She was excited to get her mom something really nice for a 70th birthday. That sounds really sweet.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Someone else. Code. Nope, she's afraid like.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
So.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Yeah.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
To Lipa.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Maybe it's that they were offering these free evaluation.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Maybe it rings about.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:22.000
And also like the long term problem solving. That's something that she was concerned about before is her mom and the dog trainer and the dog gonna get along. Well, is this program gonna work? Well, so having that free evaluation mitigates that fear.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I agree with that similar to the mattress interview. Right.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Like being able to have that. William.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
And.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Yeah, I think just to add as well. That Annie also liked that it could be customized, and that they were willing to travel to the home. So there was. It kind of broke down friction as well.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Made it more convenient and hassle free for a mom.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Absolutely so convenience that really mattered to her.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Felice.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:41:05.000
She also mentioned the like customization aspect, and I'm not sure if this is maybe the whole of this new solution, but it kind of gives a sense of control, I think, for a big amount of money like being able to customize your purchase really.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Making you feel like more comfortable with the presence.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Yeah, I would definitely say it was a poll. It was something that Annie found very alluring about the new solution.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Sure last poll.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Yup reviews.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
There were many other people's experience that.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Made the new solution out even more.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Say that last part again. It kind of cut out.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Can you hear me now?

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
The app, reviews.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Yeah.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Oh, the yelp! Yes.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
The positive real? Yeah.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Absolutely. That was a huge part of her determining this. So seeing those positive y'all purviews was a big deal.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Okay, so let's quickly move to the things that moved any away from the new behavior. So, keeping at business as usual, you see, the pink arrows are going toward the left side, so they're traditionally a little bit harder to recognize. But let's do habit. So habit is something you're sticking with status quo. You're used to what you're used to, what is maybe a habit that was keeping any at status quo.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Yeah, or.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
I mean the opinion of her sister, although you know.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
I would be inclined to.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000
A sister who's never admitting that I'm right. But.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
You know.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Saying that, you know you shouldn't touch it like.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Leave them be. It's fine, like the dog, is there? But it's ultimately choice is a big habit of the present, I think, because, you know it's it's an external.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Like. It's not in your office of control, right? So you are doing something for someone. But it's affecting more than that person loan.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:55.000
So I think they have. It is to not touch it, and then, you know, get out of any responsibility or repercussions that might.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I completely agree, the sister was saying. Stay with the status quo. It's not that big a deal like, just let it happen. Let's jump to anxiety just for the sake of time. There are probably some other habits we could pull out, but anxiety anxieties are fierce.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:20.000
So any sort of fears that we're keeping Annie at bay. I remember a couple. Can you guys identify some of them that would keep her away from a new solution.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Yeah. Flow.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Yes. So she evaluated a couple of options where the dogs were punished, and sent a shock caller, or where they used too much of the treaty that didn't really work in the past, so I guess the fear of those type of things coming back and the dog being harmed.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Exact.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
As one of them. Yeah.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I completely agree with that.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Dave.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Hmm.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Yeah, the fear that her mother would not adopt it like she would spend all this money, and her mom wouldn't actually take her up on it. And so she really liked the idea that they had a free evaluation and sold that to her mom.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Yes, that would be a huge waste. So that's like a worry in the back of your mind to spend all this money.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I completely agree.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Any other final anxieties.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Yeah, it says, here.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Dan also, in addition to that, if the class.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Don't go well.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Then.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Definitely, you'd end up in a worse position than the status. Go.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Given that there were other classes in the past, and.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:29.000
It will definitely feel desperate if the classes didn't work.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Exactly. Yeah.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:51.000
You guys did a great job. So I'm gonna stop it there. Obviously, that was like a 5 to 7 min debrief. It would be a lot longer. You would do at least 15 to 20 min, and you'd be able to derive a lot of insights from talking with your partner about what just happened, but I hope this was a great example of just like a a sneak peek of what's to come from the things you guys can derive in your interviews.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Yeah, to put things in perspective. That was about 35 min end-to-end, like when we started talking to Annie to having the debrief and wrapping it up. If you spend 35 min.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Getting to know 10 to 15 of your potential customers or existing customers, and you get to that level of fidelity with understanding their situation. And what's influencing.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Their decision, and what their needs are.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I think it's safe to say that you're gonna feel a lot more confident in what you're deciding to do to serve them and to find more. People like them.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Right, and make sure that they're happy and successful.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000
So so I hope that this is just a good initial reference for you to understand the potential power in depth.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:35.000
That you can get to early on in your startup journey. Now, with your businesses.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Great.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Okay, before we break.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I wanna go over your toes with you before we leave.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000
So let me pull up somebody's to do list. I'll pull up.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:53.000
So we've added a couple more. I want to make sure nobody has any questions. So the things you guys have left.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Remember the class roster perform and the welcome kit we're due on Wednesday. You should reach out to me and Chloe if you didn't get in either of these.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:14.000
You're gonna wanna make sure you read that program handbook. You're gonna wanna upload your completed Pre work packet that's due on Wednesday. Once you complete it. You're going to book a goal setting call with Chloe, which is down here, and we have the link to do that.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000
This is your learning objective. So by next Wednesday you're going to want to have determined what you want to learn.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:44.000
What you're hoping to gain from this round of jobs to be done, and that will directly inform your screening. So remember, I showed you this yesterday. You're gonna want to figure out your screening by next Friday, the earlier the better, so that you can start booking your 1st 10 Jtbd. Interviews like what we said here. So remember that you can't book them until Neil approves your screen criteria, and you might have to go back to the drawing board, so give yourself as much.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Time as possible. Fridays, just the absolute deadline.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:55.000
List any additional team members that are. That might be part time that you'd like in your base camp project. So any sort of designers or devs that aren't.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Part of this text project can be in here to work with you.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Like, I said, book a goal setting. When you're done with your pre work packet, you're gonna want to read Bob messes book demand side sales by day. One. We linked it here for you.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:16.000
It took me about 2 days, so it should be like a pretty quick read but make sure that you prioritize that, because we will be discussing it.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
A lot in the coming weeks. And then the last thing this is new.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:32.000
We've referenced financial modeling a lot. We're gonna have a very important financial modeling session by Neil's mentor, Troy, Hanako. He's like the king of financial modeling, but he is very strict.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
So there's this pre work that needs to be done before week. One.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
And.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:46.000
He does not accept missions, and he also is someone that you want on his. On your side. He will be helping our program, probably more than other programs, because we're very close with him.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:55.000
And Troy will scrutinize you if you did not get this in on time. So the deadline is 5 Eastern. On Sunday, September 8.th

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
So like a week and a half.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Make sure you meet that I just want to really emphasize the.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Like hard deadline here. There's not.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Just a little more Troy. He was the original managing director for Tech Star, Chicago.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And he's 1 of the most successful investors in the history of tech stars.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:19.000
So he is substantial and wants to help, and has seen all the bad and all the good across.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of companies. So he's in our corner. But he is also a total, hard ass. So just be ready.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:50.000
And he'll respond to you, even if you get it in on time. He's gonna respond to you. A pretty scrutinist response. And that's normal. So just be ready to have a thick skin. Also, we, said CEO, because the CEO should be responsible for the financial model. Even if you have someone on your team that is good at financial modeling and really likes it. You guys can do it together, but it is not recommended. And this is not how we do it here, where the CEO is not directly in charge, with hands.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:56.000
On in the financial model. I know that's hard. I know a lot of our Ceos here don't want to do that.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.000
But I challenge you. It needs to be you who submits this, and you need to have a hand in creating it.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000
This this is especially true.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000
If you expect at any point in the future that you would like to fundraise.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:15.000
The any investor isn't like as an investor, you're not gonna bet on a founder or CEO.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Who doesn't understand the financials of their business.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Simple enough.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Oh, I'm muted any questions here on any of the twos before we break for Labor Day weekend.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Quick! Question. The.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Goal setting with Chloe. Does it have to be done before you submit the screening? Is that what you said, or they can be.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000
It's about the Pre Work packet. So your Pre work packet your goal setting packet that we sent you.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Last.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
That's due on September 4.th

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Once you finish that, you want to book a go sitting meeting with Chloe. You're gonna go through it.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Okay, but it has nothing to do with the the screening for the jobs to be done.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Those are separate.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Lots of things happening at once.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Good question, Morgan. Anything else?

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Suppose I'm just wondering. Sorry. What's the what would be the timeline for conducting the interviews themselves?

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Yeah, so.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Is this unexpected.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:20.000
The sooner you can get your screening in and improve, the more the faster you can start conducting them.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Next week or on week. One you guys are gonna have a checkpoint presentation on Thursday of week, one where you let us know how many you've done so far. It's okay. If you've only done like 2 some people will maybe have done all of theirs. That's just a checkpoint. So there's no like hard deadline there. It's just we want you to have made some progress, and you can tell us what you've learned. And then the hard deadline for finishing your whole set is gonna be after mentor madness.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:56.000
After tech week. You're going to be completing the Y before the Y, which is what Neil showed you from Base camp, which is like taking all of that and synthesizing it and showing us your insights, and you'll actually be presenting it in front of one of our.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Like best alumni, who did a great job with this when we're in person for week 6.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
So that's kind of when it's gonna end.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:15.000
But I would say the sooner the better, because some of you are gonna need to go back to the drawing board. Some will have to get more interviews. So a lot of people try to finish before mentor madness.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Cool thanks. I was just thinking like 10 days or something.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
But.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Now you have. You have several weeks, but definitely don't let this go in the back burner, because once you get into mentor Mattis, it's going to be hard to juggle everything else. So use the time right now. That's why we start so early.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Yeah, and just to give you some more timeline guidance. When I've done jobs to be done, sprint with Bob.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000
And he's the best in the world. Okay, like, invented the thing. So like, just give you a reference point.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000
He gets them done in a week.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000
So.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
We schedule the calls.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
They start on Monday. The calls up by Wednesday or Thursday.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And we're finalizing things on Thursday and Friday.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.000
With our insights and the patterns and everything. So the whole process can be done in about 5 days.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
But that's when you know exactly what you're doing.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
So I would give it a couple weeks.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Well.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Alright!

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:17.000
I hope you guys have a wonderful long weekend. We're done now, so take the rest of the day. Be off on Monday. We'll see you guys on Tuesday morning.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:26.000
And any other questions that you have. Just send them to us. You can box us for anything urgent. We're pretty responsive there, but we won't really be on Base Camp for the next few days.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000
And we'll see you on Tuesday for project management, which is super exciting.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.000
It's so great to meet you guys this week. Thanks for all your participation.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
See ya.
