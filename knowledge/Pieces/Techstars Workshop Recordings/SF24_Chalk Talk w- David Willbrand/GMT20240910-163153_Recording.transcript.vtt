1
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:30.809
George H: Okay. So they actually don't know this. But David is one of our 3 eir. So we've yet to introduce or unveil our eirs. But yes, David is one of them. So you guys are going to be so grateful after you hear his talk that he's not going anywhere. He's going to be with you guys for the whole program, because you definitely want him as a resource and then the other 2 ae, are going to meet on the retreat. David sadly had a prior commitment. So we're very sad that you can't join us. But maybe next time.

2
00:00:31.891 --> 00:01:00.119
George H: okay. So today's workshop is one that we've done for a long time. David was with us back when we did tech search Chicago. He's a long time member of our network, and we've always had him do a kind of rundown of all legal and fundraising jargon that you need to know to kind of level set everybody, because everybody has different experience coming in. Some of you have started companies before some of you. This is your 1st time going into business, and we want everyone to understand when we throw out

3
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:25.110
George H: acronyms or jargon that might seem confusing. David does a great job at explaining it. He's a professor at several universities as well. So you'll be able to tell when he starts lecturing, but feel free to ask questions. David will be here for anything that you need while you're in your presentation. And then yeah. So by the end, hopefully, you guys will be able to all have the same knowledge about all of this stuff.

4
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.940
George H: And then, if you have any further questions, David will be a resource reading that program. So we're very lucky

5
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.699
George H: is also something that we used to do like

6
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:56.679
George H: during week, 3 or 4 back in Texas, Chicago, and then overwhelmingly in our survey is people wrote like you need to talk talk during week one. So for the past, maybe like 4 programs, we've had David come in for week, one because this is like one of the best things to front load. That's what our founders said in their feedback. So this is a great week. One experience for you guys. I will hand it over to David, we're recording David. I hope that's okay.

7
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.560
David Willbrand: Yeah.

8
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.430
George H: Okay. Thank you.

9
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.054
David Willbrand: Thank you for the introduction. Liliana. Hey, everybody!

10
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:22.689
David Willbrand: Sorry that I'm not with you in person. I wish that I were, and I'm looking forward to meeting each of you, one on one as Liliana said. I've been doing this talk or a version of this talk for many years. For many tech stars, cohorts

11
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:45.159
David Willbrand: along with some other accelerators and universities and other kind of entrepreneurship support organizations. It came out of my legal practice. So I was in private practice for a long time and represented entrepreneurs and startups venture capital firms, university spin out programs, tech transfer that kind of thing.

12
00:02:45.989 --> 00:03:11.459
David Willbrand: For the last 3 and a half years I've been in house as the 1st chief legal officer of a company called Picasso. We are a prop tech unicorn we were born January 1, st 2020. I joined. I represented the company when I was still perched as a law firm partner. So I was outside counsel, and then came on. Came on full time. April of 2021

13
00:03:11.934 --> 00:03:15.725
David Willbrand: so that is now my day job is

14
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:26.095
David Willbrand: running all matters, legal fundraising, capital markets, and otherwise at Picasso, and then on the side, as Leon mentioned,

15
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.539
David Willbrand: working with you all at techstars, and then I teach

16
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:39.029
David Willbrand: startups and venture capital at the University of Michigan Law School. Part of the reason why that might be relevant to you to the extent that you have an interest in this, and want to continue your education, so to speak.

17
00:03:39.681 --> 00:04:06.199
David Willbrand: is that every week I post a summary of my lecture notes from those classes. So you know, startups is like a 12 week course in the fall venture capital is a 12 week course in the spring. I make it very linkedin friendly, so it's certainly not. Doesn't require you to be sort of Jd aspirational to understand it. But I've just found over time that founders are super thirsty for this information, and so the extent I can make it

18
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:18.500
David Willbrand: accessible. That way. I'm happy to do it, so feel free to follow me, or just check in every once in a while on my profile. Profile on Linkedin. And you can see what we're up to, and just maybe pick up some pieces of knowledge.

19
00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.359
David Willbrand: One final qualifying point.

20
00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:36.387
David Willbrand: I'm going to do this by a whiteboard. We call it a chalk talk, because it actually started on a chalkboard, and it started on a chalkboard because I used to use a deck. But, like many of you when I went in far too many times and had AV issues

21
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:59.817
David Willbrand: and couldn't get the projector to talk to my computer, to talk to my software. I finally just threw up my hands and said, You know what if I show up with dry erase markers that still have some ink left in them. I should be fine. So I started doing it manually that way. Actually found I really liked it. And so it's not really a true chalk talk. I guess the 1st couple were chalk was chalk

22
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:16.179
David Willbrand: but it's a whiteboard talk, but that just doesn't have the same ring to it. I'm gonna turn my screen here shortly, so you'll get a little bit nauseous for a moment while I adjust. I cannot see you while I do this. So if you have questions, please

23
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:29.760
David Willbrand: scream them out, or you know, throw something heavy at Liliana to let her know that. You want to to ask me something. I would say this, I'm gonna put up my email address here as 1st things. First, st

24
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:47.469
David Willbrand: I will respond to. I always respond to questions. You know they they come to me directly offline. So if the questions are things like, I already hate my co-founder. Maybe we don't want to air those out right here in the room in front of everybody, unless you just are like totally down for that kind of drama and transparency. And I'm here for that, I guess.

25
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:55.419
David Willbrand: But we could save that for email. The other might be is, if you feel like there's something particularly unique to you or advanced.

26
00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:21.409
David Willbrand: The whole point of this talk is to really level set. So I really do start like very kind of 1 0, 1 basics. I find that even people that think that they have advanced knowledge find that there are probably some gaps and holes that going back and revisiting some concepts that they think they understand is is useful and helpful. But if you ask questions that are kind of 500 level questions that's awesome. But let's do that offline just to make sure that we're we're keeping pace

27
00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:39.489
David Willbrand: with everybody in the room, and we're not. We're not getting too far out over our skis. But that being said, if you've got sort of, you know straightforward questions of general applicable applicability. And I'm I'm happy to field those and would love for this to be as much of a conversation as it is a presentation. I do love the sound of my own voice.

28
00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:45.680
David Willbrand: But occasionally I do need to take a breath, and your questions provide a good opportunity for that. So.

29
00:06:46.352 --> 00:07:03.249
George H: If you guys have questions, you can raise your hand, and Chloe will call on you and then pause. Make sure that you have something to take notes with, because he's going to be drawing it all over. You're gonna want to make sure that you can either drop down on your laptop or on notebook ipad, something like that. This is really valuable stuff.

30
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:12.460
George H: And again, this will be recorded. So you'll be able to go back and review the actual chocolate later down the line. Yeah. And you usually send us pictures right? David.

31
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.105
David Willbrand: Yeah.

32
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:20.370
George H: Yeah, beautiful pictures of the creation that you'll make on the whiteboard. Okay, I think everyone's about ready.

33
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.750
David Willbrand: Alright.

34
00:07:23.686 --> 00:07:25.570
David Willbrand: Can you see my screen.

35
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.300
George H: Yep.

36
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.200
David Willbrand: Awesome. Okay. So as promised, let's start with my email address

37
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:34.980
David Willbrand: David

38
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:41.399
David Willbrand: at Picasso, PACA. so.com.

39
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.389
David Willbrand: As you all know there are lots of downsides to being

40
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.717
David Willbrand: a founder or a startup company. Og,

41
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.500
David Willbrand: you know, debilitating

42
00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:09.949
David Willbrand: mental scars and emotional trauma among them. But you do get an email address with your 1st name. So that's pretty awesome and makes it all worthwhile. I think so. Feel free to ping me there. I would be happy to take your questions.

43
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.040
David Willbrand: So

44
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:27.459
David Willbrand: I'd like to start this talk, which is in many respects framed as a legal conversation with an accounting concept, because it really does set the stage and lay the groundwork for everything that comes next. And what I like to start with is a balance sheet.

45
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:33.109
David Willbrand: and when you consider the basic construction of a balance sheet, you have assets on the left.

46
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.109
David Willbrand: and you have liabilities over equity. On the right

47
00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:42.509
David Willbrand: the 2 sides must balance. That's why it's called a balance sheet.

48
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:51.050
David Willbrand: a way to reflect that mathematically and not just visually, is assets equal liabilities plus equity.

49
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.529
David Willbrand: And then, if you're just feeling

50
00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:09.309
David Willbrand: really, really strong in the stem disciplines, you can fiddle around with that. L input. And you can reflect this equation as assets minus liabilities equals equity. So why do we start here? Well, let's break down the terminology.

51
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.140
David Willbrand: 1st of all.

52
00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:13.540
David Willbrand: move my face.

53
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.760
David Willbrand: Assets and liabilities and equity are

54
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:28.764
David Willbrand: technical accounting terms, but we can apply commonsensical definitions to them for our purposes, assets all the good stuff in the business.

55
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:47.200
David Willbrand: It's everything you create. It's everything you build. It's everything you achieve on day one. Your assets are probably 0 or fractions of a penny but over time we're hoping that that number gets quite big liabilities. This is one that we're always attentive to and fearful of.

56
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.699
David Willbrand: That's the bad stuff.

57
00:09:48.760 --> 00:10:03.710
David Willbrand: So liabilities would be what you owe debts and obligations, payments required to be made to lawyers, accountants, employees, contractors, executives, other 3rd parties, suppliers, vendors, etc, etc, etc.

58
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:17.090
David Willbrand: When you take liabilities, and you subtract them from assets. You get equity. Equity is what is left over. It's the residue, or it is residual.

59
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.949
David Willbrand: This is where you live as the owner.

60
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:28.489
David Willbrand: And what represents your stake in equity is your stock

61
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:36.749
David Willbrand: that represents your ownership interest in the company, which is a claim on equity.

62
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.960
David Willbrand: which basically is the result of the equation where you net

63
00:10:42.000 --> 00:11:05.049
David Willbrand: all the liabilities from your assets. Now, if you're operating as a traditional small business in America, you're paying attention to your balance sheet, paying attention to this equation each and every day, because, frankly, this equation goes a long ways toward determining the value of your company. If you have a traditional small business, if this number.

64
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:13.419
David Willbrand: which ought to be very, very positive in a traditional small business, some multiple of that, and it tends to be a pretty small multiple

65
00:11:14.392 --> 00:11:22.450
David Willbrand: is going to help drive and help everyone understand what your company is worth. And also tell you a lot more about the current

66
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:30.490
David Willbrand: business for those of us in Startup Land. It's not as relevant assets are still highly aspirational.

67
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:47.849
David Willbrand: and how they're created and what they are to be, and the value of the company tends to be determined on bases that are completely separate and apart and distinct from whatever might be generated inside of this equation, we determine value based very, very much on futures

68
00:11:47.850 --> 00:12:02.990
David Willbrand: based very, very much on what we think may come. Someday, there's a lot of imagination. There's a lot of creativity. There are hopes and dreams that are built into our valuation expressions. So it's not as relevant for those purposes, but there is a time where it's extremely relevant.

69
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.550
David Willbrand: and that time is M. And A.

70
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.430
David Willbrand: Now M. And A. Means mergers and acquisitions.

71
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.999
David Willbrand: What we're talking about here is when you sell your company.

72
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.950
David Willbrand: Now your company may go public.

73
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:34.139
David Willbrand: That's an Ipo, an initial public offering, and there are startups that do achieve liquidity for their investors that do have an exit for their investors via an Ipo. An Ipo is not a sale of the company. An Ipo was a transformation of the company.

74
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:41.060
David Willbrand: When you go through the public offering process, you transition from being a private company

75
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:47.510
David Willbrand: for securities, law purposes to being a public company for securities. Law purposes. Simply put.

76
00:12:47.510 --> 00:13:12.260
David Willbrand: it means that rather than jumping through all the hoops and finding exemptions that you need to lock into, to raise capital generally from accredited investors as a private company. You now have the ability to raise money broadly from accredited and non accredited investors from retail investors across the board. You can raise it in mass, you can raise large amounts of it, and you can solicit generally you can advertise. You can do whatever you want

77
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:23.220
David Willbrand: to do all the sorts of things that you weren't able to do as a private company. But of course it comes at a cost. There's a lot of reporting that's required. There's a lot of overhead. There's a lot of expense. It's why you're not a public company today.

78
00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:42.529
David Willbrand: There are some startups that do achieve that kind of escape velocity and get an opportunity for the founders themselves as well as the other investors, to sell their stock once they become public. There's a market for the stock, and they can achieve liquidity that way. But the vast majority of startups

79
00:13:42.810 --> 00:14:06.159
David Willbrand: for the vast majority of startups that achieve liquidity that have an exit. They do so through selling. And generally it's something that we might even further refine and call a trade sale, which means that you're selling to someone in your industry. You tend not to just sell to private equity or a money investor, although that sometimes happens, you tend to sell to somebody else in the field. That is Hotmail selling to Microsoft.

80
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:14.079
David Willbrand: That is, Instagram selling to Meta that is slack selling to salesforce XYZ. ABC.

81
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:24.710
David Willbrand: What happens in an M. And a transaction, and I used to teach M. And A. At Michigan, and it was a 3 credit hour class, and we spent 16 weeks. 3 ha week

82
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:49.300
David Willbrand: digging into what M and A is. It's highly nuanced. It's very tax driven in terms of how it's structured. There are thousands and thousands of ways to skin that poor cat. Maybe the worst metaphor I think we have. I I can't decide if it's worth when we talk about skinning cats or splitting babies, but they're all incredibly violent. And maybe we ought to be a soft kind of society and find different metaphors. But you know, we we.

83
00:14:49.300 --> 00:15:05.750
David Willbrand: we work with what we've got. So there are thousands of ways that but at a super high level, at a super high level. What's fundamentally happening inside of an impact is that someone in your market? Someone in your industry is buying your assets

84
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:25.460
David Willbrand: and they're giving you cash for it, or they're giving you stock in their company, you know some other property like that. But we'll call a cash equivalent so if Meta gives you stock and Meta sometimes that's called a cash equivalent, because you can generally turn right around and sell it on the stock market. So you're getting cash or cash equivalents for your assets.

85
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.080
David Willbrand: So hopefully.

86
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.270
David Willbrand: this buyer looks at you and says, terrific job

87
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.220
David Willbrand: you're worth gazillions.

88
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:41.249
David Willbrand: And you say, Thank you. Thank you for what we're going to call those gross proceeds.

89
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:52.359
David Willbrand: Okay? The full proceeds that were received from that transaction. Thank you for the gross proceeds. Now, what happens? Well, now, you need to pay off your liability.

90
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.460
David Willbrand: Okay? So you still have those left.

91
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.790
David Willbrand: You gotta take care of those. Hopefully.

92
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:23.670
David Willbrand: The liabilities do not accumulate into a ginormous hopefully. The liabilities are far less than the assets, and if this is a happy outcome they will be, if it's a not so happy outcome. Well, might be a little bit more of a push, but the bottom line is, you just sold your assets for a lot of money. We hope you pay off your liabilities with those gross proceeds hopefully. Not very much money, and whatever's left.

93
00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.030
David Willbrand: the net or the net proceeds.

94
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.510
David Willbrand: that goes to equity

95
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.410
David Willbrand: that goes to you

96
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.700
David Willbrand: as an owner.

97
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:38.369
David Willbrand: Great. Okay, little bit less than this. But hopefully, it's still a big number.

98
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.630
David Willbrand: So now the question becomes, how do we split it up.

99
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.560
David Willbrand: Okay, if it's 1 owner

100
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.659
David Willbrand: pretty easy 100%.

101
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.500
David Willbrand: But what if it's 2 owners? What if it's 8 owners?

102
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.619
David Willbrand: What if it's 14 owners or 50 owners or 200 owners.

103
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.410
David Willbrand: Okay, we call them stockholders.

104
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.640
David Willbrand: We can call them shareholders same thing.

105
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:09.230
David Willbrand: These are owners of stock or owners of shares. Same thing in the company which gives them a claim to these net proceeds because they have a claim on equity.

106
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.010
David Willbrand: What do we look to?

107
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.449
David Willbrand: Well, the thing that we look to is the cap table.

108
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.449
David Willbrand: The cap table is more than just a day-to-day scorecard.

109
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.999
David Willbrand: The cap table tells us

110
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.670
David Willbrand: how we chop up

111
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:32.049
David Willbrand: those net proceeds at exit, which means it's super important, because what you don't want to have is a fight.

112
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:49.099
David Willbrand: You don't want to go through one year, 3 years, 7 years, 12 years of building this business. Get to the point where you have finally found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and then find that your cap table is a hot, steaming toxic dumpster fire, and you're not able to discern who owns what?

113
00:17:49.220 --> 00:18:02.869
David Willbrand: In which case you've got a knife fight on your hands, and that's no fun for everyone. So the notion of keeping up with your cap table and ensuring that it's true, correct and complete at all points and times is really important. They are hard to rebuild

114
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:31.470
David Willbrand: once you've kind of gotten off track and fall and fallen out of the groove. So I would just encourage you, you know. Look, you have a lot of things to do, and focusing on legal and accounting matters shouldn't be 1st and foremost. But if I'm going to give you one or 2 things to say, you know what this is pretty important. It ought to be on the, you know Kpi Ish in terms of your priorities. It's making sure that your cap table is up to date and accurate at all times. That seems obvious.

115
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:51.370
David Willbrand: and maybe to you you're sort of scratching your head and saying I can't imagine it, it not ever being true, correct, and complete. Well, believe me. I actually see flaky cap tables more often than I see cap tables that are tight. So it's this is a ball gets dropped often, and I would encourage you not to do so so with that Psa out of the way. Let's get into the cap table a little bit.

116
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.170
David Willbrand: So a very basic tap table

117
00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:59.089
David Willbrand: looks like this. And we have our founders here.

118
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.139
David Willbrand: Sorry. It's a very non diverse group. They're all red stick figures. It's a problem.

119
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:16.553
David Willbrand: So our columns, though. Let's mix it up a little bit. We have shares here. Put a PIN in this. We're gonna come back to it, and we have ownership percentage here.

120
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:30.259
David Willbrand: The key thing, particularly for initial cap tables. But really for all cap tables throughout. Is this column right here? Why? Because this column tells us how we split up net proceeds.

121
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:46.759
David Willbrand: We actually don't care about the share numbers as objective inputs. Shares only matter to us on a relative basis shares matter, because they're the means by which we keep score of ownership. But we only care about shares insofar as they translate

122
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:56.089
David Willbrand: into ownership percentages, because this is what we look to when we're chopping up the net proceeds. So if the net proceeds that we get from the sale of the company

123
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.650
David Willbrand: are 1 billion dollars congratulations.

124
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:09.720
David Willbrand: If founder A holds 40% of the company and founder B holds 30% and founder C holds 30%. 1st of all, good job.

125
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:21.400
David Willbrand: it adds up to 100%. You'd be surprised the number of times that it doesn't when I sit down with founders, and they say I own 50, and the other person says, I own 40. And the other person says, I own 30, I'm like, well.

126
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:34.540
David Willbrand: that's amazing. I give 120% every day, too. But I don't think you're allowed to do that inside of Microsoft. Excel, this is pretty key, and pretty important. This tells us how we split up our 1 billion dollars in net proceeds

127
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:49.540
David Willbrand: 400 million to founder a 300 million to founder B, 300 million to founder C. No knife fights required very clear, very direct. Everyone's very happy. That's gonna be a fun closing dinner. Those are some really big checks.

128
00:20:49.540 --> 00:21:05.610
David Willbrand: and that's what we look to. This is the whole point of the cap table. Okay, this is why we do it. This is why we. This is why we work with Carta. This is why we try to maintain this. These ownership entries on a day to day basis over the lifespan of the company. It's purely for this moment in time

129
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.130
David Willbrand: to make sure that we've got it right. And it's controversy free.

130
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.119
David Willbrand: Now, I mentioned shares.

131
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.230
David Willbrand: Shares, of course. Tell us what these ownership percentages are.

132
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.919
David Willbrand: And, by the way, because they only matter. Relatively speaking.

133
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:31.600
David Willbrand: okay, we don't. Necessarily, we're not necessarily tied to a certain convention. So if we want for this company. For instance, if this is how the founders decided that they wanted to chop up

134
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:40.419
David Willbrand: the ownership of the company, 40%, 30%, 30%, we could say 4 shares, 3 shares, 3 shares, total of 10

135
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.040
David Willbrand: that totally works

136
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.900
David Willbrand: that totally works.

137
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:50.620
David Willbrand: or we could say 4 million 3 million 3 million for a total of 10 million

138
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.540
David Willbrand: that totally works, too.

139
00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:58.879
David Willbrand: you know, 4 divided by 10 is 40%, 4 million, divided by 10,000,040%.

140
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.749
David Willbrand: So what matters is this?

141
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.050
David Willbrand: What doesn't matter

142
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.290
David Willbrand: is this?

143
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.970
David Willbrand: But, as you probably know.

144
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.079
David Willbrand: in Startup Land

145
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.800
David Willbrand: big numbers

146
00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.609
David Willbrand: tend to be the Cultural Convention.

147
00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:35.890
David Willbrand: and there must be a reason for that. There must be a reason for that. It can't just be something that's that's sort of that. That just randomly occurs in some kind of uncorrelated and and unfoundational way, and there is a reason for it, and the reason is not so much among the 3 of you.

148
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.630
David Willbrand: although it does matter, and we'll start to tease the reason now, because it's psychology.

149
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.550
David Willbrand: even for you, even knowing

150
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.689
David Willbrand: that this doesn't matter. And what matters is this

151
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.270
David Willbrand: 4 million sounds a whole lot better than 4.

152
00:22:53.900 --> 00:23:19.579
David Willbrand: It certainly does to yourself, and it really does. When you're talking to your partner, your significant other, your parents, your roommates, your friends. There's a very big difference between telling them that you own 4 shares in your startup, and you own 4 million shares in your startup. You may be making no money. You may be lonely. You may be going through existential anxiety of the sort that you've never experienced in your life. But number one. You've got an email address with your 1st name.

153
00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:29.659
David Willbrand: baller number 2. You've got 4 million shares, Baller. So I mean, this is these things come together in a way that's an emotional lift, and it makes it all worthwhile. Right? The teeter totter balances.

154
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.840
David Willbrand: Kinda so.

155
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:40.140
David Willbrand: But that's the psychology is everything, and where it really plays is when we start adding more people to the cap table.

156
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.170
David Willbrand: particularly employees and subsequent hires.

157
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.829
David Willbrand: Because here's the deal

158
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:50.340
David Willbrand: if we have. And let's just make the math easy. Let's just say within this equation.

159
00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:55.569
David Willbrand: we're gonna rub this out a little bit here. So we still need to add up to a hundred percent.

160
00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:00.100
David Willbrand: But we're going to say that these founders had

161
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:14.390
David Willbrand: 3 shares, 3 shares, 3 shares. Okay, and so they started at 33%, 33%, 33%. Good job still adds up to 109 shares. Now, we're gonna have our 1st hire.

162
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:25.780
David Willbrand: Another red stick person. Come on, do better. Okay, we need some active diversity in this company. This uniformity is frustrating. Anyhow, we're gonna give them

163
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:37.799
David Willbrand: a 10% interest in the company. Okay, they're quasi founder. They're super important. And we think they're worth it. So where do we? Where do we insert them? 1st things? First, st

164
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.340
David Willbrand: note that what you have, you have. It stays the same.

165
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:48.409
David Willbrand: What happens with new people is it's incremental. Okay? So we're adding on top of the pile.

166
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.479
David Willbrand: So they get one share.

167
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:57.650
David Willbrand: because now 3 plus 3 plus 3 is one. So we no longer have 9 shares.

168
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.040
David Willbrand: Now we have 10 shares.

169
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:05.399
David Willbrand: because this 4th person has one share. It's also going to impact our ownership percentages right?

170
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:16.594
David Willbrand: Because now it's not 3 divided by 9, it's 3 divided by 10. So it's 30%, 30%, 30%, 10%. We did it. Okay, we hit the mark

171
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.410
David Willbrand: business solution.

172
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:23.359
David Willbrand: That's what dilution is, you just went from 33% to 30%.

173
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:32.300
David Willbrand: Your stock holding stayed the same. Your ownership percentage dropped. It was diluted. It was diluted because you issued one new share of stock

174
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.710
David Willbrand: to that party who just joined.

175
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:43.300
David Willbrand: Now let's just say, for the sake of argument, that that if at this point in time your company has an attributed value of a million dollars.

176
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:51.875
David Willbrand: Let's just say that that's that's the way you're valuing the company at the point in time you're bringing in this 1st employee or party number 4. Okay.

177
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.870
David Willbrand: if you give them

178
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:58.139
David Willbrand: one share, you're telling them that they're getting something worth.

179
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.230
David Willbrand: Let's go to another page one share.

180
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:05.830
David Willbrand: You're telling them that they're getting something worth a hundred $1,000.

181
00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.280
David Willbrand: Okay.

182
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.060
David Willbrand: now they're going to look at that.

183
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.360
David Willbrand: And perhaps they're sophisticated.

184
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.779
David Willbrand: And they understand that that's great.

185
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.919
David Willbrand: And they're excited about this. And they're able to move from the 10%

186
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.799
David Willbrand: to this conversation

187
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.690
David Willbrand: without any kind of friction or issue. But that's extremely rare, because usually what runs through their mind is

188
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.520
David Willbrand: one share is nothing.

189
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.439
David Willbrand: and it's worth $100,000.

190
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.189
David Willbrand: There's no upside left that's even way more than Berkshire, Hathaway

191
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.000
David Willbrand: like, where's the stock going to go from here

192
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:52.619
David Willbrand: now? We know that it that this is just math, and it's the pie is just not chopped up very much. So there's still a ton of room for this company to grow and for the share value to grow. But superficially.

193
00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.770
David Willbrand: emotionally, psychologically.

194
00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.050
David Willbrand: it doesn't play out. Well, let's just say, for the sake of argument.

195
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.599
David Willbrand: that we were operating in millions 3 million 3 million 3 million 1 million.

196
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.920
David Willbrand: So going to this

197
00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.230
David Willbrand: equation here

198
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.519
David Willbrand: still on 10%.

199
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.209
David Willbrand: But they're getting 1 million shares.

200
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.140
David Willbrand: 1 million shares are worth a hundred $1,000, remember.

201
00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.020
David Willbrand: So the price per share is a dime.

202
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:30.559
David Willbrand: So now you can tell this person who's joining you get 1 million shares

203
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.070
David Willbrand: and they're worth

204
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.710
David Willbrand: 10 cents each.

205
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.140
David Willbrand: This is exactly the same

206
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.800
David Willbrand: from an economic input perspective.

207
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.219
David Willbrand: And if the person you're dealing with is a Vulcan.

208
00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.530
David Willbrand: you're good to go. No problem.

209
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.690
David Willbrand: But if they are, if you're dealing with a human being.

210
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.590
David Willbrand: They are definitely picking door number 2

211
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.459
David Willbrand: because it feels different.

212
00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:12.430
David Willbrand: And that's why we operate this way. Because equity incentive compensation is super important stock options, restricted stock, the whole 9 yards super important to startup companies super important to the compensation packages that you offer employees one through

213
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.980
David Willbrand: 10,000.

214
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.159
David Willbrand: They care. They care a lot, and this just feels better.

215
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.760
David Willbrand: So this is what we do, and that's why we do it as simple as that.

216
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:29.929
David Willbrand: So before I go on. This is probably a good moment to to take the breath and to check in and see if anybody has any questions.

217
00:28:43.336 --> 00:28:44.089
David Willbrand: No question.

218
00:28:44.695 --> 00:28:45.905
George H: Wait. Sorry

219
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:56.670
George H: any. Go ahead. Yeah. So I had a question about the. So you have. So for my company, we have 15 million shares

220
00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:09.199
George H: total that we can distribute. But we're doing it in like equity plans like the the breakdown. So I guess, like in the 1st equity plan. We only issue.

221
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:15.360
George H: I guess I forget the exact number, but just for the sake of an example, say like 5 million shares, and then

222
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:21.340
George H: cause. You only have 15 million shares total throughout the lifespan of your company. Correct.

223
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:31.500
David Willbrand: So it's it's a good question. So let's let's touch on that point for a moment. What you're saying is that if I were to. Are you a Delaware Corporation.

224
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.690
George H: Yes.

225
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.790
David Willbrand: Okay. Good job. That was the right decision.

226
00:29:36.928 --> 00:29:40.269
David Willbrand: Fun fact. The leading state

227
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:52.580
David Willbrand: for corporate law out of the 18 hundreds and into the early 19 hundreds was New Jersey. They were very aggressive in creating an efficient and excellent statutory system.

228
00:29:52.580 --> 00:30:17.380
David Willbrand: primarily because they were trying to steal business from the State of New York, given the proximity. But Woodrow Wilson, among many other terrible decisions that Woodrow Wilson made, decided that it was too business friendly. He didn't like business, and he didn't trust capitalism, and so he forced the Legislature to tighten up the laws. So New Jersey kind of lost the monopoly they had. Delaware saw an opportunity, and Delaware jumped into the

229
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:33.550
David Willbrand: breach. Delaware tweaked its law to to meet and be the law of the State of New Jersey and Katie bar the door. Delaware is now the leading State. By far something like 1 3rd of their State revenues are derived from

230
00:30:34.168 --> 00:30:52.370
David Willbrand: the corporation laws and the Secretary of State's office. That's charged with with handling these materials. So it's big business for the State of Delaware. So anyhow, this is why I don't get invited to many parties, because I think this stuff is cool. But but maybe you're like me, and you think it's interesting. So in Delaware

231
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:58.919
David Willbrand: you would have filed a certificate of incorporation right? Sometimes we call this your charter.

232
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.510
David Willbrand: and your certificate of incorporation

233
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:20.920
David Willbrand: said, you know this is what the name of the corporation is. This is its purpose. Super generic. This is. It's registered agent, registered office because you have to have you. We all pay. You know, someone to just sit in Delaware and to take mail for us, because that's required. And then here is

234
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.670
David Willbrand: capital stock.

235
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:27.720
David Willbrand: and it's going to include the number of authorized to shares.

236
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.119
David Willbrand: The number of authorized shares is a cap.

237
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.300
David Willbrand: Okay, you cannot issue.

238
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:47.689
David Willbrand: sell award, etc. More than that number of authorized shares. So if your current certificate of incorporation says 15 million shares, that's your cap. So

239
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:53.089
David Willbrand: maybe what you did. And this is what I would see. A lot of startup companies do

240
00:31:53.490 --> 00:32:10.809
David Willbrand: is your 1st founder has 3 million shares. Your second founder has 3 million shares. Your 3rd founder has 3 million shares. Your plan, your equity plan, your option plan. However, it's structured whatever you want to call it, whatever you have reserved, even if it's not a plan.

241
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:19.999
David Willbrand: maybe it's just. It's nothing more than an entry on a spreadsheet at this point, which is fine, too. Okay, but what you are allocating for future

242
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:24.530
David Willbrand: hirees, future contractors whatever is a million shares.

243
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:33.090
David Willbrand: So you know, the math is very clean. 10 million total. So on and so forth, which means you've got a cushion of 5 million. Right?

244
00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:48.369
David Willbrand: So over time, you can dip into that 5 million, and you can sell shares. From that you can make additional equity awards. You know kind of once you break through the 1 million. But then the question happens, this is like, Well, what about when you get to series a

245
00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.730
David Willbrand: what do you do?

246
00:32:51.060 --> 00:33:09.899
David Willbrand: Well, 1st things first, st you don't have any series. A preferred stock yet. We'll talk about preferred stock next, because probably what your certificate of the corporation just says is 15 million common shares, doesn't say anything about preferred shares. So you need to create those shares. So you set aside preferred stock as a class.

247
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.889
David Willbrand: and then you set up the 1st series a series A,

248
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:18.669
David Willbrand: and you will authorize some series, a shares. Maybe it's 20 million.

249
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.350
David Willbrand: You can do that through an amendment.

250
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:33.680
David Willbrand: Okay? So this 15 million isn't a forever number. You can change it at any point in time, just by amending your certificate of incorporation which will start to happen a lot. I want to stay at Picaso. We're probably up to our

251
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:53.950
David Willbrand: 8th or 9th amendment, maybe more at this point. In time it happens a lot you may find that just even before you get to series A that you need more common. You know you do 20 million, you just amend it, you create more authorized shares, and then that gives you more shares to play with inside your cap table, but just never exceed it. Make sure you respect the cap.

252
00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:06.519
George H: I have a question regarding this. What is the benefit of increasing your cap of shares relative to

253
00:34:07.473 --> 00:34:12.120
George H: reorganizing the equity among among the founders.

254
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.800
George H: That is fair

255
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:28.199
George H: like, suppose you the company cap is 10 million. The number of shares is 10 million, and you want to give an extra 1 million to an extra founder.

256
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:34.559
George H: but instead of authorizing another 1 million shares, you just reorganize

257
00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.329
George H: the current equity among the current founders. So

258
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.749
George H: the final percentage is actually reflecting.

259
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:49.660
George H: the cap table that you want to see with new founder. So what are the benefits of each of these 2 strategies.

260
00:34:50.310 --> 00:35:06.741
David Willbrand: Yeah, there, I would say, I hear you. And there definitely is an aesthetic attraction to that. But that would be the extent of the benefit would be the aesthetic attraction. And the fact that it's it's got a it's got a nice round number. There's a lot of downside to doing that.

261
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:27.420
David Willbrand: Now, now, one reason. And this is not as much of an issue now, because we tend to ha handle things electronically through Carter or otherwise. So our shares are something called uncertificated shares. So they're just, you know, entries in a grid. But you know, we used to issue real stock certificates and a lot of companies still do.

262
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:49.730
David Willbrand: If you were to do this, what you just described, every time you'd have to go back you'd have to grab those stock certificates, you'd have to destroy them, and then you'd have to issue new stock certificates. So there's just an administrative load that's associated with that. But there's a bigger issue. And the bigger issue is there are potential tax consequences to doing that. If you if you're careful

263
00:35:49.830 --> 00:36:08.590
David Willbrand: and you cross all the t's and dot on the i and dot all the eyes. You should be able to thread the needle in tax free ways whenever you structured some kind of reorganization like that. But it's a lot of squeezing a lot of squeezing for very little juice, which is why the absolute

264
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:33.189
David Willbrand: convention and expectation in the space is just to keep adding shares incrementally, because it's just administratively easier to do. It's not pretty. It's why people end up with cap tables with, you know, very ugly numbers very early. And that just continues and gets worse. So it is not aesthetically pleasing, but it just tends ultimately and on balance to be simpler and more efficient.

265
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.699
David Willbrand: It's a good question, though I get it a lot.

266
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:52.329
David Willbrand: because there is. There's something about it that feels intuitive, that. Why don't you just cap it? And then just just keep modifying those those share allocations inside of it. Since we're just trying to design and and engineer towards ownership percentages, anyway. But that's the reason.

267
00:36:54.020 --> 00:37:20.600
George H: So I have a question. So if you're going from here 15 million to 20 million, and that's like for your series A, is that an expectation that happens at every raise. Should you avoid trying to do this? So this is just kind of the norm that's like, all right, we're it'll be diluted every time where you should. You be trying to hold on to more of your your slack like maybe you had series A, but series. B. You try to keep it your cap at 20.

268
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:28.989
David Willbrand: Yeah. So that definitely is the expectation. And it's the it's the expectation. 1st and foremost.

269
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:34.269
David Willbrand: because you just you just don't know at this point in time. You don't have

270
00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:46.440
David Willbrand: number One. You don't know how many of these shares you're going to need, so you could, you know, try to anticipate it and say that we think we'll need 50 million common, and we think we'll need 50 million preferred.

271
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.419
David Willbrand: But that's gonna cost you some money.

272
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:58.159
David Willbrand: The Secretary of State of Delaware. There's a reason that you know. A 3rd of their State revenues come from this sort of work, and they they will ding you for big share numbers.

273
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.819
David Willbrand: So you know, you have to pay a little bit extra. And

274
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:09.909
David Willbrand: why do that when it's so easy to amend it on a point in time basis. But there's a bigger reason. And the bigger reason is, you just don't know

275
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:18.290
David Willbrand: what the rights and privileges and terms and restrictions of that future preferred stock is at this point. In time. You probably know the common.

276
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:37.330
David Willbrand: You know you're you're, I would imagine, as a founder. You're gonna have common stock that votes. Maybe it has super voting. Maybe it just has regular voting, but it's probably voting common stock of one kind or another. You might. You don't have to. But you might have also authorized non voting common for employees.

277
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:58.110
David Willbrand: Don't have to. Many companies, don't. It? Tends not to make that much difference, truly. When push comes to shove. I've never seen it impact an outcome. But Picasso has non voting common. You know. My founders wanted to do it, which is fine. So all the employees, including me, hold on voting common that would be set up in the charter. So you know that

278
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:07.099
David Willbrand: you've got your preferred, your your founder stock. You've got your non voting employee common stock, but when it comes to the preferred you have no idea

279
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:29.060
David Willbrand: what the rights and privileges of the series A are going to be, or the B or the C, or if there are sub classes or sub series inside that. Maybe you're gonna have an a 1 and a 2 and an a 3. There's just so much that's unknown. What you just get into this rhythm of you, you will just modify and amend the certificate of incorporation, to reflect the terms of each deal as you negotiate it, and as you implement it over time?

280
00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.209
David Willbrand: These are good questions. Anything else. Before we we bounce into common versus preferred.

281
00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.950
George H: Looks like we're good.

282
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.350
David Willbrand: Alright

283
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:48.430
David Willbrand: super.

284
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.100
David Willbrand: So

285
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.380
David Willbrand: we've already teased this.

286
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.680
David Willbrand: There are

287
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.219
David Willbrand: 2 primary classes

288
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.700
David Willbrand: of stock.

289
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:06.050
David Willbrand: There's common stock, and there's preferred stock.

290
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:13.340
David Willbrand: As a general matter. Anyone who is getting shares of stock for services

291
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.340
David Willbrand: is getting common stock.

292
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:27.000
David Willbrand: It's founders, employees, executives, contractors, consultants, advisors, directors, etc, etc, etc. If you are performing services

293
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:32.430
David Willbrand: and you're getting stock for those services or down the road, you're getting stock options

294
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.599
David Willbrand: that are exercisable for stock.

295
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:41.346
David Willbrand: 999 million times out of a billion. It's gonna be common.

296
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:56.349
David Willbrand: are there exceptions where it's preferred? Sure. But those are hyper, unusual. And you better have a really good rationale for it, because it'll look a little weird on your cap table, and you'll you'll have investors that will will sort of demand support for that. So the pocket

297
00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:00.230
David Willbrand: is common for services which, of course, means preferred for money.

298
00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.780
David Willbrand: Now, sometimes

299
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:05.090
David Willbrand: people will

300
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:27.420
David Willbrand: get common for money, but that's increasingly unusual basically coming out of the sixties and the seventies venture capital funds invented this special type of preferred stock. And we're going to talk about it in a moment. They designed it so that it's particularly well suited for as an investment instrument into startup companies.

301
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:37.149
David Willbrand: Venture capitalists always ask for preferred stock, and they ask for preferred stock with a certain kind of configuration and constitution which we'll chat about shortly.

302
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.700
David Willbrand: I started practicing in 1996,

303
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:51.220
David Willbrand: in 1,996. There were certainly times where angel investors or other investors might be willing to take common stock for their investment.

304
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.630
David Willbrand: You still occasionally see that.

305
00:41:54.810 --> 00:42:16.699
David Willbrand: But I would say that you know information flows at the speed of the Internet, which is fast, and even even your run of the mill angel, investor and early stage investor at this point knows or has heard of preferred stock, and they might not know why they want it, but they just know that they do, because that's what the Vcs get. So that's what they want to get.

306
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:43.930
David Willbrand: So that's the way that it sorts. So this is generally how it works. Common stock for services preferred stock for money. Now, before we get into the distinctions, and the distinctions are there, which is why Vcs. And now angels want it. It's important to not lose the forest for the trees, because we're about to get into some trees, and we're gonna get into some leaves and some branches on those trees. But let's 1st start with the forest. And this is the really key point

307
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.300
David Willbrand: one

308
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:46.670
David Willbrand: to one.

309
00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:49.490
David Willbrand: These

310
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:51.810
David Willbrand: at a very basic level.

311
00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.980
David Willbrand: These shares

312
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:56.479
David Willbrand: are interchangeable

313
00:42:56.650 --> 00:43:00.360
David Willbrand: on a 1 to one basis economically, and that matters

314
00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.000
David Willbrand: when you're looking at our cap table

315
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:17.360
David Willbrand: because our net proceeds, and I will talk about. You know the nuance here. We'll get into it in a moment. But just the default rule. And I want you to understand this because this is powerful, and it's super important, because founders tend to focus

316
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:24.100
David Willbrand: understandably and appropriately so on the nuances. But and they and it can, you can get really uptight about it.

317
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.780
David Willbrand: but try to take 2 steps back and focus on on the forest. And it's this.

318
00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:34.339
David Willbrand: if this is founder A, and this is Founder B,

319
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:39.319
David Willbrand: and this was our employee number one. But let's say, this was a Vc.

320
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:41.040
David Willbrand: okay.

321
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:44.579
David Willbrand: so we've got 3 million common.

322
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.959
David Willbrand: 3 million common

323
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.819
David Willbrand: 1 million common, because that's for services.

324
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.980
David Willbrand: And then we have 3 million preferred.

325
00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.069
David Willbrand: because that's what our Vc. Bought.

326
00:43:56.190 --> 00:44:01.380
David Willbrand: It's still all rolled up into the same column shares.

327
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.150
David Willbrand: and it's rolled up into the same column

328
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.530
David Willbrand: from which we derive ownership percentages.

329
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:11.700
David Willbrand: So this Vc is not getting

330
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:17.190
David Willbrand: something extra there. Okay, 30, 30, 10,

331
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.740
David Willbrand: one to one

332
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.360
David Willbrand: that's massively important.

333
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.099
David Willbrand: massively important.

334
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:46.329
David Willbrand: We tweak it on the edges. We talk about that in a second, but don't lose sight of this one to 1 point. I I think you would be shocked at how many founders who have even gone through the process before, don't fully appreciate or understand this point? Because, like I said, we tend to focus on the nuance and not this core substantive issue. But it's super important to keep in mind

335
00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:57.300
David Willbrand: if nothing else, just for the sake of your mental health, so that you don't feel like you're quote unquote, you know, losing control of the economics of your company as you go out to raise. Now

336
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.239
David Willbrand: I promise nuance, I said. Nuance there must be nuance, because otherwise

337
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:07.899
David Willbrand: venture capitalist would just buy common stock. Right? So let's let's talk about what that nuance is

338
00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.060
David Willbrand: tends to fall into 2 categories

339
00:45:11.154 --> 00:45:12.000
David Willbrand: control

340
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:13.510
David Willbrand: for governance.

341
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.370
David Willbrand: It's category one

342
00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:19.210
David Willbrand: and then economics, of course

343
00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.430
David Willbrand: would be category 2

344
00:45:22.124 --> 00:45:23.780
David Willbrand: start with control governance.

345
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.419
David Willbrand: You look back at our Cap table

346
00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.439
David Willbrand: ownership percentages

347
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.529
David Willbrand: most people know as a default rule

348
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:43.210
David Willbrand: under Delaware general corporation law and the State laws of other states. You know, all of the things being equal.

349
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.720
David Willbrand: If you've got 51%

350
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.300
David Willbrand: ownership.

351
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:53.249
David Willbrand: you run the show. Okay, these are majority rules by share counts.

352
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.210
David Willbrand: And for a very long time

353
00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.880
David Willbrand: founders

354
00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.379
David Willbrand: will have an excess

355
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.749
David Willbrand: of 51%.

356
00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.809
David Willbrand: Okay, late in the game. When you're getting out into your series, E series C and series D,

357
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:29.669
David Willbrand: the founder group is probably falling below 50% because the rest is being eaten up and consumed and sold to investors. It's not a bad thing, I mean, you know, you don't get to a billion dollar valuation simply because people think you're cool? You know, you need to raise capital to build business. And the way you do that is by selling stock.

358
00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:35.760
David Willbrand: So at some point you're gonna fall below that level. But you're gonna stick at 51% for a long time. And above.

359
00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.110
David Willbrand: and Vcs are aware of this.

360
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:55.290
David Willbrand: Now, Vcs tend to take minority interests, and they want. If you look at. You know Peter Walker's Carta data, and Peter Walker, by the way, is a great follow on Linkedin. He's a friend. So I'm a little bit biased, but he's great because they carter has all of that, and

361
00:46:55.430 --> 00:47:12.200
David Willbrand: an anonymized. Let me say it right? Data, from the companies that use carta, and he's able to provide, you know, really grounded information, and he shares it on Linkedin. As a general matter, you know, looking at preceding seed altogether.

362
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:16.649
David Willbrand: you know, the state of the of the market right now is just only about 20% of the company

363
00:47:17.029 --> 00:47:22.010
David Willbrand: series a tends to be. You're selling. About 20% of the company tends to be around where it sits

364
00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:23.520
David Willbrand: now

365
00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.080
David Willbrand: focusing in particular on Rvcs.

366
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:29.760
David Willbrand: They know that all of the things being equal, they're gonna have no say

367
00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:45.069
David Willbrand: as stockholders. They're generally okay with that, you know they're not. They're not looking to come in and be super active investors, you know, despite what people may say, and sometimes Vcs do earn the negative news.

368
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:57.229
David Willbrand: In my experience. The vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority of venture capitalists are super helpful, very passive, and they just participate and lean in when asked, and or when they

369
00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:17.124
David Willbrand: see something that is hyper concerning, and they raise it respectfully and work with the founders through it. So Vcs are, are you need to know what you're doing, and you need to keep an eye on things and do your homework do research. But they're not to be feared. At least as a default rule. So I would. I would say, that is an important part to keep in mind, too. Now

370
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:26.399
David Willbrand: that being said, they're investing for a reason, and it's not just to subsidize your hopes and dreams. They want to make money from this, so

371
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:36.049
David Willbrand: they will also believe that, as a consequence, given. The size of their investment may not be 51%, but 20% is a pretty good chunk

372
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.769
David Willbrand: that they ought to have a voice

373
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:43.339
David Willbrand: on matters that are economically relevant

374
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.109
David Willbrand: in a highly material way to the company.

375
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:49.839
David Willbrand: So what might those be? Those would be things like

376
00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.349
David Willbrand: sales of shares.

377
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.230
David Willbrand: Those would be things like

378
00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.240
David Willbrand: distributions of cash.

379
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.090
David Willbrand: Those would be things like sale, the company.

380
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:13.770
David Willbrand: these fall in a part of the certificate of incorporation that are called protective provisions.

381
00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.680
David Willbrand: That's the that's the framing that they're given.

382
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:42.930
David Willbrand: Sometimes they're referred to as veto rights. You're never gonna see that in the certificate of incorporation they will be referred to as protective provisions, but they function like a veto right? Which is why they're expressed that way. Why, people would might say that. And there are 5, 6, or 7 that are pretty typical and tend to fall into these sorts of categories. Sometimes Vcs ask for a lot more than that, because they want to have a lot more. Say.

383
00:49:43.181 --> 00:49:58.029
David Willbrand: I don't think that's I wouldn't necessarily say that's a red flag, but I would say it's a conversation you should have with them, and say why, and your attorney should be able to direct you as to the ones that may be off market in terms of what's being asked. Now, how do they operate like veto rights.

384
00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:03.020
David Willbrand: these pursuant to these protective provisions, they can't make you

385
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:04.540
David Willbrand: sell shares.

386
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:13.279
David Willbrand: They can't make you distribute cash, and they can't make you sell the company, but what they can do is they can stop you from doing it.

387
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:17.310
David Willbrand: So if management wants to sell shares.

388
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:19.990
David Willbrand: and the Board wants to sell shares.

389
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.440
David Willbrand: and

390
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:25.630
David Willbrand: 51% of the outstanding shares vote to sell shares.

391
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:28.110
David Willbrand: If the Vcs don't want to.

392
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:32.050
David Willbrand: They can exercise their veto right, and say no

393
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:38.259
David Willbrand: same with distribution of cash. Same with sale of the company. Now that sounds scary.

394
00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.740
David Willbrand: totally. Get it.

395
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:44.039
David Willbrand: I would say that in 25 years of doing this work

396
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:54.249
David Willbrand: there aren't a lot of things that I can say I've never seen about. I've seen a lot of things. Some good, some bad. But I have never seen, never.

397
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:56.620
David Willbrand: Cdbc exercise

398
00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:00.860
David Willbrand: their veto right in a classic on the record kind of way.

399
00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.590
David Willbrand: So

400
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.310
David Willbrand: the reaction to that might be. Well, then, why do they need it?

401
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:18.560
David Willbrand: If it's never exercised? If it's never used, they should just drop it. And let's just not have this hanging out there as this kind of scary shadow inside the stripping Corporation fair point.

402
00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:22.389
David Willbrand: But what a Vc. Would say! And I would say, this is a good argument

403
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:30.069
David Willbrand: is that that's actually what they're there to do. They are not there to be literally used. They do not want

404
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:38.019
David Willbrand: to stop the growth or get in the way of what management and the board and the majority shareholders want to do just arbitrarily.

405
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.950
David Willbrand: just as an exercise of power. That's not their game.

406
00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:47.130
David Willbrand: What this does, though the fact that it exists is it forces a conversation.

407
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:54.420
David Willbrand: It means, you know, that if you want to sell the company, or if you want to distribute cash, or if you want to sell shares of stock.

408
00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:57.459
David Willbrand: you know that you're going to need to get their approval

409
00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.419
David Willbrand: because you don't want them to exercise a veto. Right?

410
00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:04.250
David Willbrand: So you're gonna have to go to them early in the process and say.

411
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:10.780
David Willbrand: here's what we want to do. Here's what we're going to use the money for, and these are the sorts of shares that we want to sell. And this is how we're going to sell them.

412
00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:20.270
David Willbrand: Here's the cash we want to distribute. Here's why. Here's the sale of the company that we think is coming. We want to bring you in into the tent early. So you know what we're up to, and so that you're aligned.

413
00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:32.979
David Willbrand: that's all they want. They want to make sure that they're not being surprised. They want to make sure that they're part of the conversation. They want to make sure they have the chance to be heard. What they don't want to do is they don't want to arbitrarily destroy value that's in nobody's interest, theirs most importantly.

414
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.899
David Willbrand: So. 1st and foremost.

415
00:52:34.910 --> 00:53:00.459
David Willbrand: that's what the preferred stock gives them. It gives them these protective provisions, this opportunity to participate, notwithstanding the fact that they hold a minority interest in the company. I also don't want you to feel like I'm just here as an apologist for venture capitalists. You know, 70% of my clients are startups. I work in a startup. I'm certainly, you know, extremely founder, leaning. I'm an eir with tech stars, I mean, I'm all about the founders, but and I'm

416
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:06.760
David Willbrand: certainly happy to call Vcs out on their bullshit when I see it. But this is a place that I would say is

417
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.650
David Willbrand: is a place that you should not feel

418
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:27.649
David Willbrand: threatened or scared when you see protected provisions. It's a part of these transactions. It's part of the relationship. It's understood. The one thing to keep an eye on is, as I mentioned is, if you see that list grow from 5 or 6 or 7, and it's like 15 or 16 items that's definitely worth a conversation, because that would be off market.

419
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.430
David Willbrand: So before I slide into economics.

420
00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:36.990
David Willbrand: happy to take some questions on these on this matter of of protected provisions. If anybody has one.

421
00:53:40.686 --> 00:53:48.979
George H: Thank you very much. So what other items, I guess, would be on that list and other things like.

422
00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:56.980
George H: I guess other major chain user. They just want to be aware of, or you know, what else should we typically see if it's not off market.

423
00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.710
David Willbrand: Yup. So you you could see things like

424
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:04.769
David Willbrand: if you change

425
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.570
David Willbrand: the line of business.

426
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:34.870
David Willbrand: Okay? So they invest in you because you're an AI company. And then you decide that you're sick of this AI stuff, and what you've always wanted to do is you wanted to be a 3rd party distributor for Girl Scout cookies. And you're gonna change your business model to reflect that a Vc. Might say we think we should have a say in that conversation that might be a provision that they would add, I would say, it's not market, but you sometimes see it, and that's the reason why

427
00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.940
David Willbrand: drilling down even further.

428
00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:40.790
David Willbrand: They might say things like any pay increase

429
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.830
David Willbrand: for the executive team. They want to have a say on it

430
00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:51.860
David Willbrand: that starts to feel a little less reasonable. There's there's a sense of. Now you're moving from. I understand you're concerned about cash.

431
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.480
David Willbrand: and I understand you. You want to make sure that we're keeping our eye on that ball. But, on the other hand, that feels like an operating decision

432
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:08.610
David Willbrand: that does not feel like it's that highly material sort of decision that that should raise up to the level of a stockholder conversation in the stockholder vote.

433
00:55:09.238 --> 00:55:18.910
David Willbrand: Moving the offices of the company entering into a lease for office space. Entering into contracts

434
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:25.090
David Willbrand: above a certain size. And you know, if you are a compute heavy company

435
00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.689
David Willbrand: that could be a big part of your budget.

436
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.850
David Willbrand: And they may say, Look, we just wanna make sure that you don't get out over your skis.

437
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.529
David Willbrand: Maybe in that context it's okay.

438
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:43.249
David Willbrand: On the other hand, maybe it starts to look like meddling. So those are the sorts of issues that that you're thinking about, you know. Where does it go from.

439
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:54.269
David Willbrand: You know the company distributing a lot of cash to the stockholders through a dividend or otherwise, or the company selling, which, of course, is highly material, or the company raising money through the sale of stock which is going to dilute

440
00:55:54.460 --> 00:56:08.299
David Willbrand: the venture capitalists for the reasons we just described, adding more shares to the cap table. Those are all reasonable things for them to have a have a point of view on and to be consulted about, but these these below the line. Operating decisions can sometimes seem to be a little bit much.

441
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:14.797
George H: Thank you for that. And what about? In terms of

442
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:23.650
George H: I guess getting into the weeds where they want to review the business plan or budgets and budgets for the year ahead.

443
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:28.899
George H: But also, I guess when you're doing a future fundraising round, do they have

444
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:30.849
George H: the ability to?

445
00:56:31.618 --> 00:56:42.960
George H: I guess, particularly if it's a down ground. How how do they essentially provision for that? And is it captured within the means? Within the certificate of in collaboration.

446
00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:45.660
David Willbrand: So

447
00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.070
David Willbrand: they

448
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:49.820
David Willbrand: they're very concerned about

449
00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:52.725
David Willbrand: the cap table because it goes to

450
00:56:53.340 --> 00:57:00.330
David Willbrand: their percentage of the company and what they're going to want to walk away with when you sell, so they're very sensitive to that. Which is why it's a protective provision

451
00:57:01.166 --> 00:57:23.600
David Willbrand: but they also understand that companies need to raise money to grow. So you know, series a investors are not gonna sort of arbitrarily pump the brakes on a series B, they'll be thrilled that you're having a series. B and in fact, you know what I find is, forget the protective provisions. You know. The best founders stay in constant communication

452
00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:41.589
David Willbrand: with their investors simply because their investors are an incredible resource. Their investors might participate. So they might, you know, a series. A investor might reinvest series. B, sometimes that happens. What most certainly will happen is a good series. A investor will have references.

453
00:57:41.590 --> 00:58:04.699
David Willbrand: you know, funds that they've worked with who operated the series B level, who they'd like to see in this company, and they would help connect you to. They're gonna certainly be more inclined to do that if they are fond of you, and feel connected to this company and respected. So you know, that's reason, too. So these are soft reasons. Now there are additional provisions which you alluded to. In your in your comments.

454
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.790
David Willbrand: One R. Let me just

455
00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.920
David Willbrand: jot through these pretty briefly, very typically, you'll see

456
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:20.470
David Willbrand: they're sometimes called preemptive rights. That's kind of the classic technical, legal word. Sometimes they're called pro rata rights.

457
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:22.410
David Willbrand: Sometimes they're called

458
00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.469
David Willbrand: participation rights. Confusingly.

459
00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:46.024
David Willbrand: for reasons we'll discover in a second. Sometimes they're called rights of 1st refusal, also confusingly. So, you know, hopefully, they're more clear when they're called preemptive or pro rata. It's they have these other titles. Then you just need a little. Read a little bit further to make sure that they're not referring to something else.

460
00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:56.060
David Willbrand: What happens here is, let's say, with our example, we have a Vc who holds 3 million shares, and they own 30% of the company.

461
00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:05.509
David Willbrand: What this right will give them is the right to participate in the next financing to buy shares. They don't get them for free. They have to write a check.

462
00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:07.600
David Willbrand: It's not. It's not a special deal.

463
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.799
David Willbrand: It just ensures that they have an opportunity to do it. They can buy more shares

464
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:15.380
David Willbrand: to ensure that they stay at 30%,

465
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:25.960
David Willbrand: because if they don't. You know, if if there are 30% with their 3 million shares and someone comes along and we now add 5 million new shares to the cap table.

466
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:28.900
David Willbrand: This is gonna drop. Maybe they're okay with that.

467
00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.620
David Willbrand: Maybe they're okay with it dropping.

468
00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:59.159
David Willbrand: They're like we knew it. Would. You know, founders get diluted employees get diluted series. A investors get diluted. It's the way of the world. But if they want to maintain, for whatever reason, that 30% number, and many Vcs do like to lock in to a certain ownership percentage the preemptive rights ensure. They have the right to do that now. It may seem unnecessary like, why do they need to have preemptive rights if they want to buy more stock in the series? B. Financing, of course we'll let them. Well, it doesn't always work that way sometimes what happens is.

469
00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:11.469
David Willbrand: if you're doing a series. B, and let's say you want to raise 20 million dollars and let's take. Let's say you're talking to. I don't know any. A. And they say we want to do the whole 20 million dollars.

470
01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:16.940
David Willbrand: Well, you know, without preemptive rights. You could just proceed full speed ahead

471
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:18.040
David Willbrand: and

472
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:24.790
David Willbrand: the series a investors could get iced out. This is a way of ensuring. They have an opportunity

473
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:31.170
David Willbrand: to participate inside of that 20 million dollar syndicate. Now, sometimes these get horse traded.

474
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:36.159
David Willbrand: you know. Maybe their preemptive rights would have given them the right to buy 4 million dollars worth.

475
01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.950
David Willbrand: and Nea says I don't want to buy 16 million dollars. I need to get at least 18.

476
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:48.139
David Willbrand: Maybe our Vc. Would say fine, I'll drop down to 2. I just want to have the chance to buy a little. I want to buy some

477
01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:49.740
David Willbrand: that happens all the time.

478
01:00:50.150 --> 01:01:01.860
David Willbrand: and so it's a negotiation. But it's only a negotiation because they have preemptive rights. And because everybody's forced to deal with them. So that's what preemptive rights do or pro rata rights do. That's what they're there for.

479
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:06.240
David Willbrand: It's to help give them a chance to protect their ownership percentage on the cap table.

480
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.239
David Willbrand: The other thing you mentioned was a down round

481
01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.379
David Willbrand: a down round means this.

482
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:15.709
David Willbrand: you sold series A

483
01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:19.460
David Willbrand: at a dollar a share.

484
01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.329
David Willbrand: and you sold series B

485
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.320
David Willbrand: at a dollar 50 a share, and you sold series C

486
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.220
David Willbrand: at 2 50 a share.

487
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.559
David Willbrand: But now you're gonna do Series D,

488
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:35.539
David Willbrand: and you're gonna do it at

489
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.360
David Willbrand: 1 25 a share.

490
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:42.343
David Willbrand: This has happened a lot in the last year and a half.

491
01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.640
David Willbrand: because these frowns were raised

492
01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.799
David Willbrand: pre. 2022.

493
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:51.380
David Willbrand: And these late stage companies are stuck

494
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:59.369
David Willbrand: because valuations have been adjusted and they can't support those numbers anymore. But they need to raise capital, and they go out and they raise a series D

495
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:12.059
David Willbrand: at a dollar 25. That is not a down round. As to the series, a dollar 25 is more than a dollar. So what I'm about to talk about with adjustment rates doesn't count.

496
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.529
David Willbrand: It is a down round. As to the series B. And it is a down round. As to the series C.

497
01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.850
David Willbrand: Now there are 2 types

498
01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.100
David Willbrand: of

499
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.620
David Willbrand: protective rights

500
01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:26.539
David Willbrand: that would apply in this case.

501
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.250
David Willbrand: The 1st

502
01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.430
David Willbrand: is called a full ratchet.

503
01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.069
David Willbrand: and it is one of the most delicious phrases

504
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:40.700
David Willbrand: in all of the law, because it's super descriptive.

505
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:50.955
David Willbrand: and it is exactly what it says, because it is a full ratchet, and it is ratchet. It is not nice, and it is not kind, and it's not gentle.

506
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:58.700
David Willbrand: A full ratchet means that your series B and your series. C. Will not suffer

507
01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:06.299
David Willbrand: any sort of dilution from a economic perspective, as it relates to this relates to this dollar 25. Now, the math

508
01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:14.159
David Willbrand: to get into. This is beyond the time that we have, but the Tldr. Is that

509
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:22.160
David Willbrand: their ownership will be adjusted, such that it would be as if they invested at a dollar 25,

510
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:26.190
David Willbrand: and as if they invested at a dollar 25

511
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:38.099
David Willbrand: rather than at a dollar 50 and 2 50, and otherwise the price for them. They suffer no economic dilution from the financing. They will functionally, not literally, but functionally, get more shares

512
01:03:38.730 --> 01:04:00.919
David Willbrand: to account for that, that they don't have to pay for so unlike preemptive rights, where they do have to pay with this down round protection, they don't have to full ratchet, extremely rare. If full ratchet shows up in a term sheet that is definitely a place to say, we we gotta have a conversation. I need to understand why. That is not a market term. Instead, the much less delicious

513
01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:10.755
David Willbrand: and the much less descriptive, but the kinder and the gentler type. And I'm not even gonna write. It is weighted average anti dilution protection. That is mouthful.

514
01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:16.020
David Willbrand: What it basically means is is we're going to provide a bit of a tweak

515
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:20.189
David Willbrand: to give them some adjustment to soften the blow.

516
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.450
David Willbrand: But it's not going to be this aggressive

517
01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.319
David Willbrand: depending upon how deep

518
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:29.360
David Willbrand: the down round is and how much money we raise.

519
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:39.810
David Willbrand: This is why the average is weighted, and this is where the math comes in. It's pretty advanced. But you can find some good materials that describe it. If you're if you're curious.

520
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:44.920
David Willbrand: we'll adjust this a little bit so you wouldn't see in a traditional case

521
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:50.800
David Willbrand: the dollar 50 go to a dollar 25, it probably would go to some effective price of like a dollar, 47.

522
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:58.260
David Willbrand: And this might go from 2, 50 to 2, 32, or something. So there's definitely a benefit

523
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:03.419
David Willbrand: to these stockholders. But it's just not as as deep and as aggressive.

524
01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.620
David Willbrand: All this being said.

525
01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:08.600
David Willbrand: I would, I would say to you this

526
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:11.960
David Willbrand: 90% of the time plus

527
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.110
David Willbrand: these rights are waived.

528
01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:18.560
David Willbrand: So even though the series B and the series C

529
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:20.699
David Willbrand: could take advantage

530
01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:27.030
David Willbrand: of these anti dilution rights to get a bit of an economic boost. They wave it.

531
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:30.619
David Willbrand: and they just stick with their dollar 50, and they stick with their 2 50.

532
01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:34.050
David Willbrand: Now do they do that out of the kindness of their heart? No.

533
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:35.920
David Willbrand: the reason that they do it

534
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:40.710
David Willbrand: is goes back to psychology and optics. We talked at the beginning about that, with share numbers

535
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:46.990
David Willbrand: and psychology and optics matter to startup companies. And this is another place that they matter. If you have a down round.

536
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:56.260
David Willbrand: down round is already tough enough from an optics perspective, because it suggests that the momentum has broken a bit. So the company is already going to have to fight

537
01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:58.590
David Willbrand: to get its upward trajectory back.

538
01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:03.349
David Willbrand: If you insert onto the cap table these sorts of adjustments. It's just a bad hook.

539
01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:26.620
David Willbrand: and it looks a little rapacious, and so, even though you have, you had the right to it, you negotiated it. It wasn't like something you you squeezed out late in the game. Everybody understood that it was there. But, it can be something that can leave a bad taste in people's mouth, and it can also make the cap table extremely complicated and just hard to manage and hard to work with. But the biggest reason.

540
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.959
David Willbrand: I would say that's the sub tier reason. The biggest reason is this person the series D investor.

541
01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.909
David Willbrand: And the reason for that is is the series D investor

542
01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.910
David Willbrand: cares about 2 people.

543
01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.959
David Willbrand: The series. E investor cares about itself

544
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.620
David Willbrand: and the series. The investor cares about the founders.

545
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.140
David Willbrand: The series, D investor does not care about series A series B series C,

546
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:54.609
David Willbrand: they're gonna say, the right stuff. And they're gonna pretend they do. But they don't.

547
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:57.080
David Willbrand: And they know

548
01:06:57.090 --> 01:07:00.169
David Willbrand: that a hundred percent is a 0 sum game.

549
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:05.379
David Willbrand: And they want to help you. They want to cut the best deal they can for themselves.

550
01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:14.439
David Willbrand: but they certainly want to make sure that the founders remain fully engaged and fully compensated and fully incentivized because it's the founders that are going to create the value

551
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:24.530
David Willbrand: for the series D, and if they think that these adjustments are going to get in the way of that. They're going to say we're coming in at 1 25. But guess what we're not doing this deal.

552
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:26.910
David Willbrand: Unless this gets waived.

553
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.469
David Willbrand: and the series B and the series C. Will usually rely on.

554
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:48.310
David Willbrand: They might bark a little bit. They might hand ring a little bit, but they're probably not surprised because they've, you know, seen this movie before. They understand the reason for the ask, and they'll let it go. It's a force for the tree situation again. Yes, they would like to have it on a short term basis, but if giving it up means that the company gets funded

555
01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:59.329
David Willbrand: and has a chance to see another day and perhaps get back to an ultimate value on an exit perspective that's above 2 50, and everybody's happy, then

556
01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.830
David Willbrand: they'll let it go.

557
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:03.130
David Willbrand: So that's how a downround works.

558
01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:07.090
David Willbrand: And this is this is one of the areas

559
01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:11.380
David Willbrand: that does have an economic impact. We talked about one to one.

560
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:18.560
David Willbrand: Obviously, comma doesn't get this. So this is a right that if triggered and it's only triggered in the down round

561
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:20.519
David Willbrand: only if the price per share is lower.

562
01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:23.710
David Willbrand: if it gets triggered, it can impact

563
01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:27.520
David Willbrand: that economic equation. But it tends not to be radical.

564
01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:40.609
David Willbrand: It's not going to be like one to 2, or one to 3, be like one to 1.1 or something, but still that means something, but it's pretty rare. That it's triggered, and it's even more rare that people actually take advantage of it.

565
01:08:41.058 --> 01:08:45.719
David Willbrand: But let's let's talk now about the economic rates that are important

566
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:52.769
David Willbrand: because they. They do apply in a more transcendent way.

567
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:55.480
David Willbrand: and there's a little jargon.

568
01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:07.299
David Willbrand: and I try to avoid too much jargon. But this is important, because this is just the way we speak about this. So there are 2 types of preferred stock there is participating.

569
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:09.390
David Willbrand: preferred.

570
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:12.938
David Willbrand: and there is non participating, preferred.

571
01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:22.080
David Willbrand: And the way that you can tell. The difference is by the conjunction that shows up

572
01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.030
David Willbrand: when we're talking about the economic right here. Participating preferred

573
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.889
David Willbrand: is and

574
01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:31.469
David Willbrand: nonparticipating preferred is war.

575
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.729
David Willbrand: Okay? So what context are we talking about

576
01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:38.640
David Willbrand: these distinctions? Matter

577
01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:44.659
David Willbrand: participating versus not participating when we're talking about the liquidation of the company.

578
01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.080
David Willbrand: Now.

579
01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.410
David Willbrand: when people hear the word liquidation

580
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:59.549
David Willbrand: most of the time. What they think of is some kid standing out on a corner with, you know, a placard on the front and a placard on the back.

581
01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:06.109
David Willbrand: You know, this electronic store is going out of business. Everything must go 80% off liquidation sale.

582
01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:09.650
David Willbrand: That is a liquidation, and that's a bad liquidation.

583
01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.360
David Willbrand: But there's also a good liquidation.

584
01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.779
David Willbrand: and the good liquidation is this.

585
01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.640
David Willbrand: let's go back to our initial example.

586
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.179
David Willbrand: We sold this company

587
01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:26.349
David Willbrand: for gross proceeds in excess of a billion dollars

588
01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:31.820
David Willbrand: a billion dollars to liquidation. We paid off the liabilities

589
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:39.750
David Willbrand: that took us to a billion dollars even in net proceeds. That was the example they were playing with here. Okay.

590
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.460
David Willbrand: now.

591
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:44.190
David Willbrand: all of us on the cab table

592
01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:54.659
David Willbrand: who have a claim to equity, who have a claim to these net proceeds. Want to get our share. You know. We want to get our 300 million 100 million, whatever it is.

593
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:56.510
David Willbrand: Well, how do we do that?

594
01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:00.340
David Willbrand: Well, the way that we do it is by liquidating the company.

595
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.590
David Willbrand: by breaking that egg shell

596
01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.470
David Willbrand: and releasing the yolk

597
01:11:05.530 --> 01:11:21.430
David Willbrand: of the net proceeds. That's how we get them into the hands. I don't know if you want to get yolk in your hands. That's a terrible. My metaphor game is really kind of disgusting today I apologize. But that's how you get the net proceeds out of the company. It's a liquidation.

598
01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:27.499
David Willbrand: but it's obviously very different than a going out of business sale. So given that we said

599
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:37.090
David Willbrand: that some startup companies will go public, but the vast vast vast majority will sell in a trade sale

600
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.790
David Willbrand: through an M. And a event mergers and acquisitions.

601
01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:52.199
David Willbrand: Then, if we said that, and that's what we're working toward, and that's the light at the end of the tunnel. That's the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. That is a liquidation. So when you get a term sheet.

602
01:11:52.290 --> 01:12:00.590
David Willbrand: and there's a section entitled Liquidation Pay attention. It's the most important part of the term sheet. You certainly want to read those protective provisions

603
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:08.959
David Willbrand: you want to see if they're being obnoxious, or if they're, you know, staying within the 4 corners of what's market appropriate but liquidation rights huge

604
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:13.640
David Willbrand: because it goes to the core economics of what's happening, what's happening in the end game.

605
01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:22.829
David Willbrand: So this is why this is why participation matters or non participation matters, because it shows up on liquidation and liquidation is what we're working for. Now.

606
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:25.150
David Willbrand: before we really start to explicate

607
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:33.209
David Willbrand: and tease these concepts apart, there's another piece of jargon that we need to become aware of, and that is the liquidation

608
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.500
David Willbrand: preference.

609
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:44.550
David Willbrand: The liquidation preference is expressed as a multiple of the purchase price

610
01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.290
David Willbrand: market

611
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:49.489
David Willbrand: is one times

612
01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.150
David Willbrand: the purchase price.

613
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.070
David Willbrand: So

614
01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:57.330
David Willbrand: in this prior example.

615
01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.549
David Willbrand: if it's market, the liquidation preference for the series, A

616
01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.439
David Willbrand: is a dollar.

617
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:16.940
David Willbrand: The liquidation preference for the series, B is a dollar 50. The liquidation preference for the series C is 2 50. The liquidation preference for the series d. Is a dollar 25. It's 1 times. The purchase price.

618
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:29.349
David Willbrand: The way it will read in your certificate of incorporation is one times, and then it'll say, like one x, and it will use a phrase called original issue price, which is just a fancy way of saying purchase price.

619
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:38.869
David Willbrand: Okay. The original issue price. The price at which the stock was originally issued was originally sold, was originally purchased. So this

620
01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.650
David Willbrand: is extremely market.

621
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:49.300
David Willbrand: If you get a term sheet that has something different than this, it's extraordinarily rarely less than that. That would be good for you

622
01:13:49.490 --> 01:14:02.419
David Willbrand: if it were less than one X. But I have actually never seen that Peter Walker Carter tells me it. It does exist in the wild, but it is extraordinarily rare.

623
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:05.420
David Willbrand: It is a proverbial black swan.

624
01:14:06.135 --> 01:14:14.419
David Willbrand: but you sometimes see, multiples above that, and that is definitely investor favorable, which will then we'll tell. Talk about the reason here shortly.

625
01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.099
David Willbrand: If you do see

626
01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:23.456
David Willbrand: a liquidation. Preference is expressed as 1.5 X or 2 x or 3 X. That's a big deal.

627
01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.900
David Willbrand: That is a red flag.

628
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:42.159
David Willbrand: cause that is way off market, particularly at the early stage. That's a conversation that you need to have with the lawyer, and that's a conversation you need to have with the investor. It'll be really important to understand why they may have a good reason for it, but they owe you

629
01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.840
David Willbrand: a lengthy and substantive conversation and explanation.

630
01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:54.610
David Willbrand: or they just may be bad people, in which case this is how you know, and you may want to think about walking away.

631
01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.370
David Willbrand: So why does this matter?

632
01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.810
David Willbrand: Let's start with nonparticipating preferred

633
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:07.249
David Willbrand: the way that nonparticipating preferred works is, it says in liquidation.

634
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:13.350
David Willbrand: you get the greater of

635
01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:20.520
David Willbrand: your percentage of proceeds

636
01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.207
David Willbrand: based on ownership

637
01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:25.500
David Willbrand: or

638
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:32.526
David Willbrand: your liquidation preference. So if you paid a dollar share

639
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.910
David Willbrand: and

640
01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:40.749
David Willbrand: based upon your percentage of the net proceeds.

641
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.009
David Willbrand: you would stand to get $2 a share

642
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:45.979
David Willbrand: for $3 a share

643
01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.359
David Willbrand: or a dollar one per share.

644
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:51.509
David Willbrand: You're going to go with this.

645
01:15:52.200 --> 01:16:00.670
David Willbrand: And, by the way, if you're working in this box, and you're getting a percentage of the proceeds based upon your ownership percentage. That's exactly how common is playing.

646
01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.670
David Willbrand: So in this context, there is 0 advantage.

647
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:23.489
David Willbrand: the holding preferred stock. It is literally common stock for economic purposes. It is literally one to one. Okay, so great outcome. Very good result. Hopefully, this is even more than that. Hopefully, it's 4 or 5, or 6, or 7, or whatever.

648
01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:25.269
David Willbrand: This is a good day.

649
01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:32.179
David Willbrand: If, however, their liquidation preference with which, if it's 1 x is just a dollar.

650
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.820
David Willbrand: if that's better.

651
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:39.474
David Willbrand: What that means is their percentage of proceeds would get them 50 cents

652
01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:43.290
David Willbrand: or 20 cents or 80 cents.

653
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:50.470
David Willbrand: That means they paid a buck for something that's now giving them 80 cents. That's bad. Okay, that's a bad outcome.

654
01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:57.280
David Willbrand: And that's what this is here for. This is intended to be a bit of a safety valve. It does impact

655
01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.220
David Willbrand: our one to one exchange.

656
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:04.680
David Willbrand: because this is an economic benefit to them, because it guarantees them their purchase price back.

657
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:13.119
David Willbrand: which means you would be getting a little bit less as the founder. So our one to one is impacted. But it only happens in a bad liquidation scenario.

658
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.680
David Willbrand: Okay, this is why this is sometimes called Downside protection

659
01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:19.689
David Willbrand: on the upside.

660
01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.510
David Willbrand: They're gonna participate with you side by side. Hunky dory.

661
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:31.100
David Willbrand: This liquidation, right will only be triggered, only be triggered in a downside scenario.

662
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:36.410
David Willbrand: But this is why you can also see why the one X is relevant. If it were 2 X.

663
01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:40.839
David Willbrand: Then the liquidation preference wouldn't be a dollar. It'd be $2,

664
01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:46.110
David Willbrand: and if they were to pull, say, a hundred and say a dollar 50,

665
01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.600
David Willbrand: which

666
01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.130
David Willbrand: is more than they paid.

667
01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.310
David Willbrand: but

668
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.509
David Willbrand: $2 is more.

669
01:17:53.930 --> 01:18:05.980
David Willbrand: They'll play here. So this is where the economics can start to get a little bit filled with, and where the justification can start to fall away a little bit, too. It's 1 thing to say I'm guaranteed to get my money back.

670
01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:09.619
David Willbrand: There's some intuitive logic to it.

671
01:18:10.056 --> 01:18:26.619
David Willbrand: But to say that I should be getting extra juice in the downside scenario that becomes a little bit harder to swallow, and that that becomes the necessity of the conversation. The good news is is that the early stage, this one X thing

672
01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:40.100
David Willbrand: is like 99% of the time, and the carbon data supports that. It's it's extremely rare that people deviate from that. So when you get your 1st term sheet, that's a priced round for preferred stock, it should say one X.

673
01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.779
David Willbrand: It should also be non participating

674
01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:52.970
David Willbrand: 99, 9, 9% of the deals non participating. That's really good. So if you have a pre seed price, or a C price or series a

675
01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:54.530
David Willbrand: series. B.

676
01:18:54.660 --> 01:19:01.709
David Willbrand: It would be shocking if you got something different than one X nonparticipating preferred, and that's good.

677
01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:10.079
David Willbrand: That means that one to one ratio is holding, and it's only going to change in a bad liquidation. Bad at bad outcome scenario.

678
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:11.380
David Willbrand: But

679
01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:16.229
David Willbrand: we keep talking about this other alternative. So let's describe what it is

680
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:18.199
David Willbrand: participating preferred.

681
01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:21.860
David Willbrand: It's and

682
01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.680
David Willbrand: which means they get both.

683
01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.760
David Willbrand: They get their money back.

684
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.570
David Willbrand: I should actually

685
01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.991
David Willbrand: shouldn't say that maybe more precise. They get their liquidation preference

686
01:19:34.845 --> 01:19:35.640
David Willbrand: and

687
01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:37.639
David Willbrand: they get their ownership percentage.

688
01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.379
David Willbrand: So if it's 1 x.

689
01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.630
David Willbrand: and they paid a dollar

690
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:51.500
David Willbrand: from the net proceeds. The 1st thing you have to do is pay them and give them a dollar a share.

691
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:56.240
David Willbrand: and then whatever's left on a net net basis.

692
01:19:56.340 --> 01:20:01.139
David Willbrand: they get their percentage of that. So remember our equation. That was

693
01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:12.510
David Willbrand: assets minus liabilities equals equity. What's really happening here is assets minus liabilities minus liquidation. Preference equals equity.

694
01:20:13.036 --> 01:20:14.660
David Willbrand: and they get this.

695
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.320
David Willbrand: And then they also get their percentage of this.

696
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:21.210
David Willbrand: which is why participating preferred is oftentimes called double dipping.

697
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:25.149
David Willbrand: And it's not because they really like ice cream.

698
01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:27.149
David Willbrand: It's because they really like money.

699
01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.010
David Willbrand: And

700
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:30.640
David Willbrand: they get to go twice.

701
01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:34.440
David Willbrand: When I started 1996, half the deals

702
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:36.656
David Willbrand: we're participating prefer no joke.

703
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:54.510
David Willbrand: 50, 50, especially Eastern Mississippi. But even in California, you know, 50% of the deals we're participating preferred. The really good news is is the market has moved away from that over the last 25 years. The decision has just been made that it just creates too much disalignment.

704
01:20:54.971 --> 01:21:04.369
David Willbrand: and friction between investors and founders alike. And we don't like that. We want there to be better alignment. We want economic incentives

705
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:15.109
David Willbrand: to be more tightly associated and correlated, so participating, preferred has fallen by the wayside. That being said particularly in hard times like these.

706
01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:19.339
David Willbrand: our series d. Remember, we were showing that it might be a down round.

707
01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:26.990
David Willbrand: Don't be shocked if it also is participating, preferred, and don't be shocked if it's like a 2 x kind of situation.

708
01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:30.530
David Willbrand: because in tough times, in later rounds

709
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:36.630
David Willbrand: it does show up sometimes, and sometimes it shows up for wrong reasons, and it's rapacious.

710
01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:46.849
David Willbrand: But sometimes at the later stage, it actually shows up in good faith. I was just on a podcast, with, with Peter, with Carta. And I was talking about scenarios where it is a good faith. Ask

711
01:21:47.332 --> 01:22:11.870
David Willbrand: by later stage investors, and and it can happen when they're trying to help you protect valuation and keep the valuation of the company up. Maybe not make it a down round, but they need a little bit more economics, just because, you know, the company has in theory dropped. It's not worth what it was. And you know, one way to get more economics is by lowering the valuation, and they get more of the company for their investment.

712
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:29.289
David Willbrand: Another way to do better with economics is through participation rights and fiddling with liquidation preference. So sometimes the ask comes from a proper place. But oftentimes it doesn't. That's why it needs to be. That's why the conversation needs to take place. Now. We don't have a lot of time left.

713
01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:33.850
David Willbrand: I do think it's really important to get to this key point

714
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:35.410
David Willbrand: safes

715
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:46.019
David Willbrand: and notes. This obviously could warn a lot longer conversation for whatever it's worth I wrote a book called See Deals. I'm not here to try to

716
01:22:47.680 --> 01:23:12.219
David Willbrand: push it. I make very little money from it. I didn't do it for that I did. It is just to make it a resource for founders. You can find it on Amazon. It's about 175 pages long. I talk a lot about all this stuff and really get into save some notes in more detail. So that would be a resource. And then there are obviously lots of resources on the Internet that are really good, too, including chat Gpt. So this is certainly not a commercial for me, but it's there if you want it

717
01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:16.170
David Willbrand: with safes and notes, the idea can be

718
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:18.699
David Willbrand: we don't want to go through all the hassle

719
01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:38.010
David Willbrand: of putting a new strip of stock in place. We don't want to amend the certificate. We don't want to negotiate terms. We don't want to authorize more shares. We don't want to fight about all the little piddly rights that that could be implicated and could be involved, particularly at the pre seed and the seed stage.

720
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:50.110
David Willbrand: We just want to get there fast. We don't want to spend a lot of money on lawyers. We don't want to fight over extraneous deal terms. Let's just get something in place originally. What we created for that were notes

721
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:56.417
David Willbrand: and notes would have principal. That's the investment amount.

722
01:23:57.230 --> 01:24:06.179
David Willbrand: They would have an interest rate, because a note is debt until it converts to equity. It's debt. It's a liability on our balance sheet. It has to have interest.

723
01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.629
David Willbrand: because the Irs says that's a feature of debt.

724
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:19.240
David Willbrand: Oftentimes the interest rate is like 6 to 10% depending on markets like, now, it's more like 9 or 10% during bull markets. It's more like 5 or 6,

725
01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:45.019
David Willbrand: and it has to have a maturity date when it comes due. This also is required because it's debt. So this is gonna be XY, you know, 2026, or something. And they work really well, really quick, really easy. And then you might talk about you know what are the conversion features? When does a note convert into equity? Well, you'd raise around of a certain size, call it a qualified financing.

726
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:57.870
David Willbrand: and maybe it's got a discount. Which means that if your series a investor buys at a dollar and there's a 20% discount, you get to invest at 80 cents. So you get a little bit more for your money, or maybe there's a cap

727
01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:03.910
David Willbrand: which asked, is valuation. So your series a invests at a valuation of 10 million.

728
01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:05.690
David Willbrand: but your cap

729
01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:27.250
David Willbrand: was 5 million, so you don't invest at 10 million. Your note converts at 5 million. So you just get more bang for your buck there those provisions would apply as well, and that's how notes were structured. But then, in 2,013 Yc. Came along and said, how about we do this safe, simple agreement for future equity?

730
01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:29.239
David Willbrand: And what we're gonna do is

731
01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:47.929
David Willbrand: we're gonna get rid of interest because no one really values it. And it's a pain to kind of calculate. There's just a lot of overhead associated with it. And we're gonna get rid of the maturity date because that's stressful for everybody. So we'll include the conversion terms. Is there a cap? Is there a discount? Obviously there's an investment amount?

732
01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:49.999
David Willbrand: And then that's what goes into a safe

733
01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:51.630
David Willbrand: now safe

734
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:55.990
David Willbrand: is consequently not debt.

735
01:25:56.530 --> 01:26:01.880
David Willbrand: because it doesn't have an interest rate, and it doesn't have maturity date. So notes live up here

736
01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:09.209
David Willbrand: in our liability box, where to safe? Well, there's only one other option. They have to live down here, and they do.

737
01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:10.990
David Willbrand: They live in equity.

738
01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.529
David Willbrand: And the question is, what are they? Are they stock.

739
01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:16.449
David Willbrand: or are they a type of option?

740
01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.619
David Willbrand: And that is still an unknown

741
01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:23.351
David Willbrand: Y combinator? And they're

742
01:26:24.190 --> 01:26:28.100
David Willbrand: supporters would say that it is literally stock.

743
01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:30.769
David Willbrand: and there are certain advantages under

744
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.230
David Willbrand: 12 0, 2 qualified small business stock provisions that would associate with that

745
01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:42.716
David Willbrand: other practitioners like me. Suggest. They're not that they're options, that they're not stock, and the Irs tends to be

746
01:26:43.090 --> 01:27:07.180
David Willbrand: pretty theological about these things. I hope I'm wrong. It'd be great if they just were treated as stock. I I hope that we get some relief from the Irs, and some clarity at some point that tells us that they are but until then it's it's uncertain. And investors and founders just need to be aware of that. But that's just really it's a. It's a technical issue. It can show up as a Qsps issue. As I mentioned, qualified small business stock.

747
01:27:07.230 --> 01:27:10.280
David Willbrand: But the fundamental issue is the fake is a great instrument

748
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:12.480
David Willbrand: the amount

749
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:16.150
David Willbrand: cap discount. That's it. Good to go. So

750
01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:19.540
David Willbrand: 30 seconds to spare.

751
01:27:20.044 --> 01:27:36.440
David Willbrand: We covered a ton of ground. I didn't really leave time for questions at the end, as I'd hoped but we we were able to feather in a bunch during the conversation, which I'm really glad that we were able to and with that being said.

752
01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:50.170
David Willbrand: let me stop my share. I would be happy to take any questions by email that anybody has. And I really appreciate the time with you all today, and I'm super excited and looking forward to meeting you in person.

753
01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:52.840
George H: Steven.

754
01:27:53.390 --> 01:28:07.440
George H: David, that was great. I just came back in and saw your beautiful work of art on the board. It looks great. You guys can email us questions. David, we'll see you. When's the next time we'll see you. When are you planning to come to galvanize in person?

755
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:12.740
David Willbrand: So we I need to get that sorted. But I think whenever you're in the office next, I will be there.

756
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:17.090
George H: Okay. Great. So week 6 in October after tech week.

757
01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:24.020
George H: Great. Okay. Great. Well, we're excited. I'm excited for the founders to meet you virtually, and then in person.

758
01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:36.490
David Willbrand: I'm looking forward to it, too. And this was this was fun, and, like, I said, happy to take any follow ups and congratulations on being admitted to the best accelerator program in the world. So onward and upward.

759
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.294
George H: Hey? Thanks for everything you do.

760
01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:40.500
David Willbrand: Cheers.

761
01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:45.470
George H: How's the recording.
