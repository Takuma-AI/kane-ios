### Key Insights

> "George H: okay. So today's workshop is one that we've done for a long time. David was with us back when we did tech search Chicago. He's a long time member of our network, and we've always had him do a kind of rundown of all legal and fundraising jargon that you need to know to kind of level set everybody, because everybody has different experience coming in. Some of you have started companies before some of you. This is your 1st time going into business, and we want everyone to understand when we throw out"

> "David Willbrand: I will respond to. I always respond to questions. You know they they come to me directly offline. So if the questions are things like, I already hate my co-founder. Maybe we don't want to air those out right here in the room in front of everybody, unless you just are like totally down for that kind of drama and transparency. And I'm here for that, I guess."

> "David Willbrand: the 2 sides must balance. That's why it's called a balance sheet."

> "David Willbrand: It's everything you create. It's everything you build. It's everything you achieve on day one. Your assets are probably 0 or fractions of a penny but over time we're hoping that that number gets quite big liabilities. This is one that we're always attentive to and fearful of."

> "David Willbrand: those net proceeds at exit, which means it's super important, because what you don't want to have is a fight."
