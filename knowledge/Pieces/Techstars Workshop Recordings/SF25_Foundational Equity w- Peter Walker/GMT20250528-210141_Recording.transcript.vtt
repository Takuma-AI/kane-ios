1
00:01:48.760 --> 00:02:04.500
Chloe Lannert: Where they were each worth tens and tens of millions of dollars that day. Right? So pretty great outcome. What you often find is that people along the way really, really mix up about solution, the capital that they're taking on what they're actually gonna do with it. So just keep that in mind as we go through this.

2
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.029
Chloe Lannert: How many of you are solo practice

3
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:32.089
Chloe Lannert: lonely? Well, that's never actually happened. However, not the norm these days. You are becoming a far more common phenotype in our startup ecosystem. 35% of the founders that joined Carter last year were solo founders. However, this has always been true will probably forever be true. Vcs hate them.

4
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:41.940
Chloe Lannert: It's not my supposition. This isn't an opinion. This is a fact. Vc. Funds solo founders far less than other companies.

5
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.330
Chloe Lannert: Why do these things get signed to the server?

6
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.390
Chloe Lannert: For no reason? Right? It's great. I completely agree. So why are they wrong here?

7
00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:53.280
Chloe Lannert: Okay, you're out bigger risk.

8
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.250
Chloe Lannert: We go risk this. It will say, book, you leave. What do I do? So investment gone.

9
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.919
Chloe Lannert: Other reasons why they have to freeze out of 400.

10
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:15.240
Chloe Lannert: This thing is right. One's a business person. One's a tech person. That was the old dynamic to say, I change that they don't talk about, but I think it's actually even more true. Sometimes

11
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.090
Chloe Lannert: they want to know if you're an asshole.

12
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:43.069
Chloe Lannert: and they figure if you're solo found, and you haven't had to convince anyone else to join you on that journey. That's a little bit more difficult than at least you convince one other person.

13
00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:50.890
Chloe Lannert: Okay, so if you don't, you do have a Co founder. Do you want running this alone? How do you split up your

14
00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:00.260
Chloe Lannert: 2 founder teams that split 50 50. That's that top line. So last year 45% of 2 founder teams split right down there.

15
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.210
Chloe Lannert: That means, obviously, that the majority of teams do not do that.

16
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.939
Chloe Lannert: and if you have 3 or 4, or even 5 calendars, most, none of them.

17
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.040
Chloe Lannert: So splitting unequally is the majority of cases.

18
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.979
Chloe Lannert: no matter what? Why see property in history?

19
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:33.349
Chloe Lannert: There's a lot of good reasons to split unequally. There's a lot of bad reasons to split unequally. There's no morally right position. Anyone who's too strong on this is just lying to you. 50 50 is totally fine. That's awesome. As long as you have a conversation about it

20
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:51.829
Chloe Lannert: unequal, totally fine again, as long as you had a sit down. Conversation about it. I cannot tell you the number of times I have run into founders who said I found a breakup 6 months into the business. I realized that my Co. Founder was full of simmering resentment because he or she only owned 40% of the business.

21
00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:00.429
Chloe Lannert: That was a lot right. And so whatever you do, talk about it with your partner. This is co-founder.

22
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:17.520
Chloe Lannert: You go 50, 51 49 is the most common, so obviously, very, very close. But just the decision making structure clear. If you have 3, 4, or 5 counters, there's typically someone who takes an outsized portion of that, a bigger seat.

23
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.700
Chloe Lannert: And that person is almost always nice list.

24
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.190
Chloe Lannert: So

25
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:35.559
Chloe Lannert: back to that profounder idea, what is one of, in my view, the easiest ways to kill your startups is to do all this without investment.

26
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.600
Chloe Lannert: You all have to settle on your own equity.

27
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.200
Chloe Lannert: That's not a lot of nods.

28
00:05:42.480 --> 00:06:01.830
Chloe Lannert: Disappointed. Okay? Good. Why? Because it won't happen to you. I'm sure you're all in beautiful and happy marriages with your co-founders, but one out of 4 of you will lose a co-founder in the 1st 4 years. That only counts the companies that made it to year 4, a lot of companies that died because of that, Co. Founders thought.

29
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.750
Chloe Lannert: Probably a 3rd of conference will use a couple in the session of this.

30
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:25.649
Chloe Lannert: That's what the vesting schedule does. It is obviously protection. Schedules is mostly protection for you. So if a Co. Founder leaves, they don't walk out the door to 50% of your business. And that's it. You cannot raise Vc funding. If 50% of your business is no longer working for the business.

31
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:33.200
Chloe Lannert: Okay, how to minimize that question for?

32
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:55.360
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, yeah, I over the years, the percentage of the founders that dropped out goes, is there any reason why it's that incorporate like in this range.

33
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.510
Chloe Lannert: What do you think? Why, those percentages may be higher? No, I mean, like.

34
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.349
Chloe Lannert: yeah, those those are going up. But like.

35
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:19.219
Chloe Lannert: instead of single digit percentages. I don't. I think that's mostly just noise. But there is something that happened here which is like tons of companies got funded, and then every over a lot of those Co founder relationships didn't make it past that.

36
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:26.089
Chloe Lannert: No Vc funding kills a lot of businesses. Not necessarily because you didn't have capital because it constitutes a lot of them.

37
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.020
Chloe Lannert: Okay?

38
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.809
Chloe Lannert: Question end of 4 year. There's an arrow end of 4 year. Traditional invest

39
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.550
Chloe Lannert: for founders. The standard today is 40 years with no cliff. You start investing immediately.

40
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.880
Chloe Lannert: However, you will hear Vc's try to push you towards 5, 6, even 8 year investment

41
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.530
Chloe Lannert: upfront. How does that make you feel but

42
00:08:08.266 --> 00:08:23.940
Chloe Lannert: right requests on their part. However, in logical sense, it doesn't. It doesn't make some sense. Given that you are probably not with the 1st 10 years, saving a dozen, 1314 years to ideal. So they do care whether you're long term incentivized.

43
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:40.579
Chloe Lannert: Don't give them that up front in my view stick with the 4 year you start having conversations. They might some of that equity. You can use that as a chip. Right? You can play that into evaluation. You can play that into cash. It is. It's just another term to negotiate. You don't need to just give it to them.

44
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.560
Chloe Lannert: So that's founders. You're gonna do the vesting schedule. You're gonna give yourself restricted stock awards mostly.

45
00:08:50.990 --> 00:09:00.160
Chloe Lannert: and you could get refreshed down the line. You do see? Founder refresh grants. You know, when you raise a big series, a or something, but you could also get asked to reinvest some of your equity.

46
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:23.109
Chloe Lannert: So more equity, less equity, kind of depends on how independent you are over time. Yeah. So there's a ton of different. We talk about ownership or equity like it's 1 thing, but there's 10 really different kinds of equity. The most common for founders is this one Rsa restricted soft awards

47
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:38.349
Chloe Lannert: really great for you for 2 reasons, one. When you accept that, grace. You own the ships you own them on that day there's no exercising. There's no money right, and the reason that's good for you is because on the day that you grant yourself that equity, what is your company?

48
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.189
Chloe Lannert: Zeros? Right? So what does that mean?

49
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:48.139
Chloe Lannert: Big like point? Oh, oh, one cents, which means you're not gonna pay really any taxes on it. But you already own the shares.

50
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.250
Chloe Lannert: So very favorable equity type for partners.

51
00:09:51.470 --> 00:10:01.979
Chloe Lannert: You don't generally see that for early employees or later employees, because the equity is actually worth a lot of money, and the strike price is higher. So they have to pay taxes on that immediately, and they're not sure

52
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:17.449
Chloe Lannert: reverse testing. Oh, yeah, revesting reverse testing. This is the Vc going. I realize you invested all your equity. Let's put some of that back on a new resting side.

53
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.090
Chloe Lannert: because they again wouldn't be long service

54
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:27.170
Chloe Lannert: trade. That don't give them that for free right as a as traders. Yeah. But to do that, they have to 1st buy your

55
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:42.140
Chloe Lannert: or like, what is that like? Are they diluting everyone to do that? Or they? Yeah, no, it's as simple as you own. 50% of the company outline is fully invested. Right? So they're saying is, put that on new.

56
00:10:42.720 --> 00:11:00.249
Chloe Lannert: Oh, straight up like chance cancel the previous thing. 100%. Oh, wow! Yep. Now, you won't revest your full equity state right? They'll be like, Hey, take 10% of that 50 that you own and revest it again, because from the day the Vc. Invests that's their starting they don't really care.

57
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.589
Chloe Lannert: They want you long term incentivize you to take advantage.

58
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.130
Chloe Lannert: So many of them will start asking you if you are too vested to do this.

59
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:14.719
Chloe Lannert: You don't have to say yes, right? You're gonna say, screw you. I'll take a different term sheet. It's your only term sheet.

60
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:23.930
Chloe Lannert: hey? I will give us 5% of my equity. But I'm gonna change almost like a higher valuation, or more cash, or deal with the board seat, or whatever it is.

61
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.209
Chloe Lannert: Good lawyer for me.

62
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:34.409
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, what are common, or, I want to say, acceptable, but, like reasonable asks, and what are red flags in terms of revesting

63
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:41.746
Chloe Lannert: revesting more than 50% of your position is a completely unreasonable ask, in my view.

64
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.899
Chloe Lannert: But hey! These seasons, when you get in the middle of those spreadsheet negotiations, you'll you'll be surprised what people ask for.

65
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.939
Chloe Lannert: and again it all comes back out of leverage.

66
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.119
Chloe Lannert: You won't hear silly requests. If you have 3 terms.

67
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.469
Chloe Lannert: if you have one churchy. You may hear some so many requests.

68
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.289
Chloe Lannert: and of course it comes into the

69
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:07.750
Chloe Lannert: prestige, or whatever of the fund, although we hear sometimes the Mega funds drive way harder bargains than the smaller funds.

70
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.480
Chloe Lannert: It's kind of all.

71
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.639
Chloe Lannert: But I mean, this is maybe a good point to

72
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:23.480
Chloe Lannert: roof. Just kind of reinforce. I'm sure you all know this, but venture is incredibly and always will be, and will never change from being unfair

73
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:33.349
Chloe Lannert: is not. I could give every single one of you the same arr, same product, and send you out the same road, and every single one of you come back with a different valuation.

74
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.799
Chloe Lannert: Right? It is not

75
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:48.539
Chloe Lannert: so your leverage as a founder, your leverage as the company creator versus their leverage. As the investor is always a personal leverage, it's not like cool. I get a million dollars in. Now I get these service. It's not how it works.

76
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:59.270
Chloe Lannert: advisors. How many of you have advisors here, but not oh.

77
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.140
Chloe Lannert: tell me if I'm wrong here, but whenever I talk to advisors.

78
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.130
Chloe Lannert: for some reason, they always start the conversation by saying.

79
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.820
Chloe Lannert: I don't know. Generally we take about 1%.

80
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:26.696
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, that's super freaking high. I don't know what they all got together in a conference one day. And they're like, let's ask for 1%, and then we'll get negotiated down. But no point 2 5% is the median amount of equity advisors.

81
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.430
Chloe Lannert: And then oftentimes we'll go. Peter. Yeah, your data is whatever I don't care. But you get what you pay for.

82
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:41.580
Chloe Lannert: Also, I think the main takeaway from this is not.

83
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.339
Chloe Lannert: It's terrible to give advisors a lot of equity. It is. Why do you need that?

84
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.839
Chloe Lannert: I'll say this now, too many companies use 2 and a license.

85
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.910
Chloe Lannert: If you're building a very scientifically difficult product. And you're working with a technical advisor at a university cool

86
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:05.290
Chloe Lannert: you're building. If your advisors, introducing you to actual customers and closing deals with you. I totally do it.

87
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.070
Chloe Lannert: If your advisor is telling me things that you could read online, don't give them that.

88
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.810
Chloe Lannert: Don't hear the net. Does it like? How valuable is this person?

89
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.370
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

90
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:33.400
Chloe Lannert: that, taking into account that the companies that have no advisors or no, just the ones that grants advisor. And what's the percentage that does get an advisor sometime?

91
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.990
Chloe Lannert: So, but that leaves obviously another half of it.

92
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.360
Chloe Lannert: and the median number of advisors for the ones that have them is us.

93
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.909
Chloe Lannert: Oh, 2 of them!

94
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:51.370
Chloe Lannert: Which again, I just think it's like, I think, that most of the time when we talk to founders of series A or series B, they look back and they go. That person.

95
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:58.690
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, do your advisors get a testing schedule as well well done?

96
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:10.959
Chloe Lannert: Yes, they do 2 years typically with a very short cliff or no cliff, or if you want, you can give them a performance criteria, investing schedule, which says, you get equity when you do this thing

97
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:24.809
Chloe Lannert: so very specific. If you do that be very specific on what that thing is. You don't want to go back and forth on an email where the advisor goes. No, no, you are compensating me on insurance, not closed candidates, right?

98
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:31.999
Chloe Lannert: And you're like, no, I didn't. I didn't hire the person. There's a lot of weird emails.

99
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.560
Chloe Lannert: So if you do require this criteria, be very specific about the technical service.

100
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:44.940
Chloe Lannert: nobody get. If you're an advisor. You don't typically get equity refreshed and they get non qualified stock options, which are

101
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.241
Chloe Lannert: okay. Okay? Sorry. Go ahead.

102
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.119
Chloe Lannert: Not almost here.

103
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.050
Chloe Lannert: 10 employees. So

104
00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:00.340
Chloe Lannert: you're probably, although maybe not. If you're following the same open path gonna hire some employees eventually.

105
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.479
Chloe Lannert: And you're gonna set aside a portion of equity for those people

106
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.369
Chloe Lannert: some Vcs that you'll talk to will be like your option pool. Your employees have option. Pool should start at 20%

107
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.829
Chloe Lannert: that is too high.

108
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:21.830
Chloe Lannert: Must start at 8, and then every time you fundraise, you can negotiate with Vcs about expanding that

109
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.780
Chloe Lannert: right, because if you start at 20 congrats, you just diluting yourself and not paying for no reason.

110
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:36.169
Chloe Lannert: And if the Vc. Goes well, you're probably gonna spend 20% hiring people between your seat and your a round, then they have no idea.

111
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.830
Chloe Lannert: none of them.

112
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.650
Chloe Lannert: So 8 to 10 is a great place to start

113
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:46.239
Chloe Lannert: brings us to. What do you pay your initial team.

114
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.849
Chloe Lannert: So this is higher number by first, st non founder, second non founder, etcetera.

115
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.330
Chloe Lannert: 1.5% as a median for the 1st

116
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.240
Chloe Lannert: recorded is that too high to you or low to you.

117
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.010
Chloe Lannert: Alright, yeah, you wouldn't join 4,

118
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.639
Chloe Lannert: maybe I don't know. We are found. So

119
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:18.999
Chloe Lannert: first, st the band on that is super wide could be half a percent could be 4 or 5. We see even 6%. Sometimes on the 1st hire. That person. You're all gonna hire

120
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:28.009
Chloe Lannert: at different rates. Right? It's not really a market. You're probably gonna know this person pretty well. Maybe you worked with them before, like, it's an art, not science. These are just guidance.

121
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:37.149
Chloe Lannert: However, it soon becomes not just art, it soon becomes pretty scientific, and say, Look, this is the market for this kind of position. That's what we pay.

122
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.410
Chloe Lannert: So to me.

123
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:48.509
Chloe Lannert: the hard one of the hardest things you're going to do as founders, aside from the many other hard things that you'll do is convincing teammates number 5 through 20 to learn.

124
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.440
Chloe Lannert: because they're taking a ton of risk for very little.

125
00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:58.789
Chloe Lannert: Yeah versus over, how do you guys do the business after 4 h.

126
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.450
Chloe Lannert: It's basically the same numbers here, too.

127
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.410
Chloe Lannert: less short equipment effectively the same. And they're getting

128
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:13.659
Chloe Lannert: 1 100th of the value of the company that you are, etc. So convincing those early early people to join is.

129
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.149
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, I'm curious about that.

130
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:34.090
Chloe Lannert: 1st we hired the range, but a lot of like cash salary? Or is it just like a negotiable thing? Or it's like A,

131
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:45.230
Chloe Lannert: mostly because convincing that 1st hire to join you. Okay? Right. This is probably a good thing

132
00:18:45.850 --> 00:19:03.039
Chloe Lannert: to your point, though the trade off between salary and equity here. Do you think that is happening more in the 1st 5 hires who, yes, tend to be engineers. And yes, they're coming from a bigger place, and they're already kind of cool on salary. They might be like, yeah, maybe like a marginal amount. But I want to boost that equity package because I'm in it for longer.

133
00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:21.359
Chloe Lannert: that maybe someone you want to target right? That's great. Yeah. What when it comes to like hire one. What our 1st hire is that is this based off of companies that have already raised typically, no.

134
00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:32.819
Chloe Lannert: specifically, was kind of a mix some of them may have raised a safe on safes and Angel round, or some capital. Some of them may have come out of accelerators, and others of them have never raised no money.

135
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.220
Chloe Lannert: So

136
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:44.409
Chloe Lannert: that means that there are these, 1.5 between point 5 and 4%. Are they getting to sell it? Yes, they're getting.

137
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.320
Chloe Lannert: you know.

138
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.090
Chloe Lannert: There's not that many people who are trying to look for a new site.

139
00:19:50.510 --> 00:20:00.730
Chloe Lannert: I mean, I'm sure there are some right who are like I love you. I love your product

140
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:15.730
Chloe Lannert: so investing same as usual for your best. For the one year clip. We do see some companies like Stripe and other people experimenting with different kinds of investment schedules for employees don't do that. You're not strike

141
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.680
Chloe Lannert: equity. Almost everybody gets incentive stuff happens as employees.

142
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.139
Chloe Lannert: Then you switch to Rs use way down like seriously, don't even think

143
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:33.361
Chloe Lannert: sometimes you give the earliest people like your 1st 5 employees. Rsas, like you got. That's pretty generous.

144
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:34.989
Chloe Lannert: It's another point.

145
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:44.840
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, I don't understand why one year is not in 2014, because then you don't get the advantage. Your recess.

146
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:55.890
Chloe Lannert: So the fair market value of the stock. If I have a fair market value of a dollar on my stock. 4 years from now that fair market value has risen a lot right?

147
00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:06.459
Chloe Lannert: Whereas if I get reset every year, I'm not actually getting as much of a growth in that. The the gap between the fair market value issuance and the actual value of stock isn't nearly as big.

148
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.880
Chloe Lannert: Okay? I thought the lesson schedule was when you actually get to

149
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.810
Chloe Lannert: have the possibility to buy it. It is so.

150
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:24.320
Chloe Lannert: maybe because if you have a that same schedule of a 1 year less. That means every single year you're getting a new credit

151
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:42.939
Chloe Lannert: right? It's not like for one year, and then compressed 4 years, 25% one year, and then you're right. That is the best, indicates the timeline onto which you have the option to

152
00:21:43.826 --> 00:21:49.240
Chloe Lannert: was a very important part. But it's not

153
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:59.640
Chloe Lannert: refresh. You'll probably give these people more equity. If they stick around right after 4 years they'll give them more equity because their 1st 4 year grant right now, that kind of stuff

154
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.849
Chloe Lannert: they get promoted, you might give them smartly, etc. You you probably won't get started.

155
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.089
Chloe Lannert: What are the modes for this? The refreshes? Yes.

156
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:18.299
Chloe Lannert: depends typically on a 10 year, Grant, we see the refresh being something like 60% of the initial

157
00:22:19.002 --> 00:22:33.470
Chloe Lannert: but it depends, especially if those are your first.st Like 4 or 5 employees, they probably already have a lot of equity, so maybe not promotion and merit. It's much more like we can move you from a level 5 to a level 6 in linear. And therefore the equity is bumped up.

158
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:43.029
Chloe Lannert: Those are problems, for when you're going to be done, few of them already.

159
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.900
Chloe Lannert: Alright, proceed

160
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.929
Chloe Lannert: the biggest question across Silicon Valley these days.

161
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:58.370
Chloe Lannert: You need raising, or do you not need any outside of it?

162
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:03.229
Chloe Lannert: Everyone loves reading tech crunch headlines about cursor.

163
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:09.010
Chloe Lannert: And then all these AI startups that have taken no money and are moving in our the next

164
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:18.109
Chloe Lannert: that is definitely happening. It's being written about more than it's actually happening right? I'm sure some of you are probably in that one already.

165
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:25.780
Chloe Lannert: because Vc. Is really expensive is the most expensive capital you will ever take. If you're holding.

166
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.620
Chloe Lannert: you get a loan from a bank, pay the bank back. You don't have to talk to the bank or every quarter for the rest of the year.

167
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:41.270
Chloe Lannert: Vcs are with like a beautiful laps, so

168
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:49.940
Chloe Lannert: different pathways for funding in this sort of ecosystem. Obviously you can bootstrap your cash plus revenue.

169
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:54.889
Chloe Lannert: You can go full. Vc. Where you go. Pre all that will be.

170
00:23:55.110 --> 00:24:01.880
Chloe Lannert: You can see, chat. Everyone's new favorite model, which is, I'm gonna raise 100. This profitability, not raise again.

171
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.199
Chloe Lannert: Not like it.

172
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:21.409
Chloe Lannert: Lots of people trying that you have to be seeing how that really works out, and then you can do late. Vc, so it's exactly like bootstrapping. But then I don't know. 4 or 5 years down the road. You realize, you know what? We have a great business, but if I had an extra 20 million dollars I could really supercharge this, and you're an amazing position to negotiate.

173
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.219
Chloe Lannert: You don't need to tackle. This is just for right.

174
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.189
Chloe Lannert: All of these are good.

175
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.620
Chloe Lannert: I think one of the annoying things about this moment is

176
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:36.540
Chloe Lannert: we keep telling entrepreneurs like. There's a lot of people in the ecosystem and say, if you don't do X, you are in.

177
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:45.060
Chloe Lannert: It's like that's not true. Right. Lots of different people have different levels of ambition for their business and different capital, all these different levels of ambition.

178
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:50.000
Chloe Lannert: So the big question that comes out of this is, how much money do you need?

179
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.509
Chloe Lannert: It's not an easy question to answer, but it is a developed question.

180
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.779
Chloe Lannert: because if you know that you really know that the rest of this stuff becomes live.

181
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:08.099
Chloe Lannert: But let's say you are gonna raise money from angels or from Vcs. You're all familiar with the safe.

182
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:17.730
Chloe Lannert: So states are the dominant vehicle for fundraising. 90% of the dollars received flow from States not converting notes.

183
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.610
Chloe Lannert: If you're building a biotech or robotics.

184
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.650
Chloe Lannert: maybe you'll run across some convertible notes. But most of this month

185
00:25:27.215 --> 00:25:36.260
Chloe Lannert: safe obviously have 2 terms. Valuation app. There's a ceiling of the safe. Discount is the floor of the safe. And then there's greeting post money. So

186
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:43.190
Chloe Lannert: of those terms, you're definitely gonna negotiate on your evaluation cap. It's like 90% of states.

187
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.199
Chloe Lannert: Some of them have a discount

188
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:50.719
Chloe Lannert: and then uncapped, undiscounted. Those are probably best friends in your parents.

189
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.660
Chloe Lannert: Everybody is using the post money, save which is the gray bars, gray black bars there.

190
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:08.859
Chloe Lannert: Can does anyone know what happened in say, like q, 1 of 2020, actually, q, 4, 2018,

191
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.379
Chloe Lannert: something happened that made this graph look like this?

192
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.219
Chloe Lannert: Do I see it on the right button?

193
00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.520
Chloe Lannert: Exactly. Yc, literally just took the Pdf. And the figure, he said, it pops

194
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:29.099
Chloe Lannert: you still find it literally just a Google away. But everyone just like, Oh, it's not on the white common database, so we won't use it.

195
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.429
Chloe Lannert: Yes, a lot of financial engineering. Why do they do that?

196
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.269
Chloe Lannert: Suppose money saves are better for investors?

197
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:41.999
Chloe Lannert: They're clearer, revenue better than the customers

198
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.480
Chloe Lannert: often is spoken about like they're better for everyone. They're not.

199
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.859
Chloe Lannert: And here's why

200
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:56.329
Chloe Lannert: a million bucks into a 10 million cap safe if it's pre money. I, the investor. I have no idea how much of your company? I

201
00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.149
Chloe Lannert: because you could just keep wondering, not tell me. I don't know.

202
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.980
Chloe Lannert: Post money.

203
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.420
Chloe Lannert: I own 10%.

204
00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:14.319
Chloe Lannert: The math is just much more right. It's a little less than 10%, because you have the option for more money. But in general post money saves give the investor a much better idea of how much of your company.

205
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.470
Chloe Lannert: which is good, because then you can know how much you've given away when you sold it.

206
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.989
Chloe Lannert: But it's that because it's at the dimension has uploaded.

207
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.869
Chloe Lannert: So again, if I give you 500 K and 5 million cap

208
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:34.699
Chloe Lannert: that day, I get literally nothing, and you get $500,000 saves wrong power. Second.

209
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:44.180
Chloe Lannert: then, in the future you fundraise on these terms for your 1st price round, and then on that day. I own shares, I have a percentage.

210
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.429
Chloe Lannert: It could be 12 months could be 24 months. Whenever that qualifies

211
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:54.029
Chloe Lannert: side note, if you raise on a safe and then never raise the price around.

212
00:27:55.570 --> 00:28:01.690
Chloe Lannert: There's no real mechanism on the standard document to convert that into equity ever, unless you want to be nice

213
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.039
Chloe Lannert: encode is integrated from a PC,

214
00:28:08.217 --> 00:28:15.559
Chloe Lannert: yeah, this might be a dumb question. But what makes something qualified? Which is the 4, 1, 8.

215
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:22.090
Chloe Lannert: There's some legal definitions around what a qualified financing is, typically what it means is you have a price per share.

216
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:34.839
Chloe Lannert: So it has to be a price. Evaluation, which means other States are not qualified. Right? So say, don't convert. If you raise more states, they're all waiting to be converted, and whatever the qualified.

217
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.180
Chloe Lannert: the poster shares the main estimate.

218
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:43.339
Chloe Lannert: and that it's an equity like instrument and not a bad instrument.

219
00:28:45.140 --> 00:29:04.679
Chloe Lannert: I'm sorry just a like option, like so founders still get a price per share when they get their option. Right? Yeah, that is not totally different, totally different. It's actually a great question. So there's a preferred price per share, which is you and your investors figure out. Here's the price per share for the investors.

220
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:31.759
Chloe Lannert: And then there is the 490 valuation price. Those 2 are very different, and they should be very different. And investors, good investors, all good investors understand that they're different. And they're not going to give you right? So just because your Fmv on your shares is like one cent doesn't mean they're going to be like, well, the Fmv is one cent. So we're going to lower your valuation. They're totally one is about taxes. One is about optimism in the future.

221
00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:38.120
Chloe Lannert: So the same. Yeah. So theoretically, if use only.

222
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:51.570
Chloe Lannert: and you then do all those things. Converge the Ipo price. Yes, they would, if you. I don't think any company's ever done that. But you could be the first, st I think an Ipo would count as a

223
00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:58.679
Chloe Lannert: that would be super sick. That's like extra dozen.

224
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.399
Chloe Lannert: Okay. It used to be that the safe was a simple one. Page document.

225
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:10.900
Chloe Lannert: Today it's the same thing, one or 2 pages. But then oftentimes Vc. Fund will add on a new document called side button.

226
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.940
Chloe Lannert: That is simply they are asking you the more side

227
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.899
Chloe Lannert: you don't have to accept it, although most Vc. Funds will have a side whether it exists.

228
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.900
Chloe Lannert: So the stuff they usually ask one most favorite issue.

229
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.730
Chloe Lannert: which means, if you give anybody a better deal than this deal, I get better.

230
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:36.359
Chloe Lannert: Okay, debatable reasonable issue information rights completely reasonable. In my view. That just means you have to tell us what you're doing. Everything else

231
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.139
Chloe Lannert: pretty good.

232
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:40.649
Chloe Lannert: Pro rata is the new one.

233
00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:49.039
Chloe Lannert: Right? So this means that I, the investor, can continue investing into your business to maintain my ownership percentage if you raise more capital.

234
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:58.080
Chloe Lannert: So at your seeground. I make the choice to keep investing into you, buying 10% to keep that 10% at 10%.

235
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.159
Chloe Lannert: Don't give this to everyone.

236
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.200
Chloe Lannert: This is for leads of your round, maybe, and sometimes not all of them.

237
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:21.600
Chloe Lannert: Right? So you'll talk to lawyers about who gets pro rata, who doesn't. But if you gave everyone pro rata. Then your next round is going to get more complicated and involve all the hurt feelings and all this stuff, because it's not going to be possible for everyone to take their pro rata with a new investor.

238
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.849
Chloe Lannert: Does that make sense?

239
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.080
Chloe Lannert: Don't give that to everybody, but people will ask so

240
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:29.999
Chloe Lannert: and have a lawyer be the side.

241
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:49.220
Chloe Lannert: So the big question, what should you set your valuation cap at right now in the States? If you're raising a million bucks. Media valuation cap is just about 10 million. So 1 million raised 10 million cap means you sold.

242
00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.179
Chloe Lannert: We both thank you. 10% of the business. Yes.

243
00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:07.660
Chloe Lannert: and that's how you should think about it. By the way, valuation caps, I've seen a lot of early stage founders get very, very precious about the valuation caps. 2 things. One valuation cap is not a valuation.

244
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:13.230
Chloe Lannert: 2, even if it was, it doesn't mean your business is worth 10 million dollars.

245
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.990
Chloe Lannert: It isn't

246
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:23.849
Chloe Lannert: your business. The 10 million dollars is the outcome of a math equation, saying the investor needs to own this percentage of the company to make the upside debt worth their money.

247
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.489
Chloe Lannert: It has really nothing to do with what we're worth today.

248
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.919
Chloe Lannert: right? So you can try to emotionally distance yourself from that number, because that would be helpful.

249
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:44.799
Chloe Lannert: So I think about it. When I talk to founders is just a function of dilution. So is 10% of your business worth a million bucks

250
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:52.630
Chloe Lannert: could be. What are you gonna use that 1 million dollars for? What are you gonna build with it? What's the line of sight to the next round. If that's what you want to do, all that.

251
00:32:53.140 --> 00:33:13.929
Chloe Lannert: I will say that if you raise a C round a price C round the Median dilution is between like 19 and 20%. And if you do the same amount on a safe, it's basically the same. So the market is pretty rational. If you're raising about 3 million dollars on a safe, you're gonna probably have yourself about as much as you would on the customer. It's not like you're getting a totally better if you do that.

252
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.290
Chloe Lannert: Most

253
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:30.899
Chloe Lannert: sorry. The colors are a little in the one to 2.4, as of now those are both considered I would consider those sea grounds. Yes. Now this points to the fact that see grounds could be

254
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:37.030
Chloe Lannert: awesome, right? We see price for a million bucks. And we see pricing.

255
00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:43.749
Chloe Lannert: So the terms are very flexible and saves everyone is using them today.

256
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:51.479
Chloe Lannert: So you'll probably get different reactions. So I I guess this is more of this stuff from a fundraising perspective. Yeah, curious, like, you know, generally

257
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:57.590
Chloe Lannert: we do. The math founders do the math we're like, Hey, we want to raise. We need this much money, if not, what we need. Yep.

258
00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:13.870
Chloe Lannert: Is there any point to trying to place that in one of these things? Just like, if there's like area budget, right? Cause? Or is it is it useful? Yeah, to an investor to be like, oh, they're gonna be appreciated. They're going to be.

259
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:19.140
Chloe Lannert: I don't sure. I'm not sure, but it seems based on this that it does not matter.

260
00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:30.169
Chloe Lannert: Yes, although you could also say, I will raise the lowest possible round I can by the name, just so that if the investors heads they're like, Wow! You make so much progress

261
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:45.309
Chloe Lannert: outside, even though the fees for 3 million bucks like that's people do this right. The names of the names like whatever. But the idea that so investors will have some conception in their heads of what is, pre see traction, and what is seed round traction. Yeah. But if you raise.

262
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.950
Chloe Lannert: see money, a pre see round.

263
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:54.780
Chloe Lannert: does that set you up to like. Be very impressive with your C round traction. Maybe right.

264
00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:58.699
Chloe Lannert: I've seen founders who say I would rather raise something called a precede.

265
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:06.139
Chloe Lannert: and something called based on that. Where, where would that kind of subway be? The line would probably be around 200 bucks

266
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:13.339
Chloe Lannert: would be almost all investors in the valley would consider us a raise of 2 million to be seen. Let's see, this

267
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.370
Chloe Lannert: to a year old is most of the lines.

268
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:34.670
Chloe Lannert: But again. You can call it whatever you want to call it right. And because it's on safe, you literally can do whatever you want, because it's just random sign like you don't raise in a round. You have one set of documents that everyone signs, etc, in a safe. It's just oh, 50 K. Check on this account. Keep raising.

269
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:54.589
Chloe Lannert: That's honestly why found easy or feels like oh, I just need a little bit more cash. Let me go out and raise another 50 or 100 k. On, save then I'll do that again, and I'll do that again. Then you're spending half your time thinking about that half your time building your company, and you want one of those States to convert it.

270
00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:04.239
Chloe Lannert: Some founders are very good at fundraising and building at the same time, and some founders are terrible at fundraising and building at the same time.

271
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.520
Chloe Lannert: You should know which one.

272
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:15.700
Chloe Lannert: so you cannot do both things at once, and set aside time and spend every waking moment on fundraising and then build some of you can multitask really long.

273
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.140
Chloe Lannert: I can understand.

274
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:48.559
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, that's what he's my co-found. The reason he's asking is, we're trying to figure out if it makes a difference to investors in what we know the amount of fundraise. Yeah, does it make it a difference to investors how we position by the name. If we come in that, let's say 2 and a half, and we call it a seed that looks small as a seed round. Given the currency rounds that are happening. Does that position us poorly, optically, and possibly creates anxiety among the investors about about where we are. Yes.

275
00:36:49.810 --> 00:37:06.640
Chloe Lannert: the way to get around that, if you did still want to call it a seed is we're being very judicious about capital. We we don't think we're gonna need to raise more capital for another 3 years. You can get around the initial impression of how you're going to use that money. But in general yes, I think so versus we need a big pre seat

276
00:37:10.056 --> 00:37:18.919
Chloe Lannert: as found. We're actually

277
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:30.470
Chloe Lannert: in many ways actually motivated or incentivized to say we are raising this much as this seed as pre see round now, and don't let the investor decide what type of

278
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:38.279
Chloe Lannert: sure I mean, that's why, I put you in a box anyways. And

279
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:51.439
Chloe Lannert: so yeah, most founders are sticking on, save for the initial checks. Once you're raising a pretty sizable round of probably 3 million or more. You get lawyers involved. You do a price round

280
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.050
Chloe Lannert: last time. The issue

281
00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:01.899
Chloe Lannert: shakes are like this siren song. They're so easy they're so convenient. Don't stay on them too.

282
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:17.929
Chloe Lannert: We have seen many, many tap tables who are screwed. Now all of you are very smart. You can use free tools and our calculators, or whatever to model out the dilution. I'm not that worried that you're gonna wake up one day and realize, oh, my gosh! I've sold so much more of my company than I expect. You're smart people.

283
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:25.020
Chloe Lannert: What you don't see is that the valuation caps force the next round to be higher.

284
00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:35.020
Chloe Lannert: A investor in Csc. Your precede investors are not excited about you converting

285
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:46.929
Chloe Lannert: right? So if you raise it, 20 or a 10 million dollar precede. If your seed is at a 10 million dollar valuation that is not good for your precede investors, they are not happy

286
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:51.489
Chloe Lannert: because they give you money. Then 2 years pass. And now you're at the same evaluation.

287
00:38:51.970 --> 00:39:10.949
Chloe Lannert: That is not right, and people stack Val caps on top of 1012, 15, that is, pushing up your eventual that makes the next round harder. Right? So this is, it's not just a like optics thing. It is a literal. Okay. Now we expect more from you.

288
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.159
Chloe Lannert: People do not factor that in our sense.

289
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.669
Chloe Lannert: I there are companies I'm part of that have signed seats at 30 different valuations, single company.

290
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:25.029
Chloe Lannert: It happens, everything I know it probably sounds like

291
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:35.889
Chloe Lannert: because they're expensive, and you have to pay your Vc. Lawyer fees, which feels egregious but it is probably worth. Also, if you are paying your Vc. Lawyer fees.

292
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.140
Chloe Lannert: tell them I will pay them up to this point, but not phone.

293
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:45.100
Chloe Lannert: or else Wilson sincerely will take one of your arms and rip it out of your throat.

294
00:39:46.145 --> 00:39:55.750
Chloe Lannert: Sorry, most. There are many other law firms who have been exactly the same. Okay, see fundraising

295
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:04.170
Chloe Lannert: the orange line is the seed safe valuations today, and the gray bars are the number of companies raising seed rounds.

296
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.150
Chloe Lannert: One is going way up, the other is going way down.

297
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:13.999
Chloe Lannert: So the fact that the valuation is at all time highs

298
00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:19.609
Chloe Lannert: is interesting, but not the full picture without the number of companies raising.

299
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:23.710
Chloe Lannert: What happened here is this, was above

300
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.380
Chloe Lannert: tons of rounds, valuations, and rounds shooting upwards today.

301
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:36.480
Chloe Lannert: This the Vcs. Will tell you. All agree is us being very judicious about the companies we invest in.

302
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:42.280
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, we're willing to pay up for things we think that are worth it. But there are less founders needed funding.

303
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:54.759
Chloe Lannert: Of course the if you just look at the arr between these, like the company arr the median arr for a company that raised here versus the median arr for company basis today varies

304
00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.579
Chloe Lannert: probably 2 to 2 to 3 times then.

305
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.559
Chloe Lannert: So the expectations have risen twice.

306
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:07.800
Chloe Lannert: It used to be that we would say, you have a million bucks in AR, you can probably start talking to a series. A

307
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.229
Chloe Lannert: series. Agencies are not looking at.

308
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.240
Chloe Lannert: If you're building in beating.

309
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.810
Chloe Lannert: How many of your other tasks?

310
00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.889
Chloe Lannert: Not me cool.

311
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:20.990
Chloe Lannert: Let me go to the app.

312
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.250
Chloe Lannert: Hey? Awesome!

313
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.340
Chloe Lannert: Oh, correct!

314
00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.129
Chloe Lannert: What is AI? What is that?

315
00:41:31.118 --> 00:41:33.869
Chloe Lannert: So why is this going down?

316
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:45.499
Chloe Lannert: If you read on pitch books or other things like, maybe this looks much better than it does in our view. I think our view is more accurate because we can tell when A. C round is an actual new C round or bridges or extensions.

317
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:53.280
Chloe Lannert: So 45% of the rounds in c category this year, having bridges or extensions

318
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.740
Chloe Lannert: to people who've already raised 0.

319
00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:03.609
Chloe Lannert: There's a ton of vcu time, attention, money, etc, that is going to keeping 3rd portfolio companies alive.

320
00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.470
Chloe Lannert: I need to sign language.

321
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.840
Chloe Lannert: Great question

322
00:42:08.515 --> 00:42:25.649
Chloe Lannert: bridge is around in the same name series, because we have the actual round documents. You can see this. It is for a valuation of either flat or just above the old valuation, and it is for less money in the round of product. So a typical way this might look, you raise a C round of 3 million bucks.

323
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:33.060
Chloe Lannert: 18 months later you go back to your Vcs. And you say, look, we can't reach a series a right now. We didn't get where we thought we're gonna go.

324
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:37.290
Chloe Lannert: Can you give us a little bit more money. You give us an extra 1 million bucks

325
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:43.319
Chloe Lannert: in a bridge, but it gives us a bridge round.

326
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:47.070
Chloe Lannert: That's a ton of Crm activities all over that

327
00:42:47.858 --> 00:42:54.320
Chloe Lannert: right. And why are they asking? We have Vcs. Who tell us more than half of their portfolios come back and ask for a bridge.

328
00:42:55.550 --> 00:43:01.250
Chloe Lannert: Obviously they can't fund all of those bridges they have to choose amongst their children.

329
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:05.080
Chloe Lannert: But even that choosing process there's a ton of original.

330
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.100
Chloe Lannert: Hmm!

331
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:15.100
Chloe Lannert: This is why, if you talk to repeat entrepreneurs, they will often say, Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's cool to be profitable, or whatever. Take the biggest advocate

332
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.630
Chloe Lannert: and just talking to a MoD. We're hearing about this.

333
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.810
Chloe Lannert: He was like, Yeah, man, if I was at right now I would take the absolute biggest. And then he's not.

334
00:43:26.599 --> 00:43:32.350
Chloe Lannert: What's your. Have you seen anything in terms of like rolling rounds?

335
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.990
Chloe Lannert: We've got a few

336
00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:43.666
Chloe Lannert: alumni who have just been accepting safes every couple of months for like a year and a half, and it's a strategy.

337
00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:48.520
Chloe Lannert: it's a so if you do it on stage, it's probably if you do it on price.

338
00:43:48.650 --> 00:44:12.190
Chloe Lannert: I would not take a tranche as a price found, because all you're doing then, is giving you giving the Vcs. Like more opportunities to evaluate you along the way. So you raise 3 million bucks, and they say we'll give you a million now, and a million a year and a million the year after you could raise a million on saves. Now build a little bit, go back up to market

339
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:19.570
Chloe Lannert: again. That's fine, but it just it puts a lot of pressure on getting everything right every time.

340
00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:21.060
Chloe Lannert: So

341
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:30.220
Chloe Lannert: I'm not saying that is right. And I'm not saying that you shouldn't raise just what you need or raise up. All those are great options just that people are going to have.

342
00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:39.983
Chloe Lannert: and partly why those numbers are so weird on the seaside is because everyone's in love with AI right now,

343
00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.980
Chloe Lannert: valuations are 40 or 50% higher for AI companies

344
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.560
Chloe Lannert: typically speaking and around our data, and they get raised fast.

345
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.410
Chloe Lannert: Who wants to define what an AI applicant is.

346
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.300
Chloe Lannert: Think about something they can do.

347
00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:16.770
Chloe Lannert: It has to use the word. It could be that they want you to build foundational models. It could be that they want you to build

348
00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:22.555
Chloe Lannert: fine tuned models with their own data. It could be that if you call chats, you can see, they're cool with it that works.

349
00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.300
Chloe Lannert: All investors have different definitions of what AI is

350
00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:41.250
Chloe Lannert: which is annoying to you all because you're gonna run across that a lot, and it also kind of is annoying to them to be honest, because they are. One of the reasons that the round is trending down is because they are super uncertain about what is going to be defensible players.

351
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:50.439
Chloe Lannert: We we, the you know, crappy, exposed to like, look at all the startups that opening up until today. On that release.

352
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.719
Chloe Lannert: we see the kind of feel into this

353
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:57.310
Chloe Lannert: like I funded some years ago, and now

354
00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.870
Chloe Lannert: they have business ones, and how recurring some revenues couple of

355
00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.190
Chloe Lannert: they're they're they're trying to find their footing on what the New World looks like.

356
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.700
Chloe Lannert: Never. Some of them are not feeling great. Now

357
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:18.889
Chloe Lannert: series, a same thing series B, same more to you is how much of your business you're gonna sell.

358
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:24.949
Chloe Lannert: So it's 20% in a sea ground, 20% in a series of that's still the market.

359
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.600
Chloe Lannert: You're building something more hard tech physical products, probably a little higher.

360
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.129
Chloe Lannert: And then you sell less of your company as your company is.

361
00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:37.780
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

362
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:52.849
Chloe Lannert: brings us to how often you're going to the Orange section. Here is the old Vc. Advice that was thrown around for a lot of time, which was, you're gonna fundraise every 18 to 24 months.

363
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:58.810
Chloe Lannert: And for a while it was very good advice, right? Lots of companies fundraising in that timeframe. Now it's out of date.

364
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:04.659
Chloe Lannert: So the median time between rounds from series A to series B is nearly a thousand minutes.

365
00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:12.370
Chloe Lannert: So what does this mean? This is why, maybe the entrepreneurs like mine would say, raise what we can. Now.

366
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:15.140
Chloe Lannert: you don't know how long it's gonna be until you just

367
00:47:16.617 --> 00:47:26.870
Chloe Lannert: unguaranty. Yeah. So this is more a factor of like, you can't raise more than a factor of like you choosing to wait both.

368
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.389
Chloe Lannert: Really, it's up to them right? Because, like

369
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.479
Chloe Lannert: intense is verified to whether or not you're comfortable. There's an airport

370
00:47:35.002 --> 00:47:41.249
Chloe Lannert: people say people want to say, Oh, no, this is founders choosing to see chat. I think that's not true.

371
00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:56.279
Chloe Lannert: You know what? Yeah, you'll see. Get the money now. So if I were a founder, that's what I would do. But again, or I would try to raise literally nothing. Never talk to these, which is a great way to do it. You want to do that.

372
00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:58.779
Chloe Lannert: Of course, the Internet, you know how to live.

373
00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:02.440
Chloe Lannert: So maybe figure out, address it.

374
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:08.620
Chloe Lannert: I think it's really hard with seed strapping to like we're gonna raise one round to be done.

375
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:19.369
Chloe Lannert: We hear a lot of companies trying it, and I think it's great for founders. It is immensely at odds with the current Vc. Model. So a lot of investors.

376
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:23.909
Chloe Lannert: I don't know how they justify it to themselves. It's not what they promised their lps

377
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:25.610
Chloe Lannert: when they raise the time

378
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:34.369
Chloe Lannert: they were like, we're gonna invest in a seat. And then we're gonna get marked up at you're gonna see all the beautiful TV that we have. And then you're gonna invest in our next one.

379
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:42.770
Chloe Lannert: They didn't say, we're gonna invest in this company. We're gonna wait 10 years and then hopefully tough.

380
00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:52.540
Chloe Lannert: Maybe this is the New World, and you can find the right investment. There are some Vcs who would do that model in Dvc. And Utah comes to mind a couple other ones. It's not

381
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.340
Chloe Lannert: alright. So last part for your ownership.

382
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:03.770
Chloe Lannert: This is how much the founding team owns after the rest.

383
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:11.420
Chloe Lannert: This is the meeting, and it does very good.

384
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:26.359
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, that's the correct view. So like, how does that look? Same- same data? But now with stakeholder groups, you the founding team, your employees investors in the round, the other investors that are in the nonprofit.

385
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:36.490
Chloe Lannert: So after your series a round the median amount of ownership that you? The founding team has across this is 20,000 companies I'm part of is 36%

386
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.760
Chloe Lannert: mirror refund.

387
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:43.670
Chloe Lannert: Is this new? Well, it's new as a district

388
00:49:44.219 --> 00:49:50.929
Chloe Lannert: I mean the the trend, is it? Oh, is it new like? It's actually been getting slightly worse. But it's pretty pretty standard.

389
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:59.839
Chloe Lannert: I don't know there was this thing across Silicon Valley that you have to have 50% of your company after your series 8. I don't know where that came from. That's literally never gonna be valued.

390
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:14.459
Chloe Lannert: However, that doesn't mean investors have control. Right? So you and your employees against the investor side, basically, even after series a. When can your Vcs fire you? Is that for Series B.

391
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.920
Chloe Lannert: If they truly want to?

392
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:34.440
Chloe Lannert: Again debunking most of them, the vast majority of them do not want to fire, they invested into your business. You were there right. Obviously there are literature on their bloodthirsty, and all that kind of stuff. Most of them are. Most of them want to see you.

393
00:50:35.223 --> 00:50:39.620
Chloe Lannert: But control does matter. And it's this is why we say track that additional time.

394
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:47.789
Chloe Lannert: I can see, some of you may be thinking, Well, yeah, equity wise. I've lost control, but one of my shares about like 10 to one

395
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:49.780
Chloe Lannert: is upper bird furniture.

396
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.049
Chloe Lannert: Good luck getting. At least it's quicker

397
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:59.140
Chloe Lannert: if you are Dario and Sam Almond or someone. Sure you can have super voting shows

398
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.119
Chloe Lannert: if you are competing for term seats

399
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:06.890
Chloe Lannert: very less than I think 3% of companies on Florida had super voting share costs.

400
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.480
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

401
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:23.540
Chloe Lannert: So it really comes down to less about the board seats.

402
00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:31.990
Chloe Lannert: So typically, what will happen is the lead investor in each of these rounds will take a board seat. So if the board originally was, the 2 of you, both founders.

403
00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:35.630
Chloe Lannert: and then 2 of you and the lead. You see

404
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:38.140
Chloe Lannert: 2 of you and 2 Vcs.

405
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:40.779
Chloe Lannert: 2 of you and previous years.

406
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:55.410
Chloe Lannert: Now oftentimes what will happen is, you will have independent board directors as well. That will come on. You get to choose those most of the time, but I mean look, it can happen to travision

407
00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:59.939
Chloe Lannert: at Series D or E, it can happen.

408
00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:22.489
Chloe Lannert: It doesn't happen very often. Yes, and then the control rights and those. This is why I made a joke about, but it is great to have a lawyer for these kind of things, because you want

409
00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.599
Chloe Lannert: my last one would be CEO version.

410
00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:35.080
Chloe Lannert: Obviously in the beginning it matters quite a lot whether or not the CEO is the CEO of a 1 founder company or a 4 Founder Company.

411
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.269
Chloe Lannert: but then over time, it narrows quite considerably.

412
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:46.120
Chloe Lannert: So talking between 6 to 10% after 4 or 5 rounds, that's the ownership.

413
00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:49.710
Chloe Lannert: Hopefully, your company's worth a couple of 1 billion. By then

414
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:57.170
Chloe Lannert: we've got secondaries. I'll chase and specific types super easy. Right?

415
00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:02.069
Chloe Lannert: What questions do you have any of this understand?

416
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.489
Chloe Lannert: Hiring? etc.

417
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.770
Chloe Lannert: because you haven't too cool to change oops

418
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:18.519
Chloe Lannert: doesn't have to change. You could be very, very vicious about who gets equity.

419
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:26.950
Chloe Lannert: Most people find that the initial 10% is not enough to

420
00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:36.300
Chloe Lannert: grants to all of the employees. Right? This is the pool, every one of the employees. So the employee option at 21%. There are 1,600 of us

421
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.540
Chloe Lannert: and meeting them or less part of it.

422
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.530
Chloe Lannert: it's 20% over 2,000 people.

423
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:51.530
Chloe Lannert: All the grants get smaller and smaller over time, but you could do you could keep it flat if you want. We were very ambitious about it.

424
00:53:53.103 --> 00:54:02.819
Chloe Lannert: say 20% on it able to leverage and pull back some of them.

425
00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:17.470
Chloe Lannert: Sorry, say, like telegraph.

426
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:21.960
Chloe Lannert: Think I should have been.

427
00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.859
Chloe Lannert: You're looking to talk to somebody.

428
00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.940
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, we're gonna talk about it.

429
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:32.859
Chloe Lannert: If you don't need to take it back in the event of your company getting sold, it will go back.

430
00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:37.980
Chloe Lannert: So, in the event of an exit. Unused, unallocated option will typically go back to the

431
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:44.659
Chloe Lannert: not always. But in the majority of cases, sometimes. Vcs will last week.

432
00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:51.209
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, we haven't talked about that cash out from the phone team like?

433
00:54:52.030 --> 00:55:01.489
Chloe Lannert: From what I understand, we usually take some cash out like starting with something like that. What's the trend? How are things going?

434
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.189
Chloe Lannert: Yes, a cash option. Secondary sales.

435
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:16.190
Chloe Lannert: yes, it's happening it's again spoken about more than it happens actually to be. Frankly honest, and I wouldn't start asking for that at serious A

436
00:55:16.862 --> 00:55:33.740
Chloe Lannert: but series B series C, totally. We do see some funders. If you have a hot round, you allocate a portion of that, and you actually sell secondaries to new investors, etc. Or, better yet, you and hopefully early employees, you get an option to. It doesn't have to be just the funds.

437
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:40.099
Chloe Lannert: I would recommend that if you are taking some money off the table you get the option for your employees to do so as well.

438
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:45.740
Chloe Lannert: Behavior, deep respect for the Congress to do that. And the second thing is.

439
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.829
Chloe Lannert: the bigger question is, would you be annoyed if your early investing sold.

440
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.840
Chloe Lannert: So a lot of the secondary behavior is like used to be very

441
00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:00.990
Chloe Lannert: stigmatized like a red flag. If anyone was selling before late stage.

442
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:07.959
Chloe Lannert: Now you know that angel, those early Vcs. That they invested in your PC. And now it's series C.

443
00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:15.700
Chloe Lannert: I think it's totally fair for both you and them to take something, not the whole position. Yeah.

444
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:20.680
Chloe Lannert: yeah, you should. I think the idea that you need to be ron and founders for the next 10 years is pretty safe.

445
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:25.230
Chloe Lannert: especially since it's taking 14 years.

446
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.869
Chloe Lannert: Don't get as many shots as this.

447
00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:32.849
Chloe Lannert: Well, you talked about the option pool, but I thought some of this hiring stats might be useful.

448
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:43.299
Chloe Lannert: Founders like you are not hiring their 1st people very quickly. It's taking longer and longer right? So this is days from incorporation to the 1st time.

449
00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.340
Chloe Lannert: which is the secondary.

450
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:53.479
Chloe Lannert: You're working just as founding teams for a lot longer than they used to. AI, yeah, so is that- is that actually.

451
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:58.629
Chloe Lannert: is that a correlation? Is there anything actually promable? That it is because of? AI,

452
00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:12.309
Chloe Lannert: I think the change from 2022 to 2023. And again, this is when people were hired. So it's a little bit this has nothing to do, really with AI, and much more to do with founders like looking around going.

453
00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:22.269
Chloe Lannert: I don't over count like they look at all the 2021. 0, that looks terrible. Yeah, right? For sure. That's happening. Now, I think that is dead.

454
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:36.110
Chloe Lannert: And the reason I say that is because it's not just the early stages all across. So it used to be that the average series, a company on cargo had 22 employees. Now, it's 15

455
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.289
Chloe Lannert: at the end of the year. That's probably gonna be more like 13 or 20.

456
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:46.790
Chloe Lannert: That's a massive change, right? And what do you do with Vc cash? Typically, you find favorable.

457
00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:49.000
Chloe Lannert: It's the biggest use of these cash.

458
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.716
Chloe Lannert: Maybe that means that you could use

459
00:57:55.470 --> 00:58:00.649
Chloe Lannert: distribution, etc. There's a lot of creative ways to use money. But back to the Ahmad idea.

460
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:06.119
Chloe Lannert: if we could raise a big round, but not touch it, having an event

461
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:09.260
Chloe Lannert: in case of a lady who pays. That's beautiful.

462
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:13.369
Chloe Lannert: That's optional very hard to look at

463
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:15.569
Chloe Lannert: millions of dollars and not use it for

464
00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:31.349
Chloe Lannert: any other questions.

465
00:58:37.812 --> 00:58:41.860
Chloe Lannert: Thank you so much.

466
00:58:55.630 --> 00:59:01.560
Chloe Lannert: Dude. I can't.
