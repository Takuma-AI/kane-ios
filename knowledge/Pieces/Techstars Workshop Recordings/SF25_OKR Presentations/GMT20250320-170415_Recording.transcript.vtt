1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

2
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.920
Esmaeil Sadeghi: So definitely.

3
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:10.480
Esmaeil Sadeghi: So okay, let me just share my, should I share my screen? For this discussion? Just see saying like what we have done

4
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.729
Chloe Lannert: Beautiful, and we'll go like 2 to 3Â min per presentation, and then a couple of minutes for questions

5
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.020
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Okay. So something is wrong, actually, with my

6
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.350
Chloe Lannert: We can. We can see it

7
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.490
NSG: We can see. Okay, our tracking table. You can see

8
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.860
Esmaeil Sadeghi: That. Oh, okay, I don't see it myself here, and that's the problem

9
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.310
NSG: Hmm.

10
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.540
Paria: Can open in the like other screens. Mighty one

11
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.450
Esmaeil Sadeghi: That should. Yeah, exactly. So. Probably I have to just say.

12
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.850
Paria: Yes.

13
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.390
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Sorry for this. I just quickly changed my screen.

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.190
Esmaeil Sadeghi: It's okay.

15
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.579
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Screen's not working.

16
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.569
Esmaeil Sadeghi: No, it's very.

17
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.290
Esmaeil Sadeghi: How's that possible? So a few seconds I'll fix it. Now

18
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.150
NSG: Yeah, just unshare and then reshare it, and we'll fix it

19
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.887
Esmaeil Sadeghi: It's very strange. Actually, it was just working a few seconds ago. But

20
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.369
Paria: It's my neighbor was just saying that if you can like disconnect sharing and share it

21
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.390
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Yeah, yeah, the point. I I can't see that. Okay. So it seems, something is done here.

22
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.919
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, I just muted you on

23
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.790
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Okay, so.

24
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.750
Chloe Lannert: Okay, we can hear you.

25
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.410
Paria: Yes.

26
00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:52.869
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Maybe, Perry, you can. Maybe you can explain. I'll join you in a few seconds. Then

27
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.270
NSG: So, yeah, I,

28
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.840
Paria: Okay, so.

29
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.500
Esmaeil Sadeghi: I can maybe start with the mics

30
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:16.379
Paria: So like, in this like 5 issues here. So the objective of the work region here. Okay, so he's coming to my office here. So the the objective here we kind of divide in 3 sections, which is about like the market. 1st one is about like increase market adoption.

31
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:29.160
Paria: So and then this is like a category blanks to marketing assays that we defined about the milestones. Then we we have like target results deliverable. These are more about like measurable

32
00:02:30.053 --> 00:02:34.489
Paria: targets, and since a smile, I can go there

33
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.779
NSG: There's a glaring opportunity already, while it smiles on his way to your office, for I'm curious

34
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.690
Paria: The thing is, I cannot move this screen, because he already shared

35
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:51.730
NSG: Oh, it's okay. Yeah, no, no. What we're looking at right now is good enough for people to react to. But I'm really interested to hear from the founders, and how you all are reacting to the specific

36
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.330
NSG: objectives here

37
00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:08.409
Paria: Sure, yes, absolutely so. If I go to, if I go with the 1st one, which is about like more about marketing, and says so we defined it. Milestone, as a like. So number one is like validate demands for optifab solution. So and then the

38
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:20.040
Paria: for this purpose, or for this milestones. We are targeting to go with the 6 companies. Yeah, it works comes to like running pilots for like in during these 3 months.

39
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:46.440
Paria: And then, yeah, how we are going to approach to this target results. So basically, we are aiming for 40 daily messages on Linkedin, we have already started working on Linkedin, sending messages for our potential customers and then trying to implement loom, as also like working in the warming tools like through networks, and possibly from ticketstars, networks as well

40
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.820
NSG: There's

41
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.729
Paria: That would be number one.

42
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.160
Paria: Any questions here, or should I like over the second? Then we discuss it later.

43
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.080
NSG: Anyone have thoughts on the increased market adoption. Objective. First, st before moving on to the next one.

44
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.170
Paria: So, like, yeah, please.

45
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:19.480
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Yeah, yeah, so what we actually based on the information we received from Sylvia and the presentation, so on. So we have, like, 3 main objectives here, and for each of them we have, like a few milestones.

46
00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:34.049
Esmaeil Sadeghi: And for each milestones. So we have, of course, some target results, informal deliverables like something that we can really measure. And so that's really the purpose of in the our Okr here, basically

47
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.260
NSG: Yeah. So sorry to jump in. I just want to clarify. While you were heading back with us, did a great job of covering

48
00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:43.300
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Okay. So we covered

49
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.689
NSG: The 1st one's covered

50
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.180
Esmaeil Sadeghi: That's 1

51
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.650
NSG: I'm asking the group if you all want to give feedback before we move on to the second one.

52
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.409
Vivian Liu: Maybe based off of

53
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.209
Vivian Liu: like, especially after merch talk yesterday, talking about kind of scaffolding concrete, and like, you know, where they need to be

54
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.539
Vivian Liu: It's possible that.

55
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:11.159
Vivian Liu: based on what he kind of broke down at least it might be early to do like some of those things

56
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.899
Vivian Liu: on certain sales kind of targets in, you know. Maybe product and

57
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.650
Vivian Liu: you know, kind of market validation isn't concrete

58
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:53.156
Esmaeil Sadeghi: So what we think. Actually, we are putting some objective here, and then we have some target results, of course. So and we have also the approach to reach to that target results as well. But at the end of this cycle we'll see, like, what is the results. What would be the actual results. And then we get a better understanding of the gaps there, that what the lessons we have to learn like for each case, of course, some of them, as you mentioned, it's very early to to discuss it now, but we are putting some kind of like wish list, and also

59
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.560
Esmaeil Sadeghi: kind of ambitious milestones for ourselves here, and then we validate and test everything along the way

60
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:11.049
Vivian Liu: If I can, if I can add to it. I mean, it seems like it's a bit too much of a process type thing. I think some of the results.

61
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.150
Vivian Liu: They're not so much results rather than actions, you know 20 Linkedin posts.

62
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:33.110
Vivian Liu: I wouldn't consider that a result as much as it's do you mind just keeping it still so I can see it. I don't see that really, as a result, other than an action they can take. And I understand also, 10 qualified leads can be a result. But I think these are a little bit too much like

63
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.330
Vivian Liu: approaches to potentially a goal. And I think the milestone needs to be a little bit

64
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:46.711
Vivian Liu: clear in your eyes like prove market readiness for automation and increase customer engagement. I think that's subject to quite a few

65
00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:57.610
Vivian Liu: like cracks within it. So also dig deep in like what exactly is readiness, what exactly is customer engagement and establish warm introduction. I think those are really

66
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:11.800
Vivian Liu: so much milestones as they are processes. Personally, I think it's it's better to start with, like, what is the main outcome you want to achieve with with numbers as your Okrs. And then you have a separate process as to how to get there.

67
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.840
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Hmm.

68
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:38.680
Esmaeil Sadeghi: yeah. So we had this discussion together with Perio like for milestone. If it could. If he really put some numbers here to make it more clarify here. So and then what would be the point of like target results? So it's very like, kind of like, somehow, like complementary here. So we try to make it like milestone to be something really broad, really, like a kind of like a broad perspective here. So this is something that we want to reach.

69
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:52.670
Esmaeil Sadeghi: and then for target result, we put some really like a quantified, measurable target results there and then we added some extra column here in terms of how we reached this target results, basically

70
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.940
Paria: Process. That's

71
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.330
NSG: Yeah.

72
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.730
Paria: Process that we are going to talk

73
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:15.410
Esmaeil Sadeghi: This was not originally in the initial, like, tracking Okr, Okr tracking table. So we added another column here, just to show like how we are reaching to this specific target results here. And we have also timeline here, like within the next 3 months, for instance, for instance, we would be like having, like 6 companies as our like pilots.

74
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:31.020
Esmaeil Sadeghi: And if you couldn't really reach this, we do our best actually to reach reach these 6 pilots, but if it would be like 5, so there would be some gaps there. So we would be having some discussion like how what happened there and how we can improve our like process, as you mentioned, like for the next cycle

75
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:51.750
NSG: Yeah, I'd love to see you all help each other. Refine each of these more. But I'm also committed to helping you directly myself. So for each company I want to help you all chisel and get more detailed about all of the steps in between the house that you have listed here. So, for example, 6 companies commit to running pilots within 3 months.

76
00:08:52.280 --> 00:09:05.669
NSG: You know, what's our target list of companies? How many are on there. What are the steps in addition to the 40 daily messages that actually lead to that conversion? Are we talking paid pilots? Are we talking free pilots? And if we're talking paid, how much

77
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.829
NSG: and what's the goal there when it comes to commitment and timeline

78
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:38.999
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Neil. What I actually, I have realized from Okr is basically like, let's say, from Point A, we want to go to Point B, so that's really our like, kind of like Okr, but how we are going to reach that the B point, basically, it would be a lot of Kpis. We have a separate like a table for every details there like, of course. So 6 companies here. So what I I would say there are many kpis involved here. So for each each of these milestones here, we would have multiple kpis to to measure everything.

79
00:09:39.268 --> 00:09:44.909
Esmaeil Sadeghi: I think these 2 are somehow very much connected to each other. Maybe we should have a like a table together.

80
00:09:45.260 --> 00:10:03.600
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Kpi, and like Okr together to make it more like, I would say, complementary, and like more understandable. But now we, we have separated these 2. Actually. So now it's like kind of like broad objectives that we have here and how to reach those objectives in a simple manner.

81
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.380
NSG: Great. Okay, I think this is a really really good start.

82
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:26.460
NSG: and I'd love to see the the full, comprehensive laid out plan. But I think this is a decent start. I think I would re rename the objectives a little bit to add a just like slightly more specificity to what you want. So, for example, the increased market adoption one, I think, that it sounds like what you're trying to accomplish is to get

83
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:42.109
NSG: additional. You know, you know you're trying to grow like you want. You want additional revenue. And I see that in the 3rd one. So those kind of intersect and overlap a little bit, so we can figure out a better way to differentiate those objectives. Since they seem to go hand in hand

84
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.450
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Absolutely exactly.

85
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.609
Paria: That's a valid point. Yes, thanks.

86
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.320
NSG: Cool any last comments or questions from anyone before we move on to the next person

87
00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:01.910
Chloe Lannert: We are already pretty over time. So I'm gonna if no one else wants to jump in, I'm gonna tap, really. Next

88
00:11:03.814 --> 00:11:06.490
Anthony De Silva: I would need a little bit more time

89
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.609
Chloe Lannert: Okay, Meg, are you ready to go

90
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.729
Vivian Liu: Not yet happy to join in

91
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.309
NSG: What's up, guys? We're not. We're not.

92
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.170
NSG: Let's go.

93
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.400
NSG: Hold on! Wait a second, Chloe.

94
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.287
NSG: Let me make. Let me make it clear.

95
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:29.840
NSG: If you don't have them. That's okay. But we need to know that you're not ready at the at the session, and I think it's important to communicate that.

96
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.089
NSG: So just a little reminder. If anyone is coming to this, not prepared with what we've asked, it's okay. You just need to communicate it so that we know not to call on you.

97
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.680
NSG: So who's ready

98
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.020
Vivian Liu: Yeah, or

99
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.320
Chloe Lannert: Greetings, ready

100
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.950
NSG: Alright! Let's cool.

101
00:11:48.324 --> 00:11:57.510
Vivian Liu: You'll have to you if it's in-. If it's a base camp

102
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:02.799
NSG: Alright. I see that Carlo posted his in basecamp. So let's just pull up Carlo, and go with that

103
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.450
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

104
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.630
Vivian Liu: To quit

105
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.619
NSG: Anyone need help? Or do you need me to do it?

106
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.680
Vivian Liu: No, I got it.

107
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.540
NSG: Okay.

108
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.430
Vivian Liu: Leadership

109
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:30.860
Vivian Liu: go full screen chill back.

110
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.990
Vivian Liu: I think you can use the clicker, too.

111
00:12:34.606 --> 00:12:38.780
Vivian Liu: Alright cool now. The clicker doesn't work.

112
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:42.889
Vivian Liu: I'll just, I'll just come here. Alright guys.

113
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.740
Vivian Liu: Okay. So

114
00:12:47.246 --> 00:13:08.980
Vivian Liu: I've kind of started basing these off, especially after some Jtbds. I started doing. That's why I put a Tbd. And I'll explain that in a second. But my main okay are with this one is to really just establish dominance in a Dtc industry. The reason why I put Tbd of which industries because I'm sussing those out right now with the Jtbds is which ones to really focus on.

115
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.980
Vivian Liu: But I believe. To get this, I need to get like 3 enterprise level clients within the same industry

116
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:20.811
Vivian Liu: with a minimum contract of like 50 k. Each. And for me. That's usually like a yearly contract.

117
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.170
Vivian Liu: and that just means that they've stopped to us. And what I've seen from our clients that once I book that

118
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.030
Vivian Liu: yearly contract. Then they stay with us. They don't really even look for alternatives anymore.

119
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:43.109
Vivian Liu: I want to push for the 100% client satisfaction rate. And for me, that means that they're literally happy with using us. And they've documented their approval working with us.

120
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:53.819
Vivian Liu: We want to be able to reduce the production time to 48Â h. And it's something that we've seen we're able to do when there's the right flow around this. And this depend on my next Okr.

121
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.229
Vivian Liu: which is also 70% faster than the industry standard.

122
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:04.590
Vivian Liu: And we want to generate case studies that show a 3 to 5 times improvement in engagement rates with typical campaigns.

123
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:25.459
Vivian Liu: Now, my next, okay are really just to build the scalable production system. And for me, this means having a standardized workflow that can handle the content campaigns autonomously. This especially means that I reduce my personal investment by about 90% on each campaign. And that's where I want to get to ideally. I want to get to reduce my personal investment by 100

124
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:38.869
Vivian Liu: and the other part is I want to achieve 100% on time delivery rate for all projects. And I think this is significantly helped by sort of a standardized production system with the platform.

125
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:50.639
Vivian Liu: And then I also want to expand the Creator network in our main client locations by 50%. That's also dependent on our Jtbd style where to focus the Creator acquisition processes

126
00:14:51.310 --> 00:15:08.029
Vivian Liu: on my 3rd one. I know it's only one line with this, but it's based on what Matt said yesterday about the value props that are that they can give to customers right now. We mainly cut time and costs, which is good, but, he said, the best one is to demonstrate revenue increase.

127
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.950
Vivian Liu: Now the campaigns that

128
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:16.909
Vivian Liu: drive clear revenue increase are the ones that have a click through ratio objectives, whether it's a link or anything like that.

129
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:25.540
Vivian Liu: So I would like to focus on content campaigns that are aimed at driving revenue through click through rates and achieve a 2 to 3 times higher

130
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.949
Vivian Liu: return. In that

131
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:35.399
NSG: Carlo on this point is the revenue increase. Is that in your experience the primary thing that your clients want

132
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:41.679
Vivian Liu: Ultimately. Yes, because I need to justify that budgets on how advertising gets spent to

133
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.880
Vivian Liu: for them to make more money. Brand awareness is a bit of a superficial metric that they have. Ultimately, they gotta be like, okay.

134
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.129
Vivian Liu: how much for every dollar that we put into the ads? What did we get out of it?

135
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:54.380
NSG: Okay.

136
00:15:55.099 --> 00:16:02.879
NSG: Yeah. I was just curious to know how quantifiable and objective that could be to associate with your effort and support of them, and how you could tie that together

137
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.957
Vivian Liu: It'll be quite tricky, because I'd have to let you get the clients to tell me

138
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:13.319
Vivian Liu: So your past Ctr campaign. What did it drive? And what did this one with us now drive?

139
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:22.389
Vivian Liu: So I literally need to get them to tell me what the other metrics things like engagement rates. I can. We can track and scrape quite easily.

140
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:27.269
Vivian Liu: but instead, revenue increases. We'd have to get inside information for

141
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:41.790
NSG: Okay, yeah, I'd be curious to dig deeper there at some point with you, since unpacking that and understanding how they value it, how they perceive it might be really powerful to to master, because then you can communicate more effectively how you can deliver on that kind of result for them

142
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.510
Vivian Liu: Yeah, but yeah, here they are.

143
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.220
NSG: Okay, folks, any thoughts questions. Feedback for Carlos

144
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.400
Vivian Liu: Hi! It's I don't think anything.

145
00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:07.820
Vivian Liu: One question I have was, I thought, like the numbers you put in were really really impressive, like a hundred percent client satisfaction rate, for instance, is like.

146
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:17.199
Vivian Liu: really, really high, in my opinion. And 90% increase in time as well. So like, do you have any ideas already about how you're gonna do this? Or

147
00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:23.119
Vivian Liu: I think Foss is really just sticking to like the processes like we we already have.

148
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:53.310
Vivian Liu: Clients are satisfied. And I feel like we can improve it. Like right now, we said about 95%. So it's really pretty high. And yeah, so I think we can push it to 100. And literally, that means it doesn't mean that we don't mess up, but it means that they're always happy with each delivery, and all of our clients will keep calling back throughout. And then the 90% in the time saving that's that's something just gonna be reached by the platform or finishing in

149
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:59.600
Vivian Liu: June. Okay? Because that has, I get to go to chats and you go to contracts. A lot of the stuff that I'm doing manually is now being taken

150
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.390
Vivian Liu: pair of automatically

151
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:09.309
Vivian Liu: cool, and for the client satisfaction, like one of the things that I thought looking into it was like.

152
00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:29.429
Vivian Liu: if you don't have a hundred percent. But you have like a genuine thank you like, let's say, like someone who refers you, that might be even more valuable for you, right? Track referrals. Which means they, they're really, really happy rather than just like, yeah, that was cool, which is, you know different levels. I don't know how you think about this

153
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:59.459
Esmaeil Sadeghi: I have one comment here. I think, after seeing your details here. So I understand. Like what you meant, actually, commenting on our Okr. But just curious, because we had also this discussion, together with Perry like, is this like within the timeline of the text or program? Or it would go beyond that, like, what is the timeline that you are looking at like 3 months period, or like or something beyond

154
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:05.489
Vivian Liu: I'm personally pushing for a 3 month period. I know it's a little bit like ambitious, but

155
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.399
Vivian Liu: I think it's doable

156
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:18.970
Esmaeil Sadeghi: I think, for a Okr, we should be really ambitious. And then we would see, like the the bottlenecks along the process. So I think that should be great, actually having some ambitious plan

157
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.700
Vivian Liu: Who.

158
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:26.720
Chloe Lannert: Listen.

159
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.400
Vivian Liu: That's good.

160
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.670
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Neil. One question here.

161
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.380
Vivian Liu: For the same business

162
00:19:40.380 --> 00:20:07.540
Esmaeil Sadeghi: So in order to track or Okr, so do we have any like time period that we should, it would be like everyday job, like, let's say, every morning we look at our Okr and Kpi and see what is like, I think for Kpi everything would be more like detail, and we should have it like in front of us every time. But for Okr, probably we would have a longer, maybe one week, or something like that. So how do you see? Like the tracking system for reaching this? Objectives

163
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:22.409
NSG: Yeah, there's there's components of it that are daily, that are in the details. And then every week we structure Kpi sessions after winter madness for the Okrs themselves. That'll largely depend on your you know, personal situation context because the Kpis

164
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:31.499
NSG: travel up into them. So you may want to schedule some sort of regular cadence to review or discussion of them, but it may not need to be as frequent as the kpis that we already have structured

165
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.940
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Exactly that makes sense

166
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:33.840
NSG: Yeah.

167
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.440
Chloe Lannert: That's cool

168
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.550
Vivian Liu: Okay, are you taking it next?

169
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:44.430
Vivian Liu: Yeah. And that's oh, sorry.

170
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.210
Vivian Liu: Yeah, they're just looking at me, I see.

171
00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.680
Vivian Liu: Sorry.

172
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.330
Vivian Liu: All right. Our okrs are fairly straightforward.

173
00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:17.779
Vivian Liu: These are by June 2025. The 1st one at high level is most beloved way to do web data analysis. And the second is drive outside business value for teams.

174
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.500
Vivian Liu: First, st

175
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:29.229
NSG: Can we slow that one down? Can we? Can we help us understand what you mean by these 2 points? Because I think they're they're lofty, which is not bad, but I wanna make sure I understand what they mean.

176
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:41.180
Vivian Liu: Well, yeah. So basically, the 1st one is connected to retention and make it the way that people want to do this. So it's like I mean, it's explained in the next slide. But

177
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:51.890
NSG: Okay. Well, I guess even even as the statement stands, I wanna make sure it's it's explained properly because I want it to resonate. And right now I'm like, I have more questions than clarity.

178
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.159
NSG: So most would love to do. Web data analysis.

179
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.973
NSG: The sentence is playing with my head.

180
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.320
Vivian Liu: Most.

181
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:02.610
Vivian Liu: Thank you.

182
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.640
Vivian Liu: I think I just type

183
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.750
NSG: Oh, okay, got it. There's some missing words

184
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.859
Vivian Liu: Yeah, one word way, most beloved way to do web data

185
00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.200
NSG: Okay. Got it all right.

186
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.330
NSG: Keep going

187
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:20.705
Vivian Liu: Yeah, so key results essentially increase 30 day retention to 80% after running 10 harvests.

188
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:48.169
Vivian Liu: this is, yeah, I mean, extremely important. We've seen some evidence of this right now, which is why that is kind of like a number. We can go after 40% of paying customers is a superhuman thing, would be very disappointed if they could no longer use harvest plan to use a email survey to be able to run that and do that experiment. I've done it before, so I want to be able to run it again. A total of 500 K web pages extracted per month.

189
00:22:48.755 --> 00:22:50.684
Vivian Liu: That's just a raw, cumulative

190
00:22:51.370 --> 00:23:04.549
Vivian Liu: we know. Yeah, combined with the obviously one Kda use daily, active users we want. If it's too small. We know that it's kind of like it runs into the issue of, you know, we're we're susceptible to a couple of users

191
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:18.189
Vivian Liu: kind of just switching off. And then we're we're like, we're not. We're not distributed enough. And then foundationally reduce 8Â h of time gathering web data a week to 5Â min and so they can actually do it multiple times.

192
00:23:22.087 --> 00:23:30.280
Vivian Liu: We track everything through mixed panel or purely software product right now. So should be pretty straightforward to to track from a Kpi perspective.

193
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:38.750
NSG: In your experience is the second point. With 40% of pay customers, pull would be very disappointed, like meaningful

194
00:23:40.084 --> 00:23:43.479
Vivian Liu: I have. Yes, when you have enough users.

195
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:56.936
Vivian Liu: So if you don't have enough users who are responding to the survey, then basically, it's not that useful then, but you need to have at least like 50 to 100 who are responding on a on. You know what? You basically send it out.

196
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:27.129
Vivian Liu: a week to 2 weeks after they have. You can do, you can base it off of either when they sign in or when they pay, based on whatever you think is a time that you want to measure. And then one week after that, or 2 weeks after that you send them this request, and I think that it it does actually correlate, because they will tell you to keep the survey super. Simple. They'll tell you how excited they are or how they aren't but if you don't, if we don't get a threshold of like at least 50 people responding, then it's pointless

197
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:43.829
NSG: Yeah, I'm I'm not confident in that, being like something that would be particularly informative or insightful. I think more meaningfully, in my opinion, would be the engagement things that you already have listed as proxies to indicate that, and, like the utilization like the high usage, would be.

198
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.710
NSG: you know, more indicative of it. But if you know I'm I'm curious to to learn from that as you do, it

199
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:53.690
Vivian Liu: That's that's the superhuman thing. That's what kind of it's like.

200
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:54.939
NSG: I know. Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

201
00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:04.020
Vivian Liu: Yeah. So so that's I think the main thing would be like on our way. This might be earlier than some of the other metrics, so I don't. Maybe the order isn't right.

202
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:15.450
Vivian Liu: But to start measuring it early on might be a way to measure the later ones. But you might might be right that it's more of a kpi, or like a on the way than an actual result

203
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:22.870
NSG: Yeah. And my last question on this one is, is there a subgroup of customers that you are targeting?

204
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.150
NSG: Because

205
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.490
NSG: it would? It would be helpful to illuminate like, if you have a particular like segment that you want, you want to focus on right now with harvest

206
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:55.359
Vivian Liu: Yeah. So we we have. We've been working on like our cohorts, and we've spent a lot of time even defining them. We're like, hey? We don't care. However many cohorts we we want, but we want to make sure that each one is defined really carefully, and we've kind of brought it down to 5 within those 5 cohorts. We really want to target 2. And that's that's really it. We don't. We don't want to try and serve too many, because it's gonna be too hard. Those 2

207
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.330
NSG: Which are they? Yeah.

208
00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:08.090
Vivian Liu: As as of now. Are. The 1st one is teams that need to do due diligence for investment firms, investment firms that need to do due dili due diligence.

209
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.560
Vivian Liu: Oh.

210
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:33.210
Vivian Liu: and they want to use kind of a data driven way to do it. And they want to do competitive analysis bring it into their into their due diligence report essentially. And the second is essentially hedge funds who actually want to be able to drive their trading algorithms basically build trading algorithms off of harvest harvest scheduled kind of scrapes

211
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:42.189
NSG: Okay, yeah. I mean, then, this might just be the stickler in me I'd be interested in in in specifying those those 2 groups.

212
00:26:42.993 --> 00:26:53.680
NSG: Some here somewhere within here, because I think it would be helpful to see cause when I think of most beloved way to do web data analysis, it's like by who for what

213
00:26:54.698 --> 00:26:58.110
NSG: that that that extra detail is

214
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:05.279
NSG: is can sometimes be helpful because it's less vague, and it leaves less up to interpretation

215
00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.450
NSG: by whoever's involved cool

216
00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:29.469
Vivian Liu: And then the next one is kind of more about from, you know, it can be beloved. But, like, you know, Reddit struggled with actually driving business value. And so we want to make sure we're driving outside business value for teams. 1st 1, 25 k Mrr, that's around 500 K web pages per month.

217
00:27:29.849 --> 00:27:55.680
Vivian Liu: Extracted based on our current metric or based on our current subscription model. We also want to make sure that we are. We're walking up kind of from like small teams who we're targeting now to larger contracts. So we wanna we wanna have 10 contracts larger than a 5. An annual 5 K subscription signed by the end of 3 months. A a 20% conversion rate to paid customer

218
00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.350
Vivian Liu: after running. Sorry that's not supposed to be 5. That's supposed to be 15

219
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:12.940
Vivian Liu: after 15 harvests, because that's supposed to be up from the the 1010 harvests to 80% retention, and then, finally, one paid subscriptions at $30 a month. By the end of the 3 months

220
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:23.190
NSG: So this information feels like it's based on what customers are committing to you rather than their business value.

221
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.670
NSG: Where is the quantification of their business value here

222
00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.620
Vivian Liu: I understand the distinction. Yeah, I

223
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:42.880
Vivian Liu: guess I wasn't measuring it that way. That's probably fair

224
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:54.909
NSG: Yeah, like, like, I, I mean, I I like the key results. And the Kpis, you want to track right here. I'm a big fan of these for you, but this seems to have very little to do with the business value we're driving for those teams

225
00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.939
Vivian Liu: Yeah, I guess it's fair. I I

226
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.603
Vivian Liu: didn't really think about it like that.

227
00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.840
NSG: Okay. Well, my, my, my quick reaction here is like, find a way to read. Either

228
00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:22.630
NSG: split them out right and and speak on this as your like, your goal for your traction and revenue and engagement of the customer commitment, you may want to split a different one out where you think more deeply about what business value you're driving, and how to quantify that for them, and to measure that, hold yourself accountable to

229
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.130
Vivian Liu: Alright! Yes.

230
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:25.350
NSG: Cool.

231
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.900
Vivian Liu: All right.

232
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.730
Chloe Lannert: Uniform

233
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.250
Esmaeil Sadeghi: I think our

234
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.790
Chloe Lannert: Rio. We're ready

235
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.530
NSG: Alright! Wait! Smiles.

236
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:46.700
Esmaeil Sadeghi: No, no paid customers, I remember, like needs common like customers are already paying. So yes, it's redundant.

237
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.010
Vivian Liu: Yes, sir.

238
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.780
NSG: Paid customer. It's redundant

239
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.064
Vivian Liu: Yeah. Oh, yep, yep, you're right.

240
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:55.170
NSG: Good catch.

241
00:29:55.636 --> 00:29:56.570
NSG: Thank you.

242
00:30:02.211 --> 00:30:23.710
Vivian Liu: So I guess I put them in. Oh, do you want? Do you want to go next? We already put them in 2 different places we put it in the in the calendar. Invite that is on here

243
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.950
Chloe Lannert: We got it. Let's go

244
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:39.330
Vivian Liu: Wonderful great. So just as complex. Reflecting on next on yesterday, I wanted to show you our self assessment of where we are on the product market fit tower. So if you can go to the next slide.

245
00:30:39.720 --> 00:31:07.130
Vivian Liu: so that's where brio is. So on the ground floor, we think we we are. We're pretty pretty much starting to pour concrete but we're still very far from being fully blood proof, and we are hoping for textiles to really kind of help us help us get really, really to the right, on that, on the product we are. We're we're kind of more than the scaffolding stage.

246
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:28.520
Vivian Liu: We do expect a little bit of of support and kind of progress in the next 3 months, but not that much customer success. We're actually ahead of of where where we would typically want to be and we are not expecting to make any progress and repeatable sales for us. It's not the. It's not the topic.

247
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:53.299
Vivian Liu: If you can go to the next slide in terms of our Okrs, what we've thought is, we are going to kind of look at 1st month's okrs. Be super critical, crystal clear on what we want to do. We do have like broader objectives for the rest of the program, but we are keeping ourselves the opportunity to to change them as we see fit, and as we see the results of the 1st month.

248
00:31:53.340 --> 00:32:20.759
Vivian Liu: So there's really 3 objectives for the 1st month, and one that's kind of pretty much what is in here. The 1st one is to have picked a vision for brio. We currently have 2 alternatives in terms of a vision, one that is squarely focused on educational institutions, and the other one that is much more focused on the recruiting market. We need to crystallize these 2 visions and create an evaluation grid to help us pick between the 2.

249
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:28.209
Vivian Liu: So that's no progress here. But it's really kind of super urgent for us to do it. That's something that I'm accountable for.

250
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:57.870
Vivian Liu: Then we have the middle of the thing is the jobs to be done kind of objective related objective. We want to have discovered actionable, qualitative, and quantitative insights on the Us. Educational higher Ed market and specifically prospective customers. So we've done 2 things today. We've identified 10 plus Jpd interviewers. We've interviewed one. We have a few others in the pipe.

251
00:32:58.253 --> 00:33:10.280
Vivian Liu: And we have done market research and sizing for the for the market. We still have these other 2 things. You see that clearly assigned with deadlines and that's where we are.

252
00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:34.869
Vivian Liu: And the 3rd one is to have kind of really looked at the various textiles resources that we can leverage classified them and identified what we want to leverage. And that's kind of something that is also by the end of next month, one, which is by April 10th of all, or April 11, th as you can see, and that we we haven't. We've made some progress, but nothing is checked.

253
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:57.210
Vivian Liu: and then kind of broader for the if you go further in the that 3 months kind of a time horizon we do have the objective to achieve a hundred k arr, we are 60 k, at this point. So we're not that far. We think it's stretched, but not that big of a stretch. And we we are. We're kind of seeing ourselves achieving it.

254
00:33:57.584 --> 00:34:23.659
Vivian Liu: We don't. We want to have a hiring plan, which is kind of an understanding of where we are, our strengths and weaknesses. Who do we need to hire when, what format, etc, a funding plan and an investor that are ready, which doesn't necessarily mean funding achieved. It's not like, hey? When do we want to fund? And do we have what we need to fund at the right pace when we want to. To get additional funding.

255
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:43.179
Vivian Liu: And we have also, like something around vision and positioning something around product strategy and something on the advice on how to recruit. And I just wanted to kind of give you a little bit of what we call when we when we check the box, what we mean by that? So if you can move to the next slide, and I'm going to go super quick.

256
00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:56.610
Vivian Liu: This is what we call market research. So it's not that big of a of a deal. It's not a hundred page document it just. We know how many higher ed institutions there are. There are 6,000. We have their names.

257
00:34:56.959 --> 00:35:15.119
Vivian Liu: We know how much is spent on education in the Us. We have sufficient level of granularity to understand exactly how much is spent on carrier services, which is the kind of the the spend bucket that we are looking at, and we know exactly how much is spent on

258
00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:28.410
Vivian Liu: something that we could do on their behalf. And the the true result is, it's full. It's less than a hundred 1 million. Assuming you would have like 100% of the of the of the market.

259
00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:52.209
Vivian Liu: That, that would be, that would be that would be the the target we are we are focusing on. So when we see that we're thinking, Whoa, this is not that big of a market. And our initial assumption that was, Hey, we're going to start with the higher end. And then we're going to move to recruiting sounds like it's a good idea, because, it's not a billion company 1 billion dollar company right there.

260
00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:19.009
Vivian Liu: What we did also. And that's the last slide. And then I'll shut up. Is, we've also kind of decided to really look at what are the criteria that we should use to prioritize the companies or the the colleges that we are focusing on. So we've list listed all the criteria that we thought made sense. We've ranked them from the most important to the least important.

261
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:35.319
Vivian Liu: And that's what I call prioritization axes. And and then we've we've defined whether we want to prioritize them. And what is the what do we? What are we looking for? And how are we going to get that? And the good news is

262
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:59.617
Vivian Liu: we don't. I mean, we're fairly fairly happy with that list and the prioritization and we do believe that we have a good way to in a scaled way, kind of gather information that allows us to prioritize. We have the list of 6,000 companies. We just need to move them from an access database to to an actual spreadsheet.

263
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:18.659
Vivian Liu: And we do think that with all the these AI tools that that Openai has given us we can, we can gather all the information that we need to get a good sense of that. I won't bore you with the details, but that's where we are, as far as our okay? And and the 1st results.

264
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:25.070
Vivian Liu: yeah, you can. You can. This this

265
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.019
Chloe Lannert: Do you want to look at these

266
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.970
Vivian Liu: Yeah, sorry. Go ahead.

267
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:35.839
Vivian Liu: You can stop here, though. All this, all this is, yeah, stop. Thank you.

268
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:37.760
Chloe Lannert: I'm curious.

269
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.590
Vivian Liu: It's it's it's things that we. It's kind of a

270
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.869
Vivian Liu: we're scrappy, you know. We just want to show you a little bit of a

271
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.629
Vivian Liu: of something that doesn't doesn't look right?

272
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:55.110
Chloe Lannert: Alright folks any quick feedback, or are we

273
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:56.379
Vivian Liu: Just a question.

274
00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.200
Chloe Lannert: One time.

275
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.469
Vivian Liu: Any revenue targets or anything.

276
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.740
Vivian Liu: It's kind of like 100 KARR.

277
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:10.189
Vivian Liu: That's if you go back to the objectives we want to achieve a hundred KI mean, we are 60 K. Right now.

278
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.929
Vivian Liu: By the end of the 3 months

279
00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.580
Vivian Liu: I think you guys can do a lot more

280
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.570
Vivian Liu: sorry. I think you can do better.

281
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:25.789
Vivian Liu: Yeah, yeah, it's it's I think you're already at 60 K,

282
00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:45.380
Vivian Liu: we, just I mean, Alex is the principal salesperson, and a lot of this time we are spending on on jobs to be done on this program, etc. What we're seeing is that we're our kind of our prospecting activities are going down right now.

283
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.530
Vivian Liu: as far as volume is concerned.

284
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:59.940
Vivian Liu: Well, likely I don't want to get

285
00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.789
NSG: Can Alex speak closer to the mic

286
00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:26.710
Vivian Liu: Yeah, sure. So what I was saying is that, yeah, prospecting is is down, of course, probably much so during the 1st weeks of programs. I will see afterwards after the mental madness, if maybe that picks it up a bit. The other thing is sales. Cycles are really long, which makes it a bit unpredictable to forecast AR. That's that's just it. Oh, to me.

287
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.720
Vivian Liu: yeah, okay, okay, well, I I'm

288
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:42.270
NSG: I'm grateful that you guys are are utilizing like I. I went into most of your base camps and added, like what I saw from the goal setting. And it seems like this is like a you're building upon that and adding more detail to some of these which is great.

289
00:39:42.570 --> 00:40:05.479
NSG: Before the achieve 100 k. Arr that encore was asking about. I would love to see that built out more right. The how right? What? What are the initiatives. What are the milestones? What are the components to actually achieving that? I and I totally understand the load balancing that you all are doing because you're gonna learn a lot during techsar. So it may not make sense to stay as aggressive as you were before this.

290
00:40:05.717 --> 00:40:19.740
NSG: With some of these targets. But I think I can be the most helpful to you all if you do what you did for you know the the 2 that you have, or the 3 that you have at the top here, and do that for the rest of these as well, if that's helpful to you.

291
00:40:20.175 --> 00:40:22.539
NSG: But I would love to refine that further.

292
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:30.499
Vivian Liu: Yeah. And and we we haven't. We haven't ported it here, but we do have like a a pipeline with like, how many calls

293
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:30.820
NSG: Cool.

294
00:40:31.172 --> 00:40:42.789
Vivian Liu: We do have the pipeline view. We shared it actually with the, you know. I think we added it in the in our assignment. But we yeah, we'll do it. Thanks, team. That's

295
00:40:42.790 --> 00:41:00.750
NSG: Yeah, sure, no problem. And then, by the way, I also want to commend you all for already taking initiative to like plot yourself on the product market fit tower. I think that's really cool. It's something I'm I'm already committed to doing with all of you, anyway. But the fact that you all just took it and ran with it already is really cool. So I'm I'm glad you did that, and I'm curious to know

296
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:11.839
NSG: what detail you have associated with your placement on each of these, you know lines, so you don't have to say it now. But I would love to go through that with you sometime, and just talk it out to learn

297
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.410
Vivian Liu: We'll go through it happy to

298
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:24.910
Vivian Liu: any other question or comments we are. We love to be criticized. It does. You have critical comments? So thank you.

299
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:29.839
NSG: All good. We'll we'll have to speed. Run. Whoever is left. We have about 15Â min

300
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:32.340
Vivian Liu: Okay.

301
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.419
NSG: I think. Meg raised her hand for going

302
00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:40.400
Vivian Liu: Okay. I've just been going up and down because I'm not by the my left

303
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.360
NSG: No, it's okay.

304
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.510
Vivian Liu: Alright. You can go ahead.

305
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.240
Vivian Liu: That's I'm fine, either way.

306
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:49.225
Vivian Liu: I've been ready since the beginning. Let's go.

307
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.560
Vivian Liu: Can you guys hear me?

308
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:54.760
Chloe Lannert: No.

309
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:55.850
NSG: Yeah, we can

310
00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:26.299
Vivian Liu: Okay, cool. So I did my excel sheet instead of a slide. But basically, looking at the 3 different categories based on people on our team. Our very 1st one is, we want to make sure that we're meeting with the right product, because right now we kind of are trying to pick between products. So we want to be able to, you know, refine from the jobs we've done, pick the right market, and we'll know that also by 70% of the meetings are going from 1st meeting to the second meeting.

311
00:42:26.643 --> 00:42:38.249
Vivian Liu: and then once we have picked our lead product and we looked on our jobs to be done. We want to refine our messaging on our website. And ultimately we want to be able to close $75,000 of revenue into 2,

312
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.599
Vivian Liu: so that second quarter

313
00:42:41.029 --> 00:43:03.770
Vivian Liu: and then for product wise, we kind of have some things already in the works that we're committed to delivering so like for our pro, our customers, they need for us to be able to have sub accounts, and then that translates into the new product that ringcentral paying for us to create, which is the segments product. And then we need to get our stock, too, so we can stop losing in it.

314
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:30.720
Vivian Liu: So those are what's happening. Product, wise. And then for customer success. There's kind of 3 things we need to work on. So obviously enabling the teams on the new innovations and the new products and then launching workflows that are basically hooks to get remind users to come back in to the product. And then, 3rd is creating these reports to go to the manager so that way the managers can drive adoption from the top down.

315
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:46.540
Vivian Liu: So ultimately, the big goal is that we want to have 90% monthly active users from our paid users. That's the big thing that we really care about, because that's gonna you know. If you have active users from your paid users, then you'll be able to reduce churn

316
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.279
NSG: Great Meg, how do you think about

317
00:43:54.400 --> 00:44:04.899
NSG: the the, the objective of solidifying product market fit like? How? How like? I'm not sure if I even know what that means. So I I would love to get your perspective on that

318
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:21.110
Vivian Liu: Yeah. So basically, I feel like product market fit is kind of being pulled in multiple directions. And right now, I don't know which one to leave with. Right? So it's more like product marketing, messaging right? But like, basically, there's a couple of different ones I'm trying to pick from between. And I want to like.

319
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:43.429
Vivian Liu: be solid in my answer that this is the right one, and confident in the way that I figure out which one is the right one to lead with so that's kind of where it's like, okay, I'm going to evaluate. I basically want to do 2 jobs to be done right with like 15 for each, like 30 questions, customers, right? And I want to be able to pick between the 2 based on the data and the research

320
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:52.420
NSG: Okay, so that might need to be re renamed in my view. Then, because I think solidified Pmf. And close 75 K. Seems like a

321
00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.960
NSG: look. I like the 75 k. Part, I think, solidified. Pmf is

322
00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:08.600
NSG: kind of nascent to me, based on what you just said, and something more specific is I. I've heard you say this before I read this when I was looking through your materials, you're trying to choose between 2 potential pathways that you're seeing right?

323
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:16.390
NSG: So there might be a version of this that that explains that a a little bit more clearly. But I but I see where you're going with it.

324
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.359
NSG: I'll let other people weigh in since I'm gonna spend plenty of time after this on this

325
00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:30.600
Vivian Liu: And then I have broken down by month here as well.

326
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:38.559
Vivian Liu: You mind just going back to the like main. Okay? Us. Yeah. I think, like

327
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:44.009
Vivian Liu: at least passing. I don't know if it's my wrong approach around objectives and stuff.

328
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:49.510
Vivian Liu: but I think with objectives there should always be some kind of like tangible

329
00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:58.070
Vivian Liu: metric to it is like improve customer adoption. I know you've got the 90% like monthly active users and those ones. But it's like.

330
00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.750
Vivian Liu: you know, what is.

331
00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:09.909
Vivian Liu: what is that type of customer? Who are you really going for? And it's like, I think, okay, I was, get to be broader and more like harder to achieve. But I think they should still be

332
00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:16.520
Vivian Liu: kind of specific in that sense. It's also saying, like, we launch new product segments. I don't know. There's like

333
00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:18.810
Vivian Liu: some numbers to it, but it's like.

334
00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:29.499
Vivian Liu: what process segments. How long is that? Gonna take part of?

335
00:46:30.436 --> 00:46:40.080
Vivian Liu: Always feel like with okrs, or something like the main one needs to have some like

336
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:51.079
Vivian Liu: clear one sort of number you're aiming for, and then, like there could be the smaller bits to it that's like, build the blocks up to it. But I mean, that's my I don't know if I'm just like

337
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:52.930
Vivian Liu: saying the wrong things

338
00:46:53.320 --> 00:47:00.620
NSG: So I mean, you guys should all weigh in and and help each other with this. I I'm inclined to agree with your comments.

339
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.519
Vivian Liu: I I would. Yeah, I I feel like launch new products might be a milestone.

340
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:16.979
Vivian Liu: Because that that is a really important milestone. But I guess the way I'm curious about is like, what is that going to drive for the business

341
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:42.600
Vivian Liu: in that objective? I guess you've made it a product objective. I'm not sure. But like, yeah, like, you know, if it's like, is it going to drive revenue and retention? Yeah. So those products? Yeah, so like sub accounts relates to the monthly active users, right? Because the sub-accounts what the users are requesting sock 2 relates to revenue, because that's we've gotten killed in it before, and then segments leads to revenue as well.

342
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:50.899
Vivian Liu: So it's kind of product is a little bit different, because it's pulled between the different ones right. But, like ultimately, we want to have.

343
00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.670
Vivian Liu: they're deliverable, too. But still

344
00:47:54.980 --> 00:48:00.030
Vivian Liu: I think it is. What is the main objective that launching those new products will take you to

345
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.060
NSG: Correct.

346
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:07.140
Vivian Liu: Yeah, basically, I think it's all actually great. Just maybe you actually only have 2 objectives, which is great.

347
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:11.329
Vivian Liu: And then, you know, launch. New product is just a milestone of

348
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.239
Vivian Liu: like Number One or number 2. And then that's that's that's awesome.

349
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:25.200
NSG: I think that's a really helpful and important distinction to make right, because the the launch is a byproduct of the other 2 that are split out there.

350
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.719
NSG: But by achieving the launch, Meg, you'll have

351
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.489
NSG: those 2 making progress so it could be a step towards them.

352
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:33.850
NSG: Does that make sense

353
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:38.880
NSG: great? Start

354
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:44.180
Anthony De Silva: I can go next

355
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:45.220
NSG: Let's do it.

356
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.100
Chloe Lannert: Truthful.

357
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.870
Anthony De Silva: Alright.

358
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:54.194
Anthony De Silva: So

359
00:48:55.310 --> 00:49:04.250
Anthony De Silva: What I did was I started with, I work back from backwards from our goal, setting packet where where we had the 90 day goals

360
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:09.410
Anthony De Silva: and looked into what our action plan should be for each of those goals,

361
00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:25.109
Anthony De Silva: and and like the key results of each of those so divided into sales, product and other our ultimate goal with like with everything that we're doing is to get to 20 K of revenue monthly.

362
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:50.850
Anthony De Silva: So, and we think we can achieve that through signing 3 brokerages, brokerage deals for that process. We are currently conducting interviews like the jobs to be done. Interviews post that we will ramp up our reach, out efforts through Linkedin. Cold, reach out cold, reach out, and then, like brokerage in person. Meetings we aim to get to 5

363
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:57.209
Anthony De Silva: in person meetings weekly with these brokerages. And hopefully like close

364
00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.270
Anthony De Silva: 3 of them by the end of 3 months.

365
00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:17.100
Anthony De Silva: then we also want to expand our product to adjacent industries. So we identified like insurance companies and list listing services are consumers. It could be potential consumers of the data that we collect?

366
00:50:17.636 --> 00:50:25.120
Anthony De Silva: Especially like insurance companies already doing external inspections. Is there an opportunity for us to like sell this data to them.

367
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:45.568
Anthony De Silva: So that's in sort of like the market development area. That's something that we need to explore. We will do that post our like focusing, focusing on, like, the the initial sales efforts through brokerages first, st and then this market discovery or customer discovery. It would be our next

368
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.209
Anthony De Silva: objective that trying we're trying to do

369
00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:50.035
NSG: Okay,

370
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:57.266
Anthony De Silva: So, yeah, with that, I think we will also conduct jobs to be done with that category of

371
00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.780
Anthony De Silva: the

372
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:04.819
Anthony De Silva: for pocs, like, once we discover who they are and like what level we need to reach out to.

373
00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.490
Anthony De Silva: So that's in the pipeline of things to do.

374
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:09.830
Anthony De Silva: Then

375
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:16.079
NSG: I skipped ahead because I wanted to. Sorry to jump in. I just wanna make sure we we have time to to

376
00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:16.520
Anthony De Silva: Good.

377
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:24.380
NSG: Because this all makes sense. The one like line. As an example that I would call out here is like, improve user engagement, stickiness of sales.

378
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:46.450
NSG: and the result is you launching the Mvp. And then the action plan is like the core features being finalized. I feel like there's room for some sort of detail around engagement, and how you're gonna drive it there, because if you talk about engagement and stickiness of sales, but then we're just talking about rolling out features. How do we actually layer in the details of what you're going to do to drive that engagement in that? And and retention

379
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:59.429
Anthony De Silva: My point of view is like having the app itself like, if you're able to install the app on a real test phone, I think that would drive stickiness itself, because right now they're like they're only

380
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.750
NSG: Hope.

381
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:00.300
Anthony De Silva: Oh!

382
00:52:00.533 --> 00:52:14.069
NSG: That's a hope. So I guess I'm trying to like get you to to lay out here, and we don't have to do it right now. But my challenge to you is for this one line. If we do it, we can apply it to that help that hold that same line of thinking to everything else here.

383
00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.960
NSG: what are you in control of? Aside from shipping the feature

384
00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.570
NSG: that allows you to influence that engagement

385
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:33.790
Anthony De Silva: I think, talking, talking to talking to the users right? So talking to users meeting with the realtors. That's why I like meeting with brokerages and being able to present the the product that we have

386
00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:41.690
Anthony De Silva: is key. So that's like our top goal. And like everything that else that else that we do with the product. It's it's something that we're going to show in.

387
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.819
Anthony De Silva: And if we're able to

388
00:52:43.820 --> 00:53:00.750
NSG: This reminds me, this reminds me of like I alluded to a conversation I had with Jake and Bob Mesa in Detroit of a week or so before you guys start a program. And I was talking to Jake. And we figured out that 85 of his percent of the user sign up for his app, you know, end up turning and don't come back.

389
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:11.010
NSG: I feel like there's things you're gonna learn about your users as they engage with this that are going to illuminate ideas and opportunities for you to drive greater retention and engagement.

390
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:16.290
NSG: and you all might be able to as a as a group, because you all know this way better than any of us on this call.

391
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:22.460
NSG: What are some of those potential hypothesis for what that might be what those engagement drivers might be the levers.

392
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:31.020
NSG: But I want you to think one layer deeper here for each of the action plan steps, because I think you guys have a huge opportunity to be really, really scientific in your approach?

393
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:34.409
NSG: Does that make sense? Anthony?

394
00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:44.380
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, yeah, I think, yeah, with the the features. Yeah, features were like an action plan in in the product. But I understand what you're saying, yeah.

395
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:50.919
NSG: This is this is, this is relatively clear, though, and and I think for category for other. It sounds like that's fundraising

396
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.840
Anthony De Silva: Yeah.

397
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:56.110
Vivian Liu: You know I had a question about you said to be more scientific.

398
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:57.000
NSG: Yeah.

399
00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.590
Vivian Liu: What? Do you mean?

400
00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:00.780
Vivian Liu: Like.

401
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:07.100
Vivian Liu: yeah, can you break down of what you mean? Maybe like, do you mean like tracking specific Kpi metrics, or something? Or is it like

402
00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:12.449
NSG: Yeah, yeah, like, like. So launching features for me is is almost like half the job.

403
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:17.950
NSG: Right? I launched the features. But it's okay that that's supposed to drive engagement and stickiness.

404
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:28.860
NSG: What do I mean by that like? Which feature am I launching? That, I hope, does? What job? And how am I actually gonna make sure that that feature is engaged with properly? Because right now I'm I'm guessing that these are gonna work.

405
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:43.819
NSG: But I'm not putting I'm not taking charge of my own destiny, or at least in written form here, I'm sure Anthony and Team have already thought about what I'm asking about. They just didn't put it on this page, right? So I'm asking to see it a little bit more in detail, because I think that's

406
00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:53.399
NSG: this process becomes scientific. If you actually have those different inputs in some sort of documented, measurable way that you can. Leverage.

407
00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.169
NSG: does that make sense encore

408
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:56.030
Vivian Liu: Yep.

409
00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.310
NSG: Great. Yeah, that's fine.

410
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:03.030
Anthony De Silva: Yeah. Sorry.

411
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:24.110
NSG: Yeah, I think I I know we're at time. So I guess my ask would be for the rest of the folks who have submitted theirs. If you make sure that it's in the document or in that in that. Okay, our folder. I'll commit to reviewing each of them and engaging with you all on them separately from this but we can also set up individual time to discuss them and and go in more detail.

412
00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:36.840
NSG: and for those of you who already presented, and you got feedback. If you have any updates to them, and you want another look from others along with myself. Let's also do that, too. But this is a great start, like we all need to be bought in on each other's objectives.

413
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:48.229
NSG: Right? So I wanna make sure that we all have that awareness and buy in. And I think this is a step in the right direction. Some are further along than others, but for the most part

414
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:54.580
NSG: I was not in my head along with all of you. So I'm I'm rooting for you, and I'm down to help you all accomplish each of them.

415
00:55:56.650 --> 00:56:00.359
NSG: I'll hang around for other questions. I don't have an immediate meeting right after this

416
00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:02.930
Vivian Liu: Thank you.

417
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:04.060
NSG: Otherwise we'll see you in a bit

418
00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:04.620
Chloe Lannert: So.

419
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:05.495
Vivian Liu: Thanks.
