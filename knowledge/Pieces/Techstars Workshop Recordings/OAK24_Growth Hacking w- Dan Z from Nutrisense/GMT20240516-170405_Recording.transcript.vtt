1
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.430
Dan: I'll tell you guys, maybe a funny story about Neil and I, when I was in techstars.

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.640
Dan: So I don't know if you guys have this rule where you have to get a T-shirt

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.865
Dan: to make a T-shirt for your company during texts. For the first couple of weeks.

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We don't have that rule anymore. But yes, we.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.469
Dan: Oh, really. So we had this. We had this rule where everyone had to have a T-shirts.

6
00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:24.760
Dan: Like the first couple of weeks. Maybe there was like a requirement to start and text ours.

7
00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:27.399
Dan: We finish techstars.

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:45.070
Dan: and we still didn't get a T-shirt for 3 years like it took us. I think it was literally 3 years later. We're like 120 people in that point where it's probably some T-shirts with Logos on it, because we had no swag period first 3 years, and then Neil was always asking, Where's your T-shirt? There's a every company would have T-shirts. No, in person. At that point they were coming to their T-shirts. We just didn't have anything

9
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.029
Dan: because we didn't think it was critical that point in time.

10
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.715
Dan: Oh, sorry, Neil, I could get you one if you want.

11
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.710
Dan: maybe, Chloe, if you don't mind just pinging, Diane, she'll send in the old one.

12
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.280
Dan: I'm probably gonna forget.

13
00:00:58.988 --> 00:01:05.629
Dan: But yes, 3 years later we got finally got teachers and swag because we, it turns out having swag does not sell

14
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.630
Dan: to people, and your customers don't care if you have swag or not.

15
00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:14.539
Dan: And I think it's important to remember things that matter to customers and to your business.

16
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.650
Dan: It's a nice to have, I think swag is cool, and now we have really nice swag. We pay like

17
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.310
Dan: $100 for T-shirts sometimes, but at that point in time didn't, was not critical for design swag.

18
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.279
Dan: And so I think really, it's important to remember

19
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.760
Dan: what is truly critical, what is not critical.

20
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.230
Dan: There's a lot of things are nice to have.

21
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.340
Dan: but you get a lot of advice from a lot of people. It just doesn't matter.

22
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.730
Dan: And so I think

23
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.249
Dan: the first I'll tell you before we get started is

24
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.130
Dan: the most difficult part for you guys as founders is this.

25
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.750
Dan: who do you listen to? And certain advice for certain advice. And when

26
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.280
Dan: so, a lot of people, a lot of investors, other founders the reason they've gotten this far lives are very confident. They speak very confidently

27
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.659
Dan: a lot of times. They don't know what they're talking about, but they, the sphere close goes in different directions. So, for example.

28
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.019
Dan: if you have a question about marketing to me. I'll probably pretty good at that.

29
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.920
Dan: Do you have a question about engineering?

30
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.240
Dan: I don't know anything about engineering. They're little.

31
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.420
Dan: but I'm still probably gonna answer just because I got like answering questions.

32
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.140
Dan: and you might misunderstand it. And so you should always say, like, Who's the person you go for what topic?

33
00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:22.619
Dan: Because many, many people will give answers for topics they have no idea about.

34
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.610
Dan: and they may drive their own directions, always ask like, is this the right person for this topic or not?

35
00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:32.229
Dan: That is biggest. One of the biggest lessons I've had from this career is that

36
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.709
Dan: I've taken advice from topics that from people that didn't really know that topic at all.

37
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.910
Dan: But they spoke very confidently, and they might have been a billionaire or a hundred millionaire. And then they're all.

38
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.739
Dan: And I did that and been working. And they're like, Oh, I've never actually done that. I had team people doing that.

39
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.440
Dan: and so be careful that

40
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.000
Dan: the second part, a question for you, were you on system.

41
00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:06.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Dan. Sorry I wanted to ask you something about that. When did you realize that that was happening? Because I I feel the exact same way, and people get pissed off because I tell them how much I don't know when they ask me questions. But like, when did you actually learn that lesson, maybe in in a way that like stuck with you.

42
00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:19.969
Dan: When I have hired basically. So like, I would give these advisor mentors. And they were like world experts in something. And I would hire them paying a lot of money and spend $100,000, and they brought no value.

43
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.390
Dan: Right? And you're like, how do you person who's literally a world expert like, literally like

44
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.409
Dan: celebrity status and product design product engineering, whatever that topic is.

45
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.259
Dan: And after them you pay them half a million dollars. You get nothing.

46
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.970
Dan: And you're like, Whoa, was that

47
00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:41.569
Dan: and we're actually one of the ones that didn't spend that much comparally to other people. So

48
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.850
Dan: that was a really home-hitting device advice.

49
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.750
Dan: And then the second part is also.

50
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.710
Dan: as you get introduced to more and more smart people.

51
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.279
Dan: One of the things I really started doing is

52
00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:07.582
Dan: trying to do 2 things. One is just look at their background, really like value at who they are more than anything else, like what they've accomplished with. They are looked at Linkedin background. So it's not just like, Oh, I sold the come for 100 billion like, what was your role in my company before you sold it. If you're an investor, were you ever an operator?

53
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.260
Dan: and so that's number one. Number 2 is also.

54
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.459
Dan: when you have a couple smart people get in the room and ask a topic at 11 debate.

55
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.409
Dan: And when you have those people debate with each other, you start seeing wait who actually makes more logical sense.

56
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.519
Dan: It actually helps you kind of get dots oftentimes, historically, before, when you have like 4 people in the room, and I'll present they will nip.

57
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.189
Dan: but they pick different things that I didn't understand. But now, instead, I'd say, Okay, here's a topic.

58
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.139
Dan: Once you, I'll go one at a time across the room, and you guys will answer that question, and

59
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.549
Dan: I will then

60
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:47.479
Dan: see the differences and then ask him where the differences are and watching them debate with each other and realizing the nuances makes you realize, like, wait, this person's incredible at.

61
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.730
Dan: let's say, fundraising, but only from venture capital. But this person incredible fundraising from private equity.

62
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.260
Dan: That's a very different nuance. Actually, it sounds silly. There's this person incredible fundraising from debt, from banks.

63
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:06.060
Dan: It sounds like a small thing. We always think fundraising. You're good or bad at it. But those are different fundraising types, right? And actually, incredibly different skills.

64
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.119
Dan: even though it sounds like fundraising. It's a very broad term, and you could do the same thing with every topic you can think about

65
00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:19.560
Dan: and marketing. There's like 50 different things around marketing that they're they're different skill sets completely. And there's different levels of sophistication.

66
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.280
Dan: does that help clarify?

67
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.199
Dan: I know this is way off topic of

68
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.860
Dan: girl hiking. But I wanted to make sure that you guys look at that and understand it, because

69
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.720
Dan: I will say some things and some things. I'm

70
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.200
Dan: probably 10 out of 10 something, but probably a 6 out of 10.

71
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.509
Dan: But I'm speaking very confidently, because I probably had too much coffee, and I wanna make sure that you guys don't

72
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.080
Dan: misinterpret and say like, is this a topic I can trust Dana or not?

73
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.209
Dan: Is this applicable to me or not. And as you speak to other

74
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.989
Dan: founders, investors, presenters always ask like.

75
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.830
Dan: Is this the right topic or not? And is the person I should trust on this topic.

76
00:05:54.685 --> 00:05:59.809
Dan: So that's number one, number 2 before you get started. Are you guys fundraising now? Or where are you guys in your journey of techsters?

77
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Demo days in 2 weeks.

78
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.929
Dan: Nice. How's fundraising? Going? Easy? Medium, hard.

79
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We advise most of them not to start their process until afterwards. Some of them are actively having conversations.

80
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I don't know if they're having a good or bad time, if it's hard or not. But I'll let them say that maybe tune Day wants to say that.

81
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:44.245
Tunde IO : Oh, no, but I had a question about what Dan just said about when you cause like, when to know if the person you're speaking to is giving good advice. My experience, especially from techstars. And the mentors, the mentors that we speak to. Similar to what Neil said, is, what if they don't know something that we're like? Yo, I'm not an expert at this, but this is my 2 cents, and so

82
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.849
Tunde IO : the the most people that we've spoken to are like that. But there's some like you said done that kind of just like tram bullshit just because

83
00:06:51.090 --> 00:07:09.999
Tunde IO : they can. They like to speak. So. What I'm trying to. What I think I've passed from what you're saying is that the framework that you use is number one, check the background and number 2, if you can have them debate each other. And I think from the perspective that we come a lot of us on in on this call we might not be able to have that second option where we have

84
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:21.534
Tunde IO : 2 incredible, incredible people kind of debate each other to determine who is who knows what they're saying? So are there other kind of tips or tricks that you've used historically when you're at our stage

85
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.906
Tunde IO : that would help you pass out. Who? Who knows what they're saying rather than someone that's just like talking.

86
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.070
Dan: I think

87
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.780
Dan: I would make the mentor meetings. I don't know if you guys have already finished or not as

88
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.830
Dan: 0 advice from them. And you learning about them.

89
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.390
Dan: So if you meet 20 mentors, I would say, Okay, I'm going to assume that 3 of those be super helpful, and 17 are going to be neutral or negative

90
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.529
Dan: toward the value for us, for me. So I'm going to spend time and understand who they are. And so an example.

91
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.330
Dan: someone said, Okay, Ipo, at a company, I'm a founder of Ipo company. That's amazing.

92
00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:17.619
Dan: What was your role there? Okay, I was a CTO. Okay, were you involved in fundraising. They're gonna say, of course, what did you do in fundraising? And you keep double clicking until you understand exactly what they did right? Was it? They're the ones that raised money, or was it their maybe the Cpo. Or the CEO, or the Cfo. Who's the one to raise money? Because in every company. The titles at the early stage don't actually matter

93
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:28.179
Dan: right? And so you don't actually don't know. So you have to find out like, were they around. The person did the job or the ones that did it. Because what happens? There's this like selection bias of everyone that wins.

94
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.689
Dan: You assume they're geniuses, but a lot of people. Honestly, we're just right at place the right time that happens a lot in life.

95
00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.710
Dan: And so you asking a question of like, Okay, what did you do?

96
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.100
Dan: Oh, can you tell me how you started? Can you tell me how you did it? And you keep going deeper and deeper, deeper.

97
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.499
Dan: and you'll quickly realize, like, were they just there or not? And I think that really helps you understand it. And if they were just there.

98
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.959
Dan: you kind of put them aside and say, Okay, great. And if they were the ones that did it, then you dive into that topic.

99
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.329
Dan: I will say that I think most of these people

100
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.499
Dan: have incredible insight. You just got to figure out on what topic

101
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:06.889
Dan: and named themselves probably don't have self-awareness to realize, like, I'm an incredible designer. Maybe I'm not so good at marketing.

102
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.989
Dan: but I like talking about marketing because it's cool.

103
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:17.250
Dan: And so you have to go deeper on it. Realize maybe marketing is not their skill set, but design is. And how do you then pivot to design and start double clicking, and out with them.

104
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.929
Dan: Will I help Clarks?

105
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.329
Tunde IO : It does. Yeah, thanks. Dad.

106
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.150
Dan: Yep.

107
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.750
Dan: any other questions.

108
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:34.389
Dan: But I'll tell you guys this, I mean, I think the part that's incredibly important. I need you guys go through fundraising texts. And it's hard and stuff's hard, right? And what you guys are doing is incredibly rare.

109
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.830
Dan: The part that you have to prepared for is a lot of rejection.

110
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.750
Dan: and the reduction hurts.

111
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.269
Dan: But the way I viewed it, and it's very true, and more and more times past more realize that

112
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.769
Dan: you guys are actually the

113
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.830
Dan: the unique talent

114
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.719
Dan: meaning like, you guys, are the limiting factor of so limiting factor of innovation.

115
00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.120
Dan: There is a lot of money people in the world.

116
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.189
Dan: There's more money in the world to be given out.

117
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.670
Dan: but they don't have place to give out.

118
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:04.940
Dan: So

119
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:13.560
Dan: as you have 100. 150. So 50 people tell you. No, no, no. And you think, oh, they went to Harvard. And they, you know, they run a million 1 billion dollar fund

120
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.040
Dan: doesn't actually matter

121
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.200
Dan: right?

122
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.679
Dan: So these speakers, people

123
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.940
Dan: number one is, I would always say, if they've never operated a company, and they're purely money people

124
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:29.840
Dan: already. I would kind of not take them as seriously, and I wouldn't be offended by their opinions. But Number 2, even if they have

125
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:36.299
Dan: again, they've now pivoted to a different world of investment. And, like, you guys, are really the talent

126
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.350
Dan: like, there is not enough entrepreneurs in the world

127
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.159
Dan: for the monetization needs to happen.

128
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.400
Dan: And so

129
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:53.200
Dan: I mean techstars and other orgs like creating immense value by making giving you guys opportunities shine. And I think that you have to remember that, like, you guys, are literally the unique people, not them.

130
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.610
Dan: And so don't let opinions, their opinions, you know, impact you

131
00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.909
Dan: the way. View the world

132
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.250
Dan: cool.

133
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.819
Dan: Alright. Let's get started on

134
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.159
Dan: growth hacking.

135
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.140
Dan: I'll share my screen again and then feel free. Jump in.

136
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.599
Dan: and then any point in time

137
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:24.030
Dan: ask questions. My slides are very basic. You guys probably know 99% of the stuff. So really, goal goal goal of this is just to get you guys to start thinking and asking questions.

138
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.020
Dan: So

139
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.260
Dan: had this.

140
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.010
Dan: can you guys see my screen?

141
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.860
Dan: Yep.

142
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.300
Dan: I'll just.

143
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.170
Andy iphone: Yes, ma'am.

144
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:45.850
Dan: I'm sorry.

145
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.020
Dan: Alright. So who am I?

146
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.870
Dan: Right?

147
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:58.180
Dan: I graduate. Tech starts 2020, April 2020. This is the covid year. So we did half tech stars in person, half online. Actually.

148
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.560
Dan: So that was interesting.

149
00:12:00.137 --> 00:12:03.259
Dan: Started this coat, this company with 2, my co-founders.

150
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:10.800
Dan: And prior to starting this I had 0, literally 0 marketing experience, like, I didn't know anything at all.

151
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:16.290
Dan: And I grew up revenue to 2.7 million in 37 months.

152
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.480
Dan: 2.7 million a month, so not a year, a month.

153
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.930
Dan: and

154
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.250
Dan: 100 DK. Of revenue with 0 marketing budget

155
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.459
Dan: a month again.

156
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.410
Dan: Right?

157
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.270
Dan: And so

158
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.629
Dan: what I'm trying to get to guys in the end marketing

159
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.570
Dan: isn't that brain surgery?

160
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.519
Dan: It's not sunny rocks into space.

161
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.500
Dan: It's a very solvable problem.

162
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.470
Dan: You just need to figure out how to solve it.

163
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.940
Dan: And if you guys are here, every one of you guys can do it.

164
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.139
Dan: Any questions on this slide.

165
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:51.610
Dan: cool.

166
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.060
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yes, I do. Hi, Dan.

167
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.519
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: How did you? How do you do that

168
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:04.490
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: organic growth with the the 2 points that I mean the 150 monthly revenue with 0 marketing budget.

169
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.790
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: How do you do that?

170
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:13.299
Dan: Sure. I don't know who's speaking, but that's fine. Basically it was 3. It was 3 for me. It was 3 things

171
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.260
Dan: take Grant to us 5 years ago.

172
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.410
Dan: So the way we start his company

173
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.210
Dan: is my co-founder, Alex. He was a CTO. To different company before they they sold.

174
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.780
Dan: and he told me, have this cool idea

175
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.529
Dan: to start a company in a healthcare space.

176
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.119
Dan: Do you know anything about

177
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:37.699
Dan: confuse, glucose monitors? And I said, Yeah, I know a lot. I know a lot about them, because my sister's type one diabetic.

178
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.660
Dan: I've also worked with healthcare consulting.

179
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:45.369
Dan: And so I told them. But I think it's a stupid idea. Let's do a little rock paper scissors with a different idea I have.

180
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.440
Dan: and the Hr. Space. So we rock paper scissors.

181
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.960
Dan: He won.

182
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.140
Dan: So we decided to do. His idea first is not my idea. This is his idea.

183
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.790
Dan: And so you guys said, Cool.

184
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.570
Dan: what's the next step, I said, I guess I'll quit my job so I couldn't my job.

185
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.520
Dan: and

186
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.030
Dan: it hit me when I realized, what are we doing now? And he said, Well, do you want to build or sell?

187
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:16.039
Dan: And asked them would build what that software? I do not know how to write software. So finance and finance got background. So you said, you gotta sell and sell sell what

188
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.970
Dan: he's like, a product like, what's our product? He's like what doesn't exist yet.

189
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.690
Dan: So

190
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.630
Dan: I don't know how to sell.

191
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.959
Dan: I don't know what a product doesn't exist yet. What am I doing

192
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:35.230
Dan: first? I took a good deep breath and walked around the street thinking, Wow, the fuck that I quit my job because I got paid really? Well before this.

193
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.070
Dan: And then I said, Okay, let's go try this out.

194
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.940
Dan: And my first tab is actually go to Google and say how to market on an Internet

195
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.080
Dan: and

196
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.010
Dan: download a bunch of resources

197
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.470
Dan: and a bunch of things and to start to combine a big excel file of all the ways to market Internet, Google ads, Facebook ads.

198
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.590
Dan: Instagram, Youtube, Tiktok Twitter.

199
00:14:57.246 --> 00:14:58.440
Dan: Seo sales.

200
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.730
Dan: and I just put a list of all it together.

201
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.109
Dan: And I probably had, like 200 items of ways to market an Internet.

202
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.690
Dan: And

203
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.250
Dan: I was overwhelmed. I had no idea how to do it.

204
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.049
Dan: So I went back to my co-founder, said, Okay, cool. I'm going to start to learn how to market.

205
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.339
Dan: What's my budget?

206
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.430
Dan: And his answer was 0,

207
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.030
Dan: and a second moment of panic set in thinking like, what the hell is? This doesn't make any sense.

208
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.129
Dan: But in some ways that

209
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:30.190
Dan: fear actually helped me, because it helped me eliminate us. 200 items to like 6,

210
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.559
Dan: because almost all those channels required cash, and only 6 required nothing.

211
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.389
Dan: So now I only have 6 channels to play around with on my list.

212
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:49.079
Dan: And that really helped me narrow in and focus, because focus is really a theme of success. A lot of times we get too broad, and we get overwhelmed that we can't really get good if we're only if we're doing everything.

213
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.149
Dan: So I thought it basically was 6 channels.

214
00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:54.719
Dan: I started doing them and 3 out of 6 worked.

215
00:15:54.950 --> 00:16:00.929
Dan: And I'll tell you guys, those worked, 3 or 6 worked. And then I scale those. So 3 channels to work for me.

216
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.450
Dan: there were Facebook groups.

217
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.319
Dan: They were

218
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.929
Dan: being a guest

219
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.210
Dan: on podcasts

220
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:17.829
Dan: and number 3 it was working with at that point. Instagram influencers. Those are my 3 channels that work for me effectively.

221
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:20.880
Dan: Do you want to

222
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.599
Dan: do you want me to double? Click any of those.

223
00:16:24.312 --> 00:16:39.279
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yes, please. By the way, I'm Antonio, with aware thanks for your feedback over email last night. So this, this is extremely helpful. This we relate a lot to to what you what you're doing. And if, yeah, if you can double down on those would be help helpful. Thank you.

224
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:47.119
Dan: Yeah. So I mentioned 3 channels, Facebook groups Guest as podcast and I also mentioned Instagram influencers.

225
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.940
Dan: So Facebook group.

226
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.879
Dan: I basically went and just jumped in like

227
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.140
Dan: 50 to a hundred Facebook groups

228
00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:59.429
Dan: and tried to understand what people are talking about in our space. So our space was

229
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:09.469
Dan: Vegan diets. Member nutrition app. So Vegan diets, keto diets, carbon, cycling, weight loss, fat management, peloton.

230
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.000
Dan: fitbit or ring.

231
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.550
Dan: And

232
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.340
Dan: first, I try to

233
00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:19.780
Dan: just message people hey, buy this sign up for this! And people were just, I guess, kicked out of the group couple of times.

234
00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:25.339
Dan: Then I got a little bit more elaborate. And I created 8 user accounts.

235
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.750
Dan: an old white guy.

236
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.279
Dan: a young Asian woman, just

237
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.969
Dan: different ethnic backgrounds

238
00:17:32.503 --> 00:17:37.710
Dan: sexes, races, no grab everything. And then I started interacting myself, meaning.

239
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.040
Dan: Hey, has anybody ever heard of this company called Nutris? Sense

240
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.210
Dan: me responding, that's super interesting. No. What do they do? Another person

241
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.149
Dan: I actually did hear about them with podcasts.

242
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:51.689
Dan: Oh, hearing, though someone else. I listen to this, podcast. We, this person was to get us done, you just check it out.

243
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.790
Dan: And I, basically all of a sudden was interacting with myself.

244
00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.290
Dan: And sooner or later 2 people were like, this is interesting.

245
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.879
Dan: Has anybody ever tried the product.

246
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.990
Dan: And how 2 people say, yeah, I try to loved it.

247
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.519
Dan: Third person. Say, I'm thinking about it. I haven't tried it yet. I'm really gonna fence convince me.

248
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.559
Dan: So I'm basically just interacting myself trying to get engagement

249
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.969
Dan: with 8 different people, literally 8 people of me.

250
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.189
Dan: And then 1, 2, 3 people bite

251
00:18:14.966 --> 00:18:15.940
Dan: and then

252
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.720
Dan: convince them to

253
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.710
Dan: go to. Then a chat

254
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:27.920
Dan: Instagram, Facebook chats. I don't know if you guys messenger, because again, our product is $250 a month.

255
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.950
Dan: Right? Okay, that's like you send it, or could consumer. And I gum.

256
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.070
Dan: we're not.

257
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:37.409
Dan: you know, an app. That's 1020 bucks a month. We're like $250 a month

258
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.250
Dan: for pride doesn't exist.

259
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.399
Dan: And our website's a landing page that says, Put your credit card here.

260
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.680
Dan: right?

261
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:50.350
Dan: And so you have to do a little bit more of convincing. So then I'm moving them to Facebook chat. We're chatting.

262
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.480
Dan: I'm converting some people from there. There's so many people are giving their credit cards over chat.

263
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.210
Dan: So I'm getting my cell phone right? So that

264
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.050
Dan: his first one.

265
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.090
Dan: I don't know if it's gonna work now or not, but

266
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.570
Dan: I assume it still could work.

267
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:11.810
Dan: If you're smart about it, you just gotta the key is really find the right people, the right groups. Number one's right groups. It's always it's a sick funnel, right? The right groups.

268
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:24.709
Dan: Then their interactions, then engagement. And you're kind of moving people in the funnel of. They never heard about you. So they heard about you, but they think they don't need to have the service to. They're interested to. And you're gonna go from 100 people to 10 to 5 to 3 and then reconvert.

269
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.270
Dan: So that was the first one

270
00:19:27.095 --> 00:19:29.169
Dan: the next one was around.

271
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:31.919
Dan: Being a guest on podcasts.

272
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:39.179
Dan: you know. Everyone always says it's funny. One of the mentors, Matt Marsh Band's mentors, told us. You know your product really work? Well, I'm like, where and he's like

273
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.370
Dan: Joe Rogan, podcast. You should go be a guest.

274
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.519
Dan: And I told the guy, do you know, Jerome, he said. No.

275
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.149
Dan: and I just laughed because I said, this is incredible. Voice, man, I never thought about that.

276
00:19:48.808 --> 00:19:51.760
Dan: Hopefully, you guys don't be sarcastic as those incredibly terrible advice

277
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.590
Dan: to go be a podcast guest on jargon. But

278
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:59.210
Dan: what I looked at podcast is a popularity contest.

279
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.000
Dan: it's actually the same game with, if you take it back, step back.

280
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:09.529
Dan: venture capital firms, podcast celebrities, high school popularity contests, the same exact dynamic.

281
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.920
Dan: What you do is

282
00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.479
Dan: you pick your niche. Our niche was healthcare, health and wellness medicine.

283
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.590
Dan: And you basically export a list of all the podcasts there.

284
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.060
Dan: And

285
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:30.930
Dan: I basically had a listen was like 700 podcasts from most famous ones. Like most most famous Peter Tia, Andrew Huberman, to least famous ones for like nobody's ever heard of.

286
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.920
Dan: And I start reaching out to like number 700,

287
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.580
Dan: 700 to, I think, 6, 86, 90, and the worst 10.

288
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.850
Dan: And say, I'd love to go in your pockus, because ABC,

289
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.669
Dan: out of those couple said, yes, I did the podcast

290
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.889
Dan: and we got something. Somebody got no sales, and we got one or 2 sales right.

291
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.279
Dan: but now I have content that I can use.

292
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.979
Dan: and not only do I have content to show other people. Now

293
00:20:54.170 --> 00:21:01.970
Dan: I also now can ask those Podcasters. Do you know anyone who has a podcast in this area? And it turns out, podcasts are friends of other podcasters.

294
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:10.939
Dan: big surprise Jessica engineers are friends of engineers, just like investors, friends of other investors. Same thing. Same concept. So then, the 6 90 Guy introduced me to 6 50

295
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:27.509
Dan: Podcaster same thing did the 6 50. That's that person I knew a 600 Podcaster, and it kept moving up, moving up, moving up to the point. I think we have to like number 4, number 3 in the world, or for our sphere. Right? And you just keep going down. This is the exact same concept for everything. Venture capital firms. You see the same thing.

296
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.700
Dan: When you do venture capital firms, you put them in tiers, tier one through 3 or one through 5, and you start the bottom.

297
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:37.339
Dan: You don't want to go through top of first, because if you do some silly, you burn that relationship.

298
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:44.650
Dan: but if you start the bottom they wanted. They're a little bit more open. They're helpful. There are more shots of goal, and you work your way, and you also get better over time, too, because

299
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.900
Dan: if you do get lucky and you get on Joe Rogan.

300
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.580
Dan: And then you can say, some circuits never done a podcast you really burn that relationship.

301
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.333
Dan: And so you gotta be to make sure you're ready as well. You need exposure and experience.

302
00:21:55.022 --> 00:22:01.710
Chloe Lannert: Dan, quick question of the chat. When you said you got one or 2 sales on the podcast. Early on, were you selling a product or a wait list.

303
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.439
Dan: At this point is a waiting list.

304
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:11.020
Dan: Yeah, people end up prepaying for about we for us, prior to ever having product exist.

305
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.419
Dan: So $250 a month for direct consumer product.

306
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.660
Dan: That one page which is, give me a credit card.

307
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:18.070
Chloe Lannert: That's awesome.

308
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.430
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And how long, how long was that time

309
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.169
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: like? How long was the wait list?

310
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.619
Dan: it didn't. It was.

311
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.769
Dan: I mean, when I say we did again. 0 to one.

312
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:40.590
Dan: Yeah. We told them we're gonna launch in like 2 weeks. We didn't launch for a month and a half 2 months like Prag. So there's 2 parts. First of all, product didn't exist. We want to build something before we knew people wanted it.

313
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.879
Dan: But the second part is, it was also technologically impossible at that point in time.

314
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.854
Dan: for 2 reasons.

315
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.149
Dan: you had the device we were is talking his Lucas monitor

316
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.490
Dan: before you'd scan with your iphone.

317
00:22:54.630 --> 00:23:00.060
Dan: Apple did not have the did not give the ability to company scan things

318
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.149
Dan: with a phone besides apple pay.

319
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:08.010
Dan: or Abbott's company called Abbot, the one we're using the sensor from. So we didn't have permission.

320
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:12.719
Dan: So we knew. So it was like September nineteenth was when official was going to be released.

321
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:21.559
Dan: that you can now scan things with your phone through Nfc. And your chipping up chipping phones. So until then it was both physically impossible, and we didn't actually build app.

322
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.850
Dan: So even if we built, the app wouldn't be possible.

323
00:23:24.328 --> 00:23:26.619
Dan: We decided to launch a little bit earlier. So we actually

324
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.869
Dan: forced our members to download, test flight

325
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.610
Dan: to then download our app, because then you get like a head start for a couple of weeks.

326
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.678
Dan: and that was also interesting.

327
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:37.760
Dan: does that answer your question?

328
00:23:40.582 --> 00:23:46.580
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yes, and for how long was that? Wait, Lisa, that you said 2, 3 months. Until then you actually had a product

329
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.510
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: to sell.

330
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.410
Dan: Yeah, yeah, I mean, so the goal

331
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:56.464
Dan: I mean the timing is a little fuzzy. Now it's been some. It's been a 5 years

332
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.220
Dan: maybe a month month and a half, too. It was more of.

333
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.170
Dan: We knew we had a certain date by when we can launch so until that date and nothing mattered.

334
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.610
Dan: We like we couldn't

335
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.580
Dan: get them to. The product. Wouldn't work period right technologically.

336
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.159
Dan: But the other part is.

337
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.490
Dan: we knew some people were going to cancel.

338
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.830
Dan: and we didn't care.

339
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.919
Dan: and it was much easier. Say, sorry! We'll give you your money back.

340
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.179
Dan: And so there was a month and a half 2 months timeframe, where basically, the product didn't exist. And we're just waiting.

341
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.609
Dan: And we give people refunds that they ask for them.

342
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:45.400
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Gotcha. And and the reason why I'm asking done is because we we're thinking of launching the wait list. Vip wait list a demo day, and then maybe 3 se. 3 months later, do the actual commitment for the crowd funding, and 6 months from now provide the product.

343
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.239
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And I don't want to make it to lose momentum. That's why I'm asking about the timeline.

344
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.090
Dan: Yeah. Well, this one, I this one. I'll I'll be frank, and I think there's different approaches here.

345
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.320
Dan: The console wait list

346
00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.320
Dan: is little

347
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.350
Dan: different than what we did. So our biggest competitor, that point in time actually did a wait list.

348
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.389
Dan: But they were list wasn't really real. Wait list. They just they. They did it as a tactic to generate demand. Say, look, you're on wait lists waiting for you, but they're really giving it to anyone who really asked for it.

349
00:25:13.159 --> 00:25:19.799
Dan: Well, we didn't. What we did. It wasn't a wait list was a prepayment. Wait, Alyssa, basically give us your email. We'll send. We'll let you know when you're ready when we're ready for you.

350
00:25:20.425 --> 00:25:47.050
Dan: That's a very popular tech tactic that why, company that a lot of tech starts company do just as like a standard basis like let's create, wait lists to generate demand. So when people are like waiting, they're excited when you launch and you officially announce it, and you could number one. Number 2 could also sell to your investors. Look, I have a 10,000 person. Wait, list. Imagine 5 million dollars. I'll launch this. And then such a sales tactic or marketing tactic rather than what we did. We didn't think I can have a wait list. It was a prepayment. That's a little nuanced difference. Does that make a sense? What I described here.

351
00:25:47.290 --> 00:26:02.030
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yes, but actually, our pre lease is a presale, like we're we are asking them to give us $50, and then in September to add $200 to to commit to the device. So you get a spot for $50, and in September you add $200.

352
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.480
Dan: Okay, so that's interesting.

353
00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:04.500
Dan: Why?

354
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.980
Dan: okay, that sounds that sounds harder, because asking people to twice

355
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.920
Dan: sounds much harder, because sometimes they change their mind later, or they forget you exist or.

356
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:31.309
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, we want, we wanna first start, you know. test the ground to see if people are actually, this is so new, you know, like. And and so we wanna test the ground to see if people are actually interested. And since we don't have a product yet, we have a prototype that works really well in an app.

357
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:35.159
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: But we wanna make sure that what we're building is actually makes sense

358
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.759
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: upfront. You know, the pitch makes sense to them.

359
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.930
Dan: Yeah, I

360
00:26:40.277 --> 00:26:52.989
Dan: I don't know how to answer, because we didn't. I've seen the 2 different approach. I've I've seen one before, but I don't know how it works. Well, I work how well it works. I've seen the one where it's prepaid, old thing, or it's purely weightless. I've never seen the kind of the mixed combo.

361
00:26:53.170 --> 00:27:00.080
Dan: I don't know what the I wouldn't be the right person to answer that question for you, because I just don't know the best approach I do know. Making it twice. Sales is hard, because.

362
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.640
Dan: like you're have, you have to convince them twice to the same thing.

363
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.130
Dan: and that's very difficult.

364
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.600
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Gotcha.

365
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.040
Dan: So I don't answer that I'm sorry.

366
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.026
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: No problem. I hear you.

367
00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:15.899
Dan: But again, if you take a step back here, it looks like you're further ahead than we were when we have Pre. When we have full prepayments

368
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.950
Dan: because we had no app. We had nothing.

369
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.010
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: okay.

370
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.110
Dan: Just something to consider, like.

371
00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.849
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Go go full throttle go full throttle as $200 right.

372
00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:35.880
Dan: Yeah, I I mean, I'm just saying it's it's feasible, right? You're not gonna get a lot of people convert. But you don't need that many, how many? $200. The nice thing about a high end subscriptions

373
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.719
Dan: is you don't need that many.

374
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.429
Dan: If you're charging 5 bucks a month to meet a lot of people to matter. If you have.

375
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.350
Dan: If it's 250 bucks, you can get

376
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.870
Dan: 40 people signed up

377
00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.659
Dan: right, and you're already in tens of thousands of dollars in revenue.

378
00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:49.700
Dan: That's and.

379
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.320
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And email.

380
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.410
Dan: We're doing millions a month, and we don't have that. Many customers honestly.

381
00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:00.049
Dan: So I mean, it's like, like some. Tesla is so nice. Right? There's some 100,000 our cars. You don't need to sell that many

382
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:01.880
Dan: yeah.

383
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:10.999
Alejandra Guillen: S. Sorry, Dan, this is Alejandra, Antonius? Business partner, do you think that the fact that we have like 6 months

384
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:18.000
Alejandra Guillen: to deliver on the product itself is is is gonna be too long like, what? What's your thought on the timeline.

385
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.669
Dan: I think you should always ship

386
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.100
Dan: with the concept of being comfortable, of giving people refunds.

387
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.460
Dan: Again, we have people prepay about 20% people.

388
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:35.780
Dan: Just we're like, dude. What the hell man! What did I pay for you? My money back. We're like, sure. Here's a refund. Apologize.

389
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.270
Dan: Then we sent a device once we did launch.

390
00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:45.999
Dan: because when we released a day it was possible, right? Because that's when Apple allow. I think it was Ios 13 or 14 was the first version was live scanning

391
00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.450
Dan: we ship with people

392
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.139
Dan: we actually didn't realize there was. Gonna be night mode. There's no night mode where it's like

393
00:28:52.532 --> 00:29:00.399
Dan: from like 10 pm. Till in the morning your phone changes color and iphone where it's like. So there's no blue, no blue light, I think a red light, whatever it is. Here's what I'm talking about.

394
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.180
Dan: So

395
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.389
Dan: we didn't know that was going to be a feature

396
00:29:05.792 --> 00:29:09.879
Dan: currently, we're too busy to actually read the the actual update besides Nmc section.

397
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.260
Dan: And so our app was black screen

398
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:22.359
Dan: every day from 10 Pm. Till in the morning. This purely Brex black screen for the first month. So you're paying me $250 a month, and our app only works 2 thirds of the time.

399
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:38.160
Dan: and our our entire premise of the company is real time, glucose, monitoring, 24, 7. That's our entire company business. That's what we tell people. Because historic people could figure Perk themselves anytime here. We're saying real time, even when you sleep, you know.

400
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.029
Dan: because you can wake up, and you see all you do from sleep, and all of a sudden you can't even open the app for that time.

401
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:47.330
Dan: So when I say ship when you're embarrassed, really, ship, when you're embarrassed

402
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.379
Dan: like you could always give money back.

403
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:51.650
Dan: Remember this.

404
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:56.779
Dan: there's what 370 million or 360 million Americans.

405
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.880
Dan: if you piss off a thousand Americans

406
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.520
Dan: because your product sucks.

407
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.679
Dan: But you learn that quickly.

408
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.070
Dan: It's incredible.

409
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:07.729
Dan: You want the whole goal here, so know that.

410
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:17.230
Dan: with a few exceptions, that there's always a someone who's incredibly like smart or lucky, whatever it is. There's always like one of a hundred, just like the product just works day one. The geniuses.

411
00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:25.589
Dan: But I'm not one of those. I fall into 99% category where I have to reiterate my product. And what I thought was me. The right thing is not the right thing, but I need to learn as quickly as possible.

412
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.240
Dan: I mean, I'll give you guys context.

413
00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.990
Dan: we launched this company

414
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:34.830
Dan: with a target market of Neil and me, basically

415
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.170
Dan: 22 to 30 year old

416
00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.279
Dan: Teg Bros in Silicon valley that was our target market. We launched.

417
00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.590
Dan: Within 2 weeks we realized our target market was women over 40 who are menopause will live Minnesota.

418
00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.940
Dan: That is a very different target market.

419
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.440
Dan: very different

420
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:57.140
Dan: like. And the reason we started killing to all our competitors because they actually built a wait list. They waited blah blah.

421
00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:01.239
Dan: And we realize, like, are these wind over 40 a lot of times

422
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.440
Dan: they want

423
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.810
Dan: someone to talk to. They want a

424
00:31:05.205 --> 00:31:10.050
Dan: dietician. They want more expertise versus people like me and Neil. I don't. I didn't, Neil jump it off.

425
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.169
Dan: Neil never was. He also signed up. He never gave me like.

426
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:13.990
NSG: So the work.

427
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:21.110
Dan: Oh, you're still, and you didn't ask questions. How do you know this? I read, watch, Peter Ti read all these blogs, so Neil already knew all the stuff like

428
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.790
Dan: he was not our target customer.

429
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:31.080
Dan: right? But it took because we released such a crappy version, and we saw really quickly, like it was like 10 people or 12 people signed up and we saw quickly. They're like

430
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.569
Dan: all the tech Bros.

431
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.340
Dan: Which is I I don't mean in a positive like, not a negative

432
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.220
NSG: I'll be. I'll be your tech program. It's a good one.

433
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:44.129
Dan: The tech pros they used it for like 2, 3 weeks, and they like lost engagement, or like just cancel after a month.

434
00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.720
Dan: And all these. Middle-aged

435
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.460
Dan: Minnesota moms.

436
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.880
Dan: we're on there like saying, Can I pay for a year?

437
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.700
Dan: And I was like, Wait, what the hell are you talking? I was not for you.

438
00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:56.730
Dan: and

439
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:06.539
Dan: all our competitors spend hours about building a product, redeveloping hire engineers, making this perfect, amazing product. And to this day their user experience. Still better at ours. Irony about this.

440
00:32:07.103 --> 00:32:15.019
Dan: I should show you guys a slide also for someone else, which I think is kind of funny, maybe a different day, but the product was way better than ours

441
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.290
Dan: way. Better. They still have better products than us.

442
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.470
Dan: but they just were markings that are on the people.

443
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.890
Dan: and I always say.

444
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.450
Dan: no matter how much you love dogs.

445
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.290
Dan: If I'm selling you cat food.

446
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:35.579
Dan: you don't care a shit about cat food. You're not gonna buy a cat food, no matter how good of sales. Guy, I am, no matter how much you need. You know you like you don't care about. You don't need cat food and same thing in here.

447
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:44.030
Dan: If I'm pitching tech Bros, and they don't care about this it. This simply doesn't matter. You have to understand who you're, and so by going faster, you get to read, array faster

448
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:49.600
Dan: the first like 2, 3 years. It's all about reiteration loops. How quickly can you get

449
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.460
Dan: to reiterate faster and adjust?

450
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:58.839
Dan: That's really what you want, because you, a lot of it, is just guesswork. I think they want this. I've talked to customers, online

451
00:32:59.824 --> 00:33:05.160
Dan: interviews, surveys. It's all nice, doesn't really matter. What really matters is

452
00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.779
Dan: how quickly you can get people to actually show with their wallets

453
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.670
Dan: because you could have a hundred. Your friends telling you all love this, even people saying like I would definitely sign up.

454
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.499
Dan: please say, put your credit card here, and they go. You know what? Never mind.

455
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:22.509
Dan: And so you really find out who your customers are, really quickly, when they have to actually put their money in.

456
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.480
Dan: and I had a question from Vincento Vincent, otherwise Vincento Vincent.

457
00:33:28.808 --> 00:33:44.559
Vincent Lucero: Love it. So, Dan, these are like super great insights. They're also like B to be focused like more consumer. You actually have a finance background and double prime is actually building a more inclusive and explainable AI underwriting solution and providing debt capital. So

458
00:33:44.891 --> 00:34:02.799
Vincent Lucero: I'm curious to kind of get your perspective on, like B, 2 B partnerships for distribution. Like, have you spent time thinking about like how you can, partner? I guess, to like, get referral volume, or to drive, you know, the warm intros necessary to sell into banks, credit unions, fintex, etc.

459
00:34:04.983 --> 00:34:06.090
Dan: Me. Specifically.

460
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:06.990
Dan: I have.

461
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.020
Vincent Lucero: Or just in general, yeah, go ahead.

462
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:09.679
Dan: Them.

463
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:14.020
Dan: I have not done that in the B 2 B. Fintech space.

464
00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.469
Dan: I do know a lot of people do it. That's one of one of those channels.

465
00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.400
Dan: but I have not done that. Unfortunately.

466
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.890
Vincent Lucero: Okay, okay, sounds good. Do you mind if I follow up with you afterwards? Kind of chat about your experience in in finance.

467
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.775
Dan: Sure. Yeah. Happy to

468
00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.570
Dan: Yup, I think, Jeremy, you have a question here.

469
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:40.379
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, a few questions in the chat about how you were able to engage with Instagram influencers with no budget.

470
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.750
Jeremy Banning: The third point. Third point, you're gonna conclude on Yup.

471
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:50.019
Dan: That's funny. I was on my to do, but we never even got to it. But I'm by the way, this is the value this. You should be asking these questions because I think

472
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.150
Dan: we're selling for slack. There's I mean, 25 more. But

473
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:55.009
Dan: think we don't need to even go in all those

474
00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.620
Dan: so dog behind running around. Let me know if it's too loud, guys. Sorry.

475
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.390
Jeremy Banning: You're good, but.

476
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.640
Dan: Regard to influence. I basically just DM, them

477
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.870
Dan: same exact approach. I start off with really unpopular ones, where, like, they only have 5,000 followers.

478
00:35:09.495 --> 00:35:14.170
Dan: And then work my way up t010-20-5060, just what 5,000 influencer followers

479
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.239
Dan: they're more willing to talk to you.

480
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.469
Dan: And the funny, same exact approach.

481
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:28.680
Dan: You post with them. And then you say, do you have any friends or I? And you actually can super easy. You literally look at who follows them. If you click on the link, Instagram, you looked up. Who follows you?

482
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:36.499
Dan: It'll actually prioritize most famous people to least. So if you see, like this person has 5,000 followers, but you click on top 3, and they're like they both feel 20,000. You say

483
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.840
Dan: I saw you connect to these for people. Can you introduce me.

484
00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.329
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: Dan, what was your ask? Sorry.

485
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.580
Dan: For which people.

486
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.949
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: What for the influencers when you DM, them? What was the goal.

487
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.960
Dan: The first one or the connection little step forward.

488
00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.410
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: Oh, no! The first one. So you you reach out to the first influence of what did you want them to do for you?

489
00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:03.089
Dan: I want them to post saying that Nutris sense has the Cgm device and that they should sign up to improve their Google control.

490
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.519
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: And no, no monetary offer in return, or anything.

491
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.749
Dan: Yes, monetary in return. But I had no cash, remember right?

492
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.020
Dan: And so belief system is that

493
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.490
Dan: when you're starting a company, and again, you're pitching investors all that stuff

494
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.259
Dan: you can't, people say, Oh, show me a scalable channel.

495
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.410
Dan: How can you show me? How can I show you scalable channel if I've never tested channels.

496
00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:31.799
Dan: or how can I show you scalable channel if I don't have money to go test a million channels, a lot of money, so it's just like Catch 22

497
00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.720
Dan: to scale. I need money. But to get money I need to show scalable channels. How does that work?

498
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:42.660
Dan: So what you need to do is need to do unscalable things, things that just do not work very well like at scale.

499
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.610
Dan: But they have the ability to become scalable.

500
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:53.049
Dan: And so you're doing on scalable and demonstrating the vision of what this will become. Scale in the future. Look, investor, so look how great it is.

501
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:57.310
Dan: and then, once you get the money, you do the scalable version of it. So influencers, for example.

502
00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.070
Dan: I DM a thousand of them like 6 respond to me.

503
00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.680
Dan: I get a call with 6 of them

504
00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.650
Dan: out of those 6, I convinced 2 to work with me

505
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:12.289
Dan: right? Just basically like a discussion. And I don't have money. So what did I tell them? I'll pay per conversion

506
00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:14.560
Dan: right?

507
00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:15.930
Dan: So

508
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.359
Dan: 2 things happen.

509
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.509
Dan: They're not working for free. Theoretically.

510
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:22.260
Dan: they convert someone

511
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.259
Dan: that person converts, I get revenue.

512
00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.429
Dan: I can actually now

513
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:32.189
Dan: hire someone with that revenue and by product and all those things, and build what I want to build.

514
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.460
Dan: And then, 3 months later, I paid influencer.

515
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:44.139
Dan: So I actually didn't like we didn't like we actually had revenue. And we're profitable in theory before we even like got money from techstars to raise money.

516
00:37:44.452 --> 00:37:49.129
Dan: Now we're not the opposite, but back then, like it was kind of ridiculous where, like

517
00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:56.399
Dan: we were paying them post all this time. So we're getting free revenue through. I can pay in cash later, and as your business grows more and more

518
00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:00.750
Dan: now, by the time you have. Only, like 30 influencers, you're again paying them later, you're paying original ones.

519
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:06.860
Dan: So you can have more cash Pam. And you're floating basically cash. You're almost creating like accounts, receivable bounces for yourself.

520
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:13.261
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: Was it? Yeah? Was it a percentage of the sale that they converted? Or was it a fixed.

521
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.089
Dan: I did. Yeah, yeah, I did a fixed amount.

522
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:16.890
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: Okay.

523
00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:27.460
Dan: But have. I mean, it depends on your subscription. It doesn't. You could do, by the way, whatever works best for you. It's coming of like you versus them. What can you afford to pay? You have to know that number in your head

524
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.499
Dan: theoretically want to pay as little as possible.

525
00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.828
Dan: but still not too little, because if you do too little, you won't be incentivizing them right.

526
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:46.330
Dan: And again, the irony same thing. Here. I would then go look at influencer, I would say, Hey, can you choose me? These 3 influencers now work the way up again to celebrity influencers over years. It's really this is just really kind of 2 priorities.

527
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.450
Dan: the 3 parts

528
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.700
Dan: meticulous

529
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:55.390
Dan: tracking of influencers in Excel file or Google sheets, because you have to kind of like track. All these people like where they on a list.

530
00:38:55.959 --> 00:38:58.850
Dan: Assuming that's gonna be like 99% rejection right?

531
00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.109
Dan: And then number 2 is

532
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:02.599
Dan: be very specific.

533
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.040
Dan: What I mean by that is.

534
00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.890
Dan: you can't say like, hey can choose me. Some influencers, you have to say, like.

535
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.930
Dan: Introduce me to these 2 people for this topic

536
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.999
Dan: right? And guess what?

537
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:26.799
Dan: When you get introduced someone and they're literally texting you and email intranie, the response rate goes from like 1% to like 9.9% because their buddy just introduced them. You're not like message them, you know, blankly directing, messaging them right. Their friends use them so all of a sudden

538
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:33.550
Dan: it just gets so much easier like we got so to some of the most famous people within like 12 months just doing that. It was kind of crazy.

539
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.990
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: Awesome. Thank you.

540
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:39.329
Dan: Yeah, it just requires a little bit of like meticulous

541
00:39:40.025 --> 00:39:47.509
Dan: train on it. But it's it's just funny because it's all the podcasts, influencers venture capital firms. They're all actually kind of identical.

542
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:55.810
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So so, Danny, on on those line. It sounds like, basically as you were converting people

543
00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:02.200
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: really door literally door to door. Then you would just ship the device to them and the test flight app.

544
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:22.340
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and it would start using it. And then, right, yeah, how do you? How do you deal if people wants to return? Because now you're using the money, their money to build your your products. If people want to return this and assume worst case scenar 100 return. Okay, so how do you? How do you deal with that risk?

545
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:29.289
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: That's you. I mean, you use the money. But then you need to return it. So you're gonna go negative, right? Like, how do you deal with that.

546
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.137
Dan: Yeah, I mean, I guess it's funny.

547
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.949
Dan: So the first time we sold for 10 the first time was only 10 people that Pre signed up

548
00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.539
Dan: so not a lot, but a 2 50 piece. It was $2.5,000

549
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.190
Dan: right for that month.

550
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.770
Dan: and

551
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:50.710
Dan: our customer number 7 that prepaid actually emailed and said, Hey, the package didn't arrive. I'm moving to France.

552
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.690
Dan: Can you give me a refund?

553
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:56.660
Dan: So what I actually did is I got an airplane and went to France.

554
00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.569
Dan: and Hand delivered her the product.

555
00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.600
Dan: and then went back to Chicago

556
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:04.020
Dan: because I did not want to have return for that one specifically

557
00:41:04.757 --> 00:41:10.999
Dan: fast forward. 3 years later we actually have hiring that person. And they're in our Vp of operations. Really impressive person.

558
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.689
Dan: They, I think they were like Olympic swimmer.

559
00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.020
Dan: but

560
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.179
Dan: I did not want returns.

561
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.609
Dan: and so it is anything you need to do to get them to. Now return

562
00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.759
Dan: as long as you're staying above cogs.

563
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:25.920
Dan: So if you look at nectar mattress, for example, or any of these mattress companies

564
00:41:26.532 --> 00:41:31.380
Dan: I think they'll answer your question if you look at their websites, I mean, this is here, I'll show you

565
00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:36.910
Dan: and this, they're really the experts on this, and you can just copy. And there's no reason to vent the wheel. Here.

566
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.890
Dan: You guys see my screen.

567
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.295
Chloe Lannert: Yep.

568
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.219
Dan: Yeah. I mean, what do they have? Return here?

569
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.700
Dan: See? Return.

570
00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.259
Dan: Yeah. See 365 night home trial.

571
00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:03.759
Dan: You can literally return for any reason. 3 and 65 days. It's kind of insane, right? This is a 12 to $1,500 product. You return for any reason whatsoever.

572
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.979
Dan: Try calling them, and seeing how they how they accept your return.

573
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.759
Dan: They will, by the way, give you a return.

574
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.980
Dan: but they have a script of like 7 ways to get you not to to your turn.

575
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.070
Dan: They'll send you free pillows.

576
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.070
Dan: they will say, how about a 200? Just dollar discount?

577
00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.830
Dan: How about we send you like.

578
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:31.310
Dan: It's it's incredible. I mean, I have to admire them in that regard, and you know they will. I can explain to you over the next 7 h how to do it effectively, or you can just like

579
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.070
Dan: tried live with our agents.

580
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:37.910
Dan: Just say, like, Hey, everyone, I want to return this and see what happens. And you'll just learn more than anything else about that.

581
00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:39.560
Dan: It's a very solid problem.

582
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:48.760
Dan: From hundreds of problems you don't have to solve. This is probably one of the easier ones to solve. So encourage you to give them a call or any magic. By the way, I'm not investor, net, nect, or anything.

583
00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:52.889
Dan: But all these metrics companies do this. So just first one pop in my head.

584
00:42:53.790 --> 00:43:03.250
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So it sounds like yours was all organic growth. No Vc. Money. It was like just angel and techstars, and then organic growth and revenues pretty much.

585
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:07.580
Dan: We had. We had revenue before we got a single dollar of angel and taxes anyone

586
00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.450
Dan: we already came to techstars with revenue.

587
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.469
Dan: Yeah, because I think I told you guys like.

588
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.220
Dan: I think my pan, I had a panic set in after clear my job. So it was basically

589
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.469
Dan: kind of fight or flight. I chose, I guess, fights.

590
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.219
Dan: And so within 30 days I realized I need to figure out

591
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:32.360
Dan: general revenue. So we had what $2.5,000 after 2 weeks.

592
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:39.489
Dan: Next time we had $8,000 next month. Next month we had $20,000 next time $40,000, and just keep going up and up and up.

593
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.780
Dan: Because I just said, Okay.

594
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.050
Dan: this influencer thing is working interesting. What am I doing wrong? Let me adjust.

595
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:51.530
Dan: Let me create my update, my file. Great, and I'm also a member. I'm going up on influencer. I'm going to 5,000

596
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.020
Dan: following influenza to 10,000 to 50. So now a sudden want to

597
00:43:55.060 --> 00:44:10.600
Dan: 100,000 and follower influencer posts. I'm no longer getting one sale now. I'm getting 50 sales. I'm getting 100 sales, right? So as you work in your funnel, up and up and up and up, you're getting more and more sales, too. Right? So it's it becomes easier. You end up talking. The exact same amount of people becomes easier.

598
00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:15.699
Dan: Just like, if you talk to. You know, my, podcast you've never heard of, you probably can get one sale.

599
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:21.470
Dan: But if you call on Joe Rogan, you're probably gonna get like 10 million dollars of sales. The same concept as you move up, it becomes easier and easier.

600
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:29.300
Dan: That's why you people say, like second, third time founders. They can do away easier, because they already have the connections. They don't have to restart again from scratch.

601
00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.200
Dan: Does that help answer your question?

602
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:34.660
Dan: I actually want to sidetrack here. But yeah, hopefully, that answers someone's question.

603
00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.250
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Absolutely. Yeah. Thank you. Then, absolutely, thank you.

604
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:43.090
Dan: Yeah, I'm happy to tell you about our experience, one on one, so I don't. I don't know if it's relevant to everyone here, though, so I don't want people

605
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.889
Dan: to feel distracted.

606
00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:48.230
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I will love that, so I'll take it offline. Yeah, Natalie, thank you.

607
00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.370
Dan: Nelson, but you had a question.

608
00:44:51.252 --> 00:45:08.207
Nelson Mitchell: I'm curious. If you have any recommendations for how to jump, start getting good at podcasts. Cause, I actually am, not following your advice. And I got an introduced to a pretty popular Podcaster. And I haven't done a podcast before I'm, like, oh, this is a good opportunity.

609
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.199
Nelson Mitchell: I mean, should I tell them to wait, or is there some way I can get smart at this.

610
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.219
Dan: Oh, just do it. You need to do it right away. You can do it right away.

611
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.199
Dan: you should assume.

612
00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.580
Dan: Excuse my French.

613
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.259
Dan: You'll probably fuck up.

614
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.070
Nelson Mitchell: What?

615
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.740
Dan: If you go in the mindset that you fuck up the worse that happens, you fuck up.

616
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.020
Dan: and that's it. But what if you do. Okay.

617
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.860
Dan: not great. What if you just do? Okay.

618
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.670
Dan: the upside's too high here and the risk is too low.

619
00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:42.550
Dan: This is one of those bets where you should definitely take right away like that's one of the times I was somewhere like, you get lucky. That's a lucky opportunity, and you just grab those things

620
00:45:43.032 --> 00:45:48.329
Dan: I was not lucky enough to get this opportunity, so I had to grind way up. But if you're getting that, you need to take advantage of that immediately.

621
00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.280
Nelson Mitchell: Thanks.

622
00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.319
Dan: Yeah, I saw Valerie Valeria has, and I think.

623
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:57.930
Dan: Marcia, I don't know. I wanna make sure I'm pronounced it correctly.

624
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:58.730
Dan: Where's

625
00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.720
Dan: maybe Chloe? You can kind of decide who goes next.

626
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.560
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. Muta, go ahead.

627
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:34.123
Mircea Gogoncea: Cool. I have a question about sort of free channels that take a while to ramp up like SEO and content. So we got all of our users so far as to content free content. But you know, to really do it well. You have to keep at it for a very long time, and it doesn't always work right away. So I've been doing much more of the DM people directly strategy that you talked about before, and that's been working. But when it comes to these channels that take a while to ramp up, how do you prioritize them when you need revenue now to not die.

628
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:36.430
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah.

629
00:46:36.759 --> 00:46:39.729
Dan: It's it's exactly that you prioritize me right now.

630
00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.386
Dan: You just put them on back burner

631
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.829
Dan: in either way. I prioritized it as long term channels like SEO.

632
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.389
Dan: I basically looked them as like, I'm going to allocate

633
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:52.849
Dan: less than 5% of my time on this.

634
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.630
Dan: because but you need to start now, if you don't start at all

635
00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:59.140
Dan: 3 years later, you're gonna get screwed

636
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.640
Dan: because you keep. I see what you keep doing forever.

637
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.659
Dan: But once it comes in, helps a lot, but he's do it for a long, long time.

638
00:47:06.132 --> 00:47:12.059
Dan: So it's really small allocation of time. If you're saying you don't want to die, just maybe do 0.

639
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.390
Dan: But

640
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:24.740
Dan: in some ways SEO is a luxury. So if you have a lot of money, or you are generating a lot of revenue. If you have a lot of investors that you should maybe say, Okay, I'm gonna pretend 20.

641
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:29.350
Dan: But if you're at a point where you're like pre-revenue or very little revenue, maybe 0

642
00:47:30.167 --> 00:47:36.319
Dan: around the SEO. Well, if you're talking about, if you're converting content like through Tiktok that you can go right. That is

643
00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.910
Dan: proven out that that's almost proven out like the unscalable can become scalable.

644
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:46.199
Dan: That's a little different, because that doesn't take very long. SEO takes forever. But Tiktok, Youtube, Instagram, content. They can go really, really fast.

645
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.140
Dan: Does that answer your question?

646
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:54.149
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, absolutely. We've and we haven't tried Tiktok yet. Mostly Instagram is is been what what's successful for us.

647
00:47:54.150 --> 00:48:05.170
Dan: So that one I would keep going because that one is not somewhat like a CEO like, yeah, you post today, you get sale today. Or you're again, you're demonstrating to the investor that this unscalable strategy

648
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.140
Dan: has it potentially become scalable.

649
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.210
Dan: So as I was giving you guys an example of

650
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.610
Dan: influencers.

651
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.610
Dan: messaging a thousand people and getting like 6 people to get in a call with you, and I'm only 2 agreed to work with you

652
00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:17.610
Dan: is really unscalable. It sucks.

653
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:21.039
Dan: But by doing that and getting sales. And I go to investor, I'm like

654
00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.910
Dan: now imagine, and Mr. Investor or misinvestor.

655
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:29.370
Dan: if I could pay those people 10,000 HA piece. How quickly would they respond to me versus do it for free.

656
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:38.940
Dan: and that paints a picture of like that is true. If you have, people do this for free. Imagine if we paid them. And, by the way, when you do pay people $10,000, they respond like this to you.

657
00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:49.229
Dan: the response rate goes from, like, you know, 2% or even point 2% to like 95%. It really skyrockets, if you pay enough, and you're treating you to Oprah Brett pits to do an advertisement for you. Right?

658
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:56.630
Dan: And so that's the scalability of the same thing. Right? Oprah Bratt bitters, influencers. Well, you got to pay him a lot. So that's the scalability part here.

659
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:59.390
Dan: I'm on doing unscalable work to show. Would this work

660
00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.780
Dan: and I'm painting a picture for an investor to look.

661
00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:04.209
Dan: But leave us jump. Give me the money to get it here.

662
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.160
Dan: so help clarify.

663
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.590
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, immensely

664
00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:12.600
Mircea Gogoncea: glad to hear it.

665
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:19.449
Chloe Lannert: Another one out of the chat. What channels did you try that? Didn't work going back to the 6 sales channels you tried.

666
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:22.649
Dan: What channels I've tried. It didn't work.

667
00:49:23.865 --> 00:49:26.549
Dan: Twitter influencers. I tried for me didn't work.

668
00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:29.889
Dan: They've worked for other people. They didn't work for me.

669
00:49:30.605 --> 00:49:38.840
Dan: Maybe because I didn't actually have Twitter ever before starting his company. I didn't realize that he's supposed to use Twitter. Instagram was a little easier because I've been, you know.

670
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:40.769
Dan: and avid, probably

671
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.370
Dan: unhealthy user of Instagram over the years.

672
00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:47.469
Dan: And so I just kind of knew the dynamics a little bit more, and Twitter was not very good at it.

673
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:50.320
Dan: Years later I figure out how to be better at it.

674
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.500
Dan: but I also realize, like generating me, generating $2,000 a month on Twitter is probably not worth my time.

675
00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.170
Dan: but at the early stages. If I knew how to do better, I would have done better at it.

676
00:49:59.135 --> 00:50:00.145
Dan: That's one.

677
00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:06.930
Dan: For some reason I couldn't get. I couldn't get Youtube influencers to work for me

678
00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:12.520
Dan: for free, because there's I couldn't figure out how to message them or do you have them? You just like email, them.

679
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.540
Dan: And my copywriting skills were not as good an email at that point in time

680
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:19.440
Dan: as they were, and then just DM into people.

681
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:26.090
Dan: Cause then, DM, like you can, you know, on Instagram like I would leave a comment on like a picture, and then send a message and leave another comment, you know, like, kind of that game

682
00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:32.049
Dan: versus email, like, if they literally have really good copy and skills. And you basically get one shot. And you know.

683
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:34.789
Dan: you can translate it at spam and all sort of stuff

684
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.800
Dan: fast forward. I'm a little better at copy right now, but it's just a little bit different. Skill set right?

685
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:44.070
Dan: So that's not failed. Does that help clarify? So something like, Go ahead.

686
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:49.880
Chloe Lannert: Sorry. And the other question was, how quickly did you decide to drop those

687
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.429
Chloe Lannert: and focus in on the the ones that we're working.

688
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:59.390
Dan: Hmm! Like 3 months, 3 months.

689
00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:06.069
Dan: right? I mean it. And it's more so also, like selection bias here. Right? It's

690
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:18.879
Dan: I'm trying all these channels because they're all free. This is how right I narrowed down 6 because they're all free. So again, I'm happy that I only got the free channels. Maybe if I had money investment I would have tried other channels, but they maybe they also could work. But I had. I was

691
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.990
Dan: in a point we didn't have money.

692
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:34.220
Dan: and then I tried all but the same time, and the first ones I clicked the ones I you know, double double clicked on and went forward more and more and more more, and I just kept getting deeper. So maybe if I spend more time on Youtube influencer work better. I think there's

693
00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.970
Dan: what's hard to hear is there's some channels simply don't work for your business.

694
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.890
Dan: but they work for mine, and vice versa. Right? That's number one. But the other part is.

695
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:47.759
Dan: there's also like Marketer Skill channel. So this channel might be amazing for you.

696
00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:51.369
Dan: But you don't have the skills for it right like. I'll give an example.

697
00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.109
Dan: I bet

698
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:58.890
Dan: if I can convince people on the Internet to give me money, because there's people in America that if I knock on doors. They'll also give me money

699
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:04.419
Dan: right if I just knock on, walk around the streets and just knock people's doors in Middle Minnesota. Someone will give me money.

700
00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:08.529
Dan: but I'm not really good at that, like I don't know how to knock in people's doors. I get kind of nervous.

701
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:16.300
Dan: and so, but some people are really good at knocking on doors, but they're probably not as good at like as chatting with someone to convince them via chat to give them money right?

702
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:17.380
Dan: And so

703
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:24.790
Dan: I, you know, as you guys and probably know, like people sold things in person. We knocked on doors for hundreds of years, thousands of years, probably.

704
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:38.400
Dan: but I'm not able to do that. So I could have said like, Oh, that's a failed channel. I don't believe that. I think I'm just not the right marketer for that channel. So it's channel sometimes doesn't work. And sometimes the person in that channel doesn't work. And you have to make that clear distinction right?

705
00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.239
Chloe Lannert: That's fine. Yeah, thank you.

706
00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.030
Chloe Lannert: Yep.

707
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:46.799
Dan: Any other questions.

708
00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.490
Dan: I see. Valerie asked something. I don't know if you want to ask out loud.

709
00:52:52.952 --> 00:52:58.687
valeria brenner: I did not ask anything, but I am having a great time listening to this.

710
00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:00.299
Dan: Glad to hear it

711
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.420
Dan: any other questions.

712
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.070
Dan: Go ahead.

713
00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:06.710
Chloe Lannert: Aye.

714
00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:32.040
Alejandra Guillen: Yeah, very quickly. So you said that you have you got your original target user? Wrong? How did you? And then you discovered it was months in their forties, who wanted to talk to nutritionist? How did you get to the first one? Did? Was it through Jtv. Because I think that we're in in that situation where you know, we need to expand and think a little bit about our target consumer.

715
00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.079
Dan: How I found out they were the wider ones, or how did I get them on the platform?

716
00:53:38.688 --> 00:53:41.080
Alejandra Guillen: What was your original targets?

717
00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:46.920
Alejandra Guillen: And then, how? How did you get the right one into your platform? Exactly.

718
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.620
Dan: My original target was 22 to 30 year old

719
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.700
Dan: tech pros.

720
00:53:52.855 --> 00:53:53.870
Dan: But

721
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:57.699
Dan: again, desperation was basically like anyone who'll just respond and engage.

722
00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:03.209
Dan: I need them in the platform. And so it was just like as I want to like. For example, I want to

723
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:09.780
Dan: peloton groups, Facebook groups or or ring, or Fitbit, or Ketogenic diet groups.

724
00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:13.740
Dan: I would do this engagement if whoever wanted to engage in me. I'm like I need to talk to that person

725
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.630
Dan: right?

726
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.210
Dan: And

727
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:19.620
Dan: more women or 40 engage with me than young guys.

728
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.039
Dan: Apparently a lot of young guys don't want to chat with a random dude on Internet.

729
00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:24.100
Dan: right?

730
00:54:25.115 --> 00:54:25.950
Dan: But

731
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.430
Dan: just this is how it worked out right like to be frank.

732
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.139
Dan: And so it was just

733
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.510
Dan: whoever it was. It was selection bias who agreed to talk to me. Was the people right?

734
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.120
Dan: We still got a bunch of like Dubai hackers.

735
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:42.350
Dan: I mean, our early people were all San Francisco, all Barria right.

736
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.150
Dan: and

737
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:52.539
Dan: when they all sign up, so that's number one we use like the revenue. We don't know who the customer is. Remember, prior to this. I didn't know what Keto Junk died was.

738
00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:57.149
Dan: I didn't know what carb cycle. I didn't know these words. You meant a lot of these words.

739
00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:04.039
Dan: so I was just a complete discovery. I didn't. I was not a customer, I mean, when we started. So I thought, this is kind of a stupid idea. Why would anyone want this?

740
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:11.490
Dan: And it turned out people wanted it. But I had to understand. I had to almost convince myself and learn from this. Why would people want this? What do they need?

741
00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:12.730
Dan: And so

742
00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:16.919
Dan: whenever I got in people from Facebook to chat, I asked them hundreds of questions

743
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:20.279
Dan: like, I even asked him question like, why are you talking to me right now?

744
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.210
Dan: Why are you open to this conversation?

745
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.179
Dan: What problems are you facing so similar jobs to be done

746
00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.929
Dan: except less of a product

747
00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.750
Dan: and more so about the problem that they're facing

748
00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:36.740
Dan: right? And then, when I knew the problem, I was more so focused on

749
00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:40.909
Dan: conveying a problem. On my website. And

750
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:42.650
Dan: in that communication to them

751
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:51.740
Dan: without the product actually solving the problem because it probably didn't exist. Then we said, we'll solve the problem. We probably build the product. Remember, I said earlier, where that we're not sending rocks in space.

752
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:59.929
Dan: I'm guessing most people here are not doing something so incredibly intense that it's like you need like billions of dollars, and if so, you can always build pretty much anything

753
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.890
Dan: right? And so for us to understand like, is there demand for your problem

754
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:11.580
Dan: jobs to be done to me as a little deeper, and funnel where you have consumers. They like your product, they find value.

755
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:17.700
Dan: But maybe they're turning early. Or maybe they're like quitting sometime. And then you're like, Okay, well, how do I make sure they stay for a longer time. And

756
00:56:18.173 --> 00:56:25.709
Dan: or how do I speak them more effectively at scale? So so it's a little bit more further down for me this point I was like, I need revenue to survive.

757
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:30.069
Dan: because again, I could do as many interviews I want. But until someone gives you a credit card.

758
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.980
Dan: Notice. Some people say actually matters to me

759
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:34.320
Dan: right? Like.

760
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:40.670
Dan: I'm sure you guys been on a date before in your life where a person says I really like you. Let's go another day, and I go, of course, and never hear from them again.

761
00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:42.590
Dan: Right? How did that happen?

762
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:45.540
Dan: And so

763
00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.530
Dan: that's why I don't think these interviews

764
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.639
Dan: as impactfully.

765
00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:56.350
Dan: you know, as a credit card. I do like doing interviews, and they have to interview be like, all right. Here's a checkout page. Can you play? Can you pay it? Live?

766
00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:01.829
Dan: And so these people on chat? I will often say, like, Okay, seems like we're on board here. Here's a link. Let's pay

767
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.590
Dan: and see if they pay. If they really, if you're really going to solve the problem, they're going to pay you.

768
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.770
Dan: I mean at a perfect example. I mean, like I could pick out anything here.

769
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:11.729
Dan: Alejandra, right?

770
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:14.050
Dan: What's your business?

771
00:57:15.502 --> 00:57:20.469
Alejandra Guillen: I'm working with Antonio, you know where the the wearable for mental wellness.

772
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.830
Dan: And so you guys are trying to negotiate the Api contract.

773
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:27.029
Alejandra Guillen: Yes, we are one of those.

774
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:28.449
Dan: How important is that a contract to you.

775
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.393
Alejandra Guillen: That? That's a good question.

776
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:39.769
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, no, very important. Actually, we would like to follow up with you as well on that, then. But we believe that this is the form factor.

777
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:58.990
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: People use 1 HA day. This thing. We want people to use it 12 HA day like, you're wearable. Okay, so this is just an entry point for us to start testing our app and keep testing the algorithm with a company that is established in this sector. But we wanna build our own hardware. There's gonna be as small as yours.

778
00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:09.750
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And maybe these guys can actually help us with manufacturing and hardware. We provide the the design. And we, we see these guys as a way to grow and start getting customers.

779
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:20.839
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: But but eventually wanna be like, you guys like having the smallest eg. Device in the world that is very cheap, and we can start selling door to door

780
00:58:21.211 --> 00:58:26.989
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: like you guys did. And I'm very inspired by what you. What are you teaching us today? It's been phenomenal. By the way.

781
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:29.030
Dan: If I can give you that device

782
00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.789
Dan: in 2 months.

783
00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.380
Dan: would you take it

784
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:34.659
Dan: that month device to last for

785
00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.580
Dan: you said people use for 12 months.

786
00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.849
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: What device the.

787
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:45.969
Dan: Device that you want to build. You said, you want to build device. We're used for 12 months. That's small in the world. If I can give you that device. Would you want it?

788
00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:47.680
Alejandra Guillen: Yes.

789
00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.290
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah.

790
00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.939
Dan: How much would you pay for that.

791
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:57.870
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So we we are still building it. So we we believe that we can build it for $50

792
00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:04.330
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and then charge maybe $100 and then charge maybe Han $200 on it.

793
00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:06.440
Dan: What if I give it to you for $10?

794
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:09.109
Alejandra Guillen: I want to know.

795
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:10.320
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah.

796
00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:11.930
Dan: You want to use your credit card.

797
00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.250
Dan: and we'll make this deal happen.

798
00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:15.540
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah.

799
00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:20.819
Dan: You see what I'm saying like, you just gotta add, you gotta let the other person talk more.

800
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:23.670
Dan: understand what they want, what they need.

801
00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:31.490
Dan: I still don't really know your product? To be frank, but just by asking you questions and you saying you you're going to tell me what you want.

802
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:34.759
Dan: And I just have to ask you that back.

803
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:39.320
Dan: So and our example like

804
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:41.390
Dan: and so like in your customer's example.

805
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.990
Dan: is around stress. I'm guessing stresses you guys working on? Or what is it.

806
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.990
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Stress and anxiety. Yes.

807
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:48.590
Dan: Social anxiety. Okay, so like.

808
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:50.599
Dan: do you have social anxiety?

809
00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:51.640
Dan: Yes, I do.

810
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:55.300
Dan: What? What like? How does it impact your life?

811
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.109
Dan: I can't sleep at night.

812
00:59:58.380 --> 00:59:59.849
Dan: How does that impact your life

813
01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:02.640
Dan: that you can't sleep at night? I struggle to work.

814
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:07.230
Dan: What? How's the stopping you've like struck? What makes you struggle, work with us?

815
01:00:07.742 --> 01:00:12.430
Dan: Because I know I whenever my boss talks to me, I get nervous, and then

816
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:14.260
Dan: I can ask for raise.

817
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.270
Dan: Oh.

818
01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:18.759
Dan: so how much raise you? Asked for $30,000.

819
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:24.700
Dan: So you're telling me that if you have the confidence and last social anxiety would get $30,000 more a year. Yep.

820
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:29.560
Dan: you know what I have this device for $100 or $200. They'll remove that for you.

821
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:30.799
Dan: Are you interested?

822
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:38.029
Dan: Right? Like having a conversation, you just start getting deeper, deeper, deeper. Why, why, why.

823
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.750
Dan: it lets you understand how to convince that person

824
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:49.170
Dan: first off. If you could say if you cancel the problem, don't you know? Don't invent something that's not possible. Right? Like, don't tell me you gotta cure cancer. If you can't cure cancer, please don't say that.

825
01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:52.170
Dan: But like what you're describing is very feasible.

826
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:55.250
Dan: you know, like that's realistic. I know. I believe that you guys can do this.

827
01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:55.950
Alejandra Guillen: Hmm.

828
01:00:56.216 --> 01:00:59.940
Dan: But the irony is, you gotta get revenue to make it happen right revenue

829
01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:01.749
Dan: capital and then building.

830
01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:04.479
Dan: But the way you get revenues understand the problem

831
01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:15.779
Dan: right? And I think that's the way you do it. You just keep asking those questions. All you really understand what it is because people like. I'm guessing some people like people aren't saying, oh, I wish I didn't have anxiety.

832
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:21.460
Dan: They're saying, I wish I didn't have anxiety, so I can get a girlfriend. I wish I didn't have an anxiety, so I can make friends.

833
01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.839
Dan: I wish I could have anxiety, so I get a raise to work.

834
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.649
Dan: you know. I wish I could. Exactly. So there's there's a reason for that

835
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:31.670
Dan: afterwards. It's not either worked about. They're worried about the things they're doing their day that are not accomplishing right.

836
01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:34.949
Dan: And then think about what is it that's driving that factor

837
01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:37.569
Dan: and addressing those things?

838
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.949
Dan: And then people are really willing to pay you after that.

839
01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.560
Dan: Does that help?

840
01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:43.979
Dan: Yes, yeah.

841
01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:44.690
Alejandra Guillen: Yeah, he does.

842
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:45.350
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Nothing.

843
01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:49.249
Dan: And sorry. My examples are maybe not as

844
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:54.419
Dan: great. They're doing it real life here in real time. So it's a little complicated without knowing your business or.

845
01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:56.580
Alejandra Guillen: They're actually paying.

846
01:01:56.770 --> 01:02:02.060
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: No, this is great. And basically you're saying converting the Jtbd interviews into sales calls basically

847
01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.569
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: start converting those into sales calls

848
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:07.520
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: yeah, understanding and converting sales.

849
01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:19.380
Dan: Yes, yeah, it's some. It's a little different, I'd say, because I think there. But there is overlap. But it's a little different, right? Jb, jobs will be done as a framework. It's a great framework, by the way, amazing framework.

850
01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:22.630
Dan: This one's a little bit earlier in a funnel

851
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:24.900
Dan: of more. Just

852
01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:28.690
Dan: I mean, it's kind of like paying to cash.

853
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:31.569
Dan: What?

854
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:33.209
Dan: Gdb is more like

855
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:38.399
Dan: one safe pay joots or like, what do you build for them right? How do you dress a solution?

856
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:42.309
Dan: Is it that device like, for example, does it really have to be a smallest device in the world?

857
01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.119
Dan: The people actually care. I'm not even sure it's a big device doesn't matter.

858
01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:52.820
Dan: Maybe it doesn't. Is it better for last 3 years or one month or 2 days like, so that that job should be done a lot of times about that as well.

859
01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.839
Dan: Because, for example, if the job is, they're afraid they're gonna look silly.

860
01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:01.280
Dan: That's why they want social anxiety. When you give a device that's huge, they can look at goofballs.

861
01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.650
Dan: Then again, you didn't. You create another problem for them?

862
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:13.809
Dan: Sold them. But then you invent a new problem from now. They didn't want to wear. Those things are embarrassed, right? And so you should. That's more jealous. We don't helps address that a little bit more.

863
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:16.460
Dan: So I'm probably earlier in the funnel. Actually.

864
01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.360
Alejandra Guillen: And Josh, we.

865
01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.510
Dan: Probably like me, and then just be done next.

866
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.049
Dan: But really, Jeff's a bit about the West as a good guy. I think you guys talked to him really, really sharp guy and really helpful.

867
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:31.000
Dan: Anything else.

868
01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:37.410
Chloe Lannert: We're running short on time. Should we see if we can run through a few more slides.

869
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:40.770
Dan: Sure. Sure. One slide, I think one in there now. So

870
01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.379
Dan: let me see if I can open this.

871
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:50.589
Dan: But this is great. I'm I'm glad you guys are asking questions. This is more for you guys than this for me. So I'm gonna make sure you guys are getting value whatever value that

872
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:52.530
Dan: you think that drives.

873
01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.239
Dan: Let's see, where's his deck?

874
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:09.940
Dan: I don't even know where Powerpoint is anymore. Let's try some.

875
01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.040
Dan: Oh, there it is.

876
01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:27.040
Dan: alright back to business guys back to business. Can you guys hear me?

877
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:30.109
Dan: So any questions on this slide?

878
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:34.620
Dan: Nope.

879
01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:35.959
Dan: our next slide?

880
01:04:37.508 --> 01:04:40.540
Dan: So I think the the thing about is

881
01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:41.780
Dan: this is

882
01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:45.530
Dan: an important self awareness exercise. You guys need to do this

883
01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.940
Dan: is

884
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.770
Dan: understand?

885
01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:53.240
Dan: Like, truly, this is this is the really hard exercise, because startups, because I think

886
01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.170
Dan: we as founders, have to be a little bit crazy and a little bit

887
01:04:56.630 --> 01:05:03.909
Dan: egotistical to start a company say, like, Hey, I'm gonna quit my job, and I'm gonna start something that's never existed before. It's it's a little cocky, right? Let's be honest here.

888
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:14.519
Dan: and that skill comes with sometimes lack of self awareness, because you don't know you can fail. And you're like, I can anyone, you know, you have to be a little crazy in the same time cocking, but all self aware which is hard. And so

889
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:16.700
Dan: where are your actual pain points

890
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:19.899
Dan: in regard to sales marketing all this stuff?

891
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.180
Dan: What I mean by that.

892
01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:24.209
Dan: it always comes with the humans. Right? So

893
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:27.980
Dan: if it's you and your partner, let's say it's 2 of you guys

894
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.199
Dan: which one of you guys is actually in charge of this.

895
01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:37.469
Dan: What I mean by that is only 2 jobs matter, only 2 build and sell.

896
01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.429
Dan: Are you building? Are you selling.

897
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:48.110
Dan: because the biggest mistake that I've seen over and over and over is, you have an engineer start company and guess what they hire. Another engineer find another cofound engineer because it's easy

898
01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.910
Dan: or they have a product manager and they find no product, manager, designer, designer, or even

899
01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:56.730
Dan: you might have to salesperson or marketer. But then you also hire a marketer right? And they're bringing marketers co-founder.

900
01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:08.680
Dan: It shows Builder sales. You. Just divide that and so ask yourself like, is it me? And where's my partner? Because a lot of people say like, Oh, we're both kind of doing building. We're both kind of doing sales. No, no, no, no one does sales. One does building.

901
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:10.910
Dan: So really asking yourself.

902
01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:12.209
Dan: which one am I?

903
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:14.629
Dan: And dividing this.

904
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:17.529
Dan: you guys aren't both selling one of you guys, it's selling one's building.

905
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:21.219
Dan: And if you guys don't have that that you're truly like.

906
01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.870
Dan: oh, it's both of us, but we're kind of both bad at it.

907
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.660
Dan: One of 2 things needs to happen.

908
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:30.210
Dan: either one who needs to get really freaking quick, good, pretty quick.

909
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.069
Dan: And say, I'm focused on this.

910
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:37.140
Dan: Well, your focus says I'm gonna get really quick, good, or you need to get another co-founder, third, fourth.

911
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:45.419
Dan: or one. You got to realize. Maybe I'm not supposed to be part of a founder, because I'm not the right person. But you have to determine that really, really quickly.

912
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:48.869
Dan: because you can have the best freaking product in the world.

913
01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.160
Dan: But if people don't know about it doesn't matter.

914
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:53.429
Dan: That's the irony here. It doesn't matter.

915
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.850
Dan: There's so many products. They're just incredible. But people don't know they exist.

916
01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.220
Dan: And so

917
01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:02.340
Dan: I mean, I think a good exercise is you know.

918
01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.570
Dan: Go around the room like Lisa.

919
01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:05.930
Dan: who's in your team.

920
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:17.163
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: We are, I think, the only ones with the I'm the brand person we have a fantastic CTO, and that the sales genius. So I think we we're onto this.

921
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.360
Dan: Okay, what about you, David?

922
01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:26.239
David Akinyemi: We have me product. And then my CTO. Was a full second engineer.

923
01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:28.180
Dan: Who's doing marketing sales.

924
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:29.950
David Akinyemi: Me!

925
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:32.660
Dan: But you, you said you do product alright.

926
01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.129
David Akinyemi: Yeah, product management, background.

927
01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:39.000
Dan: So you so you're doing, are, do you think the right person to do marketing sales.

928
01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.670
David Akinyemi: On the team. Yes, in terms of

929
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.922
David Akinyemi: the best skill set for it.

930
01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:52.260
David Akinyemi: decent above average, but not not my expertise.

931
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:56.670
Dan: Do you think you'll be good enough in 3 months? How good do you think you'll grown that.

932
01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.859
David Akinyemi: I think it'll be good enough for 3 months.

933
01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:05.010
Dan: Okay, well, it's good. But that means that you should stop doing product completely. You should do 0 product. Going forward. Your CTO needs to product.

934
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:07.380
Dan: They need to expand their skills and own product.

935
01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:17.109
Dan: So you could hyper focus to do marketing. Get really freaking good at it. If you're doing some marketing. And you're not. By the way, if you're incredible. And of course you could do millions things if you're not saying you're elite to 99 percentile

936
01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:19.449
Dan: need to pause all other things.

937
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.050
Dan: and only do that

938
01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:24.910
Dan: literally do that and nothing else. And your CTO needs own product

939
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.490
Dan: in that time period.

940
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.249
Dan: because without any thanks. Go ahead.

941
01:08:29.609 --> 01:08:31.359
David Akinyemi: I just ask, how do you manage

942
01:08:31.629 --> 01:08:33.159
David Akinyemi: those roles with like

943
01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:35.839
David Akinyemi: collaboration when it comes to

944
01:08:36.297 --> 01:08:44.649
David Akinyemi: feedback and iterative loops? Like, for example, we have roles where someone is a driver, but we still also have these things where?

945
01:08:45.093 --> 01:08:51.199
David Akinyemi: Let's say, George may make a decision I disagree with. And I'm like, Hey, actually, I don't want you to do it this way. You're gonna do it that way.

946
01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:53.119
David Akinyemi: Do you think that kind of

947
01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:57.209
David Akinyemi: contradicts the ideas of, Hey, this is your role. You should be doing this or.

948
01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:59.620
Dan: Are you pre-prot? Are you pre revenue or post revenue?

949
01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:01.370
David Akinyemi: We're pre-product pure revenue.

950
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:02.899
Dan: Pre-revenant.

951
01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.599
David Akinyemi: Correct. Yeah.

952
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:10.169
Dan: Until you get revenue, and you get feedback from your customers that are paying customers. Not I, you know not ideal customers. Interviews

953
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.030
Dan: like none of it matters

954
01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.050
Dan: like get paid customers.

955
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:17.280
Dan: So your job right now was convince people to pay you

956
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:20.020
Dan: and get them to pay you the moment they pay you.

957
01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:26.849
Dan: and you ask them what they want, or if they're kept leaving while you're leaving, or first paying you more, what is that you want?

958
01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:32.449
Dan: Then it's no longer debate. You know exactly what they want, and it's not your opinion, his opinion. It's the customer's opinion.

959
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.509
Dan: but that those things don't matter

960
01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:38.170
Dan: if that person builds the wrong shit.

961
01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.979
Dan: and you don't have customers doesn't matter

962
01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.250
Dan: right. If you have customers to build around, shit that you can adjust.

963
01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:50.289
Dan: But you like. It doesn't matter like whether it's they build the right or the wrong stuff. It simply doesn't matter right now. That's the irony here.

964
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:54.860
Dan: because you don't actually know you're you're, you're basically, you guys are

965
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:56.960
Dan: debating intellectually.

966
01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:03.049
Dan: And it's more of like again, as I mentioned, is the the difficulty about the self awareness. Here is because

967
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:07.609
Dan: for you to start a company you have to be really freaking, smart, and really charismatic and really like

968
01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.910
Dan: confident.

969
01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.250
Dan: Which means that

970
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:14.389
Dan: your co-founders also knows those criteria and those things clash

971
01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:19.569
Dan: because but in the end customer wins. But with that customer you don't have a tie breaker.

972
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:22.240
Dan: so if you just let them build shit.

973
01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:26.210
Dan: It could be the wrong shit. And assuming it's gonna be a lot of substantial wrong stuff. But it doesn't matter

974
01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.370
Dan: right

975
01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:41.950
Dan: what he should theoretically could do is almost help you assist with sales. For example, you're convincing customers, and you got like 3 signed up or 3, will the page you. But they said, We're going to cancel unless you give him this feature. Then you tell them, hey, dude, this is, they're literally saying this build this

976
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:56.650
Dan: over time you'll find out like sometimes you go in wrong directions. You might be like, Oh, we both, for like 5 people, but 1 million people on something else. But find out a later. And it's over time. When you have 20 engineers doing stuff for you right now. It's sell, build, sell, build. It doesn't rest doesn't matter. And so.

977
01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:57.150
David Akinyemi: Yeah, you.

978
01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:04.760
Dan: Say, I'm gonna do only sales for marketing sales whatever for 3 months, because I need to become a elite. At this I need to become the best in the world at this.

979
01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.449
Dan: So either you can do that or you can't. If you can't do it, put someone else in place, you can.

980
01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:14.890
Dan: but the only you can do that fast like people spend 20 years and still bad marketing sales. How do you do in 3 months?

981
01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:18.749
Dan: Absolute focus. You can't do anything else. Everything else is distraction.

982
01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.829
Dan: I mean, that's what I said. We didn't have swag

983
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:22.620
Dan: for 3 years.

984
01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:31.499
Dan: we didn't really spend much time with investors. We didn't do. Pr, we didn't do SEO. Sorry. Where was that SEO for a while, because it's just like

985
01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:41.089
Dan: I don't know what I'm doing SEO, for who is my customer like I could do SEO for ex like we did SEO. We would think how much time would have spent 5 SEO for the buy hacker, tech Bros.

986
01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:51.350
Dan: I would have got all SEO, but nobody would have signed up because they don't care about product. They care. It's a different demographic. So then you're going around direction because you don't have customers right? You're guessing you're just throwing, you know.

987
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:53.519
Dan: and you need customers to tell you the right direction.

988
01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:05.159
David Akinyemi: Definitely makes sense. I guess how important is building then, in that sense. And so our theology has been, hey, we don't need to build. And unless we have someone who's paying to then start building. And so we've kind of

989
01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:23.210
David Akinyemi: actually, almost become strictly a marketing and selling team where the goal right now is to just sell and marketing. We're not really building. We're just using the feedback we get from these conversations to improve our marketing but in that sense our roles have kind of become more ambiguous in the sense where

990
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:31.530
David Akinyemi: my co-founder is a builder. But we're not building. I'm a product manager. But we're not developing the product. We're just selling and marketing kind of thing.

991
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:32.880
Dan: But you haven't sold yet right.

992
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.900
David Akinyemi: Hmm! No.

993
01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.089
Dan: So until you sell, you haven't really actually become marketing sales. You like, you talk to our marketing sales a lot.

994
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.569
Dan: You try marketing sales a lot. But you didn't actually converse right? It's kind of people say, like.

995
01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:46.790
Dan: you know.

996
01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.629
Dan: I'm kind of pregnant.

997
01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:53.710
Dan: It's either pregnant or not pregnant. You don't kind of get pregnant right? And same to this. You don't kind of sell

998
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:56.110
Dan: until you sell right?

999
01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:02.700
Dan: Yeah. And so right now you're, I think you think your marketer is sale, but you're actually not

1000
01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:04.389
Dan: when you get.

1001
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.900
David Akinyemi: Gotcha.

1002
01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:12.900
Dan: People, but give you pay you and your marketing sales here you got it. And in regard to building, there's exceptions what I'm saying, the exception is this.

1003
01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:19.239
Dan: if you are again building AI like like, if you're like open AI, you're building something innovative that like

1004
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:29.749
Dan: that's different. Like I mentioned before. If you're building something like rockets, you probably get to build those before you sell right. If you're bringing. If you're doing cancer research, probably to build it before you sell.

1005
01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:34.139
Dan: But that's this. That's like the 1% of things that are like

1006
01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:36.390
Dan: unusual, right? Unique

1007
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:47.090
Dan: majority of the companies here. I'm guessing 9 out of 10 companies here are probably not in that bucket. Maybe there's one here. So again, ask you, I don't know if anyone does anybody feel like they're that company where you're like the rare bird where, like.

1008
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:51.799
Dan: you could basically be unprofitable because you build like a biotech company. That's gonna Ipo with 0 revenue.

1009
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.450
Dan: Is anyone like that? Okay? Well, great. We at least remove that exception.

1010
01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.540
Dan: Maybe somebody selected messages here.

1011
01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:01.060
Dan: Someone maybe did.

1012
01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:05.879
Vincent Lucero: Yeah, it was. We're doing capital markets. So it's a little bit different.

1013
01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:11.460
Dan: So what do you guys do in the capital markets?

1014
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:12.330
Dan: Is it so.

1015
01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:15.880
Vincent Lucero: So we we essentially help facilitate

1016
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:35.529
Vincent Lucero: Fintech lenders to get access to revolving debt, capital debt facilities. So we basically connect self credit card from Tech to 2015, with a hundred 1 million dollars from Bank of California and facilitate that as a a deal. We also are focused on decisioning and providing AI decision. That's a little bit more inclusive to help people at lower credit. Bans.

1017
01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:37.489
Dan: Why do you think that?

1018
01:14:38.367 --> 01:14:41.079
Dan: Yours is different, and than everyone else's?

1019
01:14:41.920 --> 01:15:03.870
Vincent Lucero: It's different, just because of the order of magnitude, of like trillions of dollars that we're working with. And then this individual deal size and the fact that, like our time to our first sale, is likely going to be at least a year. Right? So it is a little bit more like a hardware type startup from that perspective, not obviously, like actually like building rockets. But the timeline to first launch essentially is similar.

1020
01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.050
Dan: Question for you.

1021
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:07.410
Dan: Yeah, how do people currently do this?

1022
01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:09.940
Vincent Lucero: Fis and Pfizer.

1023
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:17.630
Vincent Lucero: So essentially, they use enterprise solutions, or they build it in house. And typically they just don't have the talent in house.

1024
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:22.190
Dan: Do they ever? Does anybody ever do it manually? Do they have? Is there ever done relationship wise? We're like.

1025
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:23.629
Dan: I'm friends with Banker.

1026
01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:25.789
Dan: I'm friends with a capital manager

1027
01:15:25.890 --> 01:15:27.999
Dan: allocator that can help you make this deal happen.

1028
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:42.159
Vincent Lucero: So that's the thing. Is that time to actually do the deal, even through the manual process, without actually building it still in itself takes months to close these debt facilities, because the due diligence necessary by the risk committees is a multi month process on both sides.

1029
01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.950
Dan: Got it.

1030
01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:49.730
Dan: can you use a earlier metric then, because the deal size so big can use a metric of

1031
01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.879
Dan: people that agree to work with you on a manual version of this.

1032
01:15:54.280 --> 01:16:03.162
Vincent Lucero: And that's exactly what we're doing. We're using Lois, which Neil hates. But we we also recognize the reality of of of sales cycles for enterprise, finance.

1033
01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:09.999
Dan: Yup, I mean, I hate otherwise, to some extent it's really, I think it depends what's in there

1034
01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:15.779
Dan: and how in depth, if it's something like we're considering working with you. Not very specific. But there's some other ways that are like

1035
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:17.580
Dan: almost legally right.

1036
01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:24.530
Vincent Lucero: Yeah, ours is gonna have teeth around. If they choose to use one of the debt deals that we broker, we get 1% broker fee on like the 100 million dollars.

1037
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:27.370
Dan: Yep, yeah, yeah, that's interesting. Yeah.

1038
01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:37.110
Dan: yeah. I mean, we could talk about more than does. But it's there's definitely ways to figure this out, and you should. You should probably define definition sales there right? Maybe it's Loi. Maybe it's a little deeper in funnel. Maybe it's a stronger loi.

1039
01:16:37.511 --> 01:16:42.810
Dan: I think when Neil's probably coming from, and I'm not gonna speak for him. But I would. I've seen all the wise they're so weak

1040
01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.299
Dan: don't mean anything like I've seen Eliza. We're like

1041
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:51.630
Dan: one we launch. You agree to work with us. You agree to explore working with us that, my God! Nobody takes that seriously.

1042
01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.850
Dan: but I've seen it otherwise. Where we're like.

1043
01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.609
Dan: Here's a prepayment for $20,000 as a

1044
01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:00.509
Dan: guarantee that we'll work with you when we, when this goes live

1045
01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.330
Dan: right like

1046
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:03.779
Dan: that's more legit holiday

1047
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:06.010
Dan: you've got for sure.

1048
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.509
Vincent Lucero: Need to have some teeth in it.

1049
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.410
Dan: But yeah, I'm saying you could still do prepayment all wise. I've seen prepayments all wise.

1050
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:31.279
Vincent Lucero: Yeah, the prepayment part is hard, because, like it's, it's a bit conditional on the actual debt deal going through. And our actual like AI. We is not yet ready, but we could potentially be asking for nre upfront and then discount the amount of broker feed that we take just to show the upfront value.

1051
01:17:31.479 --> 01:17:38.470
Dan: I mean, you could do escrow account. You could say, Hey, can you put it? The pause on escrow account? So we take you seriously because we're gonna build all these things for you.

1052
01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.000
Dan: You know, there's ways to think about it. It's

1053
01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:43.910
Dan: show more commitments.

1054
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:46.350
Dan: There's definitely ways around it.

1055
01:17:47.338 --> 01:17:53.890
Dan: Cause you wanna waste to stop wasting time. I think we tried something where all these research organization reach out us. We wanna partner with you guys. But we, you know, we're, gonna

1056
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:57.500
Dan: you know, work with you in one year from now, because we have to get off the approval.

1057
01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:06.810
Dan: And my marketing sales team actually spent months with these people, and still $0 revenue. And what I kind of cost to be spent is probably like $100,000 of labor cost.

1058
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:12.179
Dan: Negotiate all these deals like, don't we have anything? Or describing the process? I basically have a call. I was like.

1059
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:15.210
Dan: we're happy to work with you. I need you a 5% deposit.

1060
01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:19.949
Dan: And like 95% of companies dropped off. They disappeared. 5% gave a deposit.

1061
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.649
Dan: Now we're taking it more seriously

1062
01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:26.490
Dan: right? And so it helps you also understand that point of view.

1063
01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:29.470
Dan: So

1064
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.305
Dan: cool.

1065
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:36.160
Dan: What else? Anyone else here? What about you, Kevin? Who's the sales versus market person.

1066
01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.570
Kelvin Alaneme: Okay.

1067
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:41.440
Kelvin Alaneme: Okay. Oops.

1068
01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.740
Kevin: Sorry I thought you, said Kevin Kelvin. Sorry.

1069
01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.390
Dan: Yep.

1070
01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:48.459
Kelvin Alaneme: I think we are 2 Kevin's. Yeah.

1071
01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:55.220
Kelvin Alaneme: So I'm I'm the CEO and the salesperson the building person is my CTO.

1072
01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.669
Dan: Got it. How good are you at sales.

1073
01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:04.390
Kelvin Alaneme: I've been selling since I was 5, so I'm trying.

1074
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:05.570
Dan: So good

1075
01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:06.820
Dan: rebels.

1076
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:11.719
Dan: Okay, what about you, Sergei?

1077
01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:18.470
Sergey: Yeah, I'm I'm with Lisa. And so I

1078
01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:20.680
Sergey: I'm building.

1079
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.129
Dan: Okay, perfect.

1080
01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:28.960
Dan: So you guys, are you guys are the dream team on the build or the okay? Awesome. Nelson, what about you guys.

1081
01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.670
Dan: You're also with Lisa.

1082
01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:34.305
Nelson Mitchell: No

1083
01:19:35.383 --> 01:19:41.726
Nelson Mitchell: I'm I'm separate. So I'm the I'm the product guy. And I'm working with the software engineer

1084
01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:46.047
Nelson Mitchell: And I'm trying to do sales and marketing over the Internet.

1085
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:48.659
Nelson Mitchell: just testing that out. So.

1086
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:50.959
Dan: So it's just you 2.

1087
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:52.110
Dan: Yep.

1088
01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.850
Dan: So I mean, it sounds like, you guys need to break that roll apart right?

1089
01:19:56.210 --> 01:20:03.430
Dan: Or maybe you stop stuff. And your CTO does engineer security and tough engineer does a product. And you just do marketing sales.

1090
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:04.860
Dan: Yep.

1091
01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.379
Dan: yeah, that's the thing I think

1092
01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:12.110
Dan: you can't like again, test out marketing sales like

1093
01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:20.709
Dan: it's only it either works or doesn't right, because, like, you can't go to investors when you raise money and say, like, I need money. I need cash from you guys in my company.

1094
01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:26.529
Dan: So I can test out more stuff. They're gonna be like, well, what did you test already. And you're like, well, I only did a little bit because I was doing product

1095
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.099
Dan: like, no one's ever gonna do that.

1096
01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:30.519
Dan: I've seen amazing products

1097
01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:39.960
Dan: way better proximized with shitty re, with shitty revenue than nobody invested. I've also sent seen some terrible products with awesome either revenue or just user counts that works, too.

1098
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:42.950
Dan: And people just throw money in with. I don't even understand what it does.

1099
01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.760
Dan: No idea, right?

1100
01:20:45.365 --> 01:20:52.999
Dan: I'm assuming most you guys want to raise money. So you should really, I mean, after I mean, this is perfect for you, probably more than some that you guys should really think about. And also. And it's either

1101
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:55.920
Dan: purely marketing sales phone

1102
01:20:56.230 --> 01:20:57.600
Dan: forward, starting today.

1103
01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.159
Dan: or you're missing a third cofounder.

1104
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.289
Dan: And which one is it

1105
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:06.340
Dan: because this is the only thing should be doing all day every day.

1106
01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:07.960
Dan: Yep.

1107
01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.953
Nelson Mitchell: Probably both

1108
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:11.620
Nelson Mitchell: get a third cofounder.

1109
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:13.580
Nelson Mitchell: Okay.

1110
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.449
Dan: That person. Yeah, I mean it. This is hard. It really is hard.

1111
01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.000
Dan: Because we all like

1112
01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.890
Dan: you guys should keep going like this

1113
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.520
Dan: and understand us.

1114
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.009
Dan: What about you, Mark?

1115
01:21:29.155 --> 01:21:45.289
Malc: I'm CEO. So yeah, more the operational side of the business. My brother CTO, I would say, I'm proficient at the market. But you just echo must been in my mind. You just echo the last point. It's just carving out the time to do it and do it consistently and and do it, you know, at a high degree rather than kind of an hour here or 2 h there. Type of thing.

1116
01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:48.560
Dan: That's what I'm saying. I it should. It should be the only thing you're doing.

1117
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:53.740
Dan: Again. Another thing I don't know. If Neil still on. He's gonna be mad. More again. Me.

1118
01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:57.150
Dan: you guys know, you guys do that weekly update of all the metrics and stuff like that.

1119
01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:02.000
Dan: We were still focused on, only build and sell, build and sell.

1120
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:11.490
Dan: I think we missed like 90% of updates where we do the call. You know, the weekly meeting, and we didn't even update the sheets, and Neil's like, what are the numbers? I'm like? Oh, shit! I sorry!

1121
01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:15.053
Dan: And again Neil was very upset. Sorry, Neil.

1122
01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.529
NSG: It's all good dude I got over it.

1123
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:28.420
NSG: My rule with them, Dan, is that if they're making money it's all good like, if if what they're doing is selling and making progress, then I forgive them. But if they're doing other shit that isn't relevant, then I have a problem.

1124
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:36.679
Dan: Exactly because your generated revenue, Neil, get over it. He got over. He got over swag. He got over update updates.

1125
01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.789
Dan: But if you're not generating, no matter how amazing your product is.

1126
01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.190
Dan: nobody gives a shit.

1127
01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:57.370
Dan: and this is very, very hard conversation to have with yourself, and I'm being a little bit, you know, Nippy, here, because it's such a critical thing, because there's no more important part than what you guys are doing now, and as I'm going through. Some of you guys are lucky that you already have this part. And I'm you guys are bounds ahead

1128
01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:01.849
Dan: and you're likely to success just exponentially increase everyone else. But whoever doesn't have it, you need to do this

1129
01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:03.619
Dan: like it's so hard

1130
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:09.539
Dan: like, maybe get a drink with your partner and just talk about this, because it's just so critical.

1131
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:23.100
Dan: Should we go next slide? I know there's more people that I can pick, but it's to me. I think this is such an just like step one that needs to happen before anything else happens. And sometimes people care about stuff. 5 and 6 and like, we talked about podcasts and Youtube.

1132
01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.209
Dan: But if there's no on your team, we could do that. Does it really matter like.

1133
01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:27.739
Dan: it's a great channel. But like

1134
01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:29.620
Dan: it doesn't. It won't succeed right?

1135
01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:35.790
Dan: Just like I mentioned, I wouldn't be able to do. I'm here, not the guy, Felipe. Were you gonna say something.

1136
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:47.559
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah, no, thank you for that. And with just there was one question, because I have my co-founder, who is more into retail and home furnishing stores that we are setting in that area.

1137
01:23:48.136 --> 01:24:04.589
Felipe - Gohaus: I'm more into real estate, and I have my content. Real estate. So we kind of divided the the task of selling. She's more into that one, me into the other one. But she's only she's also doing product because she's an architect, and she knows about decoration and what we're doing.

1138
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:06.780
Felipe - Gohaus: So it's it's a better

1139
01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:17.289
Felipe - Gohaus: way to do it is that that I I go on sale. I've been. I'm not the great person on selling, but I, doing some business development before, were the in my work plus years.

1140
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:21.120
Felipe - Gohaus: But it do you think it's better that she focus on building.

1141
01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:24.550
Felipe - Gohaus: And I focus in sale or this, how do? How do you see that.

1142
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:29.040
Dan: I think one of you needs to focus on building what I'm selling. I don't know who's better which one but

1143
01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.210
Dan: it could be either one, but it has to be one person, 1 one person there.

1144
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:43.389
Dan: It's very difficult to do product and sales at the same time it as a one individual. It's just, it's too distracting. Again, if you already are an expert in the street like there's exceptions to rule right like

1145
01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:52.280
Dan: this is your now nineteenth company, or your third company, where you've done sales. And now you're like, Oh, I got the sales to figure it out unlocked down. I'm an expert is, and sure you could also do product, because

1146
01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.320
Dan: because you may already know Joe Rogan.

1147
01:24:54.410 --> 01:25:00.390
Dan: and guess what like, you don't need to spend where I spend your years trying to get in this podcast you already know Joe, and you call Joe. And you're like, Hey, Joe, can I come on

1148
01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:06.190
Dan: super easy? You might be friends with the guys at Walmart and target super. Easy. Right? So if you have those connections.

1149
01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:08.380
Dan: then you're good.

1150
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:15.279
Dan: If you don't have those connections, then you and your party inside who's building selling. And it's literally split. So only 2 jobs

1151
01:25:16.395 --> 01:25:20.469
Dan: question back to you. Do you have those connections that you think you need that, you can just get it like this?

1152
01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:29.409
Felipe - Gohaus: No, no, no, no, no, I mean I have some, but it's not like just like that. No, we had to go, and we had to do research, we had to begin. So it makes sense.

1153
01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:36.419
Dan: And so it's important. There are exceptions, as I'm describing their exceptions, if one of you like. If ours connected like at the Sea of Walmart. Just, cousin, guess what like

1154
01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:42.199
Dan: cool that'll work like. Don't worry about pro selling them. I just build awesome product.

1155
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.780
Dan: but not a lot of us have that, like

1156
01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.270
Dan: some people do, and but not many

1157
01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:50.470
Dan: cool

1158
01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.720
Dan: everyone else. Good. Alright! I thought I saw I saw some more polls.

1159
01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:58.289
Art- Clubreq: I don't have a connection with Walmart guys. Just Fyi. Okay? Alright.

1160
01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.721
Dan: Oh, you said, okay, time.

1161
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.449
Chloe Lannert: Andy, go ahead.

1162
01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:14.729
andy - lexir: Yeah, I just have a quick question on the like, build versus cell. What if you have like? You have some customers, and there's like an operations component. What's your take on like

1163
01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:16.470
andy - lexir: keeping those customers.

1164
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:17.160
Dan: Perfect.

1165
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:19.739
Dan: Once you get really good at billing and selling.

1166
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:21.700
Dan: you hire a third person

1167
01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:23.880
Dan: maintaining revenue.

1168
01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:32.299
Dan: So me, my co-founder, is me selling, marketing, my co-founder building, and then we brought a third cofounder, first employee. But she was a first employee, but third cofounder.

1169
01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.069
Dan: She was a dietician. We, her job was maintained. Revenue

1170
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:40.279
Dan: you only you have to earn the right to get that third person.

1171
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:44.029
Dan: Yeah, a lot of times actually build cell

1172
01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:55.530
Dan: one person, then it's 1 one, and it goes to Bill to sell 3 Bill 3, cell 4, Bill. And he keeps expanding those 2 jobs. And once you earn the rights because you're doing such a great job to hire this person that's maintaining revenue.

1173
01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.509
Dan: You have to earn that right. You don't just get that right.

1174
01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:08.330
Dan: and also please ignore the pr firms like you don't need a Pr. Person. You don't need an accountant. You don't need an Hr. Person. Those things do not matter for a long time.

1175
01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.580
Dan: And yeah, Calvin, you had a question.

1176
01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:20.109
Chloe Lannert: Super quickly. I just wanna let everyone know that we're at time. If you need to jump go ahead. But

1177
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.459
Chloe Lannert: yeah, Dan, if you're happy to stay and answer more questions that would be important.

1178
01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:30.029
Dan: Yeah, yeah, I'm happy. I'll send you guys a deck because I the deck was actually very different. There's a lot of other topics. I think we're still on slide to

1179
01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:30.710
Dan: yeah.

1180
01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:44.559
Kelvin Alaneme: Thank you. Thank you so much. Just a very quick one for 2 persons co-founder, because what I'm hearing from you is that one person should focus on sales and so it it. Have you seen it that

1181
01:27:45.120 --> 01:28:03.780
Kelvin Alaneme: the person that is building more like the CTO will also be in charge of product, while the CEO focuses on sales. And then for those 2 persons co-founder, what is your thoughts about? You know some people would tell you. You need to hire a marketing person, you know. Let's say your sales

1182
01:28:03.970 --> 01:28:15.760
Kelvin Alaneme: skills are decent, but not maybe top tier. At what point do you need to hire a marketing person versus getting a co-founder, which one will you recommend.

1183
01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:23.849
Dan: So the first part, maybe I saw her 2 questions. Right? Make sure. I understand correctly. First question was.

1184
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.520
Dan: you're saying that

1185
01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.619
Dan: should you let the other, your co-founder, will focus on product, and you don't touch product. So you do sales marketing.

1186
01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:31.440
Dan: So first question.

1187
01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:56.644
Kelvin Alaneme: Yeah, because because technically there, sometimes there is the leadership aspect. There is the product and the you know the the sales. But you know, if you are CEO, most times you know the sales fall upon you because you know you are front facing you, also getting those first few customers and all. So when we're talking of products, so to speak, should we leave it.

1188
01:28:57.010 --> 01:29:08.360
Dan: Leave that person until you get customers. Once you get customers, you guys can decide. And a lot of times the a lot of times you'll see the seal will have more product insight. But at beginning you leave to the person, let them folks on product.

1189
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.390
Kelvin Alaneme: Okay.

1190
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:11.480
Dan: Enabled the wrong stuff. That's okay.

1191
01:29:12.776 --> 01:29:14.350
Dan: Once you get customers.

1192
01:29:14.490 --> 01:29:22.400
Dan: then you could adjust and you give feedback, and then then you can. Things can change? That's the first question. Second question is, when do you decide if you want to hire marketing or co-founder, or whatever else?

1193
01:29:24.230 --> 01:29:26.319
Dan: one is again. Self awareness. How good are you

1194
01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:29.199
Dan: if you think like, hey? I can learn this.

1195
01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:31.700
Dan: then you should do it. If you think

1196
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.700
Dan: honestly, I don't think I can to get a lead at that fast cause. Here's the thing.

1197
01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:40.279
Dan: I'm sure, like I'm sure, that I can learn like python.

1198
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.320
Dan: and get really really good at it in 6 years.

1199
01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.170
Dan: but I have 3 months.

1200
01:29:45.580 --> 01:30:00.769
Dan: I don't think I could do in 3 months. So questions how quickly can get there in 3 months or 6 months, because, remember, you will run on money. That's your living factor here. So if you get there in 3, 6 months, you're really freaking good if you but if you focus, then you should do it. If you don't think you can get really good, then you need a co-founder.

1201
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:03.879
Dan: When I say really good at this point, I'll say, probably like

1202
01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:09.599
Dan: a minus right. One thing I've discovered over the years is that

1203
01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:13.819
Dan: if you get obsessed about a topic. Least me. If I get obsessed about a topic

1204
01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:17.900
Dan: I can get to like a 90, if 90 fifth percentile within like 2, 3 months.

1205
01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:21.839
Dan: even better than people have done it for 2030 years. Because you gotta remember.

1206
01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:30.379
Dan: most people look at a job as this a job. So just because they're Vp. Of marketing at Mcdonald's or craft.

1207
01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:38.980
Dan: They're not actually that much better. They've just been. They've like, got this job and slowly moved up. But their goals are clock in and clock out a lot of people actually optimizing for work life balance.

1208
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.900
Kelvin Alaneme: Hmm.

1209
01:30:40.330 --> 01:30:43.190
Dan: As a founder. You're optimizing for skill, improvements

1210
01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:50.820
Dan: and growth of your skills in a company. They're not. Their goal is to how do I make as much money as possible while working as little as possible.

1211
01:30:51.090 --> 01:31:06.170
Dan: So if you offer 250 KA year to work 40 h, or 250 K to work 10 h. Everyone will, almost almost everyone take 10 h. Right? So they're optimized for different things. So basically, I kind of do a 3 step process of learning incredibly fast, like I can pick any topic and get really elite

1212
01:31:06.777 --> 01:31:12.619
Dan: quickly. And my step process is really 3 parts like Facebook ads. Never done. Facebook ads in my life.

1213
01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:13.980
Dan: Step one

1214
01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:17.800
Dan: allocate, 2, $300. Know when this is going to go down in trash.

1215
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:19.939
Dan: You're gonna get nothing out of this but learning.

1216
01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:33.470
Dan: And then just run ads, press on every freaking button and take obsessive notes like I usually have tens of pages, notes of like, what does this button? Why does this button there? What does this look like? What does the image so obsessive? It? Second thing is consumer, enormous amount of content

1217
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:37.799
Dan: on that topic. Youtube, podcast whatever it is.

1218
01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:45.059
Dan: third, one is. Once you have notes from both those areas reach out to people one or 2 years ahead of you.

1219
01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:49.470
Dan: and just get on a call with them and have them answer your questions for you

1220
01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:51.830
Dan: when I say, that is.

1221
01:31:52.100 --> 01:32:01.920
Dan: don't say, Hey, teach me marketing. Teach me Facebook. Don't say that. Say, Hey, I tried running an ad that looks like this, but it didn't work. But then this ad worked.

1222
01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:03.650
Dan: I'm thinking it's this.

1223
01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:04.820
Dan: what do you think?

1224
01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:09.800
Dan: You'd be amazed? How many people were incredibly successful? Be open, answering a question

1225
01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:12.539
Dan: like, I've gotten in touch with like

1226
01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:16.200
Dan: Mark Cuban, because I've asked questions like that like, it's just literally cold email.

1227
01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:18.820
Dan: But I'm specific. My requests.

1228
01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:22.259
Dan: The request that I hate and people hate is.

1229
01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:26.369
Dan: Hey, I really love what you're doing. Neutral sense. Can I talk to you about marketing and Facebook?

1230
01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:32.259
Dan: I'm not even gonna answer that email like, you can, Youtube, how to use Facebook ads like this is not a new topic.

1231
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:34.320
Dan: But if you're specific in your question like, I think.

1232
01:32:34.643 --> 01:32:40.710
Dan: Antony, you guess your question is very specific. One example is, Antonio sent me a question. I think it was you right, Antonio?

1233
01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.199
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yes. Yeah.

1234
01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:47.279
Dan: Oh, it was about. It was very specific about Api contracts. Sandra's not stranded like that is not Google.

1235
01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:48.650
Kelvin Alaneme: Okay.

1236
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:58.339
Dan: And that's like I wanted to answer, and I gave some answers. Probably still not good enough. I'll probably go deeper, but I think it was maybe valuable. I'm not sure. 120 feet I was valued out.

1237
01:32:59.050 --> 01:32:59.660
Kelvin Alaneme: Yeah.

1238
01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.889
Dan: Happy to answer. But people ask me questions like.

1239
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:04.010
Dan: what are Api contracts?

1240
01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:08.079
Dan: How do you do them? I just ignore those people because it's they didn't. Google, the answer.

1241
01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:16.635
Kelvin Alaneme: Yeah, Ju, just to clarify between hiring a marketing person. Let's say you need to hire a marketing person.

1242
01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:23.350
Kelvin Alaneme: What do you think between getting a top co-founder and hiring a marketing person. Given the nature of

1243
01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:38.219
Kelvin Alaneme: co-founder contracts and everything. And you know the marketing person you're hiring. You're not even very sure they're going to perform. So if they are an employee and they don't perform, they don't hit their kb, as you can easily let them go as against if they are a co-founder.

1244
01:33:38.250 --> 01:33:45.759
Kelvin Alaneme: if they comment so, what do you think like? If you need a marketing person, would you hire, or would you get the.co founder.

1245
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.169
Dan: So I mean, I heard several things in there letting people go

1246
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:52.660
Dan: marketing versus co-funder. So start letting people go.

1247
01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:56.760
Dan: I teach a class Northwestern Mba about firing.

1248
01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:03.090
Dan: because as a startup you will, you will need to learn how to fire

1249
01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:05.939
Dan: really, really quickly.

1250
01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:11.389
Dan: the biggest mistake we've made, and I teach everyone my company's Wallace. To this day they all make the same mistake

1251
01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:15.130
Dan: where they let people stay who are not good enough too long.

1252
01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:21.709
Dan: When you work at Kraft, Heinz, and you have 10,000 employees, and you hired a 10,000 first employee.

1253
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:27.879
Dan: And they're not that good. That's literally one out of 10,000 percentage. What annual percent? That is what is a point 0 0 1.

1254
01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.149
Dan: And if they suck, it doesn't impact that much

1255
01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:35.690
Dan: when you hired a third person, and they're not good. That's 33% of your town pool.

1256
01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:45.549
Dan: It's insane. These, the first 30 people need to be freaking incredible like we have fired people who are good, not incredible good.

1257
01:34:45.970 --> 01:34:47.880
Dan: And the reason was they were just good.

1258
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:49.989
Dan: So think about that standard.

1259
01:34:50.490 --> 01:34:53.080
Dan: So when I hire a marketing person, for example. So

1260
01:34:53.170 --> 01:34:58.960
Dan: I told you guys like, I get really good at this stuff really quick, I get the 9% out. And then when I interview someone for Facebook ads, for example.

1261
01:34:59.090 --> 01:35:00.469
Dan: to run Facebook for me.

1262
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:03.789
Dan: I make sure this person is at least 3 times better than me.

1263
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.200
Dan: because if I spent 2 months on this.

1264
01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:08.619
Dan: and I'm better than you.

1265
01:35:09.710 --> 01:35:11.599
Dan: Dude. How can I take this person seriously

1266
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.549
Dan: like it's it's insane. They need to be at least 3 times better than me.

1267
01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:22.500
Dan: and that's a standard. You should use that. Because, by the way, also, if you don't ever run Facebook as an example.

1268
01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:27.579
Dan: how do you know if somebody's bullshit in your now? How do you know they're good? You literally can't tell.

1269
01:35:28.050 --> 01:35:34.160
Dan: like you have no idea what they could tell you anything about? Oh, that sounds great. If you ask him like, what are you? Gonna ask him like, are you go to Facebook ads?

1270
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.289
Dan: I doubt the candidate's gonna say, Nope.

1271
01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.359
Dan: everyone's gonna say, yes, of course, I'm amazing.

1272
01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.470
Dan: But if you now know how this works and you ask more questions because you're ready like a ninetieth percentile 90. Fifth.

1273
01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:46.560
Dan: you're looking for the 90 ninth, right? You're trying to find someone better than you.

1274
01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.560
Dan: It's much easier to understand the better than you. Right.

1275
01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:53.280
Dan: Does that answer your question? I don't know if.

1276
01:35:53.852 --> 01:36:00.549
Kelvin Alaneme: Yeah, it does. I think the only part is should you get the co-founder? I thought, co-founder slash.

1277
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:06.800
Dan: Yeah, you can fire. You can fire co-founder, too. Right? There is a 4 year of us on everyone's contract co-founders all the time

1278
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:10.300
Dan: co-founder. It's really, I mean, that's a game you're actually playing a little bit more

1279
01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:11.780
Dan: of.

1280
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:14.689
Dan: Are you optimizing for salary or equity?

1281
01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:19.260
Dan: What is a co-founder really co-founder is really someone who's willing to work even more hours

1282
01:36:19.290 --> 01:36:21.340
Dan: for even less pay for higher upside

1283
01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.719
Dan: versus an employee

1284
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:24.670
Dan: kind of wants some money to live

1285
01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.710
Dan: right

1286
01:36:25.930 --> 01:36:26.940
Dan: like.

1287
01:36:27.330 --> 01:36:34.269
Dan: We have plenty of employees. We hire who we pay more than Facebook now, and more Meta, more Meta on Amazon, because like and they're still amazing. By the way.

1288
01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:38.729
Dan: they're not their faculty. They're there for the salary, right? They're still amazing.

1289
01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:42.549
Dan: But the early in people it's really just you're trading off like money for

1290
01:36:43.118 --> 01:36:49.550
Dan: for cash, or I'm sorry. Money for equity. That's what you're really doing. So it's whatever is required to get the best person possible.

1291
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:54.140
Kelvin Alaneme: Thank you very much.

1292
01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.009
Dan: Yep, looks like Snowy. You've got a question.

1293
01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:16.686
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah. First of all, I I really thank you for sharing your insight. I'm I'm very impressed, and that I I I want to learn more about the revenue part keeping the revenue part. So you mentioned that? So we we are post product post revenue. So I'm I'm

1294
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:27.349
Snow Lee / Runbear: I'm trying to be on the sales part while my co-founder liam is on the product part. What is the the main role of the person who

1295
01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:38.740
Snow Lee / Runbear: keeps the revenue. And also is it is it good for us to have some co-founder for dedicated to it? So we have 2 more engineers in my team. So we are 4.

1296
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.530
Snow Lee / Runbear: So I'd like to learn more about.

1297
01:37:40.530 --> 01:37:45.790
Dan: I wanna make sure. So your your question was there. When do you add the revenue maintenance maintenance person? Is that what you're saying.

1298
01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.589
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't. I don't know nothing about that.

1299
01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:52.700
Dan: Sure. I mean, this is in every company. It's different right in our company. It was a dietician.

1300
01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:58.150
Dan: and a different company might be customer support different company might be customer success.

1301
01:37:58.370 --> 01:38:02.130
Dan: right? Another company's operation. So it's really question, what like that? What is the

1302
01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:04.910
Dan: what is causing? Excuse me.

1303
01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:07.719
Dan: The question is, what is causing a leaky bucket for you? Meaning

1304
01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:10.659
Dan: when customers are turning? What's the reason they're turning

1305
01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:15.300
Dan: their attorney cause they're not getting product on time. But it's someone who works in logistics.

1306
01:38:15.370 --> 01:38:25.519
Dan: If they're turning, because they're not getting answers. Questions, questions asked, answered customer support. If they're not. If the turning because the onboarding sucks customer success. So the question to you is.

1307
01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.360
Dan: why are customers turning.

1308
01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:30.370
Snow Lee / Runbear: so once, you don't.

1309
01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:33.100
Dan: Definitely turn. That's when you hire that person. That's the person you hire.

1310
01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:45.209
Snow Lee / Runbear: Got it, got it so as a as a so you you mentioned that I need to. We need to focus on one thing so as a CEO, I'm trying to focus on the marketing and marketing sales.

1311
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:45.540
Dan: Yes.

1312
01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.280
Snow Lee / Runbear: So

1313
01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:55.410
Snow Lee / Runbear: is it better, for do you recommend me to hire someone for this customer success, instead of a handling that kind of com conversation with the company

1314
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.210
Snow Lee / Runbear: customer by myself.

1315
01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:02.280
Dan: So you will have you said you have 3 engineers. You're doing marketing sales right.

1316
01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.050
Snow Lee / Runbear: That's right.

1317
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.629
Dan: You're not doing any engineering product right?

1318
01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:09.840
Snow Lee / Runbear: Actually I'm doing. But I'm trying to avoid it.

1319
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:13.389
Dan: First stop, stop that number one, number 2 is

1320
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:17.710
Dan: you should want to understand the pain points to the customer. Why they're turning. You should understand that.

1321
01:39:18.141 --> 01:39:22.070
Dan: So that understanding is on you, because only then you will hire the right person.

1322
01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:31.629
Dan: If you don't know the pain points. You're logistics, person, but you need a customer support person, or you're gonna hire dietician. We need a you know, director operation. So you need first understand that part.

1323
01:39:32.926 --> 01:39:34.720
Dan: And then you hire that person. Yes.

1324
01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.019
Snow Lee / Runbear: Go ahead. Got it? Yeah. Understood?

1325
01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:40.709
Dan: Other questions like, Do you have a do you have a retention problem? You may not have one.

1326
01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:47.280
Snow Lee / Runbear: We we have, we have, I mean, we have 1510 to 15 churn rate monthly churn rate.

1327
01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:50.910
Dan: I would dive a little deeper in that, because that's not always a problem.

1328
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.020
Dan: right? What I mean by that is.

1329
01:39:53.130 --> 01:39:55.530
Dan: I mean to be frank guys, we have really high turn rate, too.

1330
01:39:55.670 --> 01:40:01.000
Dan: But we're really for us like we look at everyone who looks at business are always different. We look at Cltv to Cac.

1331
01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:04.100
Dan: So if we have the ones still to eat a kack.

1332
01:40:04.690 --> 01:40:05.829
Dan: does it really matter?

1333
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:11.170
Dan: Mean like, if I'm making $20 for every $1 I spend on product and marketing

1334
01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:15.300
Dan: like. And I'm making $19 like I can keep going forever.

1335
01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:16.960
Dan: Does it matter

1336
01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:23.610
Dan: like? So you should define what? Why, like, sometimes investors are a little tricky, and it just keeps it. Retention, retention, retention.

1337
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:25.730
Dan: Sometimes it's true, sometimes it's not

1338
01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:26.700
Dan: right.

1339
01:40:27.233 --> 01:40:32.810
Dan: Think about prior to Sas businesses existing. There were hundreds and hundreds of businesses existing that we're just selling you a product

1340
01:40:33.490 --> 01:40:34.469
Dan: we're like.

1341
01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:37.709
Dan: I mean, I don't know if you go to any store? 7, 11. There's gum.

1342
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:46.700
Dan: They're not getting a subscription for gum. They're selling you one piece of gum. They're still making money. They're still making billions of dollars. They're selling you one piece because they're making more money. So the question really becomes.

1343
01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.300
Dan: is it truly the retention problem

1344
01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:57.509
Dan: like, What is your steel TV to cap is question number one. And do you need to be a retention company or not? And are you more of like a one time purchase, or like

1345
01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.489
Dan: intermittent purchase. So those questions need to be asked first.

1346
01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:04.790
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah, that's a great question. I need to find out.

1347
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:06.100
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah.

1348
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:07.820
Snow Lee / Runbear: people usually think.

1349
01:41:08.102 --> 01:41:12.619
Dan: Differently. Yeah, I was gonna say, like, if you're doing a $10 month subscription.

1350
01:41:13.711 --> 01:41:15.170
Dan: sometimes retention is the key.

1351
01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.579
Dan: When you're doing a

1352
01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.950
Dan: $250 a month. Consumer product

1353
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:23.610
Dan: for us. Retention is important and everyone's had retention retention, but yet

1354
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:26.240
Dan: we're profitable. Every every sale.

1355
01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:31.839
Dan: post marketing post cogs, post operations. So the question becomes like you, sure.

1356
01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:34.230
Dan: because maybe at that point it's

1357
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:37.620
Dan: get as many human beings in a door. So you get brand building.

1358
01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:43.859
Dan: So it's really again, yeah, understanding, like, what pain point are you solving? It's very hard to solve many pain points.

1359
01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.199
Dan: And it always comes down to like which one is most important. Pain points.

1360
01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:48.600
Dan: and then you do that

1361
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:50.640
Dan: right

1362
01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:51.680
Dan: right.

1363
01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.180
Snow Lee / Runbear: Right.

1364
01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:54.189
Dan: And that pain point solves, and you go to the next one.

1365
01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:56.470
Dan: and then you go next one. And yeah.

1366
01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.140
Dan: so the question is, which one.

1367
01:42:00.150 --> 01:42:07.249
Snow Lee / Runbear: so but the you know, we are in the AI field and that things change quite rapidly and

1368
01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:20.089
Snow Lee / Runbear: of course I. I understand that there are so many people. So I I need to focus on the growth. But there's still I feel a little bit afraid about losing customers. They I I feel afraid about that. They are not coming back later.

1369
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:21.919
Dan: Do you have a lot of customers.

1370
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:24.629
Snow Lee / Runbear: No, no, we have 50.

1371
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:26.430
Dan: 50. Okay.

1372
01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:30.610
Dan: Is it enterprise or consumer?

1373
01:42:32.065 --> 01:42:35.630
Snow Lee / Runbear: Company, so not the enterprise size, but the.

1374
01:42:35.630 --> 01:42:35.950
Dan: Of the.

1375
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:37.990
Snow Lee / Runbear: Start up, yeah, between.

1376
01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:39.620
Dan: And they're all paying customers.

1377
01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:40.860
Dan: Yeah.

1378
01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:41.750
Dan: yeah. But.

1379
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:45.450
Snow Lee / Runbear: 1 $100 per month. It's not relatively slow. Yeah.

1380
01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:51.620
Dan: How many companies in the Us you think are possibly able to buy your company like you buy your product.

1381
01:42:53.535 --> 01:42:57.310
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah, sorry that that I I don't have the numbers in my head that probably.

1382
01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.549
Dan: Yeah, 10,000.

1383
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:02.990
Snow Lee / Runbear: More than 10,000. Yeah.

1384
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.730
Dan: So

1385
01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.439
Dan: would you say, what are you optimizing for next 3 months?

1386
01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:10.350
Dan: Like, what's your number? One metric? What's your North Star Metric, or your North Star Company goal.

1387
01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:19.999
Snow Lee / Runbear: So within this year so before, before we having starting out next funding, we want to have 10 K Mrr.

1388
01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:22.790
Snow Lee / Runbear: which is around, yeah, one.

1389
01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:25.550
Snow Lee / Runbear: 100 100 customers. Yeah.

1390
01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:26.870
Dan: So it's interesting.

1391
01:43:27.450 --> 01:43:32.620
Dan: I heard you say 10 Kmr. But you said before you started fundraising, is that what you said? Did I hear that correctly?

1392
01:43:34.054 --> 01:43:45.079
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah. 50 K. 50 kmr, but the we are thinking about the bridging bridge bridge of an as let me get rid of the bunch of the irrelevant information. So.

1393
01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:45.719
Dan: Yeah, older.

1394
01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.180
Snow Lee / Runbear: 5, 5, 5 500.

1395
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:51.339
Dan: Before you get into. I think the reason I'm asking you this question is.

1396
01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:52.779
Dan: it sounds like

1397
01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.390
Dan: you're actually optimizing for a fundraise.

1398
01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:59.789
Dan: Right sounds like that's actually the north from metric your goal is to raise next round.

1399
01:43:59.790 --> 01:44:16.489
Snow Lee / Runbear: No, no, no, it's not about the Northometrics. Sorry I I I wasn't talking about North Dormitory our the the next milestone. So our next milestone goal is 100 paying customers, and then, probably next step will be having the series 8 to boost the growth

1400
01:44:16.530 --> 01:44:27.229
Snow Lee / Runbear: and then to to do the afforded next boosting the growth, we need some funding, and then that is the goal that we want to achieve. That 50 Kmr.

1401
01:44:27.610 --> 01:44:29.289
Dan: So let me flip that conversation.

1402
01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:31.549
Dan: Okay, for you to do that fundraising.

1403
01:44:32.230 --> 01:44:33.829
Dan: What do investors need to see.

1404
01:44:35.831 --> 01:44:38.780
Snow Lee / Runbear: Our growth, the probably Mr. Growth.

1405
01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:45.420
Dan: So to get to Mr. Growth. Is it easier for you to get more customers? Or is it easier for you to fix your potential problem.

1406
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:46.520
Dan: She can like.

1407
01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.649
Snow Lee / Runbear: More customers, more customers.

1408
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:49.910
Dan: Let's just focus on that for now.

1409
01:44:51.690 --> 01:45:03.610
Dan: because you have limited resources. That's the problem. You have limited resources. When you have 50 people on your team. Yeah, you have people more customers to be able to fix the retention. But right now, like limited resource, you can only do one problem at a time. Sometimes you're lucky. 2 problems at a time.

1410
01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:06.550
Dan: but once you know what

1411
01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:15.750
Dan: the promen to soft to get the next milestone, which sounds like fundraisers what you want to do, and that means to get there. It's easier to get more customers and fix the retention right.

1412
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:19.250
Dan: Yeah. And it's and it hurts.

1413
01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.029
Dan: I heard. So you spend all this time acquiring these customers, and they leave, and it sucks.

1414
01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:26.309
Dan: and your investors always gonna be like, what are those customers leaving? Oh, no!

1415
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:29.550
Dan: And it's going to hurt even more when they say that.

1416
01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:35.669
Dan: But then you show me your month of a month charts, increasing revenue, and they're all gonna shut up and say, Okay, here's more money.

1417
01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.519
Dan: Of course you're gonna have an a good answer of

1418
01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:41.119
Dan: Well, no, the guys. If I have 5 million dollars

1419
01:45:41.170 --> 01:45:45.099
Dan: I'll hire 4 engineers, and they're going to build XYZ. And our retention would be perfect.

1420
01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:54.200
Dan: and immediately that conversation goes away. So that's how you answer that question. But again, it's company specific in your situation. It's new customer. Seems like.

1421
01:45:55.180 --> 01:46:00.449
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah, yeah, totally makes sense. I'm I I'll take that. Thank you very much for the advice. Great advice.

1422
01:46:00.450 --> 01:46:06.119
Dan: Sorry for the many questions I just. It's hard to give an answer without knowing more details. That's why I need to ask more.

1423
01:46:07.090 --> 01:46:07.840
Snow Lee / Runbear: Great great.

1424
01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:10.090
Snow Lee / Runbear: that's help. That helps a lot.

1425
01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:11.760
Dan: Antonia.

1426
01:46:13.255 --> 01:46:21.304
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: You started selling door to door. At what point you decided I need. Vc money. I need to grow like what point and why.

1427
01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:24.479
Dan: Yeah, yeah, I never actually sold door to door I sold on Internet.

1428
01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:26.172
Dan: But it's wonderful.

1429
01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.530
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Beautifully, figuratively.

1430
01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:33.927
Dan: Yeah. Oh, oh, you gotta get again, I was saying. I'm saying I can't sell door. I don't know how

1431
01:46:34.645 --> 01:46:34.950
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: You!

1432
01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:36.410
Dan: Little point. We got money.

1433
01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:39.121
Dan: We've got a like

1434
01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:50.090
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: What point? At what point you realize that these these revenue is not enough. You guys were surviving with revenue getting directly from the customers at what point you said. Now we need to raise money.

1435
01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:51.570
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and why.

1436
01:46:51.834 --> 01:46:53.419
Dan: We always want to raise money

1437
01:46:54.776 --> 01:46:55.933
Dan: from day one.

1438
01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:57.700
Dan: but

1439
01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:02.300
Dan: it's sometimes very hard to convince people that they should give you money

1440
01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:04.999
Dan: unless your previous founder and exits.

1441
01:47:05.010 --> 01:47:07.979
Dan: or you have friends and family that trust, and you want to give money.

1442
01:47:08.491 --> 01:47:13.309
Dan: I didn't, was not a priest founder, my parents. I'm an immigrant, so didn't have

1443
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:17.039
Dan: friends. Family can just give me money, and so for me it was more like.

1444
01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:19.670
Dan: I want to raise money, but I need to show them something.

1445
01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.410
Dan: And it's really about portraying a

1446
01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:26.119
Dan: you know, beautiful story. A painting to these investors give you money.

1447
01:47:26.730 --> 01:47:30.950
Dan: and a story is usually really only 3 pieces. It's

1448
01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.260
Dan: team.

1449
01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:34.900
Dan: it's traction.

1450
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:36.280
Dan: and it's

1451
01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:41.929
Dan: fluff storytelling of the vision, the vision which is going to change my 100 times. So I'm saying, fluffy.

1452
01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:45.210
Dan: But those 3 topics, those 3 pieces every time

1453
01:47:46.019 --> 01:47:53.999
Dan: we didn't really have a vision or a good story, because I didn't believe this idea was gonna work. Let's remember we did rock paper scissors. I went to the Hr idea.

1454
01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:58.530
Dan: So it's kind of hard to convince someone else with a story or vision that I don't even know what the hell is

1455
01:47:58.850 --> 01:48:03.180
Dan: right. We've no customers like my my friends buy hackens away so that one's kinda hard.

1456
01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:10.110
Dan: our my team. Our team, like my co-founder, was really impressive background, but he was a CTO prior.

1457
01:48:10.945 --> 01:48:12.489
Dan: Of those startup

1458
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.079
Dan: I came from. Corporate finance

1459
01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:22.259
Dan: has no background, nothing to do with Mark like they're looking, and they're like, What are you new marketing? I was like, I don't know, like I don't know anything, right? So

1460
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:30.719
Dan: our team backgrounds are not impressive either. And I saw a bunch of you guys went to like Stanford or some people into Harvard like, Sue, you guys, a waste your time in that regard so very impressive.

1461
01:48:31.085 --> 01:48:33.009
Dan: I went to like an average school

1462
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:34.180
Dan: right?

1463
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:40.070
Dan: so I didn't have the background. The team. So the only option I had was the third one is subtraction.

1464
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:44.890
Dan: So you have to ask yourself, like, which of those 3 do you have. If you have the grand vision you could sell to anyone.

1465
01:48:45.150 --> 01:48:47.099
Dan: shit. You don't need traction or good team.

1466
01:48:47.410 --> 01:48:50.140
Dan: or if you have Mark Zuckerberg, join your company tomorrow.

1467
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:54.199
Dan: Then you don't need traction. You don't need vision. You have Mark Zuckerberg, because you have amazing team, right?

1468
01:48:54.490 --> 01:48:57.220
Dan: So it's really which of those 3 do you have?

1469
01:48:57.650 --> 01:48:59.309
Dan: And that will determine.

1470
01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.060
Dan: how can you? And when can you pitch investors?

1471
01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.620
Dan: Yeah, I didn't have 2 of those I had, so I had to get traction to convince them.

1472
01:49:06.730 --> 01:49:07.340
Dan: That's what.

1473
01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:08.709
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Syria. Yeah.

1474
01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:11.879
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: yeah, Dan, is it realistic for a wearable

1475
01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:20.169
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: to to doing that organic growth to? Is it realistic to say that I will never need investors, and I'll I'll grow slowly.

1476
01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:32.219
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: What's the risk is just that the competitors will will bite you? Or why? Why can't I just keep growing as low slowly with a small team, and gradually increase what the size of my team, without having

1477
01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:34.020
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: ever having investors.

1478
01:49:35.397 --> 01:49:43.010
Dan: You can, but I don't think you can. The answer is you can. There's risks. There's hundreds of risks for that. But you can.

1479
01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:47.020
Dan: I would probably not join. Text starts for that, because text are all like grown fast right.

1480
01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:55.309
Dan: and venture capital fundraising. That's more of like a family business, or like a small company business which is cool. By the way, way, less stressful

1481
01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:58.800
Dan: lot of times, then the craziest venture capital side of business. But

1482
01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:01.859
Dan: you can just probably different type of business.

1483
01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:05.160
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Okay. Thank you.

1484
01:50:06.481 --> 01:50:09.660
Dan: By the way, just give you an example. Just do you guys know? Tender?

1485
01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.339
Dan: So one of my buddies, he was the founder tinder.

1486
01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:17.409
Dan: and he cashed, I think, 1.4 billion. And

1487
01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:23.009
Dan: after he started a wearable company, also wearable company round stress. Actually, if you look up, they have like, I think, a.

1488
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:25.429
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: The rings happy, ring, happy, ring.

1489
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:30.489
Dan: I don't remember that name, but but he raised 80 million dollars pre revenue

1490
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:32.559
Dan: and a 30 min meeting.

1491
01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:37.850
Dan: Right? He said. I want to build this this thing for stress management.

1492
01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:44.650
Dan: and someone wrote an 80 million dollar check after 30 min meeting that day. Wire to money. No term sheet. Nothing.

1493
01:50:46.710 --> 01:50:47.960
Dan: no vision.

1494
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:50.069
Dan: no traction like I, said

1495
01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:55.970
Dan: founder, and press a founder. So that's we have to ask you which one are you? By the way. That company, I think, is going to shit.

1496
01:50:56.180 --> 01:51:01.280
Dan: But Tinder was worth 40 billion dollars. Right? It's the number one dating app in the world.

1497
01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:03.809
Dan: whether you like it, or don't like it. It is what it is. But

1498
01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:08.439
Dan: so which I mean. Question back to you, Antonio, which one do you have.

1499
01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:11.980
Dan: I guess. First question is, you have rich friends, connections.

1500
01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:14.510
Dan: They'll give you money.

1501
01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:19.489
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, I'm I'm the I'm like, you. Basically.

1502
01:51:19.490 --> 01:51:22.859
Dan: Okay? So maybe then you're not the extreme which I was. Gonna say, then, you're in different bucket.

1503
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:25.539
Dan: So that's the second bucket of the 3 parts.

1504
01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:27.490
Dan: Do you have traction?

1505
01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:29.610
Dan: Do you have a famous team

1506
01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:31.879
Dan: or impressive team like Super impressive?

1507
01:51:32.530 --> 01:51:32.990
Dan: Or

1508
01:51:33.230 --> 01:51:35.650
Dan: do you have a vision that you're going to solve? Everyone.

1509
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:40.759
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I think we have an impressive team and a vision. No, ma, 0 traction.

1510
01:51:41.210 --> 01:51:45.319
Dan: Then that's pro. That's probably good enough. You probably don't need traction to raise money. Then, if you have impressive team and

1511
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:46.379
Dan: your vision.

1512
01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.559
Dan: it's good enough.

1513
01:51:50.650 --> 01:52:02.109
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Okay, so I need to decide, we need to decide how fast we wanna grow, basically. And and it sounds like, if we wanna, because, yeah, otherwise the the main. The major reason we don't capital is that they're gonna.

1514
01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:07.679
Dan: What I'm saying to you is what I'm saying to you. If you said you have an amazing team and you have vision. What I'm saying to you that those 2

1515
01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:10.189
Dan: you can actually raise money without the traction.

1516
01:52:10.530 --> 01:52:13.379
Dan: You could skip most of the steps. You can just raise money right now.

1517
01:52:13.670 --> 01:52:15.190
Dan: if you believe you have those 2

1518
01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:17.979
Dan: or we didn't, we didn't have. I didn't have those 2.

1519
01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:24.829
Dan: I wasn't sure the company is gonna work, and our team was not impressive, so for me it was like shit. I gotta get traction.

1520
01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:28.000
Dan: But if you have those 2 you can skim the traction part for now, and raise money.

1521
01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:52.089
Alejandra Guillen: I I think. Then there's there's a lot that goes into. How do you find? Impressive? I think it's it's a good team, but impressive is, Do we have successful exits on our on our background? Do we have, you know, like recognition by name. And and I think we're missing those. So I think there's there's definitely talent. But

1522
01:52:52.574 --> 01:52:57.675
Alejandra Guillen: if if impressive, means that we need to have like millions of

1523
01:52:58.090 --> 01:53:02.729
Alejandra Guillen: of dollars in an in a successful exit. That's not where we are.

1524
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:09.769
Dan: Alright. Yeah. I mean somebody. Maybe I'm using the word a little extreme. Everyone here is incredibly talented smart.

1525
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:12.250
Dan: But what I mean say, impressive as in like.

1526
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:14.559
Dan: if Jeff Bezos join your start tomorrow.

1527
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:18.370
Dan: what would happen if Mark Zuckerberg joined and start tomorrow? Circuit Bryn joins? Start tomorrow.

1528
01:53:18.958 --> 01:53:22.529
Dan: I bet if I join you, start tomorrow, someone'll give us 10 million dollar check

1529
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:24.839
Dan: without any traction, product.

1530
01:53:24.970 --> 01:53:26.550
Dan: right or vision.

1531
01:53:26.830 --> 01:53:34.189
Dan: If you have enough people, if you have at least someone who's like, who's accomplished those things. Second founder. But it could be a fail startup. By the way, does that be successful? Startup?

1532
01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.680
Dan: But if they get enough recognition.

1533
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:39.580
Dan: then you could skip the other 2 steps.

1534
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:43.560
Dan: I just think that most people don't join textors if they have that

1535
01:53:43.710 --> 01:53:44.800
Dan: because they could, just

1536
01:53:45.010 --> 01:53:46.999
Dan: they already have the connection. They already have everything.

1537
01:53:47.590 --> 01:53:53.219
Dan: Once in a while you get lucky, and you know they're they just like some reason, join text, or I have seen it

1538
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:54.779
Dan: on a rare occasion.

1539
01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:57.009
Dan: There's one guy that was a celebrity that joined, and

1540
01:53:57.170 --> 01:54:02.809
Dan: within like a week get a couple of 1 million revenue. We're doing almost nothing. And I was like, okay, I don't know why you're giving away 7% of your company

1541
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:06.080
Dan: for this. So it does happen a really rare occasion.

1542
01:54:06.610 --> 01:54:08.310
Dan: But it's rare. It's really rare.

1543
01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:22.020
