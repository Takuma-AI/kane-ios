### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Bob Moesta: Yeah. The fact is, is that what? Yeah? So as they start to frame a project we talk about all the things they struggle with in framing the project like, there's so many details in framing a project. You gotta know the measurements. You got to know this, you got to know that. And it's like it's at some point. It's overwhelming and easy for somebody else to do it. But we have a way to actually solve this by breaking it down into small pieces, and people go like, Oh, my God! That's exactly what my problem is. You got to have a solution for it. I'm going to try the process. So sometimes when you can describe the problem better than they can.

### Key Insights

> "Bob Moesta: And and I would tell you that it's probably not all of them. It's the big ones that actually just throw them for a loop every time. And, like you said, there's probably there's a there's maybe a hundred things yet that means less friction. But it's these 15 that are really important. Make sure you prioritize to the 15, not not trying to do it all, because you'll never do it all."
