1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
Carlo Scaglia: That's cool.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's go. Carlo.

3
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.470
Carlo Scaglia: Hi, Bob, nice to meet you.

4
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.520
Bob Moesta: So how are you, man?

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:14.060
Carlo Scaglia: Very good. Thanks you. It's cool to to the man the myth, the legend about you. Yeah, let me let me kick into it. So

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:25.940
Carlo Scaglia: exhort is a global network of like the world's best photographers and video makers, or from a younger generation, we host them on our platform, and we work with producers within agencies

7
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.840
Carlo Scaglia: to facilitate all of their content campaigns anywhere in the world with extreme efficiency.

8
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.689
Bob Moesta: Okay.

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.280
Carlo Scaglia: Now we've

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.969
Carlo Scaglia: come quite well far, ish. Last year we supported about 500 productions, 30 different countries for quite big clients like Airbnb

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.090
Carlo Scaglia: across all of them, like, we've consistently reduced

12
00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:51.210
Carlo Scaglia: time by about 70% and production costs by about 30%.

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:06.449
Carlo Scaglia: Now, the sort of main question that I had for you is that we're consumption based business. In other words, agency producers come to us when they have the green light on a campaign, and they've got the right people in the right places.

14
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:30.818
Carlo Scaglia: However, agency producers also do a lot of other work in pre-production. They gotta scout people. They gotta list them. They gotta talk about them. They're gonna see what's possible. And all of those things are still very much doable within the platform. So I'm trying to work out how we can increase usage within our platform beyond what they think is their only need. That's 1 part I struggle with.

15
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.220
Bob Moesta: So the way that I would answer that is, that

16
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:52.780
Bob Moesta: I would target whatever their big struggling moment is@firstst And so, whatever whatever they, wherever they need to change behavior, or wherever they need to save money or want to save time, like, what are the things you need to fix. But once you solve that problem, it goes down the list. It's like, Okay, I got that solved. Now, what's the next thing?

17
00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:06.656
Bob Moesta: And so part of it is to actually think about the the set of struggling moments, and how they emerge through time and space. And so the the reality is like every time we create a new feature, we actually solve one problem. But we usually create another problem.

18
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:22.810
Bob Moesta: right? And so it's that aspect of being able to do both of those things and be able to understand kind of what's the sequencing. So my thing is, if the big thing is about basically the production of the of the of the thing. Let's let's help them there and then, as we get better at that, now, we can help them with the pre-production stuff.

19
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:40.810
Bob Moesta: or are they really struggling with the pre-production stuff? And they're not struggling with too much, with the, with production of How do we actually help them with the pre-production stuff, and it's like, what can you do to help them in those modes? Because in some cases they have to be able to. One admit they're struggling and 2 is they have to see a better way to actually try.

20
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.450
Bob Moesta: Right? Does that help.

21
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.760
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, that makes sense, especially the last part. When you say they actually have to see a better way to actually

22
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.690
Carlo Scaglia: try. Do you want like just expanding a little bit on that one.

23
00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:02.230
Bob Moesta: Well. So so here's the thing is is, if you actually can explain their problem better than they can articulate it. The 1st thing is they're gonna assume you actually have a solution already.

24
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.922
Bob Moesta: Right? So think of, think of

25
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.920
Bob Moesta: I'm trying to let me see if I can come up with an example of that one.

26
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.411
Bob Moesta: let me think. Sorry I I have some in home products. I have some you want. So we want software examples.

27
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:34.130
Bob Moesta: oh, alright so so in in shopping, right? The fact is, is, the fact is, like as as people are trying to actually put together a project.

28
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.190
Bob Moesta: The the reality is as they as they

29
00:03:37.638 --> 00:03:42.239
Bob Moesta: try to frame that project. Hold on a second, I lost my thought.

30
00:03:46.240 --> 00:04:15.919
Bob Moesta: Yeah. The fact is, is that what? Yeah? So as they start to frame a project we talk about all the things they struggle with in framing the project like, there's so many details in framing a project. You gotta know the measurements. You got to know this, you got to know that. And it's like it's at some point. It's overwhelming and easy for somebody else to do it. But we have a way to actually solve this by breaking it down into small pieces, and people go like, Oh, my God! That's exactly what my problem is. You got to have a solution for it. I'm going to try the process. So sometimes when you can describe the problem better than they can.

31
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.779
Bob Moesta: they assume, you have a solution to it, and they'll pull them into the solution

32
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:34.990
Bob Moesta: right? And so figure out how to articulate their. The other part is to articulate their problem and their words, not your words, and not not global words. So my thing is is go interview like so how many, how many clients do you already have.

33
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.650
Carlo Scaglia: We've got about 13 clients and overall in terms of Jtbds.

34
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.929
Bob Moesta: And how many job and what how many jobs do you have.

35
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.659
Carlo Scaglia: 15.

36
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.020
Bob Moesta: 15 Jobs.

37
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.710
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah.

38
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.640
Bob Moesta: Okay, so.

39
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.230
Carlo Scaglia: No sorry. Sorry. 15 jobs to be done. Interviews like.

40
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.319
Bob Moesta: Yeah, okay, well, and how many have you done any patterns in it yet?

41
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.679
Carlo Scaglia: Bypass. Yes.

42
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What what outcomes, what.

43
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.520
Bob Moesta: What are the 3 or 4 like of the 15 interviews? How many different jobs did you find.

44
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.000
Carlo Scaglia: 3 core ones.

45
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.072
Bob Moesta: Okay, which are.

46
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.349
Carlo Scaglia: Drastically reduce the sourcing time of high quality. Creatives.

47
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.479
Bob Moesta: Are they willing to pay more for more better sourcing time?

48
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.280
Carlo Scaglia: Yes.

49
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.010
Bob Moesta: Yeah. Good. Okay. Next.

50
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:22.690
Carlo Scaglia: Remove all operational friction points once they have the right creatives things like contracting payments.

51
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:42.725
Bob Moesta: And and I would tell you that it's probably not all of them. It's the big ones that actually just throw them for a loop every time. And, like you said, there's probably there's a there's maybe a hundred things yet that means less friction. But it's these 15 that are really important. Make sure you prioritize to the 15, not not trying to do it all, because you'll never do it all.

52
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.660
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, okay, that makes sense.

53
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.660
Bob Moesta: And the last one.

54
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.270
Carlo Scaglia: The last one was providing greater transparency around pricing.

55
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.710
Bob Moesta: And why do they want that? What's the outcome? How do I say? Providing transparency is a solution? To what problem.

56
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:11.349
Carlo Scaglia: If it's back to the sourcing, because then in the past all the different creators had different prices, and if they didn't fit budgets, the producer would have to start again, and they waste loads of time, and they're on a time. Crunch once that.

57
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.280
Bob Moesta: This is really about. Help me help me build better, more realistic budgets.

58
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.460
Carlo Scaglia: Yes.

59
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.889
Bob Moesta: Got it, and the other one is about helping reduce my source time and the middle one is

60
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.520
Bob Moesta: remove the friction.

61
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.850
Carlo Scaglia: Yes.

62
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.530
Bob Moesta: Got it, and which one are they doing? Mo. Of the 3?

63
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:39.049
Bob Moesta: How many people are? So here's the thing is there's a reason why people come. And then there's sometimes a different reason why people stay

64
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:57.069
Bob Moesta: right. So they might come to you because they have a sourcing problem, and then they realize, oh, you can help me get rid of these friction points. So I'm staying for the friction points, even though you've already. I might use the sourcing once in a while. But the friction points is a big thing for us, right? And so why do people come, and why do they stay? What's your theory.

65
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:06.420
Carlo Scaglia: They come because of the sourcing, because they've got an immediate need, and they've got to find someone quickly, and then they realize how easy it is, and how convenient it is the friction point. So that's why.

66
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:30.860
Bob Moesta: Got it, got it. So that's probably why they say so. My thing is, is, you don't really need to do any advertising around the friction points, because at some point those might not be big enough things for them to commit to trying a new platform. It might be through the other 2, which is how we build a better budget or help me help me reduce sourcing time, and ultimately then they'll they'll they'll they'll actually value the other part, because now you've got rid of those other 2 problems.

67
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.480
Bob Moesta: right?

68
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:46.100
Bob Moesta: And so from a product strategy perspective, it's like, you know, I might not need to do all 3, but from a marketing strategy I might only lead with the the 2 of you know. Help me reduce sourcing time. Help me build a more realistic budget.

69
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.579
Carlo Scaglia: Only so it's a sense.

70
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:57.549
Bob Moesta: Right, because if you, if you, if you reduce the friction, they might do it. But I I think they'll value it actually more after they see the other things you do.

71
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.810
Carlo Scaglia: Yes, I think the friction part is one thing they have to experience to evaluate.

72
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:12.090
Bob Moesta: That's right. It's so hard to articulate. And and they really don't know it into, because all of a sudden they're gonna go. God! That was easy. Why, why was that so easy? You're like, oh, because we have this and this and this. Oh, that's why we're gonna stay.

73
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.200
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, exactly.

74
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.240
Carlo Scaglia: Nice. Thanks.

75
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.290
Bob Moesta: Very cool, very cool. Yeah, I don't think I don't know if I have anything more

76
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:41.110
Bob Moesta: unless you have any more questions, but I feel like that's like I feel like 3 jobs is about right. If you know, I've done stuff in in similar areas around this, the the notion of reducing sourcing time is like, it's the aspect of help me keep the project on track. Help me get realistic expectations. And the friction they are those those 3 jobs make sense to me.

77
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:49.719
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, especially that sourcing time, because for them, for producers each campaign is tied to revenue, and the longer it takes miss out on it.

78
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.420
Bob Moesta: Is, the is the resourcing time

79
00:08:52.590 --> 00:09:06.250
Bob Moesta: where you can actually help them. So the the thing is, is they the the output might be that they want to reduce the sourcing time. But the outcome is so I can do more shoots, so I can do more. you know, projects

80
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:20.079
Bob Moesta: right. So make sure you're aware of what's the real outcome they're looking for, though they say they might want to save time. The reality is this, what are they gonna save the time to do and make sure you connect what they want to do back to that saving time.

81
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.500
Bob Moesta: because just saving time alone is not enough.

82
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:34.019
Carlo Scaglia: Those were the the sort of 3 consistent things that were coming up, and one of them was the producers were actually saying no to quite a few jobs, because they didn't have like they couldn't do them.

83
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:41.710
Bob Moesta: Yeah, no band. So when I don't, when I don't have enough bandwidth, help me reduce my sourcing time. So I can actually say yes more than no.

84
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.390
Carlo Scaglia: Exactly.

85
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.699
Bob Moesta: Got it. Okay, what's another one.

86
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Carlo!

87
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.540
Bob Moesta: One more.

88
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.000
Carlo Scaglia: Don't need to wrap it up.

89
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.080
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

90
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:52.940
Carlo Scaglia: Okay.

91
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, no, you don't need to. You're good.

92
00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:04.779
Carlo Scaglia: Alright cool. Yeah. So one of them is, do more do more projects. The other one is actually gain a competitive edge over other competitors because they can.

93
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.160
Bob Moesta: How, how does it do that.

94
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:16.468
Carlo Scaglia: Because it means they're able to find the right people a lot faster and come back to the client a lot faster when they client wants to get the job done while others.

95
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.959
Bob Moesta: So one is so I could do more. The other one is so. I could be more responsive to my to my customers.

96
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:29.400
Carlo Scaglia: Yes, and then the other 1, 1 second.

97
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.330
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

98
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:30.950
Carlo Scaglia: No.

99
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:41.119
Bob Moesta: I still still think that. So I'm more responsive. So I can do more job, I more more projects. I think that's that's the big thing.

100
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.989
Carlo Scaglia: But also that delays make them lose clients, because

101
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.589
Carlo Scaglia: then the client is not satisfied, and then move to other agencies.

102
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.679
Bob Moesta: Yeah. Reduce. Churn.

103
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.660
Carlo Scaglia: Exactly.

104
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.280
Bob Moesta: Okay.

105
00:10:51.730 --> 00:11:10.499
Bob Moesta: but make sure you have it. So it's like when when I when I'm in this situation and I struggle with these things, you know, help me do these things. So I can do more projects. So I can basically. So I can reduce my churn. So I can like, make sure you get to the outcome they want as opposed to just the output they want.

106
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.329
Carlo Scaglia: Okay, so it's like, source people faster, so that you can do more projects.

107
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:31.700
Bob Moesta: That's right. Sourcing people faster is like the solution. And then you're gonna tell them how, how you source people differently. And that's gonna be your unique competitive position, because other people can't source that way. And so it's like, Oh, if I can actually do that and reduce my sourcing time! Oh, I can do more for sure.

108
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.750
Carlo Scaglia: Hmm, okay. Now that yeah, that clears up a lot. Thank you. That's super useful.

109
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.900
Bob Moesta: Yup, cool.

110
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.360
Chloe Lannert: That's fine!

111
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:39.720
Bob Moesta: Thank you.

112
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.330
Carlo Scaglia: Thanks.

113
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.540
Chloe Lannert: Alright, brio! You're up next.

114
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.989
Jake Gutstein: Top with like.

115
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:44.579
Chloe Lannert: Oh, yeah.

116
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.700
Jake Gutstein: Spew.

117
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.919
Bob Moesta: Jake, I can't hear you. Can you please.

118
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Your your voice is faint. It's like the volume input is low.

119
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.789
Bob Moesta: Have an hour right?

120
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There we go. You're good.

121
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.160
Bob Moesta: Hey, Jake.

122
00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.410
Jake Gutstein: Hey! Man!

123
00:12:00.564 --> 00:12:16.470
Jake Gutstein: So a couple of things one is, I would talk to May about this honest budgeting conversation because they deal with it, and it materializes with their customer as well. So I think that you guys actually may be able to trade notes there. The other is.

124
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:23.769
Jake Gutstein: if I was hearing you right. The the nature of the conversation was also about what to do. Once the customer engages with you

125
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.049
Jake Gutstein: is that like a piece of this, Carla.

126
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:35.020
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, because the customers engage with us when they when they have an immediate need. Right? So they're like, Oh, I gotta do this campaign and need people. And they're like, Okay, cool, but actually could have used us for a whole lot of work beforehand.

127
00:12:35.290 --> 00:13:04.580
Jake Gutstein: So okay, so you're getting them to the point where they're paying you. And I think that's great. To Bob's point, the context that they're in is going to change post use once they're able to say yes more than they're saying no, or they're experiencing this ease. Bob, I'm curious your thoughts, should they be having conversations? If you have enough paid customers? Should you have conversations about purchases that your customers have made after engaging with you, as it relates to the area that you're trying to solve, because that might be the next most prominent.

128
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.810
Jake Gutstein: prominent struggle that they're dealing with.

129
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.940
Carlo Scaglia: With me, or with other suppliers.

130
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.310
Jake Gutstein: With somebody else.

131
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:17.499
Bob Moesta: I? Yeah, I would. I would actually do what I call churn interviews around. Why, they left other a agencies.

132
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.820
Jake Gutstein: Hmm.

133
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:32.460
Bob Moesta: And get the. And so the thing is is, there's always a surface level of that story. Oh, my God! It was a horrible project. It was bad like it was. Everything was off times like, Okay, let's slow it down and tell me what really happened. And when did they know that this was going off the rails.

134
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:49.809
Bob Moesta: because all of that information is be very important to you. Basically start to tell them the subtleties of this is where you know it's going off the rails before they do, because you're actually giving them hints of here's what here's the. Here's the underlying causes of getting it to go off the rails. And then here's how we actually keep it on the rails.

135
00:13:49.960 --> 00:14:04.119
Bob Moesta: And so it's the aspect of being able to understand like, so when they switch to you, you've got to actually can. Sometimes you got to convince them that that they have a problem that they don't, that they just like. So in in many industries, people just assume this is the way it is.

136
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:12.760
Bob Moesta: And the fact is, so if you can actually start to articulate like, you know, everybody has a bad project once in a while. It's like, Yeah, you don't need to stand for this anymore. Here's why.

137
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:23.500
Bob Moesta: But I would actually do a set of churn interviews, of, of, to be honest, of your competitors. What? When? So when people come to you, they left somebody else. Why did they leave somebody else

138
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.916
Bob Moesta: cause? That's why they're gonna leave you, too.

139
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.240
Carlo Scaglia: It's just what to ask if it's rhetorical. If you want me to answer it.

140
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.870
Bob Moesta: You can answer it if you want.

141
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:52.550
Carlo Scaglia: Very cool. Well, in the it's because our habits around content consumption change in the past. You're watching these big, long ads on TV. And that's how agencies were built. Now we changed to much more social 1st fast consumption, a lot more content, and agencies are stuck in those old ways, so they can't keep up with the demand, and brands are like, no, we need this much faster at a different price

142
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.160
Carlo Scaglia: ago. That's quality.

143
00:14:54.410 --> 00:15:12.140
Bob Moesta: So this is. This is sometimes stating the obvious, but it's the. It's the notion of putting together 3 or 4 things that they haven't put together before. So it's kind of like, look, this has gone down. This is what's happened. This is the other thing that happened. And when you put those 3 things together, you get this problem. And they're like, Oh, man, we live. That problem.

144
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.760
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah.

145
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.619
Bob Moesta: Right? So that that's what you want to be able to kind of piece together.

146
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.120
Carlo Scaglia: Okay. Nice. Thanks.

147
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.680
Bob Moesta: Yep.

148
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.560
Carlo Scaglia: Thanks, Jake. Those are good points, too.

149
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:45.389
Jake Gutstein: Yeah, no, for sure. I I think, like, Bob, when you're saying, explain the problem better than they can articulate. What you're hinting at is when you have these conversations on repeat. It's all causal, like something's gonna happen as a result of exactly what happened right before it. So it's just pattern recognition in the language of the people that you're talking to, so that when you turn around and talk to the next group of people, you're just essentially repeat you. They don't even realize, they repeat exactly what they're thinking.

150
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:52.689
Bob Moesta: So this is where this is, where, for example, in demand side sales. I I don't know is that the one they're reading? I don't know if that.

151
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, they all read it.

152
00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:20.999
Bob Moesta: So so, my thing. This is where at some point it's like you know. Tell me, tell me about your last worst agency experience, and they'll start it, and then you go. Hold on a second. Let's see if I can finish it, and you can literally play the causation out of saying, Oh, then this happened, and this happened, and they're like, how do you know that? How do you know that these things happened? And the reality is like it's because there's a pattern in it, and you'll be able to see it. And when they see you know that it's better than they do, that's when they're going to start listening.

153
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.040
Carlo Scaglia: Okay. Nice. Cool.

154
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.950
Bob Moesta: Because they really don't have a solution in mind. They don't know what to do right.

155
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.689
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And.

156
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:37.879
Bob Moesta: So and so. So the moment you know the problem they're going to assume, you've got a better solution than anybody else, because nobody's been able to articulate the problem that well.

157
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:59.469
Bob Moesta: and and you want to articulate the problem in both social, emotional, and functional ways. So it's not just. Oh, we were late and we were over budget. It's like, I almost lost my job. And you know, at some point everybody was standing around, and you know, it's like like the the real kind of like the the real experience of kind of going through that that bad project.

158
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:06.040
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, I also read the competing against Locke, and it was a cool, cool chat around those 3 3 teams.

159
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:06.710
Bob Moesta: Yep.

160
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:07.540
Bob Moesta: Cool.

161
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.670
Chloe Lannert: Alright!

162
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.700
Bob Moesta: Thank you.

163
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.509
Carlo Scaglia: Thank you. Thank you both.

164
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:13.650
Bob Moesta: Chloe, whose name.

165
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:16.190
Chloe Lannert: Next we've got brio here.

166
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.259
Alex Nativelle: Hey, Bob, how you doing.

167
00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.159
Bob Moesta: Hey! How are you?

168
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:26.960
Alex Nativelle: Hey? My name's Alex. I'm the co-founder, and CEO of Brio. We've heard so much about you, so I was eager to to meet you. It's it's nice to have you here.

169
00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.119
Alex Nativelle: Thank you.

170
00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:54.220
Alex Nativelle: So Brio is an AI powered interview coach to prepare and assess critical conversations, starting with job interviews. So it's basically helping you prepare for job interviews. And we sell to higher ed institutions, universities. We have now 10 paying customers and 50 K of AR. And in France you can probably tell, maybe, from the accent. And we're looking into us expansion.

171
00:17:54.310 --> 00:18:10.840
Alex Nativelle: So our learning questions for those jobs to be done. Where? Why do some buyers buy right away and other takes a lot more time, and how to better sell to them, pinpoint the problem and understand whether us. Institutions work the same way as.

172
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:18.970
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah. So this is, this is where it's, it's tricky, because you're actually selling to universities. But consumption happens by the students.

173
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:19.810
Alex Nativelle: Exactly.

174
00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:24.299
Bob Moesta: And so and so the question is, are the students paying for this? Or is this free to the con? To them?

175
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:29.020
Bob Moesta: It's free for the students that's in my in my world, that's a problem.

176
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.159
Bob Moesta: Free is free is a problem, because what happens is, is

177
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:37.139
Bob Moesta: anybody. Their expectations for free are very low.

178
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:54.070
Bob Moesta: And so what happens is is, the fact is, is, even even though you're offering it free, and it seems like it should be free. The fact is, is, if I so, for example, like what we did at Base Camp, one of the things we realized is that $39 a month, and and this was back in 2,010 and 11.

179
00:18:54.350 --> 00:19:06.630
Bob Moesta: People didn't believe they could run their entire business on the product at $39 a month. And so what happened is is we end up taking the price up to $99 a month, and you'd think that we would lose people.

180
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:22.520
Bob Moesta: But what actually happened is we actually grew. We grew almost 22%, because of all those people who didn't want to pay didn't think it was actually good enough. And so part of this is, this is where it's somehow I would think about how you have. You might actually offer the the

181
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:39.320
Bob Moesta: the university to pay, and then figure out a way in which you can actually think about getting the students committed to doing it. Because if it's free, it's kind of like they they don't. They just don't value like, I believe that free is one of those things. That's a very. It's like 0. It's a very dangerous number.

182
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:58.740
Bob Moesta: right? And a minimum of charging them. $5 will actually have more commitment to them or $2, or I don't know a couple of euros just to basically make sure that they're in on it. And you can donate that money back to the school and do whatever you want. But the fact is, by having some commitment from them, will be really, really important in this.

183
00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.349
Alex Nativelle: So we would charge both the universities and the students.

184
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:10.379
Bob Moesta: Well, you say so. Here's the thing is what I would say to the university is like, look, you have a bunch of free tools and that. And people don't use them.

185
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:34.319
Bob Moesta: And they're gonna say, Yes, I'm like, okay. So here's the thing is is one of the reasons why they don't use them is because they don't have any commitment to it. The reality is, if we can get commitment, even if it's a small commitment of $2, and we'll refund the $2 back to you or we'll we'll donate this money towards the career counseling center or whatever it is. But the reality is is by you charging them just a little bit more. The fact is, all of a sudden they're gonna have a different

186
00:20:34.761 --> 00:20:42.850
Bob Moesta: they they'll have a different level of you. My belief is you'll see usage go up by 50% at least.

187
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:49.160
Bob Moesta: Right? This is where everybody says they don't want to pay, but the reality is is when they don't pay, they don't value.

188
00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:54.650
Bob Moesta: And so the other part is is, there's 3 3 currencies I talk about.

189
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.599
Bob Moesta: One is money right?

190
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:07.109
Bob Moesta: And if there is no money involved so like in volunteering situations, there's no money involved, then time is the currency. How much time are they going to put in for what outcome?

191
00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:19.140
Bob Moesta: Right? And the last one is knowledge. If they have knowledge, they'll actually do something. So I spend time and money to get knowledge. I actually use my knowledge and time to make money

192
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:26.970
Bob Moesta: right? So it's that that triangle of money, time, and knowledge is what you're really trying to get them to figure out how to do.

193
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.526
Alex Nativelle: Oh, okay,

194
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:39.210
Alex Nativelle: One of the critics, you know, like, when we did the job, one of the things why, they bought the this tool. The universities and the carrier centers.

195
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.679
Bob Moesta: Why the university bought the tool.

196
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:51.589
Alex Nativelle: Exactly is because they have a bad reputation. They've seen us not productive, not innovative. And they want to offer technical solutions. And you know innovative solutions to their students.

197
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.930
Bob Moesta: And I think what to do, what.

198
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:57.049
Alex Nativelle: To train them for job interviews to help them get jobs.

199
00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:10.719
Bob Moesta: So is it? So? The thing is is what I would tell you if the rep, if it's a reputational problem, that's a different buy than actually, if I need to actually get more people play like, I want to go from 92% placement to 97% placement

200
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.050
Bob Moesta: like, is that what they want, or they just want? They just don't want to look bad.

201
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:20.240
Alex Nativelle: I. So I try to push them. And I think it's more they don't want to look bad.

202
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:41.449
Alex Nativelle: Yeah. And and the thing is they want, they. They are focused on placement, and they are focused on maximizing placement. At the same time they know that there are many, many aspects that go into placement, and it's very difficult to move the needle or conclusively, and to

203
00:22:41.670 --> 00:23:10.929
Alex Nativelle: to be to be kind of rewarded personally for it, or to feel that they've had an impact. So although they report and they communicate a lot about the the fact that placement is really important, including in the marketing materials, etc. In practice they are trying to. They they value tools that give them very specific things about things that they've done that are obviously going to help with placement

204
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:16.960
Alex Nativelle: like, Hey, 10 people did an interview. That's a very concrete tool.

205
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.900
Alex Nativelle: And so that's that's the the.

206
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.460
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

207
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.830
Alex Nativelle: Reason why the the issue there.

208
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:28.187
Bob Moesta: This is. This is why I have the. What I would tell you is, it's not.

209
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.229
Bob Moesta: I would say

210
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:41.939
Bob Moesta: I I wanna I want to give you my opinion about this, because I have some experience in it, and I'm not sure I don't want to discourage you about it, but like trying to sell to universities is really really hard.

211
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:53.290
Bob Moesta: like like. The fact is, is, these are people which which is very strange. But but so I do a lot of work in higher Ed, and you start to realize that they act like they have no money.

212
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.379
Bob Moesta: Yet they're literally charging students outrageous amounts of money

213
00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:09.210
Bob Moesta: right? And so they're gonna try to negotiate with you to make this thing as small as possible, because it's for the good of the students. But the reality is, they're not willing to pay you enough money to actually make it work

214
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.280
Bob Moesta: right. The thing that you have to realize is you have to actually make sure this helps the student make progress

215
00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:25.240
Bob Moesta: right? Because if it doesn't help the student make progress, they'll buy it. And say, we have this new technology coming in. Here's what it is, but if nobody uses it, it's still gonna go away.

216
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:46.630
Bob Moesta: And so you've got to make sure that this is so, my to me. My 1st priority is not to sell more universities. It's to increase consumption at the university by the students before I scale, because if I scale before that. I'm then stuck, having to revamp every every university I've added until I realize how to crack the code on getting students to do it.

217
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.919
Alex Nativelle: And for that, having a price for the students will increase.

218
00:24:52.920 --> 00:25:03.759
Bob Moesta: I I would start to experiment in that area. My my experience says that if if I do it for free, or I ask other people to do it. The fact is, like, like.

219
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:18.340
Bob Moesta: like Basecamp Base camp. One of the things we had at Base Camp is we had a free Demo. They could. Actually, they could literally have a demo for 30 days like so they could load whatever. But the limitation of 30 days

220
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:24.180
Bob Moesta: made people never actually load basecamp to be big enough to see if it worked for them or not.

221
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:43.390
Bob Moesta: And so what we end up doing is creating what we call base camp personal, which is, you get one project for life, and we want you to actually plan a wedding plan, a vacation plan, a you know, a kitchen remodel, whatever it is in your life, but plan one whole real project in it, and it literally quadrupled

222
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.710
Bob Moesta: conversions.

223
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:46.420
Alex Nativelle: Yeah.

224
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.140
Bob Moesta: Right and so.

225
00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.550
Alex Nativelle: It's this.

226
00:25:47.550 --> 00:26:16.280
Bob Moesta: Notion of getting them to do use the product in a way that helps them get better at interviews. And so it's like making sure that there's some way they they're actually going to use it. Because my belief is, these students have a thousand tools they have access to. They don't know how to navigate any one of them, and they have some somebody on the other side who says, Oh, just go to this web page, and here's all the things we can help you with, but they have no idea how to source it. They have no idea how to do it like it's it's like just a series of tools, right?

227
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:43.049
Alex Nativelle: Yeah. And the communication is, you know, blocked by the school kind of like, the school doesn't communicate right with the students. So there's different. So what I'm thinking, hearing you is, we could, because the students are already complaining about how much the school pay. So if you say, Oh, you give me a tool, but I need to pay again. So what I was thinking was, Can you can we say like an interview is probably $10, and because you have your school is gonna be 5 for you.

228
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:55.649
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, something like that. Yeah, yeah, you have to be creative around how you're gonna do it. But what I'm telling you is if they're not willing to actually put either money or time into it. The reality is is like, it's they're just not gonna do it.

229
00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:04.410
Bob Moesta: And so the university can buy. See, this is this is where I I talk about where people can buy something, but they don't consume it. You will be fired.

230
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:05.070
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, yeah.

231
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:22.140
Bob Moesta: Consumption is the student part of this, and I believe the harder part is not selling universities, though that is hard. I think the harder part is getting the the students to use it in the right time and space when they're ready to go for like, do they finally see the tool when they have had a really shitty interview.

232
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.390
Alex Nativelle: Right.

233
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:39.319
Bob Moesta: And so now they'll value it even more. And so it's like, Well, do you actually set them up to say like, Go do an interview, and then let's talk about it. And then, when you talk about like, all right, here's the things we can do to make it better. But if you try to do it before they do an interview, they're going to go. I know that. I know that I know that, and the reality is they don't.

234
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:41.990
Alex Nativelle: Yeah.

235
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.639
Alex Nativelle: I get it.

236
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.429
Bob Moesta: I know, Jake, do you have anything to add, or or

237
00:27:49.440 --> 00:28:00.879
Jake Gutstein: I love the idea of money, time, and knowledge as a triangle, and I understand that that is an ancillary to this conversation. But I'm definitely taking away, because something also, when you exchange money to save time.

238
00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.530
Jake Gutstein: Yes.

239
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:08.979
Bob Moesta: That was like the previous one. I'm willing. I'm willing, to spend money to save time and sourcing like that makes lots of sense.

240
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.229
Alex Nativelle: In some of the sorry.

241
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.389
Bob Moesta: So my my thing is is that the the other part is, is.

242
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:22.189
Bob Moesta: have you talked to students, and where they struggle around interviewing? Do you know where their struggling moments are in interviewing.

243
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:46.640
Alex Nativelle: Yes, we started with the universities, but we've also doing like the we've target the super users of Brio, who've done like more than 7 interviews on Brio. Recently, we had. People do like 40 interviews on there, and the pain points are around. Stress is a big, big factor of people wanting to rehearse as much as possible, and then competitiveness of

244
00:28:46.940 --> 00:29:12.119
Alex Nativelle: interviews like are those like very high positions and with big salaries? If so, I feel that I'm not prepared enough, right? If this is a job that I feel I'm interviewing with, like juniors and stuff like that, I'm like, yeah, I could probably vibe it. But if I'm you know, in an investment banking interview or consulting interview, I know I really need to prepare. And so now I'm stressed and I need to go into.

245
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:12.819
Bob Moesta: Got it.

246
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:26.080
Bob Moesta: So there's certain categories of interviews you want like, do you have? Do you have it broken down by categories like, here's how you do a financial interview. Here's your how you do a soft engineering interview. Here's it like for you, broken that way.

247
00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.960
Alex Nativelle: That's what we're starting to do. Yeah.

248
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.830
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, I spotted.

249
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:29.749
Alex Nativelle: To do this.

250
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.270
Bob Moesta: By the way, they might be different processes.

251
00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.410
Alex Nativelle: Yes.

252
00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:44.849
Bob Moesta: Right. So so the way I study and prepare for a financial investment banking job is different than how I would study and prepare and practice. For a for example, a consulting job.

253
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:46.870
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, thank, you.

254
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.980
Bob Moesta: Is that that you're finding that as well.

255
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:55.090
Alex Nativelle: Yes, yes, and you know, being very process specific is what gives us credibility as well.

256
00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:03.510
Bob Moesta: So. So the other thing I will tell you, and this is more so. I wrote a I wrote a book about this. I don't know if you've seen it. Have you seen the book? Job moves.

257
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.500
Alex Nativelle: Yes, yes, we have.

258
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.050
Alex Nativelle: That's your latest.

259
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:20.370
Bob Moesta: Oh, that's my latest. So here's the thing is is, my thing is is, I think this product is equally as important, and people trying to find a new job in the real, the real world part.

260
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:33.440
Bob Moesta: So there's actually a a value added, because think of it! Most people work for 3 to 5 years in one place, and then they lose their all the skills and all the knowledge of what interviewing is like, and they got to relearn it again.

261
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:46.129
Bob Moesta: and they have all the same anxieties when they're going to interview about all the same things. And so do you actually have a a university version. But do you also have a direct to consumer version for basically people interviewing for their next job?

262
00:30:47.130 --> 00:31:01.390
Alex Nativelle: We don't have a direct to consumer product yet, but we've partnered with an executive coaching firm. So we have coach people who are like out of executive jobs and like a 1 year coaching program looking for other jobs. So we.

263
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.249
Alex Nativelle: I think if you.

264
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:12.299
Alex Nativelle: we said that we would 1st have Bob Booster as advisor, and then we would kick, start the G. 2 C. Offering.

265
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:12.680
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

266
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:22.170
Bob Moesta: so this is, this is the hard part is, I think the fact is, is, the university is probably where you can add the most value, because they're almost the most naive.

267
00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:33.440
Bob Moesta: But the fact is, is, the people who will value it more are like the 28 year old who's literally been at a startup for 5 years and wanting to go somewhere else, and has no idea how to interview for the next job.

268
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:35.290
Alex Nativelle: Yes.

269
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:46.781
Bob Moesta: And so my thing is is and it's not. It's not a like, my belief is there's lots of places you can advertise and and like we, we've, we started just doing some Facebook ads, and we were generally able to generate a lot of a lot of

270
00:31:48.471 --> 00:32:00.409
Bob Moesta: just people willing to sign up and talk to us about it. And we learned basically the channel of how people are going towards navigating their their their career change or career move

271
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:30.899
Bob Moesta: right? So so I I think the universe like, I don't want to discourage you on the university side. I think that it's there. But from a bigger business model perspective, I think there's there's way more people who want to change jobs and don't know how. And interviewing is a big part of that. The other part is figuring out like where they want to go and what they want to do. But the you know, that last part of getting to the interview part that scares more people like it's almost like it's too hard to change jobs that I'm just going to stay here for another year.

272
00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:39.550
Bob Moesta: and my belief is there's way more people wanting to switch jobs, but they don't know how. And that's kind of like, how like, that's how we came to writing the book.

273
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.119
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, so we 100% agree.

274
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:54.830
antoinecarriere: And started with. That is because we also think that it's a lot more difficult to crack that that piece. It's a big opportunity. But it's also going to be a lot more difficult to crack.

275
00:32:54.830 --> 00:33:21.979
Bob Moesta: So yeah, I I do agree with that. I think I think the hard part to crack. There is the marketing and the the the go to market strategy part of it. But I think the fact is, you you might actually just start testing in that space and recruiting people to help in that space because they're gonna actually have a better feedback than the students, because the students will have no feedback at all. Besides, it was too hard or too long, or like they're just

276
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:29.399
Bob Moesta: they're not as engaged where, like somebody who's 28 to 30 trying to find that job, they're in man. They're they're they're gonna spend the time.

277
00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:37.009
antoinecarriere: Yeah. And and that's that's that for us. It brings the question of how much investment should we

278
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:42.610
antoinecarriere: make into fighting that battle of engagement with the students.

279
00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:42.950
Bob Moesta: Yes.

280
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:53.670
antoinecarriere: As opposed to something that is in the back of our mind. That is you. You find them there, you. You put a hook on the students at the University.

281
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:54.489
Bob Moesta: Yeah, will they keep.

282
00:33:54.490 --> 00:34:10.969
antoinecarriere: And then, and then, as they leave, they become an alumna, and they get their 1st year free, etc. And then we do some sort of a Hey, let's do the end of year, your end of your self preview, etc, etc, and how to how to stay in touch

283
00:34:11.732 --> 00:34:20.230
antoinecarriere: sufficiently kind of thoughtfully to to be top of mind, but not too often, because again, there's.

284
00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:20.669
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

285
00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:25.879
antoinecarriere: Yes, problems you don't have. We're talking about a lifetime. Probably. I mean, we're talking about here.

286
00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:26.229
Bob Moesta: Yep.

287
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:40.010
antoinecarriere: Between the first, st the the 1st the 1st hook, and and at you, as you said at some point, there's kind of some crisis that is going to happen when the 1st job kind of just didn't

288
00:34:40.070 --> 00:35:01.920
antoinecarriere: they? They realize that this is not. This is not the the end. There's the next step going on. So so again, we we very, very. We buy a lot of what you're what you're saying. And in terms of. That's the difficulty is how to get them how to. And so right now, what we're saying is, we go at you the university level, because

289
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:21.719
antoinecarriere: that's that's kind of a formative part of their journey and and and maybe it's our acquisition mechanism just to kind of start tracking them as they find their their 1st job, and then but what you're saying is a different.

290
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:35.339
Bob Moesta: Yeah. So so I I get that. So so now, the so really one of the big assumptions or the big things you have to prove out is that like, you can actually keep people's attention after they've gotten their 1st job. Because if you can't get that.

291
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:54.520
Bob Moesta: then you've got a completely different model. And you're you're counting on kind of recurring purchases. And what I what I what I've found in the space is that that is true. Once they find a way that works for them, they do remember it, and they do come back. But you have to make sure that it's easy enough for them to remember, and they know how to get there.

292
00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:56.950
Jake Gutstein: Yeah, so.

293
00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:01.559
Bob Moesta: I I think that's that. So it's almost like you can. You can almost get

294
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:16.070
Bob Moesta: trial through the university. But the reality is is eventually the university is not. The university is not going to actually help you get it used. They're just gonna offer it to them. You still have to sell it to the student, and that's going to be the challenging part.

295
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.270
antoinecarriere: Yep.

296
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:30.774
antoinecarriere: And and maybe it's a different thing that we need to sell to the students. as we. Because to your point, we're talking about something that is so infrequent in the in the lifetime.

297
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:44.486
antoinecarriere: 1 1 thing. And again, I I think at this point the problem is where it's a lot of ideation and brainstorming and very difficult to. But things we need to to test. It's around like

298
00:36:44.970 --> 00:37:03.830
antoinecarriere: Today. Free news is garbage news and paid news. People don't pay for paid news, and so there might be there might be something there in terms of kind of some sort of of paid package of of news or expertise, or like the equivalent of your of your magazine subscription.

299
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:27.759
Bob Moesta: Yep, yep. The other thing that I've I've learned is so for example, I did this with language labs, I built a language lab software that basically helps people learn foreign languages right? And so what what I did is I went to foreign language teachers in high school and in colleges and basically said, Look, I'm trying to design the language lab of the future. Would you be willing to sit down and talk to me about it? And then, when I'm done, I'm gonna give you a report.

300
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:54.489
Bob Moesta: And so out of this is like, How do you give a report like as you hear all these things. And you, you hear all these different jobs. How do you actually tell the university of the jobs that the students have? So you actually help them figure out kind of what's the portfolio products they need. And it's already you. And they can't replicate it. They're not. Gonna they're they're really not gonna use it that much. But they they just keep pushing you as you're a leader of how you're trying to build engagement where they're just literally trying to

301
00:37:54.580 --> 00:38:07.069
Bob Moesta: send out another email. And let's put it on a banner and a flyer. And like all these crazy things that don't work. And so part of it is to figure out kind of like, how do you actually help the universities look better about buying these things?

302
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.090
antoinecarriere: Yeah. That's a very good point.

303
00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:13.620
Bob Moesta: The the real thing to me, though, is that I I would be

304
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:26.870
Bob Moesta: personally, I would be afraid to getting like going from 10 universities to 100 universities, and that I don't have enough knowledge of how to actually convert the students. And so now I have a hundred universities, and nobody's using the product.

305
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:34.959
Bob Moesta: I'd rather stay with the 10 Universities a little bit longer. Figure out how to make sure I got engagement and then go find go from 10 to 100.

306
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.320
antoinecarriere: Yeah, I think I think that's.

307
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.789
Alex Nativelle: It's clearly a consideration on our end.

308
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.670
Alex Nativelle: I think it's not 10. It's more like 30 cheers.

309
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:48.560
Alex Nativelle: because it's it's kind of we're we're breakeven. We're good.

310
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:48.920
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

311
00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.799
Alex Nativelle: Point. If the churn is high, better have 30 than 300.

312
00:38:52.800 --> 00:39:06.379
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. Well, and and but the reality is like, you wanna learn the right things because it if you go to a hundred that you then have to change. If you find out new ways to do stuff, you have to, then go change all 100 customers, and that's really.

313
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:13.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This conversation because Bob has disproportionate domain expertise on this subject matter.

314
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:14.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Given the.

315
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:15.349
Alex Nativelle: Go to click on it.

316
00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:15.690
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

317
00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:19.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We do have to make room for some of the other companies and stuff up now, though so.

318
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:42.200
Bob Moesta: And and it's a clear, struggling moment in the market. I think the the part of the the issue is the structural problem of universities and students. Because, again, how is it actually work? And it's the the real value is convoluted between the University buying it and giving it to the students as opposed to the students buying it and actually using it. So just I would think hard about that that angle of it, because

319
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:50.349
Bob Moesta: it's it's an easy way to get revenue, but because it's easier to sell the universities and individual students. But the reality is like it's harder to convert.

320
00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:52.430
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, thank you so much, Bob.

321
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:53.359
Bob Moesta: Yup. Thank you.

322
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, harvest is up, and then May, you're on deck.

323
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.570
Ankur Toshniwal: Bob nice to meet you.

324
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.609
Bob Moesta: Hey! How are you?

325
00:40:03.214 --> 00:40:25.940
Ankur Toshniwal: My name's ankur and so yeah, we're building harvest harvest powers, platforms with web and document data using no code. We reduce 7 h of web research and data entry to 15 min. While providing analysts with the precision and accuracy accuracy, they need to deliver high quality insights to their own customers. We have 2 annual subscriptions and one monthly subscription right now.

326
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:28.050
Bob Moesta: Okay.

327
00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:37.959
Ankur Toshniwal: Our learning questions before jobs was what types of companies are impacted the most by inaccurate and incomplete data entry and web research outcomes.

328
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:59.449
Ankur Toshniwal: We wanted to know how much companies are currently paying analysts or web scraping software today to do this work. Are there net new unlocks that happen when you massively drive down the cost so that they can do things they they couldn't before. Are there internal organization structures of large orgs that do data entry that we can either replace or massively scale up.

329
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:03.220
Bob Moesta: Okay. And what did you find? What have you found to date?

330
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:04.690
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah. So we we.

331
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:09.063
Ankur Toshniwal: So some, some of the core core synthesis is

332
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:20.169
Ankur Toshniwal: from the analyst perspective is, I need to reduce the time I spend doing web research for individual customers, so I can onboard more. So it's a time time saving thing they need to do.

333
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.530
Bob Moesta: The difference between analysis and onboarding.

334
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:32.580
Ankur Toshniwal: Onboarding analysis is I see. So onboarding is being able to do a particular set of

335
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:38.289
Ankur Toshniwal: I mean onboarding is for, like the customers that are coming to their particular platform.

336
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:45.900
Ankur Toshniwal: So the same, I guess. But you're not gonna do analysis on random things. You're only gonna do it on the ones that you're trying to either sell.

337
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:57.560
Bob Moesta: And and is so is onboarding, basically playing out the research that you did. So there's a difference between me going off and doing the research. And then there's okay. I gotta go play it off to these 15 different companies.

338
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:08.650
Ankur Toshniwal: Correct. Yeah, like, I need to do the research. That's for my own insight. No, that's this is a different use case. They actually need to put this or deploy this in front of their customers, and that's where the stakes are much higher.

339
00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:20.360
Bob Moesta: Yep. And this is I mean, I've so I've done this for several different kind of research and consulting firms. So I I know exact. I think I know exactly what you're talking about. And and who buys this.

340
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:22.120
Bob Moesta: Yeah. So

341
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.830
Bob Moesta: the analyst, the analysts don't buy this, do do they? It's it's the. It's the manager of the analysts.

342
00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:40.700
Ankur Toshniwal: Usually. Yeah, it's like a coo Coo CEO. Sometimes. At small teams. It's it's a CEO, but usually a CEO, sometimes at hedge funds, more technical companies. It could be a head of data or head of head of yeah, data.

343
00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:45.390
Bob Moesta: And what, what, what, what metric are they trying to in influence when they buy this.

344
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.328
Ankur Toshniwal: So for them for yeah, there's 2 different

345
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.830
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, there's there's different different levels. Have different metrics. Right?

346
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:58.680
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah. So ultimately, they're trying to reduce. They're trying to spend less money on contractors, analysts and data engineers.

347
00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.260
Bob Moesta: Okay.

348
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:05.710
Ankur Toshniwal: Product operational. They want to reduce their costs so they can become profitable as fast as possible in that particular sector of the business.

349
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:17.970
Bob Moesta: Got it. And and ultimately they don't really make money while they're doing the analysis. They make money while they're doing the onboarding. And so ultimately, we wanna the ratio of analysis to onboarding has to change dramatically.

350
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:27.539
Ankur Toshniwal: Correct correct. There's a second part, which is, after that happens. They need to continuously provide customers with an insights edge, otherwise turn.

351
00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:32.240
Bob Moesta: Yes, there's an onboard. There's a continuous kind of scheduled part of it, too, is like, if

352
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.709
Bob Moesta: what what does it mean to have an inside edge.

353
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:54.670
Ankur Toshniwal: Basically go deeper into into particular sectors, companies people, and provide particular. You know, if it could be contact information or insights that other AI tools, other products don't have access to or aren't surfacing at the right time to the customer.

354
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.470
Bob Moesta: Got it? And and are they

355
00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:03.949
Bob Moesta: that you still have, like a a person managing the relationship between the research and the and the

356
00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:11.720
Bob Moesta: and the the onboarding. And this isn't completely automated. Where there's no, there's no analyst, or there's no human in in between. It's just

357
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:20.349
Bob Moesta: providing human tool or providing AI tools to a human, so they can do more clients, and they can spend less time on analysis.

358
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:34.380
Ankur Toshniwal: Correct, correct and a lot of that is because, again, this is maybe more less of the jobs to be done, but more of the paranoia that we've understood about. These, these, our users and analysts is they have tried AI tools and have gotten bit really bad by.

359
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:34.970
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

360
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:41.900
Ankur Toshniwal: Bad links, bad content. So they don't trust them huge, you know. Then they have to do it manually. So yeah.

361
00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:50.320
Bob Moesta: And and and ultimately they've burned. So what's the what's the test you provide to them to show them that yours works and and chat? Gpt doesn't.

362
00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:53.430
Ankur Toshniwal: We would often just do it side by side.

363
00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:57.749
Bob Moesta: And that's that's enough for for the. And how much is this service.

364
00:44:58.061 --> 00:45:17.359
Ankur Toshniwal: It's a thousand dollars. Well, $30 a month for kind of consumers what we call like kind of that's the readily self serve. We generally are charging a thousand plus contracts for annual subscriptions. To be honest, we're gonna be going much higher. We're probably gonna going into 5,000 range as within this month.

365
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:24.080
Bob Moesta: Got it? And and are you gonna grandfather, your your

366
00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:26.700
Bob Moesta: existing clients in? Or how are you gonna handle that.

367
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:43.999
Ankur Toshniwal: Usage based. So there's no the A after you go to hit the $1,000 cap anything you spend over that will is we charge percent per credit percent. Basically, there's a token system. And so you know that we don't need to do anything for them if they use it above the $1,000. There that's built in.

368
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.021
Bob Moesta: So one of one of the things to think about on the pricing there is

369
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.120
Bob Moesta: when you start to do it as a token.

370
00:45:52.617 --> 00:46:12.950
Bob Moesta: Most of these people are trying to budget and plan like cash flow and everything else. And so when I don't know how many tokens I'm using, this becomes a real big pain point later, because it's like, Oh, I thought it was gonna cost a thousand a month, and it's cost me 14,000 a month. And so all of a sudden, it's not really cheaper. I'm getting better information. But I'm actually it's not cheaper anymore. Right?

371
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:14.300
Bob Moesta: Yup. And so.

372
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.780
Ankur Toshniwal: We've actually talked about outcome based pricing.

373
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:18.270
Bob Moesta: Yep.

374
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:27.690
Ankur Toshniwal: Help! Help us! Help us understand what? Not even like. The price point itself. But what is the name of that outcome, like? What is the unit.

375
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:37.608
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah. So that that's so, that's where I was trying to get to is the is the metric is like, you know, analysis hours over basically.

376
00:46:38.777 --> 00:46:40.442
Bob Moesta: what? What did you call it?

377
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:52.260
Bob Moesta: onboarding hours right? Like I if I can. Swift switch significantly swift the switch, the ratio of kind of those hours. That's that's a big metric to them.

378
00:46:52.260 --> 00:47:11.640
Bob Moesta: right? But if they actually end up doing now that they're not doing, they could do what they did before, and you know, in 50, in 8 h and 15 min. But now they're doing, you know, for 4 h and going way deeper and doing way more things. And ultimately you're not helping them because the margins don't actually add up that way. Then.

379
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:13.160
Bob Moesta: right.

380
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.470
Ankur Toshniwal: If they're yeah, unless they're doing more.

381
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:25.069
Bob Moesta: Well, if they're doing more and charging more. But a lot of times they're not be able to charge more. They just trying to provide more insights, because the way their contract is written is different. Right?

382
00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:26.390
Ankur Toshniwal: Right, right, yeah.

383
00:47:26.669 --> 00:47:41.769
Bob Moesta: So it's like we're gonna provide you 5, you know, for 6, 6 reports a year. Here's what they look like. Here's what's going on. But all of a sudden, if now it's now I've got, I've got more information. It makes it harder. There's like a whole bunch of complications around it.

384
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.610
Ankur Toshniwal: So it's not necessarily about the number of reports that's actually not pretty.

385
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:51.319
Bob Moesta: No, I I don't. I don't think that's that's the because I believe that. The fact is is that that

386
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.060
Bob Moesta: it it might be the cost per report.

387
00:47:55.430 --> 00:48:22.679
Bob Moesta: right? That might be one of the metrics they have, or the time to produce, a report that might be another metric that they're interested in. And so ultimately, where does scale come from from? Their perspective is, if I can actually do you know, more reports faster. And I can. I can actually spend less money in producing those reports than the fact is, you know, that's a win win for both of us. But if you just make it the number of reports. It's like, okay, you're growing. They're growing. They don't really know the

388
00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:27.430
Bob Moesta: the thing that you're changing, which is, you're changing the fundamentals of where they spend their time.

389
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:34.115
Ankur Toshniwal: And then

390
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:58.520
Ankur Toshniwal: I one thing that we have been also kind of interested in and and trying to figure out if it's even worth trying to sell, or even worth trying to have. The conversation about is the net new opportunity that we get some inbound we get inbound for, but we struggle to be able to. I guess. Monetize because people come in with like a lot of aspiration sometimes, hey? I'll be able to do that.

391
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.270
Bob Moesta: Unrealistic expectations. Yeah, yeah.

392
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:05.100
Ankur Toshniwal: I track these particular trends. I want to do this. I want to do this, but then we ask them, are you doing this now

393
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.110
Ankur Toshniwal: they'll say no, and we.

394
00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:07.630
Bob Moesta: That's right.

395
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.620
Ankur Toshniwal: Why and you know, it's like, Oh.

396
00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:18.410
Bob Moesta: Too much money don't have enough. People don't like. So this is where this is, where I would tell you that that's kind of the risk that I kind of feel about this, which is

397
00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:26.190
Bob Moesta: like if I'm not doing it already. So what you're doing is you're enabling people who couldn't do research before to do research.

398
00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:31.769
Bob Moesta: That actually is a bigger market than trying to actually just help an analyst be better

399
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.410
Bob Moesta: right? Think of how many people want to do better research. But just don't have access to it.

400
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.190
Bob Moesta: Andrew, you're thinking, or you're I don't know what's going on there.

401
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:53.019
Andrew Fernandes: Yeah, yeah, so we we tried this with, with Vc analysts. As an example, Vc associates to help them do better pricing analysis, competitive analysis. What we found is

402
00:49:53.270 --> 00:50:04.929
Andrew Fernandes: that for a lot of them they were already doing it without going that deep, and they didn't feel compelled to need to go that deep. Maybe it's just that we're going after the wrong profile in Vc.

403
00:50:06.346 --> 00:50:09.780
Andrew Fernandes: Maybe consulting firm. We've we've spoken a little bit to consulting firms.

404
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:28.749
Bob Moesta: This is the yeah. So this is the difference between Tam and basically the the truly addressable market tam, which is the total addressable market is like. Like these people have analysts, they should be able to buy your product. This is what it is. But the reality is they're not struggling. If they're not struggling, they don't want your product.

405
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:32.500
Ankur Toshniwal: Right? Which is, which is why we actually shifted away from that. And when?

406
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.520
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, yeah, where does it.

407
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.669
Bob Moesta: Users yet, but but the but the point is is that they struggle with something

408
00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:54.700
Bob Moesta: so they might not struggle with that set of analysis, they might struggle with some other sets of analysis, and so, instead of asking them and showing them what you have, start by, start those calls with what are the top 3 things that you're struggling with in research that if you could solve would fundamentally change your business

409
00:50:55.030 --> 00:51:14.510
Bob Moesta: because and and to be honest, that's I call that. That's what I call a good question, because it's all of a sudden you're connecting some dots for them to go like I struggle with this. But if I solve that, does it really make the needle move? And you start to realize that they really have to think about it deeper, and they appreciate the question because nobody's asked them that question.

410
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:21.660
Bob Moesta: And then what you do is then you then you figure out from their situation how your product fits into their situation.

411
00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:30.690
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, yeah, I think for the ones that we have done this with it, it often is just like, it's just not like they? They have some.

412
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:35.680
Ankur Toshniwal: They're they're looking for, like, you know, like, yeah, pitch book. Yeah, it is an interesting one. Alright cool. We'll we'll.

413
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.160
Bob Moesta: So.

414
00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:36.540
Ankur Toshniwal: Too much.

415
00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:56.990
Bob Moesta: There's 2 parts of this right, or really 3 parts. One part is, can you provide them a new set of data that helps them actually do what they need to do right? So it's not they. They've got their own research, but they don't have time to do this other stuff, and you can literally supplement my data. So my reports are either easier, more comprehensive, whatever right

416
00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.100
Bob Moesta: the other one is, can you actually take the workload off of them

417
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:07.930
Bob Moesta: right? And then the other one is, where where do I want to do research? But I can't, because I just don't have the the resources to do it.

418
00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:13.729
Bob Moesta: I think those are the 3 big areas where I where where I try to focus when I'm talking to people who have analysts.

419
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:30.309
Bob Moesta: Gotcha. And and this is th. These are. And and the hard part is everybody's experimenting with AI. So you're just. You're in the midst of the noise, and and most people are failing like miserably at this. And so they kind of go like, Yeah, it's not for me, because we can't figure it out.

420
00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.899
Bob Moesta: And so what you need is you need a case, study or 2 to show

421
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:41.899
Bob Moesta: about how it's not only changed like what what you deliver to them, but how the relationships have changed with the agency and their customers.

422
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:42.540
Ankur Toshniwal: Hmm.

423
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.140
Bob Moesta: Right?

424
00:52:44.860 --> 00:53:00.589
Bob Moesta: Yeah, cause you can talk about what you did to basically make it cheaper or easier or faster. But the reality is like that. That's not necessarily because everybody says that it's like, what did you do to actually help us have a better relationship with our current set of clients or help us grow our client, base.

425
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:04.930
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, no, this. This makes a lot of sense.

426
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:15.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And and that last piece, that advice that Bob just shared is true for almost all of you. By the way, that's not just for harvest like that. What he just said, I think from a case study standpoint, I think many of you are in that same situation.

427
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:31.429
Ankur Toshniwal: Fundamentally being. How did this change? Not like time savings, but how did we massively scale up our business or change the way our our customers view us right like, how do they view us?

428
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:32.290
Jake Gutstein: All right here.

429
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.529
Bob Moesta: That's that's really what that that will actually grab their attention more than anything else. I think.

430
00:53:37.953 --> 00:53:39.646
Jake Gutstein: Is where like Bob?

431
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:51.559
Jake Gutstein: but like like Bob, will talk about like outcome, outcome versus output. Right? And if you're talking about analyst hours to onboarding hours. It's a great output, like it is something that speaks directly to them. But, like.

432
00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:56.880
Jake Gutstein: what does this actually mean for me lately is going to be the outcome. It's going to just spell out the story.

433
00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:07.180
Bob Moesta: It makes us more profitable makes us grow at a certain rate. It makes us a, you know, a better thing for the research. It increases our speed to market. But what are those things.

434
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:13.769
Jake Gutstein: Right, we'll do it for you. We can quantify how we'll do it for you, and we've done it for these people in these 2 ways.

435
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:14.450
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah.

436
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:18.059
Bob Moesta: Alright. Thank you. Guys both appreciate it. Thank you.

437
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:26.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You've been harvested. Now let's let's talk. Let's talk cars. This is this is the good one, Bob. This is the this, the spicy one I prepped you for. What's up? Viv?

438
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.856
Bob Moesta: Got it.

439
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.489
Vivian: Hi, Bob, it's really great to meet you.

440
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:29.310
Bob Moesta: How are you?

441
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.350
Bob Moesta: Thank you. Very.

442
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:44.790
Vivian: So make sense. We're making auto easy. It is an in dealership sales enablement tool that helps salespeople sell more cars faster. We match customers to the right vehicles in their inventory, and we bring new salespeople from 0 to effective in their 1st month. Yeah.

443
00:54:46.361 --> 00:54:55.209
Vivian: So we have 2 paying dealerships, but I'm firing one as a client and the one that is staying with us. They are actually looking to push it to the rest of their auto group, and we have a date set for that meeting.

444
00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:55.920
Bob Moesta: Okay.

445
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Vivian.

446
00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:05.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if I were to ask, can you also introduce yourself, like to give a little bit of background, and why you're doing this business. This is. This is a bit of a you guys know what I'm doing here, both of you.

447
00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:27.720
Vivian: So my name is Vivian. I'm CEO of May. My background's in automotive. I consulted 80 dealerships for General Motors. I was their dealer rep. And then I went to work at a tech startup as their head of marketing to help myself understand how to build startup. But I started this business because the women in my life were asking me which cars they should buy, and they were making uninformed decisions.

448
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:46.269
Vivian: and I ultimately walked them through the process. They ended up buying cars under my supervision with the tools that I'd given them. They ended up buying more brands, sorry brands that they weren't considering, and that was really cool as an oem girl. So I automated that process and then we met. Japnet built it, switched to b 2 b last year.

449
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.090
Bob Moesta: Love it? And why dealers? Why not direct.

450
00:55:49.930 --> 00:56:01.360
Vivian: We went direct. We were, we did. Everything was organic that went really well. We never connected it to inventory at that point, but we just realized it was hard to build that traction without marketing money.

451
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:07.289
Bob Moesta: Got it. Okay? And so part of this is, and what what happens if I have a dealer that only has, like one brand.

452
00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:13.499
Vivian: So it's this right now, the products in store. Only so custom. We're not bringing them new customers. The customers already in store.

453
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.230
Bob Moesta: Got it. Okay, got it.

454
00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:22.529
Bob Moesta: And and I'll alright. So we we both know we, we're doing something in this. I'm doing something in this area, right?

455
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:43.849
Bob Moesta: And so like, I I know way too much. So I I'm just gonna I'm how do I say? I'm gonna make sure that I don't reveal any of our trade secrets, but at the same time I'll provide you like any direct answers to questions, and I'll probably elaborate a little. But I'm not gonna elaborate too much, because I have a competitive business to this. Just so, you know.

456
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:44.680
Vivian: Yes.

457
00:56:44.680 --> 00:57:04.730
Bob Moesta: Got it. But I want to help. And I and I like competition. So I just want to make sure that it's like you understand like I want to. I want I want you to succeed, because if you succeed I'll succeed, because this is a wide, open business, wide open especially, I'll say, on the female side. They have no idea about cars and they don't really care and they just they don't want to be sold right.

458
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:12.879
Bob Moesta: so so it's it's it's a very interesting, and the the number of people who want a new car but don't know how to get it is massive.

459
00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:16.690
Bob Moesta: It's it's in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 million people.

460
00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:22.579
Bob Moesta: So got it. So what are you struggling with? What are the what are the jobs you have.

461
00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:40.409
Vivian: So we went out there to ask or to learn about whether we were actually solving the right problems. I have obviously a lot of information about this. But we wanna make sure that the problem that was does the problem match what we think we're solving with our current product. And then, because we have so many different stakeholders, how do we provide value to each

462
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:49.169
Vivian: holders? Which ones are more important? What are they motivated by, and how do we show value without tying our current performance to cars sold right now.

463
00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:51.690
Bob Moesta: Got it? Who's who are you selling to.

464
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:53.540
Vivian: We sell to the Gms.

465
00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:54.649
Bob Moesta: The GM, okay.

466
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.409
Vivian: But our end users are the salespeople.

467
00:57:57.410 --> 00:58:00.465
Bob Moesta: Yup, and what do what are they? What will they stop using

468
00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:06.089
Bob Moesta: if if you're if you're really successful, what can they cut out of their portfolio of tools. They have.

469
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:07.070
Vivian: Their crms.

470
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:09.400
Bob Moesta: Entire. Crm.

471
00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:15.480
Vivian: We could get there. But right now, what we're replacing is either paper guest sheets or their manual process of just remembering information questions.

472
00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:24.120
Bob Moesta: Got it. Yep, you're you're just better than nothing, because they really don't have anything besides, like you said, paper. Right? Okay.

473
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:30.299
Bob Moesta: all right, and and so you sell it in the dealers. How do the salespeople take it.

474
00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:40.450
Vivian: Sales, people that are newer. So 3 years and under are, take it well, especially the brand new ones. They're all young. Gen. Z. They prefer technology over paper, anyway.

475
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:51.959
Bob Moesta: Yup. They don't want to talk to people, they they they'd rather just interact. And if you can actually send somebody send a lead through your system, and it comes back out and says, Here's the car they want. Let's go for a test drive. They're like, this is awesome.

476
00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:52.810
Vivian: Yeah.

477
00:58:52.810 --> 00:59:06.940
Vivian: it's. And and also like part of our jobs. What we learned was they need to pivot in the conversation because they uncover more about their jobs what the customers hiring this vehicle for. And when that happens, the salesperson needs to be able to pivot, and they don't because they're just order taking.

478
00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:09.420
Bob Moesta: That's right. That's exactly right. Yep.

479
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.600
Bob Moesta: okay. And so, how? So have you built the process to do that?

480
00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:16.690
Bob Moesta: Yes. So.

481
00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.710
Vivian: So we have

482
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:31.549
Vivian: our system right now what we've done. We've taken surface level things. So we ask them what their challenges are. It's the salespeople are not following the process. They're not asking the right questions, and they're they're not putting the right information into the Crm.

483
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:46.510
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, that's the that's the that's the that's the GM talking about their salespeople going like these people. They they're not following our process. They don't have enough training. They're not doing what it is. Everybody has their own approach, everybody documents their own way. Our Crm is shit because there's no data in it.

484
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.140
Bob Moesta: something like that.

485
00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:58.619
Vivian: Yeah, it was actually through jobs that we were able to take all of those things and get to a deeper level to understand. It's not just about asking the questions about, did they actually get to the right budget to the right use case?

486
00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.450
Bob Moesta: Exactly. Did you get to the box right.

487
01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:29.990
Vivian: Exactly so now it's kind of changed, the diff like the framework on how we build our product moving forward. But I think that the challenges that we're facing is because the process is so not linear. And we're trying to build a product to help salespeople assist their customers, make progress at every single stage of those 6 stages of buying that makes a little bit confusing for us. The tools intended to help those customers see their options, make the trade offs those decisions. So at the end of the day the dealerships only care if they're

488
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:44.069
Vivian: they're selling more cars. That's their biggest pain point. And the sales process is part of that. And I'm trying to understand, how do we take our jobs, learnings and reframe selling more cars into something that we can actually align with right now without over promising things that we can't control.

489
01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.629
Bob Moesta: Yeah. So let me think about this.

490
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:52.918
Bob Moesta: So one thing is, is is

491
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:58.950
Bob Moesta: like. So the way we've started to talk about it is. What's the turnover in the salesforce.

492
01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:10.830
Bob Moesta: Because turnover is one of those things that really cost them a ton of money. And ultimately, how do we actually, how do we get new people up to speed faster. And how do we get people to stay longer?

493
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:24.429
Bob Moesta: So instead of instead of just making about sales, make it about all the headaches they have around. So like, if you ask them, how often do they have a meeting about sales and the their approach to sales? They'll gonna tell you every month they have a meeting on this.

494
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:49.540
Bob Moesta: and they have a bunch of tools. They have all these other like other lead generating tools, all these things, but like nobody's using any of them well, and how it works right? And so to me, I would try to figure out some surrogate things besides just almost like lead measures. The lag measure is, how many cars did you sell? But if I've got people staying longer and building skills, and actually, you know, and doing better, making more money. Then then

495
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:51.370
Bob Moesta: they're going to sell more cars.

496
01:01:52.690 --> 01:02:16.202
Bob Moesta: And so the the other thing is is, I might I might actually focus on newer salespeople, because at some point in time there they are a different breed, and it's like almost like you can. You can you can hone and shape them where the people have been there for 20 years, like the likelihood that you can convince them to use. The tool is probably just a little bit above 0.

497
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:40.070
Vivian: Yeah, that's exactly what we found was the way we originally tested this pilot. We found that we were able to new help. A new salesperson sell their 1st car on the 1st day of using our product, and he actually sold 8 cars in his 1st month. So the second store, what we had done was they had 8 salespeople, and they were hiring another 7, another batch of 3 more. So we launched this as like, this is their process for the store. There is no paper guest sheet. This is what they're using, and that's where we saw the lift.

498
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:43.690
Bob Moesta: That's right. And so and so part of it is, is.

499
01:02:44.190 --> 01:03:05.960
Bob Moesta: are you? Let's see how equipped are you for the for the onboarding and training part of this process like, because this is the what's interesting to me about this business is that you can build the software. But the harder part here is selling it and and installing it. It's not actually making the software. This is in most cases making the software is usually the harder part.

500
01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:16.259
Bob Moesta: That's not the case here, because the the process is so broken. It's it's literally a training and a and a and a and a selling problem more than it is a technical process problem

501
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:19.240
Bob Moesta: if that makes sense. So how are you guys addressing that.

502
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:44.279
Vivian: So sticking really close to the salespeople. We do weekly check-ins. I go into the store. I do debriefs with all the sales people. I've done lunch and learns at each one of the stores on more than one occasion, just to go over the product. And I found that the way that it has worked is when I can use real world examples other than that. Like it has been hard. It's taken us like 5 different times 3 different ways each time to be able to explain it to them.

503
01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:48.647
Bob Moesta: So one of one of the things I would suggest is that

504
01:03:49.060 --> 01:04:06.039
Bob Moesta: so like I did. I had a a company that sold countertops right, and I sold them to Home Depot. I sold them into Lowe's. I sold them into kitchen and bath stores, and ultimately I ended up working on the weekends, basically at a home depot for over 2 months

505
01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:19.839
Bob Moesta: to get all that data, because I could see, like one of the biggest problems for them was how they quoted a countertop, and we made it 10 times easier to actually quote the countertop which made our sales go from 500,000 to 20 million in 18 months.

506
01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:26.919
Bob Moesta: and it wasn't about we had a better product. It was just. We made it easier for the people who were managing the process to make it easier for them.

507
01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:41.610
Bob Moesta: Yeah. So my thing is, is you selling cars? You going to a dealer or go to use car dealer, and and literally use your tool and let everybody see how you're doing with it. But you're using it to get more stories, so you can tell people how it works.

508
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:43.150
Vivian: Right.

509
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:49.959
Bob Moesta: And and again, you don't have to do it for 2 months, but I would say, do it for for a while. Is there a licensing thing you have to do to sell cars.

510
01:04:50.385 --> 01:04:58.159
Vivian: Yes, there is. But I went in for 10 days, and I was the concierge person I can park for, and I made everybody go through the platform before I hand it off to the salesperson.

511
01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:58.900
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

512
01:04:58.900 --> 01:04:59.650
Vivian: Yeah.

513
01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:14.869
Vivian: but that's that's so. Everything you said like that makes sense. I I think one of the the challenges right now is making sure that we show the right vehicles, not from our perspective, but from the dealerships and their profitability perspective. So that actually means that we need to stick even closer to the managers.

514
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:15.300
Bob Moesta: Oh, yeah.

515
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.449
Vivian: And review. If it makes sense.

516
01:05:18.529 --> 01:05:23.279
Bob Moesta: So this is where I would, I would tell you so. I I have a different approach.

517
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.149
Bob Moesta: I really don't give a shit about the dealers

518
01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:32.720
Bob Moesta: I want to find and get the customers to have the best car they can, and if it's not at that dealer I'm going to move them to another dealer.

519
01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:42.390
Bob Moesta: Because if I make this just a dealer tool, I'm stuck with the most limited inventory, and people want to find the best car, and they don't know what the brands are at all.

520
01:05:43.350 --> 01:06:02.560
Bob Moesta: Right. Most people don't know what a difference between a Buick and a Chevy and a Toyota, and like they just know I want that car. And so part of this is. And so you see the knowledge of cars going down. And so my thing is is the more like the the bigger dealers you can have where they have a diversity of inventory will be way. Better

521
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:07.190
Bob Moesta: acceptance than just trying to sell for for a chevy dealer.

522
01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.770
Vivian: Yeah, absolutely.

523
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:21.400
Bob Moesta: And so and so my thing is is I we're choosing to to pivot or to focus on the customer and helping the customer do it, because if we help the customer the dealers will come, but if I help the dealer, the customers don't necessarily come.

524
01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:24.059
Bob Moesta: Does that make sense.

525
01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.100
Vivian: Yeah.

526
01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:38.810
Bob Moesta: It's a little bit different approach. But that's we. We kind of looked at both ways, and and we felt it's ultimately, if we can actually become the thing to help people make decisions around cars. We can go to boats, and we can go to all these other places to help people do that

527
01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:51.319
Bob Moesta: right? So it's but but knowing how to ask the discussion, how to how to ask those questions and how to actually connect the trick really is connecting the vehicle data to the outcomes they want.

528
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.640
Vivian: Yeah.

529
01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.930
Bob Moesta: Right? Yeah. So that's.

530
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I hope I can keep you all connected, Bob, if you're.

531
01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:00.289
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

532
01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:07.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think like for me, I you know you know me. I started at the 1st coding school, so naturally I like had to work with all of my.

533
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:08.529
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

534
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:14.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Competitors, and we had to help each other. So for me, it feels like a very playful and like opportunistic.

535
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:15.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I connection, that's right.

536
01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:16.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

537
01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:32.820
Bob Moesta: And I think we're taking some somewhat little bit different approaches, though we both see the problem kind of the same way. And and again. It might be about lining to dealers, but I live in Detroit. I grew up in the automotive business, and I hate the business. I'm actually doing this to destroy the business

538
01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:58.460
Bob Moesta: cause. I think dealers, basically, dealers are not actually adding the value they should be adding, and they're actually causing more friction in the system out of anything, and people would much rather buy a car with a lot a lot less of all these systems that they have. And ultimately, there's it's very hard to do so. And so I want to try to free the consumer to actually buy the car they want as opposed to them, finding the car that they'll settle for.

539
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:30.110
Jake Gutstein: in in the world of May today, Bob, there's something that you had said that given if they're gonna exist in the dealer space. I wanted to pull out and see what you meant by our salespeople, leaving understanding what the journey towards somebody leaving in, and what that process of onboarding looks like, which sounds like you guys have spent a bit of time understanding. But just from job moves, I could assume that when a dealer, or when a salesperson leaves a dealership, they've probably been thinking about it for 6 to 12 months.

540
01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:44.440
Jake Gutstein: maybe even without realizing it. And so trying to intercede in the moments when they're like this job sucks so bad that I could leave it before they realize that they're even thinking about leaving it. And that could come from interviews, from people who have recently switched dealerships.

541
01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:47.760
Bob Moesta: Yep, that that would be useful.

542
01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.410
Vivian: Yeah.

543
01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:53.690
Bob Moesta: I I think the other thing is, I like, I like the fact that you're focusing on the dealers because I think

544
01:08:54.231 --> 01:09:06.779
Bob Moesta: but like you said you, you're gonna start serving up the cars that are make the most money for the dealer, and I want to try to figure out how to serve up the cars that best fit the customer and and understand the trade-offs they have to make to get it.

545
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:08.329
Bob Moesta: It's true.

546
01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:20.910
Vivian: Product is what's right for the customer. And we're and like, for, as you would expect, they're wondering how they can sell one vehicle over the other, because they're they're paying too much on interest for it. So.

547
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:33.620
Bob Moesta: And and ultimately the interesting part is, the customer wants to make trade-offs, but they don't get to make them. The dealer just tells them what they have to. They say you can do this one, or you can do that one. And it's like it's not giving them the trade offs that they want.

548
01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:51.050
Bob Moesta: So it's a great, it's it's it's a very big market. There's a lot of cars being so. There's over 50 million cars transacted. I think this is also very big in the used market, where, like, I can buy a like a brand new honda civic, or I can buy A. A.

549
01:09:51.149 --> 01:10:06.240
Bob Moesta: You know, a 3 year old. Bmw. 3 series, right? And most people don't compare the 2 because they don't know how to. And ultimately that's the thing that they're they're trying to figure out is like, Do I want a new car, or am I willing to have a an older car with a few miles, but it's actually a much better car.

550
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.769
Vivian: Yes, that's right.

551
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.649
Bob Moesta: So you're on the right track.

552
01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:13.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I will, I will make sure you all connected after this.

553
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.589
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yep, good alright. So.

554
01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:17.049
Vivian: The money.

555
01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:17.920
Bob Moesta: Please. Thank you.

556
01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.430
Bob Moesta: Thank you.

557
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:33.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Legalize. You're up. And then just just see, I know I'll post the the remaining pecking order, and I'm gonna aggressively manage the time from here on out, because we're gonna have about 8 min per company. And hopefully it it. What's the appetite? And I'm gonna be fairly aggressive, and I'll call out 1 min warnings, okay.

558
01:10:33.190 --> 01:10:36.779
Bob Moesta: Got it legally. Hey, Chris? Hey, Mark!

559
01:10:36.780 --> 01:11:04.960
Chris Wong: Bob. Nice to meet you, Jake. Good to see you, too. Yeah, Bob, I was actually watching your Lenny's Newsletter video last night at one am. So it was cool background you have there same one, anyway. I'll go into it. So my name is Chris co-founder and CEO of legalese. We're saving law firms time by streamlining their billing process. And we're doing that by building AI powered legal time tracker and invoice generator that tracks what they do on their computer.

560
01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:22.750
Chris Wong: And then it helps generate narratives for their invoices. We just we're building a prototype right now. We have about 2 early commits for customers so really starting, just starting out the race here. I was a startup lawyer before at Cooley big law firm. And so that's kind of like this culmination of like the pain point.

561
01:11:23.261 --> 01:11:45.488
Chris Wong: So for us, our learning questions one of them is, you know, is time tracking, invoicing, or both kind of the pain points for small solo and small law firms. That's kind of where we're targeting our our initial like customer base, which is solo small law firms, startup lawyers and then also fractional. Gcs, so that's 1. The other one is

562
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:57.489
Chris Wong: How do we penetrate solo law firms and move up to bigger firms over over at each step. Because we right now experience pain with starting out with kind of the bigger law firms of trying to like, penetrate their 1st

563
01:11:57.767 --> 01:12:05.279
Chris Wong: and then you know it kind of along the same lines of like what the right pain point is is like, what's the number of features that we should be able to.

564
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:05.700
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

565
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.960
Chris Wong: Complete product for these small firms. Yeah.

566
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:22.670
Bob Moesta: Yeah, that's that's that's a tough one, like it's almost like, like you wanna add a bunch of features. But like they're just happy to have like 5 of the 20 features, and they're willing to pay the same amount for 5 features or 20 features. How do we actually figure out the the minimum that actually makes it all work.

567
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:24.139
Chris Wong: That's right.

568
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:31.989
Bob Moesta: So. So this is a tough. Again, I I have relative things. So I'm sorry. But I just this is a tough one to me, because

569
01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:35.610
Bob Moesta: all of this is overhead.

570
01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:52.959
Bob Moesta: Right? And so part of this is is they wanna like to get a 10 x like they're willing to invest in overhead as long as they can actually make sure that they have a significant amount of savings. And what I mean by that is like a a 40, 50, 70, 90% savings and cost.

571
01:12:53.100 --> 01:13:11.085
Bob Moesta: And so building. The case is very, very difficult, because think of it as like. Think about the last time, and a law firm actually changed its. It's accounting system or changed its. It's document management system like they don't really want to do any of that ever.

572
01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.100
Chris Wong: Right. It is a painful process.

573
01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:29.280
Bob Moesta: It's a painful process. Nobody wants to do it, and yet people still do it every day. And so part of it is getting into understand. So so this is where, for example, I I would go into the smaller firms and actually understand the smaller firms who actually bought finally bought a system

574
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:44.180
Bob Moesta: they went from using. Excel or Google sheets or like, my belief is your biggest competitors, Google sheets and and Google Google Docs, right? And so ultimately is. When is it to the point where they want to, you know, basically have a formalized system.

575
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:49.380
Bob Moesta: And it might be that they want to cut overhead. It might be that they just want to actually look more professional.

576
01:13:50.180 --> 01:14:05.790
Bob Moesta: Right. And so part of this is actually so. This is, this is the interesting part is when when people you know like you start to realize like they? When do people get a real headshot? It's like when they have when they started their business, and they finally realize, like, I can't use a photo from a wedding

577
01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:18.100
Bob Moesta: right? And so it's that kind of notion of like, how do we actually understand the moments where people really run into enough problems. And typically so I did. I did something similar with Ryan Singer from Base camp where we

578
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:46.869
Bob Moesta: we looked at this notion of helping people do invoicing like. When do people decide that they can't invoice from word or excel, or sheets or docs like? That's almost how everybody's initial invoicing system works. And then what happens is you start to realize they end up having some problems like an invoice gets lost. And then they got to figure out where it was, and it's not connected to the payables, and there's no, there's no running cash flow kind of. So it's not connected to the system, and eventually they don't buy an invoicing

579
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:52.610
Bob Moesta: solution. They buy a new accounting, they buy quickbooks and quickbooks, has it in it.

580
01:14:52.640 --> 01:15:05.779
Bob Moesta: and so part of it is to realize is like, will they actually switch out the time tracking system? Or is the time tracking system part of some bigger system they have? And that's where the threshold of my belief is, there's like

581
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:25.020
Bob Moesta: like like, there's sap. And and you know the big Erp people. My belief is in the law firm business. There are people who have the integrated system for the big law firm. And ultimately, how do you actually figure out the right way to that? It's the people who are too small for the big systems.

582
01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:38.190
Bob Moesta: but big enough to basically figure out kind of like what like, they need some new system of some sort right? And so it goes back to. Are they buying piecemeal solutions, or are they buying kind of combined solutions to kind of get them to that next level?

583
01:15:39.280 --> 01:16:00.750
Chris Wong: Yeah, and through our jobs to be done. So far, we've realized that the pain point occurs when they either increase from 2 to 3 clients and going upwards, or it's they're spending 2 to 3 h every month on an invoice. And they realize that's when they position out of word. And so that's kind of like the thing that we've started to discover. And there are other tools outside of quickbooks like Zoho, fresh.

584
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:01.700
Bob Moesta: Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

585
01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:08.399
Chris Wong: That also do this same kind of solution that they use these general solutions just to fit their kind of bill in order to get that.

586
01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:13.090
Bob Moesta: Sharepoint. They'll build a sharepoint site. They'll do like all these crazy, crazy things. Yep.

587
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:30.039
Chris Wong: Yeah, but all that kind of re like resonates to kind of what you mentioned and so we're really like one of the things that we're trying to solve for is like, when's the right time to reach out to them when they fix when they face these problems and like, when's the right time to kind of like find these? And this is mainly within the solo fractional Gcs, and like.

588
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:30.710
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

589
01:16:31.345 --> 01:16:42.070
Chris Wong: But when you get up to like the smaller ones what we, what we have found is that they are looking for something a little bit more, where the time timekeeping becomes more of a pain point than the invoicing actually.

590
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.680
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

591
01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.649
Chris Wong: Need to be able to track their work. Yeah.

592
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:46.580
Bob Moesta: They want to do both. It's kind of like I can give you

593
01:16:46.900 --> 01:17:12.180
Bob Moesta: email system. But if I don't give you a new calendar system. It's like it doesn't work, because all my, all my calendar invites come via email. And if the 2 are connected like that's really hard to manage. And so you start to realize, like, you can't build an email service without a without a calendar service. Right? And so that's what we really have to be able to look at is what what are the combined services? And and ultimately, what's what's so? The way I would describe it? What's the half step that they have to take

594
01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:41.499
Bob Moesta: to to show progress that they're getting there. But they're not buying the big system yet, so like as a company I helped back in the early 2,01020, 11 called intercom. And and their whole thing was is that they they really end up building a product. That kind of did a lot of a lot of little things well, but didn't do them like spectacularly. But they competed against Hubspot and Zendesk and all these big competitors. But the reality is, was like the the firms were never big enough

595
01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:59.560
Bob Moesta: to like be able to afford Hubspot or Zendesk, and so what would happen is they'd go there and say, All right, we're gonna make it easy for you to transition. So it's all these startups that basically don't have quite enough money, but need these systems, and they buy it. And then what happens is they get so adopted to the system that they never transition to anybody else's system.

596
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:01.050
Chris Wong: Right.

597
01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:10.969
Bob Moesta: And so and so the aspect here is is now they're they're they're they're almost 15 years old, and they've got they. They got a valuation about 3.5 billion.

598
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:12.400
Chris Wong: Yeah.

599
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:23.580
Bob Moesta: Right, and and at some point in time Zendesk and Hubspot never saw them as a competitor ever, because they always looked at them and said, like, you know, these are just small time guys. And now they're almost as big as they are.

600
01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:32.820
Chris Wong: Yeah, yeah, I like how you said, it's like the half step like, what do we need to accomplish within that? Get them and then get the clients that you have, have them sticky, and build.

601
01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:49.359
Bob Moesta: I I think you're a nightmare, for you would be getting a big client who wants to custom, make their own system. And then all of a sudden, like, you're stuck trying to build this really high end system. And you're really actually building a low end system. For basically, you know, people who are in between right and they

602
01:18:50.020 --> 01:19:13.960
Bob Moesta: and and a lot of lawyers. They they end up going to a big firm, but almost all of them in their in their older age, all end up in a smaller, sole proprietorship unless they're a partner. And so you end up realizing like there's a lot of. There's a lot of these people who are lawyers. They're good lawyers, but they don't know technology. They don't know the system. And if you can actually help them kind of start their own practice and have the right practice around it. You'll you'll win for sure.

603
01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:14.420
Chris Wong: Cool.

604
01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:15.520
Chris Wong: Got it? Okay.

605
01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:18.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right, gents, we we've hit our time hopefully.

606
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:19.649
Bob Moesta: I went to.

607
01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:20.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That was great, that was great.

608
01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:21.840
Mark Wong: Thank you. Bob.

609
01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright, optifab! Let's do it.

610
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:31.240
Paria: Yes, Hi, Bobby, nice to meet you. I'm paria from. Thank you. I'm paria from Optifab. I'm city of Optifab.

611
01:19:31.591 --> 01:19:57.979
Paria: So Esmael, who is our CEO is currently in the like going to attend to a exhibition or trade show tomorrow, so he's not able to attend today. So but I'll be here and we'll talk about optifab and J. 2 Pd, that we have so far. So basically, at optifab, you know, optipub enables part manufacturers avoid a costing mistake by giving them the confidence to get it right at the 1st time.

612
01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:07.039
Paria: So we have spoken with over 50 companies around and currently launching almost 3 pilots.

613
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:35.010
Paria: So our learning question here is like, even with the like, the tools that they are already using. Where do experienced manufacturers are still struggling with the like, reducing failures, delays, and the extra cost that they are facing in the manufacturing cycles. So screening criteria for us is like we are focusing on the manufacturers from different sectors, aerospace like energy automotive. And anymore that we have.

614
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:55.910
Paria: And we are working who, I mean the manufacturers that they are trying to use the tools like simulation tools, or like incision, monitoring tools, or like the design of experiment tools, etc. So the number of interviews that we did, as I said, like we talked more than like 50 companies around. We participated.

615
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:57.840
Bob Moesta: How big and small were these companies?

616
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.870
Paria: I'm sorry.

617
01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:00.910
Bob Moesta: How big or small were these companies?

618
01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.949
Paria: So the class you can.

619
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:06.079
Bob Moesta: Tool and die shops are these small tool and die shops? Are they.

620
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:32.219
Paria: It's not just like that, you know. 1st of all, our entry point to the market is like 3D printers, or like id manufacturing companies, you know. So, and the best customer for us is the Oems, who are like kind of building the main 3D printing machines right? If we can integrate our software to their machines. That's the best way that we can capture the market for us.

621
01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:36.780
Bob Moesta: But it's very tricky for us, because they don't want, you know, they're like

622
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.960
Bob Moesta: they don't want 3rd party in. They want to control all of that.

623
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:53.060
Paria: Exactly. That's the big problem there. So, but from the like, the interviews or jobs that we kind of implemented so far, we got this pattern that the tool that we are developing is somehow is really needed.

624
01:21:53.060 --> 01:22:12.449
Paria: But it's really hard to kind of acquire appropriate trust from the like different manufacturers that they can at least get a trial for the from the software that we are developing and also giving to give us some feedback how we can further develop the like different features that we have in the software.

625
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:14.880
Paria: So yeah, the.

626
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:24.470
Bob Moesta: What's the what's the main? Sorry I don't want to interrupt, but we we give limited time. What's the main struggling moment that they have that kind of cue them to go like we gotta do something different.

627
01:22:26.054 --> 01:22:30.529
Paria: The production speed as well as the amount of base that they have.

628
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:59.299
Paria: So the waste of the metal, like the waste of the manufacturing is quite high, and the speed of the production is not the things that you are expecting. Imagine they want to like manufacture a part. It takes almost 15 days, and in the like, in the middle of like day 10, they see that the part is failed, so they have to again rerun the whole process to make it right? Right? So this is something that they struggle with, that they are looking for a solution that they can fix it.

629
01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:03.060
Paria: And so that's that's the biggest struggle which we have.

630
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:05.749
Bob Moesta: How much of the problem is is.

631
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:11.070
Bob Moesta: So I grew up in the space. So I know the space very, very well.

632
01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:19.300
Bob Moesta: Nice, and like my experiences is when I when I'm a design engineer and I bring my product

633
01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:24.020
Bob Moesta: to the, to the manufacturing people. All they do is complain about my design.

634
01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:51.229
Bob Moesta: and then, when when the design doesn't work, the fact is, I blame the manufacturer, and and when the design doesn't work, the manufacturer blames the designer. And so you end up with these things where people point at each other. And they're like, Yeah, it's not my problem. I did what I supposed to do right. And so how? How do you kind of overcome that? Because at some point at least, my experience in this in this realm is, there's a lot of talk. There's a lot of finger pointing, and there's very little action.

635
01:23:51.970 --> 01:24:18.140
Paria: That's a very good point. And actually, this is something that we we always seen this type of experience from the like in the manufacturing field. Right? So what we are addressing with this product that we are developing, we are covering the whole workflow from the design, manufacturing and the post manufacturing which is happening. So the solution that we coming here is saying that no matter what type of design you have.

636
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:43.790
Paria: So we are saying, we're gonna say to you how you have to kind of what type of like processing condition you have to apply during your manufacturing system that you don't. Your your part will not fail, and you don't need to go for the like later for the post manufacturing, which is costly for you. We are trying to cut the post manufacturer manufacturing processes, as well as the concerns that which may arise during the design. So.

637
01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.140
Bob Moesta: So so

638
01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:53.520
Bob Moesta: most most of them do this like they. They've been living through this for years like this is not like this is not a new problem for them. This is something they've been doing.

639
01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:58.029
Bob Moesta: as far as I can say, almost 40 years like this is not, and they usually have.

640
01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:05.609
Bob Moesta: you know. Sorry I'm gonna say it the wrong way, but like a guy or a person who like they're they're the ones who kind of come in and save the day.

641
01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:09.189
Bob Moesta: Right? So you're really competing against the expert.

642
01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:35.269
Paria: Yes, we are. I mean, you know. What about what we are hearing right now? I was like it was a couple of days ago I was talking to one of the oems and saying that, yeah, we are doing this. And we just want to, you know, get your feedback. Try this software in your systems and get us feedback. Give us feedback feedback. So then, but the question, the main question from their side was, so we do have a very big software companies in the like design side.

643
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.810
Bob Moesta: Good.

644
01:25:35.810 --> 01:26:01.640
Paria: I'm not making this. Why, you think that you can make, and they can't make so. And we had an answer for that question. So we know what we are doing, because we know that, like the expertise of like metallurgy, metallurgical background, is coming to the play here, adding, like new features, making a competence in the production. But the competitors that we have there, so it makes us a little like hard for us to proceed. I mean.

645
01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.060
Bob Moesta: So this is where.

646
01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:28.512
Bob Moesta: like how to say, some industries like don't like to buy piecemeal solutions right? Because at some point one of the things that happens to them. When when their system doesn't work right, they blame one software company, another company blames the other software company and they still don't know how it works. And so the the phrase that has come up is that they want one throat to choke

647
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:51.590
Bob Moesta: right when they have a problem. And so when there's 2 of you, the reality is, they don't know who to choke. They don't know who to go for the problem solving. They don't know what else is gonna happen. And so part of it is as much as you offer an opportunity to them. You offer a lot of risk to them. Because now the data is going outside the system, it's going somewhere else. It's going into somebody. Think like what other problems can happen. Because we're adding this software layer on top of it.

648
01:26:51.780 --> 01:27:00.790
Bob Moesta: So my my thing would be is is the only people who would be really willing to buy. This is when the software they have is not that good?

649
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:12.529
Bob Moesta: They they can't afford to buy an upgrade to the next system. And ultimately they want to be able to actually kind of fix this problem, but they don't trust the current vendor to actually do any of it.

650
01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:14.230
Paria: Yeah.

651
01:27:14.230 --> 01:27:14.660
Bob Moesta: Right.

652
01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.210
Paria: It's much better.

653
01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:31.809
Bob Moesta: And that, and that's where that's where you can fit into that that niche. And then ultimately, my belief is you can start to add more and more features to get bigger and bigger and bigger. But the fact is, is, you you've got to be able to almost like think about the other thing I would think about is a network of

654
01:27:31.810 --> 01:27:45.420
Bob Moesta: consultants that actually can utilize your software and can license it from you and go plug it in and use. So almost like software and consultants or a service network behind it will actually probably help you as well.

655
01:27:46.250 --> 01:28:07.910
Paria: That's a great point. Yeah, that's a very point. Yeah, I think that's a i mean, we know that we have competitors. And we know that we're there stages. But and we know what is our value proposition here in our product. But our approach is like trying to kind of as I said, like we have 3 pilots right.

656
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:08.309
Bob Moesta: There we go!

657
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:22.959
Paria: Approach them. They are mainly from the Academia side universities, 2 from Germany and one from Canada here. And then we are just trying to develop cases just to showcase the capabilities of the software here, and to do the marketing by this way.

658
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:26.930
Bob Moesta: Yeah, are they paying for the pilots, or are they free pilots?

659
01:28:27.325 --> 01:28:39.570
Bob Moesta: I mean, I wouldn't say like they're free because they are kind of manufacturing the parts and sharing the data through the manufacturing with us. But we don't charge them.

660
01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:41.720
Bob Moesta: So this is this is a free trial for them.

661
01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.230
Paria: It's a kind of free trial, but the we don't pay.

662
01:28:44.230 --> 01:29:04.040
Bob Moesta: But you need it. I I'm not. I'm not like you heard my diatribe on free, but I think sometimes you have to do free to get the to get the stories. But the fact is, is, it's really hard to get people committed when they're not paying. And so my belief is as you try to build these case studies like here. I'll tell you my experience when I offered what I do for free

663
01:29:04.941 --> 01:29:08.469
Bob Moesta: so I could get a case study. I never got a case study

664
01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:21.689
Bob Moesta: when I offered. Basically here, it's a hundred $1,000 full price. I'm gonna give you a discount to 25,000 and a case study. So if you don't want to do the case, study, you owe me 75,000, then I can get it done

665
01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:30.550
Bob Moesta: right, because without them paying something they don't, it's hard for them to value. And so all of a sudden, when other priorities come up, you get pushed to the side.

666
01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:34.090
Bob Moesta: Something to think about.

667
01:29:34.090 --> 01:29:37.850
Paria: Yeah, thank you so much, Bob, for sharing your chats with me. Thank you.

668
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:38.650
Bob Moesta: Yep, thanks.

669
01:29:38.650 --> 01:29:40.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right. Let's go.

670
01:29:40.690 --> 01:29:41.020
Anthony De Silva: Hey, guys.

671
01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.180
Bob Moesta: How are you?

672
01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.799
Anthony De Silva: Hey? Doing? Well, very nice to meet you.

673
01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:45.859
Bob Moesta: Nice to meet you.

674
01:29:45.860 --> 01:30:03.099
Anthony De Silva: Thanks for your time. I'm the founder of. Really we are a company that's consolidating home inspections and appraisals into a single process. We provide home inspections. We collect 400 plus data points on a property. And then we leverage that data for appraisals.

675
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:14.309
Anthony De Silva: We eliminate the need for on-site appraisers so that we can help speed the process of closing. And we're able to close on transactions up to 3 weeks sooner.

676
01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:43.190
Anthony De Silva: that's the idea. So we we wanted to. We. We wanted to find out the struggling PIN points of realtors when we went went to speak with them. Our hypothesis was that, you know, speed would be valuable to realtors in these transactions, but the the key themes that we found out were inconsistencies in home inspections like lack of standardization.

677
01:30:43.190 --> 01:30:54.389
Bob Moesta: There's no standardized. There's no standards around the home inspection. There's no, it's a it's a very cottagey industry. There's no big companies usually in it. There's a lot of little companies, because it's a very low barriers to entry.

678
01:30:54.650 --> 01:31:01.417
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And just like 2 2 reports, all for the same property would be would be completely different. And

679
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:29.520
Anthony De Silva: then, also, like we we. So we also spoke to buyers. In addition to realtors, our criteria was to go speak with people who had used our services or were a key decision maker. So buyers on the buyers, and they also brought up like a consistency. But the lack of next steps. One comment was that, hey? If I go to a mechanic they will tell me what's wrong with it, but also like they'll give me a cost to and tell me like this is. This is how much it's gonna cost.

680
01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.910
Bob Moesta: Yep. Yep.

681
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:39.900
Anthony De Silva: So that was missing and then on the realtor side, the like, the lack of communication updates. If if they don't attend or like the progress.

682
01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.160
Bob Moesta: And and the home inspector is like

683
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:56.690
Bob Moesta: like the the appraisal people are by the mortgage people. So the appraisal side is actually not even through the network of that of the of the of the of the appraisers. But, like, I can see how the data coming together is going to be useful, but it's like.

684
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:59.720
Bob Moesta: can you? Can you? Can you?

685
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:25.249
Bob Moesta: Can. You talk to the appraisers and understand what they struggle with and what and how you might be able to help them with a different data set, because my my belief is again, most most appraisers are very old school as well. I I've just had my house appraised, because I'm doing some construction, and it's like, you know, the guy had a had a camera from the nineties in it, you know it didn't even use his phone. He goes. It's just much easier to do it this way. I'm like, Oh, my God! Like it's just.

686
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:32.800
Bob Moesta: But I like I. I feel like the appraisers and the and the inspector. The home inspectors are like, though they're

687
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:36.800
Bob Moesta: they're both part of the process. They're very disconnected. People.

688
01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:53.030
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, yeah, it is. And our our process to completely cut out. Cut out the appraiser. So we want to collect data for the appraisal during the home inspection. Like, there is like specific guidelines from Fannie Mae that yep, that that.

689
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:57.910
Bob Moesta: So I. So I built homes from 2,004 to 2,008. So.

690
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:58.920
Anthony De Silva: You've done everything.

691
01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:03.230
Bob Moesta: Yeah. Well, Hi, it's crazy like this is why I'm like, Neil. Did you pick this on my portfolio, or what?

692
01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's what I'm doing.

693
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:12.254
Bob Moesta: But but the reality is is as you as you start to look at that business. The fact is, is like, I I think there's actually

694
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:27.510
Bob Moesta: there, there's a there's a there's actually I I would try to make the case that buyers would love to be able to understand. Like, if I'm buying this property, I want you to do basically 2 things. Tell me what? Tell me what's wrong with it.

695
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:32.960
Bob Moesta: Tell me what I need to do to to fix it. So you help me with as a negotiating tool.

696
01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:52.650
Bob Moesta: and then talk about like, if I want a new kitchen, or I want to do this, help me appraise what all those things are, so I can see what my total package is going into it as opposed to like. All right. We'll buy the house, and then we'll just fix it up along the way. The other part is is to actually connect yourself with home warranty, because I think that'll help people buy home warranties more.

697
01:33:52.880 --> 01:34:01.980
Bob Moesta: and so think of it as being the buy. The buyer's agent on the technical side of the sale where the real estate agent is kind of like the person who's gonna help you shop.

698
01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:06.590
Bob Moesta: But they're not the. They're not the software engineer telling you how it works right?

699
01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:30.260
Bob Moesta: And so can you actually kind of think about partnering with with realtors. But to add this service as a way in which to kind of get the get the real data. They need to make a better decision because most of the time people are making offers before they know anything about the house. So if you can actually have a have a way to get an appraisal for a home inspection to the to that house

700
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:40.050
Bob Moesta: without having to send an expect like, or to at least then connect it to the appraiser. Say like, how much can I get a loan for like that will help them all make those decisions.

701
01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:44.710
Anthony De Silva: So so you're saying like, pre listing like inspections and and.

702
01:34:44.710 --> 01:35:14.380
Bob Moesta: Or or or basically make deal. So the way that I would think about it is, can I actually give the realtor a commission? For basically, if they if they hire me for I don't know, I'm making it up. $500 to offer up basically a thorough report on that house. What is it worth? Based on kind of the appraisal business? And then what are the improvements they need to make? So when I go in, I'm like, yeah, I need 20,000 off this. And I need 3,000 off that. And here's what we're going to do. And here's the price like, give them the

703
01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:27.419
Bob Moesta: fuel they need to actually manage the negotiations of it as opposed to trying to like, you know? I think trying to cut the appraiser out is like the appraiser, is more connected to the mortgage than the real estate deal.

704
01:35:28.770 --> 01:35:43.779
Anthony De Silva: Yes. So the value that we provide to the lender is that appraisal waiver. So like we, we send some of this data back to Fannie Mae directly like when we inspect, and if the property is in good condition, then they give you an appraisal, waiver so like the.

705
01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.339
Bob Moesta: So you can get an appraisal. Waiver.

706
01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:46.290
Anthony De Silva: Yep. Yep.

707
01:35:46.290 --> 01:35:51.780
Bob Moesta: The real question is is, but but if they're getting a mortgage they still need appraisal to know what they can. So like. I have

708
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:58.080
Bob Moesta: somebody in my office who just bought a house, and they're worried that the house won't appraise for what they what they want to be able to get a mortgage for

709
01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:14.129
Bob Moesta: right. And so, all of a sudden, it's like, Well, do I buy this house or not? Because I don't want to go into contract, and then I can't get a mortgage for it. So do I like. Where do I sit in terms of what is it really worth? Because I know how much mortgage I can get, but I don't know how much it's going to appraise for to know if I actually have to come up with more money or not.

710
01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:32.706
Anthony De Silva: Right? Right? So at least like the product that we have now it's for, like Fannie Mae, already like, has an idea of like what the range value should be. So if it is within that range, they they're like they look at. Look at the property condition like data that we provide, and they give you an appraisal. Waiver

711
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:37.040
Bob Moesta: And how much is appraiser? How much is appraiser cost in the in the closing docs.

712
01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:41.789
Anthony De Silva: 5, 500 to 600 versus our like waiver is 2 50.

713
01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:42.970
Anthony De Silva: So.

714
01:36:42.970 --> 01:37:04.849
Bob Moesta: So this is where you'd say, like, like we, we can get a. So the value proposition is, we can waive the appraisal basically because we're gonna do such a good inspection. And we're gonna connect it with Fannie Mae, that we're not only going to provide you the appraisal which you need for the closer we'll get you the waiver. But we're gonna give you a plan of what needs to be fixed and how it needs to be fixed, and how much it's gonna cost.

715
01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:22.129
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, yeah, that's the idea that the struggling piece of that is like connecting all of these. All of these, like the realtor, had like has to talk to the lender. The lender has to like, educate the buyer, like all of that is like, is the tough piece that we're kind of struggling with.

716
01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:32.159
Bob Moesta: You've got to figure out. Where's the lead on that right is the realtor. The lead is the is, the is, the is the appraiser. The lead is the mortgage company, the lead? Who's the lead? That will actually kind of

717
01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:36.289
Bob Moesta: make that? Have you had? Have you been able to get any sales at this point or no.

718
01:37:36.882 --> 01:37:46.869
Anthony De Silva: Yeah one. So we've did. We've done one combined because we like got the Fannie Mae approval like only recently. But like we've done home inspections quite a bit.

719
01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:55.729
Bob Moesta: Okay? And you've been able to. And are you throwing this all into an AI? Is that what you're how you're kind of throwing, consolidating this data set or not.

720
01:37:56.024 --> 01:38:03.675
Anthony De Silva: No, there's like specific Fannie mae guidelines on like data to collect. And there's an app that we use to like. Collect that data.

721
01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:09.459
Bob Moesta: How how much does that data really relate to the customer versus the bank.

722
01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:11.300
Anthony De Silva: It's.

723
01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:14.499
Bob Moesta: I mean, like, does it have power like there's there's there's like a whole bunch of.

724
01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:23.209
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, it's yeah. There's a lot of like detailed information about the property like, is there anything obstructing the view of the property like things like that, that

725
01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:29.150
Anthony De Silva: it impact the value. There's no like opinion of value. There's like no value assigned to.

726
01:38:29.150 --> 01:38:32.599
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the property when we submit it. But it really.

727
01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:37.430
Don Kuruppu: Real quick real quick. That hey, Bob, my name is John. I'm also another co-founder.

728
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.959
Bob Moesta: Hey! How are you?

729
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:43.260
Don Kuruppu: Yeah. In this report. There's there's also no property condition data. It's all visual. It's all a bunch of photos.

730
01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:51.540
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's not. It's not anything about the entire inside. And any of its it's is there inside stuff that has you have to go into? Go into the house.

731
01:38:52.210 --> 01:38:54.603
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, there's pictures of the pictures of the rooms

732
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:55.330
Don Kuruppu: There it is!

733
01:38:55.330 --> 01:38:56.850
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, interior and exterior pictures.

734
01:38:56.850 --> 01:39:05.030
Bob Moesta: So the the real estate can provide you. The agent can provide you the pictures. And is that enough for you to actually be able to write your home inspection.

735
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:20.129
Anthony De Silva: Not quite, because there's like we also need to like, scan the floor like, calculate the gross living area things like that, so that that I don't think like a regular realtor can do it unless, like people, the technology to do it eventually.

736
01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:23.690
Bob Moesta: So this is. This is again where I would say is like, I think the

737
01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:52.250
Bob Moesta: building. The product is the easy part of all of this right cracking the go to market strategy and figuring out who's the person that's going to be the influencer to help you along the way? And do you go to the realtors? Do you go to mortgage people? Do you go to direct to people looking right? How how do you find these people. How do you market to them? I think that, like all of them, are potentials. I just don't know how the economics work around any of them right.

738
01:39:53.530 --> 01:40:06.270
Bob Moesta: And so part of is, you have to start to think about that model. Like again, I think I think the the data integration is valuable, but because the structure of the industry is so kind of modularized that that

739
01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:16.679
Bob Moesta: no, it's almost like it doesn't feel like nobody. Nobody really needs everybody. Let's see, everybody needs each other to a certain extent, but they don't actually respect each other in any way.

740
01:40:18.210 --> 01:40:42.520
Bob Moesta: Do you know what I mean? Like the realtor doesn't respect the mortgage person. The mortgage person doesn't respect the the realtor or the inspector. You know. There's like all these people who are involved, but they're like they all think they're they. My experience is, they all think they're better than each other. And so the fact is, there's no reason for them to collaborate besides the house, and just trying to get the house closed. So the notion of Hey, let me give you data to make your your job easier.

741
01:40:42.900 --> 01:41:02.860
Bob Moesta: That's just not how they think right. And so I really, you have to think hard about, how do you go to market with this like I, again, I think getting the data figure out how to actually do something with the data is is important. But I think the reality is like who is going to value the data that's like, I know, I think the buyer is going to value it the most.

742
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.850
Bob Moesta: Right? Yeah.

743
01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:11.590
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, that's what we realized. Buyer like the lender and buyer. Yes, and then, like realtor, like, they just want to get the deal done. They don't, they don't. That's right.

744
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:16.699
Bob Moesta: Right. So to me and the lender. The lender has certain just real

745
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:23.370
Bob Moesta: like, they only need certain amounts to get to the appraiser right through the appraisal. And so the reality is like at some point.

746
01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:48.479
Bob Moesta: like again, I would actually start to think about, how do you go? How do you figure out how to go direct to consumer in terms of like trying to buy a house, but need, you know, want a 3rd part? Want an independent view of kind of what's going on in an appraisal. We can do that for you. And so it's like having somebody in your court right? My belief is, most people don't feel like the realtors in their court, the realtors there to navigate the game

747
01:41:48.650 --> 01:41:49.500
Bob Moesta: right?

748
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:55.319
Bob Moesta: And so it's a very different thing of like, who's gonna really help me with the data I need. So I can make this decision.

749
01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.330
Anthony De Silva: Oh!

750
01:41:56.850 --> 01:41:57.699
Bob Moesta: That's how I.

751
01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:00.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I love the empathy there, let's do it.

752
01:42:00.730 --> 01:42:01.389
Bob Moesta: All right.

753
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:02.629
Anthony De Silva: Thank you, Bob. Thanks. Aman.

754
01:42:02.970 --> 01:42:05.100
Bob Moesta: You alright. We got sales play.

755
01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:05.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's go, Meg.

756
01:42:05.730 --> 01:42:06.510
Bob Moesta: Hey? Meg!

757
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:12.419
Meg Hall: Hi, how are you doing? Is you? I feel like you've been doing some mental gymnastics, trying to understand everybody's businesses.

758
01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:26.299
Bob Moesta: Oh, this is by the way, this is the funnest part of my week right now like this is this I love. I do this every year for every every group. And I I feel like it's just all coming at me. And I'm just like I love. How much it makes me think so. It's it's wonderful.

759
01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:32.423
Meg Hall: Okay, good. And I write, I've gotten some good insights just from what you've been telling the other people. I've definitely wrote down some good quotes. So.

760
01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:34.239
Bob Moesta: So tell me a little about sales, play.

761
01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:59.210
Meg Hall: Yeah, so our platforms for strategic sales. So if you think about selling like enterprise software to large companies, so we help the enterprise. Comp sales reps, break into either new markets or to their named account plans. Right? So if you want to sell into your dream list of customers, our platforms, the one for that. Right? So we have some pretty good comp. We have 6 figures of revenue, and we have some good customers like ringcentral

762
01:42:59.210 --> 01:43:22.619
Meg Hall: smart communications and bassware. So some pretty big software companies and with ringcentral, they're our 1st public company customer, and they paid for us to make a new product right? And so what I wanted to do for jobs to be done was to basically research this new market and make sure that I build something that they would want right. And so this new product, basically, it's if you look at.

763
01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:39.929
Meg Hall: you know, they have their product marketing team that's made all these materials? How do they spin it to create messaging for partners or for new right? So whether it be for like life sciences, things like that, they want to be able to spin up marketing and like go to market messaging really quickly. So that's the new product.

764
01:43:39.930 --> 01:43:54.940
Meg Hall: So my screening criteria was we want to talk to managers who have paid money or hired somebody recently to make messaging and content for a new segment. Okay? And that needs to be a company with A, b 2 b sales team. Okay? So.

765
01:43:54.940 --> 01:44:09.210
Bob Moesta: And just to make sure we got this. So they don't have the in-house capabilities to actually go do this. It's somebody that they say, all right, we're gonna go into this new market. Let's hire an expert to help us get into that new market and like, why did you choose them. What do they know? Why, why, this project, that kind of thing.

766
01:44:09.210 --> 01:44:09.890
Meg Hall: Yeah.

767
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:11.399
Bob Moesta: That's a great! That's a great approach.

768
01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:25.250
Meg Hall: Yeah, they'll typically already have like a product marketing team. That's like making stuff for like enterprise or for, like their big markets. And this is like they're gonna expand. And they have to make a hire to do that expansion because they do. Their existing team doesn't have capacity.

769
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:27.390
Bob Moesta: Yup. Okay. Got it?

770
01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:44.440
Meg Hall: So what I want to know is like what kind of documents they want to create, most often like what drives them to pay for external content to be made and like, what does success look like? So I did. 6 companies interviewed for vmware oracle, taba, pay, ignite, and a bunch of different ones.

771
01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:44.950
Bob Moesta: Yep.

772
01:44:45.138 --> 01:44:47.959
Meg Hall: And I can tell you the 3 main buckets that I came up with. But.

773
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:48.390
Bob Moesta: 8 am.

774
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:52.739
Meg Hall: Did find like this very common, like buying pattern, which I can also.

775
01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:53.666
Bob Moesta: Yeah. Yup.

776
01:44:54.399 --> 01:45:16.250
Meg Hall: So the 3 buckets is one they've invested in a hiring like a new team to go after this new market. Right? Let's just imagine they're going after Emia, or they're going after you know, the life sciences, industry like they've they've hired the people. And all of a sudden the Cro kind of goes we, we got to support these people with some materials, because I want to make sure that, like we get the most out of that.

777
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:25.529
Bob Moesta: Yeah. So they've hired the salespeople, but they haven't hired all the marketing that they they all of a sudden realize they're they don't have. They're trying to use their old stuff in this new market, and it just doesn't work.

778
01:45:25.530 --> 01:45:37.579
Meg Hall: Yeah. And so it's like an afterthought, they're like, Oh, crap! We gotta support these people with some more things, or they hired like they're gonna go after and to go to a conference something like that. So they've made some kind of an investment. And they have this freak out moment where they're like, we gotta support these people.

779
01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:39.799
Bob Moesta: They all have it. By the way.

780
01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:46.200
Bob Moesta: it's a very common thing where they they yes, so that I see the market already.

781
01:45:46.200 --> 01:46:05.009
Meg Hall: Yup. So that's the number one. Number 2 is from the partner marketing team partner. Marketing already has budget. Right? So partner, marketing is expected to take the stuff from product marketing and then spin up new Co branded materials to be able to like promote if they've you know, if ignite partnered with Google. They gotta promote that partnership.

782
01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:16.880
Bob Moesta: And and and partners are like distributors. They're like 3rd party installers there. There are other people who are part of the process that actually are connected with the the product.

783
01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:23.030
Meg Hall: Correct. Yeah. So basically, both of them have the vision that they can take the other person's sales team and turn them into an army of sellers.

784
01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:50.179
Meg Hall: And so it's like, okay, how do we activate those sellers? We make materials for them to go sell it? And then the 3rd use case is is like they have this, this feeling of like, they need deep domain expertise, which is where they'll typically hire like a product marketing person to go in there and like, do a lot of interviews, and try to add, like some industry vernacular, and really like T. Train the sales team. And so that's the other 3rd use case and I think

785
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:54.259
Meg Hall: that's okay. Let me just stop there. That's that's where I got so far. And then I can tell you.

786
01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:57.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And we're halfway through time, so we gotta knock out in 4 min. The next point.

787
01:46:58.087 --> 01:47:03.140
Bob Moesta: So give me the 3 again, just the high level. So like I'm trying to write.

788
01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:04.900
Meg Hall: So we gotta support the sales team.

789
01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:05.633
Bob Moesta: Yep. Yep.

790
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.309
Meg Hall: We have co- co-branded co-selling with partners.

791
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:12.599
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah. And then the I need deeper domain expertise.

792
01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:13.230
Meg Hall: Yep.

793
01:47:18.890 --> 01:47:21.249
Bob Moesta: Do you have a preference of where to go first? st

794
01:47:25.150 --> 01:47:52.169
Meg Hall: most of my connections are already with Number One. Right? It's the most natural one for us to. But I think my theory is that number 2 with the partner team? They're always hiring vendors. So like, if we look at Number one and number 3, they're gonna hire a a full time person most often if they don't go for hiring a contractor. Number 2. The partner team already has budget for contractors, and they're already actively hiring for contractors. So I think that's an interesting one.

795
01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:59.790
Bob Moesta: Yep. So the so the other thing I would say is, you need to actually study their approaches because their approaches aren't working

796
01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:21.139
Bob Moesta: right. And so like you can almost tell the story of like you did this. You hired these salespeople, and then you hired somebody to support them. But they didn't really know what to do. And then this happened. And this happened, and this like, ultimately, we can get you somebody who has this expertise and help you do this for half the price. But it's way more effective because of blah blah, blah blah, right? So you've got to be able to come back.

797
01:48:21.150 --> 01:48:33.769
Bob Moesta: And so not only do you have to understand, like the 3 different jobs, but then how are the people that they're using in those jobs? Not working? Because if it's working for them, they have no reason to look at you.

798
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:37.160
Meg Hall: And so what's not working about those relationships?

799
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:43.109
Meg Hall: Yeah, I mean, most often, it's it's expanding into a new market. So that's kind of that was the criteria.

800
01:48:43.110 --> 01:49:08.000
Bob Moesta: Yeah, but it's like the the problem would be is, you know, what? We didn't get as much traction as we thought we would. You know what we've had to go back 3 times to actually kind of re revamp all the materials like, what are the consequences of this? Because, again. Nobody. Nobody really values this until they've been through it 2 or 3 times. And they go like, yeah, we're just doing the same thing we did last time, and it didn't work right? So you've got to connect it with this really doesn't work. But we don't have any alternative.

801
01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:23.969
Meg Hall: Yeah, definitely. And I think the question that I was struggling with was, You know, why? Why go with a 3rd party, instead of hiring a full time person. And so I think that that's part of it is like, if we figure out why they where they failed previously with a full time person.

802
01:49:24.370 --> 01:49:53.240
Bob Moesta: Well. And so this is. This is my personal opinion. Is I much rather outsource it first, st till I know I'm really committed to it, because at some point there's still so many big unknowns that I need you to uncover some of the fundamental unknowns that I don't know to realize what's the right person I need to hire. And a lot of times we end up hiring people who mirror success in the other categories or the other channels, and they don't actually perform at all in this category.

803
01:49:53.560 --> 01:50:07.050
Bob Moesta: And so part of it is is to actually almost highlight some of the risks they have, and some of the misfits they've had, so they can when you're telling them a story they're going. Yep, that's happened to me. Yep, I know what that is. It's like. Okay, let me tell you how we're solving that now they're open to listen

804
01:50:08.690 --> 01:50:09.520
Bob Moesta: right?

805
01:50:09.930 --> 01:50:19.249
Bob Moesta: So that's that's kind of where I'd start, and I I might pick one or 2 of these to start in and then figure out how to migrate to the other, I think trying to go after all, 3 is kind of.

806
01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:39.319
Bob Moesta: They're almost structurally different to me. And so you like, I don't think you can create one service package that works for all 3. Right? So I would think about trying to pick one like you said, if your strength is in the in the support kind of the the expansion like I would try to make it land there, because if I can make it land there, I'm sure I can make it land in the other 2.

807
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:40.959
Meg Hall: Yeah, yeah.

808
01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Take care of

809
01:50:42.150 --> 01:50:50.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: real quick team. Sorry to jump in. Bob is 3 h ahead of us. It is 7 pm. Almost time. So, Bob, are you.

810
01:50:50.890 --> 01:50:54.670
Bob Moesta: I got a little bit. I I hold on one second. I just gotta check one thing. I've got a.

811
01:50:54.670 --> 01:50:55.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sure, sure.

812
01:50:55.450 --> 01:50:56.269
Bob Moesta: Just find out where my.

813
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:57.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You just have one more company.

814
01:50:59.830 --> 01:51:00.520
Bob Moesta: Hold on!

815
01:51:01.110 --> 01:51:02.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sorry to jump in, Meg.

816
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:03.210
Bob Moesta: No, that's okay.

817
01:51:06.030 --> 01:51:07.520
Bob Moesta: Yep, we're good. Okay.

818
01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, so.

819
01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:11.050
Bob Moesta: Track my wife to find out where she was, because.

820
01:51:11.050 --> 01:51:11.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's right. Okay.

821
01:51:11.650 --> 01:51:16.660
Bob Moesta: My night to make dinner, and I gotta make dinner, and she's not even moving yet, and I can get dinner on the table faster than that.

822
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:26.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Obviously the the founders. You all know the rules at at time. It's 4 o'clock over here on the West coast, if you need to jump, jump, but I highly encourage you to listen to whatever Bob has left to say. If you can.

823
01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:27.520
Bob Moesta: Got it.

824
01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:27.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool.

825
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.760
Bob Moesta: Hey? Trina.

826
01:51:29.230 --> 01:51:37.720
Trina Das: Hi, Bob, thank you so much for giving that extra time for listening to me. I'm super grateful for this opportunity to discuss our business with you.

827
01:51:37.780 --> 01:52:03.179
Trina Das: So basically at trains, we are solving the problem of biomedical AI teams who are trying to implement biomedical models which are based on imaging data. So if you look at diagnostic labs in the Us. They make a lot of mistakes because of radiology reading errors like, you know, there are false positives and misdetections which cost this labs a lot of money, and they are

828
01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:10.180
Trina Das: the inefficiencies in the process of diagnosis is costing a lot for the entire, like, you know, lot of stakeholders. So what we

829
01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:14.339
Trina Das: is, most of this cover is is most of this covered through malpractice insurance.

830
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:32.010
Trina Das: Yes, so basically, there is a part of it that is covered but there are, like, you know, radiology errors like radiologist errors which are not in certain ways where radiologist has this risk of losing their license and lot of other like, you know.

831
01:52:32.010 --> 01:52:32.770
Bob Moesta: Oh, wow!

832
01:52:32.770 --> 01:52:38.099
Trina Das: Which is like crazy, and which is why radiologists do require help from AI models.

833
01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:38.870
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

834
01:52:38.870 --> 01:53:06.570
Trina Das: Market reason why labs in the Us are wanting to implement AI models. Now, the tricky part is that these labs doesn't have the tech teams to implement these AI models in terms of like just integrating their data with AI models. Even if it is a plug and play model, or to annotate the data or to, like, you know, track the data, ensure that they are compliantly like, you know, implementing the model throughout all these things requires a lot of data tools, and they don't have that or the expertise in house to

835
01:53:06.570 --> 01:53:30.329
Trina Das: building from scratch wasting them months and a lot of money. So we at trains are solving that infrastructure gaps, giving them the data tools required to like, you know, implement highly accurate and optimized AI models which are like accurate in their production environment. And the biggest data point is that even for the most like, you know, accurate models which are actually having, like 96, 97% training accuracy.

836
01:53:30.643 --> 01:53:48.510
Trina Das: The moment you implement them in production, it starts breaking and the accuracy drops to 50 60% because there are a lot of data flaws. And like, you know, data challenges trees can solve this entirely and help you make like, you know, like, make sure that the models are accurate even in your environment.

837
01:53:48.680 --> 01:54:04.009
Trina Das: So for Gtbts, we have actually interviewed a lot of pathologists, radiologists, we are starting with chest X-ray data. And we have, like, you know, also interviewed a lot of CIO Ctos of these labs

838
01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:28.960
Trina Das: who are our major customers, and we have also created, like a whole need list of like a lot of labs in the Us. Around 8,000 labs who fit into our screening criteria of labs that has recently implemented imaging group AI models, or are planning to implement immediately. So I wanted to ask you some things like, you know, the 1st question that I have is that, are we solving the real

839
01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:52.120
Trina Das: barrier to production grade? Biomedical? AI. Would you agree to that like positioning ourselves right like that? And the second thing is like, you know, who do you think? Should we actually target? Is it going to be the AI engineer or like enterprise? It teams, or like the CIO Ctos we are we from our Jtvs. We have found out that CIO Ctos are the

840
01:54:52.554 --> 01:54:58.630
Trina Das: most like, you know, crucial like crucial decision maker in this case. Yep.

841
01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:11.839
Bob Moesta: So so, having worked in in hospital systems and being able to understand how those systems work. The 1st thing is, the CIO is, is probably, or the chief legal officer. One of those 2 is who you want to go to

842
01:55:12.190 --> 01:55:39.384
Bob Moesta: right, because at some point in time they they have responsibility for the systems that actually do all these things. And so what happens is when there's a big lawsuit when there's a malpractice suit that's like I would be scanning everybody who has had a malpractice suit of any sort in terms of this kind of mistake of making these mistakes, because that's that's the the biggest pain where they're gonna go like, yep, we need to do something, but we don't know what it is. And so

843
01:55:39.730 --> 01:55:54.629
Bob Moesta: The other thing to realize is that they have these scores for the hospitals and the scoring for the hospital then reflects kind of some of the government funding that they get, and so, having a malpractice suit actually affects their score, which actually affects their funding

844
01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:03.340
Bob Moesta: right. And and so you have to actually connect the dots between those the thing is is the AI engineer might be the one who

845
01:56:04.450 --> 01:56:14.689
Bob Moesta: who actually helps you implement it. But the reality is is they don't have the ability to buy anything, they only have the ability to to implement things, and so the only person.

846
01:56:14.690 --> 01:56:15.930
Trina Das: Okay. Yeah.

847
01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:17.090
Bob Moesta: Is that wrong?

848
01:56:17.090 --> 01:56:23.999
Trina Das: No, no, no, I think the legal and compliance angle. I never explored that. But that sounds like a very strong like, you know.

849
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:37.789
Bob Moesta: It. It is because this. So I I looked at we. I had a 2 2 underlying systems that that hospitals had to buy, and what you realize. If it didn't cost them money or it wasn't broken, they were doing nothing about it.

850
01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:59.060
Bob Moesta: And so my thing is is, they might have only a 70% like a effective rate. But if they're not getting sued about it, and they're not, actually, they don't see it as a problem on their on their governmental data. The rails like they're not touching it because they've got so many other problems. And so part of this is to. So the other thing I would do is, I would tell you to figure out how to shape it, to fit the hospital system.

851
01:56:59.665 --> 01:57:00.110
Trina Das: Right.

852
01:57:00.110 --> 01:57:09.670
Bob Moesta: Right? Because at some point in time, like, if you can like cause, my belief is they have a they probably have a global system like an sap, or some some big system, or or

853
01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.200
Bob Moesta: who's the other guy in Madison?

854
01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.260
Trina Das: Yeah, like, reading and data visualization.

855
01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:34.369
Bob Moesta: They have all these. They have all these tools and stuff. But the reality is is like at some point in time. You want to go to almost the tier. 2 people who don't have those big systems and literally are just trying to figure out where it's like they'll they'd rather buy, and I'm sorry to say it this way, but they'd rather buy a Band-aid than buy a a whole new way to do something

856
01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:45.489
Bob Moesta: right. And so part of this is to figure out, where can you slot in to do that? And my belief is that there's like the other thing I would actually think about is the pet industry

857
01:57:45.650 --> 01:57:53.530
Bob Moesta: anything to do with vets, veterinarians. They have the same problem. They have all the same diagnostics. The pathologists are all basically making the same problem.

858
01:57:53.530 --> 01:57:59.199
Trina Das: So we don't have our models work only on humans right now. So we

859
01:57:59.507 --> 01:58:06.589
Trina Das: okay, okay, I. And I was thinking, I was thinking about the veterinary market only because it's an easier market to get into.

860
01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:31.900
Bob Moesta: Right that then then the because the hospital side is is just, it's so big. And now you might be able to go to certain practices, but what I would find that anybody who's in like radiology practices, they're gonna try to buy the best because they want to grow the the business. And so my thing is, is you want to find somebody who can, who's willing to take a standalone solution that will actually do it. And so it's probably mid tier or a rural hospital.

861
01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:54.170
Trina Das: Yeah, that's a great point. So we are not actually stopping them to buy the best. What we are saying is, even if you buy the best implementing. The best in your environment requires a lot of data tools. Either you have to build your own data tools or you have to like, you know, work with something compromised. We can help you solve that gap like the adapter that is working.

862
01:58:54.170 --> 01:58:54.550
Trina Das: Thank you.

863
01:58:54.550 --> 01:59:00.490
Bob Moesta: But but if they, if they already have the tools and they already have the people, then it's just putting time and effort to go against it.

864
01:59:00.490 --> 01:59:20.169
Trina Das: No, they don't. So every lab, every environment. To implement AI, they need to build custom, like, you know, workflows and custom tools for those environments, and they don't have that they have to build build it. We are giving them the infrastructure and the tools to like do it much faster and specifically built for diagnostic labs.

865
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:21.739
Trina Das: So we are not stopping them from.

866
01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:25.900
Bob Moesta: Are you are, by the way, are you taking on the liability? If it's wrong.

867
01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:36.010
Trina Das: No, we are not, we are not. We are not positioning ourselves as a medical devices, company and all we are. So we are just positioning ourselves like a data infrastructure company.

868
01:59:36.010 --> 01:59:40.369
Bob Moesta: Yeah. But if you give me the wrong, if you give me the wrong diagnostic, can I hold you account.

869
01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:46.079
Trina Das: We are not. No, so we are not giving them the diagnostic. That's the whole point. So we, we are letting them implement the best models in the.

870
01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:46.850
Bob Moesta: Got it.

871
01:59:47.210 --> 01:59:53.750
Trina Das: And implementing is the challenge, and that implementing the bridge that it takes to. So you can imagine, scale AI.

872
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:54.050
Bob Moesta: Yup!

873
01:59:54.813 --> 01:59:55.740
Trina Das: File me.

874
01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:56.110
Bob Moesta: So.

875
01:59:56.110 --> 01:59:56.460
Trina Das: What do you.

876
01:59:56.460 --> 02:00:10.470
Bob Moesta: The the one other piece of advice I would tell you then, is, if you're going to try to go to radiology practices and and do this for radiology practices. Typically, there's 1 or 2 of the radiologists who are the who are the geeks who are into this

877
02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:38.839
Bob Moesta: you need to find the 2 who are one or 2 who are really into it, because the rest of them are just cranking. They're just doing all the other stuff. But there's usually a partner who's in charge of systems and infrastructure. And and they're a geek around some of these things, and my belief is you'll have way, more success if you actually can. I isolate who that person is in the practice because they're the ones most likely to actually buy it where everybody else is just doesn't have to say No.

878
02:00:39.110 --> 02:00:48.010
Bob Moesta: right? Somebody's got to say yes, and you want to find that person who's who's willing to take the political risk to put in a new system to solve this problem.

879
02:00:48.890 --> 02:00:50.329
Bob Moesta: Cool, I got a

880
02:00:50.330 --> 02:01:12.759
Bob Moesta: that. It's a, it's like, it's either it's not a problem, or it's a really big problem. But there's no like we have. We're kind of good at it, like it's like they don't even think about it, or they're thinking about it every day. And so it's it's 1 of those things where I think it should be obvious who? Who's candidates and who are like? Oh, that's interesting when they say, interesting, that's the kiss of death.

881
02:01:14.670 --> 02:01:15.969
Bob Moesta: Do you know why?

882
02:01:16.770 --> 02:01:18.620
Bob Moesta: Cause they? They cannot articulate?

883
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:29.429
Bob Moesta: Yeah, but they can't articulate any of the outcomes that they would get with it. It's like the 2 the 2 phrases when when you talk to customers about your product, if they say it's cool.

884
02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:31.729
Bob Moesta: or they say it's interesting.

885
02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:41.160
Bob Moesta: It means nothing. It means that they're just trying to make up words to tell you. And so I would be very wary of people who tell you those 2 words.

886
02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:42.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Great.

887
02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:43.797
Bob Moesta: All right, Neil.

888
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:46.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So, Bob, I have one final, clever question.

889
02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:47.160
Bob Moesta: Good.

890
02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:51.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: For you. So you've met. I think every single class that I've invested in at Texas.

891
02:01:51.790 --> 02:01:53.560
Bob Moesta: A pretty damn good class, my friend.

892
02:01:53.560 --> 02:02:13.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Thank you. This is 13. This is Class Number 13. So my question for you, though, is that out of the 13 classes you've helped a lot of my founders separately outside of this as well. None more than you've helped Jake. So what has made and separated your desire and willingness to spend so much time helping Jake relative to every other founder that has asked you for help.

893
02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:18.260
Bob Moesta: So so before I answered, I want Jake to answer, Jake. Why did I help you?

894
02:02:20.230 --> 02:02:25.410
Jake Gutstein: Man I I was on. I was in Sf. Last week, and Neil was like really drilling me on this.

895
02:02:25.410 --> 02:02:26.119
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah.

896
02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:29.030
Jake Gutstein: I don't know. I.

897
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:33.080
Bob Moesta: And I literally have helped you more than anybody else in Techstar's history.

898
02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:37.280
Jake Gutstein: Yeah, I really like this stuff.

899
02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:39.059
Jake Gutstein: So I don't know if that.

900
02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:52.719
Bob Moesta: But it's not so alright. So let me. Let's break it down a little bit. One is is you take you take the time to understand what I'm saying, and, to be honest, you hold me accountable to the words I use, so you'll you'll come back 3 days later.

901
02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:56.210
Jake Gutstein: I forgot about that. You told me. I just keep coming back.

902
02:02:56.210 --> 02:03:03.170
Bob Moesta: You just keep coming back. And so the but but you come back with 2 things the humility to say you don't know

903
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:07.650
Bob Moesta: the curiosity to actually be open to what the answer might be.

904
02:03:07.770 --> 02:03:27.450
Bob Moesta: And then the 3rd thing is, you go off and try, and, to be honest, you might fall flat on your face, you might actually get a little bit of thing. But then you come back and say, All right. This is what I did. Here's where how it went, and you give me the feedback, and the other part is you. You value my time so much that, like we could do a lot of these conversations in 5 min.

905
02:03:27.754 --> 02:03:51.679
Bob Moesta: Right? And so it's that that building the building a way in which to actually have conversations very, very quickly, so like the 1st 2 min is what like, why are we talking? The other 2 min is basically about what? What what you're struggling with. And then there's 1 min for me to basically say, Do we need more time? Or can I just give you an answer? And then we could actually, we, we would resolve a lot of things in 5 to 7 min.

906
02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.950
Bob Moesta: You know. What would you agree.

907
02:03:54.230 --> 02:03:57.170
Jake Gutstein: Yeah, no, that that part of it is definitely spot on.

908
02:03:57.450 --> 02:04:18.309
Bob Moesta: I think the other part is that you also did not just accept what I had to say. You challenged and you challenged, based on kind of going back and doing research or going back and kind of saying, like, Yeah, but I learned it this way. And this is what it feels like this, these 2 feeling conflict. Why are they? Why are they in conflict, or am I looking at it? Wrong?

909
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:35.760
Bob Moesta: Kind of thing? And so you, you would you? You would argue and and debate with me around it. So you got clarity of understanding, and what you helped me with is being able to articulate how it's different from some of these other things that people are doing like the our whole conversation around personas. I remember very vividly

910
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.530
Bob Moesta: right that way.

911
02:04:38.210 --> 02:04:39.049
Bob Moesta: Neil does that.

912
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:51.050
Bob Moesta: I tease that out because I wanted them to hear that connection and to aspire to have that same type of connection with someone that they can from it could be you. It could be many other people that they've met or will meet. So I think.

913
02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:52.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So really good, kind of.

914
02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:53.240
Jake Gutstein: Yeah.

915
02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:54.530
Bob Moesta: So this is, yeah, totally.

916
02:04:54.530 --> 02:05:14.369
Bob Moesta: Here, I got to turn this up. So this is my mentors, right? And what I'll tell you is, I've learned, just like you got to remember I'm a dyslexic, illiterate person. At 18 years old I was told to be a construction worker or a baggage handler, and the reality is is these 4 people, Dr. Willie Moore, Dr. Taguchi, Dr. Christensen, and Dr. Deming.

917
02:05:14.450 --> 02:05:38.689
Bob Moesta: They all were my mentors. I worked with them directly, almost at least for a period of time. And ultimately the fact is is that I I learned how to be a mentor because I was mentored by them, but they were. They were very hard on me. They were very direct on me. They made me work my ass off, and then, when I was wrong. They literally rubbed my nose in it, and they basically made sure that I knew how things worked. I'm not saying

918
02:05:38.690 --> 02:05:46.740
Bob Moesta: I'm that way, but the fact is that I think there's there's some efficiency about telling Jake to go. No, that's not. That's close. Go do a couple more interviews, Jake.

919
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:53.366
Bob Moesta: right? And so part of this is to realize it's about you learning how to do it. And you need to actually realize that there's

920
02:05:54.248 --> 02:05:57.679
Bob Moesta: so there's a there's a point where.

921
02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:06.799
Bob Moesta: So I wrote an article or a a blog post, or whatever in Hbr. Maybe, Neil, can you look it up? It's called getting the mentoring equation right.

922
02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:07.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: On it.

923
02:06:07.890 --> 02:06:19.359
Bob Moesta: And what it. What it talks about is, the fact is is that one of the reasons why I'm mentoring Jake is because I want Jake to be a peer of mine, so we can collaborate on things later.

924
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:27.130
Bob Moesta: And so I'm trying to download everything I can to Jake. But eventually, Jake, I will not be Jake's mentor anymore. I will be his peer.

925
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:40.309
Bob Moesta: And and ultimately that we're getting very close to it. But it's that aspect of as we're going through this. The reason why I'm doing this as a mentor is, I need other people to play with, and I need other people who are serious about this stuff. And so to me.

926
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:57.300
Bob Moesta: find people who love the stuff you're talking about, learn as much as they as they will give you, and then figure out how to become a peer to them, because they want to collaborate and be better as well. And there's no like for me. There's very little people I can collaborate with who will push me to the next level.

927
02:06:57.310 --> 02:06:58.780
Bob Moesta: But my mentees.

928
02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:01.490
Bob Moesta: Sorry.

929
02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:02.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Came on.

930
02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:03.020
Bob Moesta: Epsilon.

931
02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's for dinner?

932
02:07:06.793 --> 02:07:11.156
Bob Moesta: Grilled chicken rice and snap peas.

933
02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:12.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No wine.

934
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:16.460
Bob Moesta: No wine, not not I. I've cut. I've

935
02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:20.079
Bob Moesta: I've I've stopped drinking for a period of time.

936
02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:20.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Congrats.

937
02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:21.430
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

938
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:22.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Proud of you.

939
02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:25.549
Bob Moesta: So that's it.

940
02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:28.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Awesome, awesome, awesome.

941
02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:38.861
Bob Moesta: Can I? If if there are people still here? I don't know how many people are still here like they didn't have to stay, but like, what did you learn? I want to know what people get out of this, because, like, I feel like, this is a this is like,

942
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:53.240
Bob Moesta: you know, somebody just throwing throwing baseballs at me and me letting just literally swinging, you know, just getting batting practice in. So I I don't really know if you guys get anything out of this. So if anybody's willing to come out and share what you've learned out of this, that would be great.

943
02:07:53.710 --> 02:07:55.250
Ankur Toshniwal: I don't need everybody.

944
02:07:55.250 --> 02:07:57.029
Ankur Toshniwal: Carla, you go first.st Yeah.

945
02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:00.672
Carlo Scaglia: Well for me, I think it was more more so. Just like

946
02:08:01.590 --> 02:08:16.210
Carlo Scaglia: Well, 2 things, 1 1 a positioning of product, because I think I don't want to speak for the others, but always feels like most of us know, the things, is just like reiterating them or identifying like a process around them, and how you can approach clients within it.

947
02:08:16.210 --> 02:08:16.620
Bob Moesta: Yep.

948
02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:30.349
Carlo Scaglia: And then, secondly, it's kind of those that difference between you know, using and then staying. I thought that was possibly for me really interesting because I was benchmarking them with the same tier, using and stay

949
02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:36.999
Carlo Scaglia: when, in fact, using attracts. And then the staying so keeps. So those were my 2 main things.

950
02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:38.840
Bob Moesta: Very cool. Thank you.

951
02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:40.260
Carlo Scaglia: Thank you.

952
02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:46.650
Ankur Toshniwal: I I was just gonna add, I I think I was.

953
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:54.410
Ankur Toshniwal: I was surprised how simple you kind of kept stuff. I don't know. I think Neil's kind.

954
02:08:54.410 --> 02:08:56.149
Bob Moesta: I take that as a compliment. That's.

955
02:08:56.150 --> 02:09:13.689
Ankur Toshniwal: Very much so I think that it was actually very easy to understand. whereas, you know, I think maybe there's a bit of an impression that, like you go really deep and like it's like kind of goes really into the nitty gritty. But he actually kept it like very practical and kept it about business and kept it, you know.

956
02:09:13.730 --> 02:09:28.734
Ankur Toshniwal: so that I could understand your conversation with whatever 9 other companies, despite not necessarily knowing every single piece of those other companies. And keeping it down, you know, to to the basics of what build a good business.

957
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:41.299
Ankur Toshniwal: also just make me think in a business oriented way. Hey? Are we preventing the product from, you know, causing churn? You know what you know? What is? What is the metrics keep it simple. And I think that's that's just illuminating.

958
02:09:41.300 --> 02:10:00.750
Bob Moesta: Yeah, the thing I would add is, the fact is, what I'm trying to do is get you to be so immersed in the demand side, because most of you know the supply side so well about what you can build, and you know how we're going to market, and like all these other things. But the the fact is, the more you're rooted in the demand side, the easier the supply side becomes. And that's why

959
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:14.540
Bob Moesta: it it actually is simple when you actually have demand, very clear it. And so, to be honest, if it becomes too complicated to figure out, I typically will take a step back and re interview, because it means I didn't actually make it simple enough.

960
02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:22.669
Bob Moesta: because once you see this, some once, you see the demand side, it actually causes simplicity. You're like, on the other side of complexity.

961
02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:26.359
Jake Gutstein: i 1 1 thing that I would just

962
02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:36.350
Jake Gutstein: add in there anchor like the reason you're saying he made the business easy to understand. It's because he's like speaking to the people rather than the business. The people who are buying

963
02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:39.449
Jake Gutstein: you know, and almost everybody can relate to buying

964
02:10:39.450 --> 02:10:52.149
Jake Gutstein: right. So he's talking in a way that you're gonna understand, because you don't need to know anything about what the people are selling during these conversations. And that's like the expertise to which he's like bringing himself. I nerd out of it. I'm like.

965
02:10:53.790 --> 02:10:54.270
Bob Moesta: Alex.

966
02:10:54.270 --> 02:11:15.849
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, for me. I took out 3 main things. The 1st one that you said to Callo, I think was really insightful is about articulating the problem better than they would say it. I think that resonated a lot with me. The second thing is, it sounds weird. But every time I was trying to understand, like your path of thoughts with each one of us, and each time it was like

967
02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:25.989
Alex Nativelle: understanding clearly who are the stakeholders, and what is their big, big problem. And that feels weird to say, but when you said, if someone says, Yeah, that's cool, or you know.

968
02:11:26.290 --> 02:11:28.139
Bob Moesta: Interesting. It's not big enough.

969
02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:47.009
Alex Nativelle: And we had that a lot. And I think a lot of us can resonate with that because we're building AI, you know, cool stuff innovative. But you were always like, yeah, but they do. They really need it? Is it a bandit? Is it something, and always dipping on that? And the 3rd thing would be like the time, money, and knowledge that we like triangle, that we talked about.

970
02:11:47.010 --> 02:11:47.390
Bob Moesta: Yeah.

971
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:48.570
Alex Nativelle: Going to come back to.

972
02:11:48.860 --> 02:12:18.524
Bob Moesta: Yeah, yeah, I like to be honest, one of the attitudes I take about this is, I've done now 10 startups. And what I'll tell you is like, I want the advice, like the advice that I got when I was in my twenties and thirties was garbage, because everybody told me, oh, this is a great idea! Oh, this is so wonderful! And you're like, and and they're being supportive. But they're actually just ruining my life because they're like. I keep falling down the path when I should have pivoted 2 or 3 times before, and so I feel like my job is to be as brutal as I can, but without crushing you.

973
02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:19.330
Alex Nativelle: Yeah.

974
02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:24.339
Jake Gutstein: And is is is George still here.

975
02:12:25.150 --> 02:12:26.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You know it.

976
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:28.299
George Haikal: Is he? Where's George?

977
02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:30.029
George Haikal: I'm right here listening.

978
02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:47.810
Bob Moesta: There you go. So, George George. So if I have a hierarchy, it's Neil, and then it's and then it's Jake, and George is the newest addition to the mentoring my of my realm. And so, like George has been, I've been pushing George a lot. But, George, what's what's it like to to for me to mentor you.

979
02:12:50.010 --> 02:12:51.618
George Haikal: It's a good question.

980
02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:53.670
Bob Moesta: I'll put you on the spot. I know.

981
02:12:53.670 --> 02:13:00.220
George Haikal: Oh, no, it's good. It's kind of going on your question on what we learned. It's acknowledge

982
02:13:00.450 --> 02:13:09.460
George Haikal: that you're pretty dumb that I'm pretty dumb in terms of life knowledge, and what I want to do, and whatever I'm trying to figure out, stay curious about

983
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:14.479
George Haikal: the people you're talking to, and what you're trying to learn, and why, and then just getting down

984
02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:16.689
George Haikal: to the truth of whatever it is.

985
02:13:16.690 --> 02:13:19.200
Bob Moesta: The cause and effect. Just get down to cause and effect.

986
02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:25.079
Bob Moesta: Right? So I I've met George. How long have we known each of the 4 years, 3 years, 4 or 5 years. I don't even

987
02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:26.950
Bob Moesta: 4 or 5. Yeah, right? Right?

988
02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:27.550
George Haikal: But.

989
02:13:27.550 --> 02:13:42.070
Bob Moesta: And and I. I helped George just kind of navigate his way to different places, because at some point I saw what I see in Jake is what I see also in George, which is this humbleness, this curiosity, and this this ability to kind of like.

990
02:13:42.270 --> 02:14:08.829
Bob Moesta: how to say, the the ability to take action like, it's those 3 combinations that make those. And Neil's the same way that it's those 3 things that are really essential for me as a mentor for to take anybody on you, you've got to be in the top 1% for that, and that's and and so my thing is is, you'll always find a good mentor. But I would tell you like, it's a 2 way street. You gotta help the mentor as much as the mentors helping you.

991
02:14:11.140 --> 02:14:15.960
Bob Moesta: Neil. What like? What would you add to it about being a mentor, me being your mentor?

992
02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:16.809
Bob Moesta: It's weird.

993
02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:17.750
Bob Moesta: Say, that.

994
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:18.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I know.

995
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:19.320
Bob Moesta: First.st

996
02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:27.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I mean, there's there's 1 thing that I haven't answered yet, Bob, and then again, like I still haven't figured it out so and and that's why aren't you married?

997
02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:50.930
Bob Moesta: Yeah, that's 1 of the problems we have. Yeah, every time I see Neil, I I don't it doesn't bode well, because all I ask about is like, is is he? He wants to be married, and we've tried to like you say, but I always interrogate him about his whoever he's dating, and are they the one or not? And if they are the one, what do you do? And if they're not the one, what do you do, and he hates it. He hates it.

998
02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:52.320
Bob Moesta: Just I like it

999
02:14:52.320 --> 02:15:02.500
Bob Moesta: to the nth degree, and and he knows that I'm gonna ask it. And he and there's times where I believe that you've actually stayed away from me because the the relationship is too early, and you don't want to answer my question.

1000
02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:02.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know.

1001
02:15:02.980 --> 02:15:07.689
Bob Moesta: No, I don't know yet. I don't want to, and and but it's it's only because I care.

1002
02:15:07.690 --> 02:15:14.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, so the thing is is what I've learned from from you, Bob, though as a mentee is, this isn't just business

1003
02:15:14.450 --> 02:15:30.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like this is like you. You can't you? The way you look at the world starts to shift when you actually take this all the way in. So everywhere I look every little thing I interact with every day. I'm I'm looking at it through this lens of progress and jobs, way, shape or form. So that was my big unlock.

1004
02:15:30.730 --> 02:15:42.359
Bob Moesta: Yep, and that that's that's really what I consider the gift that my mentors gave to me was an ability to think in a very different way. And that's ultimately what I'm trying to pass down. So

1005
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:46.019
Bob Moesta: thank you guys here, I'm gonna can. I? Can I snap a picture hold on.

1006
02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:47.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Please. Oh, yeah.

1007
02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:49.079
Bob Moesta: I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't actually.

1008
02:15:54.110 --> 02:15:55.860
Bob Moesta: all right. Here we go. One.

1009
02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:58.410
Bob Moesta: Hold on. I gotta figure out where it's gonna go before I do it.

1010
02:15:58.930 --> 02:16:04.749
Bob Moesta: I don't want it. It doesn't need to go to 2025 taxes. It's gonna go to my desktop. There we go alright ready. One.

1011
02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:05.600
Jake Gutstein: Nrs.

1012
02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:06.973
Bob Moesta: 2, 3.

1013
02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:10.939
Bob Moesta: There we go. Thank you. Got it.

1014
02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:12.790
Bob Moesta: Very good.

1015
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:13.560
Bob Moesta: Cool guys.

1016
02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:15.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Bob, have a great dinner. Thank you.

1017
02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:17.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Tomorrow we'll check in.

1018
02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:24.990
Bob Moesta: Yeah, we'll we'll check in tomorrow. Congratulations on the sale. Yep, cool. See? You guys, thank you. Bye.

1019
02:16:24.990 --> 02:16:25.380
Anthony De Silva: Thanks.

1020
02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:25.855
Vivian: Bye.
