1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.719
Lilliana Robinson: There we go!

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.759
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay. Can you hear me?

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.019
Lilliana Robinson: Yes, that sounds so much better.

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:22.009
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, it's the podcast. Yeah. So my Monica, Roy, seascape, clinical founder and CEO and the objective of my pitch is to attract investor attention.

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.370
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I'm not trying to target customers or anything like that.

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.379
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): So do I just launch in.

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.510
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay.

8
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:43.729
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): it takes 10 years and 1 billion dollars to get a new drug approved by the FDA. However, once a drug is approved, it starts creating revenue for small pre-revenue pharma companies. The 1st drug approval is existential

9
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:52.709
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): for large pharma companies. One drug approval can lead to the addition of 250 billion dollars of market cap. As happened with Eli Lilly, recently

10
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.969
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): the longest and most expensive component of drug approval is a multi-stage clinical trial process.

11
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:08.960
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): As we increasingly test drugs in complex rare diseases and specific patient populations. The clinical trials themselves are only getting longer and pricier.

12
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.869
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I'm Monica Roy, founder of seascape clinical. I worked in Pharma for 20 years. So know the space. Well.

13
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.090
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): My company's Sas platform automates the entire clinical trial

14
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:33.309
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): from workflows to reporting. To compliance. This leads to faster trials and yes, faster drug Approvals global trial spend was 80 billion last year. If you'd like to make the spend more impactful, we invite you to invest in us.

15
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.170
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that was 1Â min flat.

16
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700
Lilliana Robinson: Feel free to just jump in. Our mentors.

17
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.790
Thomas Cirone: I'll go ahead. Hey? I like that, Monica. I won't change a thing. There you go! I'm done.

18
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.980
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay. Thanks.

19
00:01:54.192 --> 00:01:59.719
Thomas Cirone: I mean. So you said you were gonna track it as you. I'm sorry. Did you say you wanted to attract attention? That was your objective.

20
00:02:00.423 --> 00:02:01.409
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): From investors.

21
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:14.439
Thomas Cirone: Investors. Okay, I just wanna make sure. And I think you did that right. So I like you start out with the money started with the you know what I mean like so, and I like the way you kind of walked it through. And if I'm in the healthcare space of the current trial space. I'm gonna come talk to you. In my opinion.

22
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.950
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay. Thanks.

23
00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:20.860
Andrea Perdomo: Monica, I just had one quick question. Is there

24
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.259
Andrea Perdomo: anything you're planning on talking about? Like what?

25
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.480
Andrea Perdomo: Why, you're starting this company.

26
00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:42.550
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I actually don't have I don't plan to touch on that in any of the segments. But the answer is because I worked in Pharma for 20 years. And so I was. I am. I am the potential end user of the product.

27
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.640
Andrea Perdomo: I

28
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:59.380
Andrea Perdomo: I mean, I think that that is something. If you can weave in somehow. I don't know, Tom. If you agree like you definitely captured my intention. But knowing that you've been in the space, and that you're in fact, your target customer

29
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.909
Andrea Perdomo: is actually something that would draw me as an investor even closer to being like, I want to figure out. I want to talk to them.

30
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.749
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, I can add it to the Q. And A. I still have a lot of room there.

31
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.329
Andrea Perdomo: Okay, yeah, I think that could be interesting.

32
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.910
Lilliana Robinson: Can you say where you introduce yourself again? Can you just read back that sentence.

33
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:29.169
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, it's vague, because, I don't have enough time to elaborate. But basically it's I'm Monica Roy, founder of seascape clinical. I worked in Pharma for 20 years, so know the space well.

34
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:42.210
Lilliana Robinson: So I agree with Annie. Just put in the chat. You shouldn't undersell yourself by saying so. I know the space well. So she suggests saying, I'm deeply familiar with these customers struggles, or I'm an expert in the space. Something I just worked with

35
00:03:42.350 --> 00:04:00.979
Lilliana Robinson: Annie and Morgan on like is saying who you are so like. Annie says, like I'm a an AI researcher, and Morgan says I'm a i have a Phd. In chemistry. I'm a scientist, and so I have a background here so like you were at a minute flat, adding a few more words to boost your

36
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.930
Lilliana Robinson: your intro there, I think, is really valid.

37
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.530
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, I like Annie's suggestion of swapping in the word expert cause.

38
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.479
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, but you're not saying why, like you just said, you have years in the space like.

39
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.260
Lilliana Robinson: what is it? Who are you? What are the

40
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.559
Lilliana Robinson: what are the words you could say like, or do you want to call yourself a researcher? What do you want to say.

41
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.069
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, yeah, I can add a few words. There.

42
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.329
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, just like a very small like, basically, what would be like your Linkedin headline if someone just like looked you up.

43
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.769
Lilliana Robinson: That's what you should say.

44
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.770
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, sounds good.

45
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.970
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I'll change that.

46
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.629
Lilliana Robinson: Really good. Don't undersell yourself like that. That's a huge part of your unfair advantage.

47
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.160
Lilliana Robinson: Is the founder fit here?

48
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.480
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

49
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.840
Lilliana Robinson: so it sounds like everyone is pretty happy with that pitch, Monica, do you have any other questions? I think we're gonna move on.

50
00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:53.410
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): No thanks.

51
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.360
Lilliana Robinson: Good job.

52
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.210
Lilliana Robinson: Thanks for going first, st Talitha, start with your objective objective.

53
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:17.810
Talitha: Yes, Hi, guys. So the objective is, since we're not fundraising, just having, like early conversations with anybody in the audience who might be interested in our space just to start up conversations with them as investors, and also the second one is, if they have any connections to property management companies, large ones as potential clients.

54
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.585
Talitha: Alright.

55
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:39.510
Talitha: Last year I was super excited for my vacation to Mexico, and to finally eat the Tacos I'd been dreaming of. But when I arrived at my Airbnb I struggled to enter. The host didn't respond, leaving me stranded on the street alone at night with my bags. It's not just my story. 700 million travelers face similar challenges every year.

56
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.669
Talitha: delayed responses and lack of support when navigating unfamiliar places can turn a joyful getaway into a stressful ordeal.

57
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:59.810
Talitha: On the other hand, millions of short-term rental hosts are under constant pressure to be available. 24, 7 manually answer repetitive questions and struggle to balance operations with growing and improving their business.

58
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.569
Talitha: I'm Talitha, CEO of Collab, and our mission is to redefine the future of hospitality.

59
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:20.360
Talitha: For all of us travel is a chance to unwind, recharge and create beautiful memories. So imagine a world where every guest has a 5 star concierge at their fingertips, anticipating needs, providing inspiration and making every stay flawless. So let's take a glimpse.

60
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.600
Lilliana Robinson: That was 58 seconds. I think you can slow down a little bit. You kind of still do that.

61
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.190
Talitha: Yeah.

62
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.580
Thomas Cirone: I'll let Andrea go 1st this time.

63
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.090
Andrea Perdomo: I think it was good. I'm I'm

64
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:51.929
Andrea Perdomo: I was trying to like. Listen, and maybe it's because you and I have had conversations in the past, where, like, I know a little bit more about the the product itself.

65
00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:01.770
Andrea Perdomo: But to me like, if you're trying to get in front of like the property like, you know. If if your end goal is kind of to get some of those introductions.

66
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.189
Andrea Perdomo: Do you talk about your business model at any moment?

67
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:19.979
Talitha: Yeah, so we speak about the business model in our QA. And then video is supposed to really illustrate the problem from the host side as well as the benefits of our solution for them. So we try to focus a lot on the host in the video.

68
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.910
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, okay.

69
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:38.620
Andrea Perdomo: I think that'll I think that will help. But that's that's just a little bit of where it left me, which is, I mean, you and I have talked about this like comparing to like other things that are out there. So I'm wondering if there's an opportunity right off the bat to kind of distinguish what makes you all different.

70
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:46.940
Andrea Perdomo: So that my my head doesn't go to questions and doubts, but rather towards like opportunities.

71
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.160
Andrea Perdomo: and how you all are going to actually stand out in the market.

72
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:59.029
Lilliana Robinson: I completely agree with that. I actually just told Talitha about an hour ago. That needs to be her 1st question in the Q. And a

73
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:09.270
Lilliana Robinson: cause I don't. I don't think there's space to like. She does want to show the product in the demo video. So there's not really space there. But as soon as she sits down with the eir, that's the 1st thing I want him to ask her.

74
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.210
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, yeah, I think that'll I think that will help.

75
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.099
Lilliana Robinson: Because everyone's going to be wondering it, like the defensibility piece.

76
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:23.360
Talitha: Exactly. We'll be speaking about Airbnb Vrbo, but also, for example, differences to Alexa for hospitality, and that kind of thing.

77
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.340
Andrea Perdomo: Okay.

78
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.370
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect, to Tom.

79
00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:52.080
Thomas Cirone: I had them. I don't. You know. I struggle on this, so I have to change my brain because I was going through pitch decks yesterday with someone from the last cohort. Right? And this is a 1Â min. This is not a pitch deck, right? So I get. So I totally get that. So I'm I don't know how I feel about this other than you probably mentioned this in the Q&A or the video. So you grab. So if you're trying to get people interested, I like, whenever you say 700 700 million travelers or millions of short term. So that gets my attention.

80
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.580
Thomas Cirone: I say, I think large market there. I'm curious in the Q. And a. Or

81
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:07.569
Thomas Cirone: anywhere. Have you ever kind of quantified it like? So if I'm a short term owner of a rental property, and I have 5 or 6 of them. Maybe I don't know how much money am I losing because of this.

82
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:14.050
Thomas Cirone: and you probably know that, and that's cool, and I don't. I just want to see, and I don't know if it fits into the pitch. But I'm just curious.

83
00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:24.890
Talitha: Yeah. So we bring it into the Q. And A, we talk about how an average portfolio they're losing like $40,000 a year and a thousand 800 working hours. So we've talked that.

84
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.459
Thomas Cirone: Okay. And so so my thought so. And, Lillian, you know this like sometimes. At demo night

85
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:37.009
Thomas Cirone: I tune the Q&A out sometimes because it's like like the 1Â min pitch in the video mean a lot.

86
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.400
Thomas Cirone: Talfa, right? So

87
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:54.799
Thomas Cirone: just as a as a thought challenge, I don't know if you want to work that in or work it into the video. Somehow, I don't know that. And I'll defer to you guys because you're on the front lines a bit more, but I I unfortunately have a bad habit of zoning out in the Q. And a.

88
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.290
Talitha: Yeah.

89
00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:00.589
Thomas Cirone: Even if I'm interested in you, I've already made a decision. If I want to talk to you sometimes the Q. And a.

90
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.599
Lilliana Robinson: So what would you suggest like? Is there something small that could be added in the pitch.

91
00:10:09.227 --> 00:10:16.580
Thomas Cirone: I adding that money piece. Maybe, like, you know, 1 million people. And they're potentially losing an average of this

92
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.329
Thomas Cirone: on rentals or this on time, or this is happening.

93
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:29.690
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, totally. I'm wondering. Is there a way to maybe shorten the story, part upfront a little bit, to feel a little less

94
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.610
Andrea Perdomo: whimsical?

95
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:40.989
Andrea Perdomo: So you can buy back like a few seconds to actually talk about for property like you, said Tom. Like for property manners, we would be saving Xyz thing.

96
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:49.580
Andrea Perdomo: I don't know something along along those lines. I know you've been working right.

97
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.930
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

98
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:51.760
Thomas Cirone: It is a good stuff.

99
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.460
Lilliana Robinson: What'd you say to them.

100
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.696
Thomas Cirone: It is a good pitch, though it's a decent pitch.

101
00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.329
Talitha: So we should be adding, in the quantifying the problem from the host side into the pitch. Is that right?

102
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.580
Lilliana Robinson: In a very brief way, like you save them X percent.

103
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.480
Talitha: Yeah.

104
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:14.320
Lilliana Robinson: And you can even throw in the lines that your solution is proprietary. That

105
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.709
Lilliana Robinson: basically, you have this very unique

106
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:24.949
Lilliana Robinson: development you've made, and that kind of hints at what you're going to get into in the Q. And a. About how Airbnb can't take it.

107
00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:32.319
Lilliana Robinson: Neil told Talitha about an hour ago that the whole example needs to become a little bit more

108
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:55.860
Lilliana Robinson: realistic and less like fear mongering like she's not actually helping people not get stranded on the street. It's a lot more about like you come in and like you don't know how to access the Wi-fi or the shower is not having hot water. So like, I think Talitha and Flo are gonna workshop that a little bit. So what I'm hearing from Andrea and Tom is that you need to also shorten the example. At the beginning.

109
00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.320
Talitha: I think.

110
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.300
Lilliana Robinson: That you buy yourself.

111
00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.610
Talitha: Yeah.

112
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.840
Lilliana Robinson: And Annie had a point for you

113
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.220
Lilliana Robinson: instead of let's take a glimpse, maybe something that into the video more smoothly.

114
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.400
Talitha: Okay.

115
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:06.950
Talitha: Yes.

116
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:08.180
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

117
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.110
Talitha: Thank you.

118
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:16.289
Lilliana Robinson: Karim, are you okay? If Annie cuts in line because she needs to drop before noon. Okay, Annie, go ahead.

119
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:38.040
Annie Brown: Yay, thank you. Karim. Okay, so my objective, we have currently we have a lead for a pre seed round. But we want to bring in a technical investor to close the round because they are a social impact investor. So that's that's our objective to attract and start conversations with a

120
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.620
Annie Brown: technical investor that has experience investing in AI.

121
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.420
Annie Brown: Okay.

122
00:12:44.970 --> 00:13:12.169
Annie Brown: ozaz, a skincare brand for melon enriched skin relies on AI for product recommendations. But there's a problem existing skin tone matching algorithms simply don't work for their customers. People with darker skin tones are left disappointed by AI enabled foundation matching. Why off-the-shelf data labeling services like Amazon, mechanical Turk introduce racial bias leading to inaccurate skin tone annotations and ineffective model training.

123
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:24.230
Annie Brown: And this issue isn't limited to skin tone. Today's solutions struggle with any socially complex data, impacting recommendations across consumer products, from social media to e-commerce to generative AI.

124
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:53.060
Annie Brown: When annotations are biased, AI model recommendations miss the mark. Users spend less time on a platform and revenue drops. That's where reliable comes in. I'm Annie Brown, an AI bias researcher at Uc. San Diego and the CEO of reliable. Our data annotation software eliminates bias at the source enabling consumer tech companies like Ozaz to deliver precise recommendations that give them a competitive edge. Now let's take a look at how reliable makes this possible.

125
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.760
Lilliana Robinson: 1 0, 5.

126
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.169
Annie Brown: Okay. I gotta cut some down.

127
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:09.300
Thomas Cirone: Oh, hey? So in keeping with my Anti-curmudgeony day, I like that pitch, too.

128
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.738
Thomas Cirone: I like them all, Annie.

129
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:29.360
Thomas Cirone: I you know I would make a I'll play Nico from Speako for just a second, Liliana. Right? So just, you know, keep practicing so it doesn't feel like you're reading it, Annie, obviously right. And then I think it's really important when that one sentence where you're beyond melanin, melatonin skin color.

130
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:29.780
Annie Brown: Yeah.

131
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:45.579
Thomas Cirone: It's not just for, like like, really like I, you know, I want to inflict some of Talitha's enthusiasm into that sentence because you do you cut across any, almost anybody who, using AI for something related to consumers or to their constituents?

132
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.070
Annie Brown: Yes.

133
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:56.720
Thomas Cirone: That's the great thing about what you're doing. I think so. I don't have a lot more than that. I think I think I think I love what you're doing, and and I get it so.

134
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:06.479
Annie Brown: Yeah, yeah, no, I appreciate that. And and, Dave, I like, I like your comment to the only reason we're using those as is because they're our our 1st paying customer.

135
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.809
Thomas Cirone: Yeah, no, no, no, not. I'm not picking that apart, but just like.

136
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:10.400
Annie Brown: Yeah, yeah.

137
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.329
Thomas Cirone: When you bring it to the rest of the world. Right?

138
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:20.129
Thomas Cirone: That's like, Oh, wow! Yeah. Cause that. That's a decent market up here. But then, wow! Everybody like you're right. There's biases everywhere.

139
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:26.100
Annie Brown: Yeah, okay, bring it like, just emphasize that part of this is a big picture problem.

140
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.026
Thomas Cirone: Yes, and I apologize for the nit, but that's all I got.

141
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.669
Annie Brown: I love. I love nitpicking. I love it.

142
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:38.590
Andrea Perdomo: Annie, I just had a quick question. Did you mention in the pitch that that is a paying customer of yours?

143
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.279
Annie Brown: No, I don't mention in the pitch that that's a paying customer. So yes, I should.

144
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:43.810
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you.

145
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:57.850
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah. And the other thing is again, this is not my space. But I imagine if you're trying to get technical investors, they're gonna not know skincare brands either. So the 1st line where you mention the brand

146
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:03.659
Andrea Perdomo: I actually like stopped listening because I was trying to figure out. What did she. What brand I was like is that her company

147
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.379
Andrea Perdomo: brand? So that was confusing.

148
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.660
Annie Brown: Confusing. Yeah.

149
00:16:08.114 --> 00:16:13.975
Andrea Perdomo: And again, if I'm sitting here and I'm like, I'm technical. Your technical investors are not gonna know who the hell that is.

150
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:19.359
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, maybe need the name, like, I think the name is distracting. I think you should say

151
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:25.750
Lilliana Robinson: there's a skincare company that blah blah blah! This is our 1st paying customer, and we help them like this.

152
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:32.750
Annie Brown: Yeah, I could even start our 1st paying customer. A skincare brand for melanin. Rich skin relies on both. Does that?

153
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:42.730
Annie Brown: Yeah. That cause I was like. Wait! And then you said the brand name is reliable, and I was like, oh, that's their name, not the Skincare Company is not your name like I got a little confused.

154
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:52.059
Dave Scott: Although, Annie, I guess my challenge, though, is that as soon as you say, your customer is a cosmetics company that focuses on melanins, rich skin. I think that's your market.

155
00:16:52.480 --> 00:17:21.330
Dave Scott: and your market is way bigger than that. I remember this sitcom that I love, where they're where, basically the water fountains were all voice act. No, they were all wave activated, and all the black people couldn't drink water hilarious, but like I think there is a broader market beyond just cosmetic companies that only focus on melan and rich skin. Every company should be focused on this right, I mean, like oil of Ola should be focused on this like any any company where they have. They want a larger population than just

156
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:30.989
Dave Scott: Caucasian people. It should be. And I want you to say that I want you to say that your mission is bigger than companies that are already focused on melanin rich

157
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.220
Dave Scott: issues.

158
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:42.049
Annie Brown: Yeah, yeah, no, that's a really good point. Cause I think we don't even talk. I don't even say the word like gender bias, or like, you know, things like that in there. So

159
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.956
Annie Brown: yeah, I

160
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:54.409
Annie Brown: I was thinking about, maybe including like there's a statistic that 73% of Lgbtq content is labeled as inappropriate on the Internet. I was thinking that.

161
00:17:54.410 --> 00:18:01.839
Lilliana Robinson: Something like that. I think your opening line should. And you're gonna have to cut other stuff is something like that, like, okay, that Stat, 70%

162
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:17.829
Lilliana Robinson: and say the thing that I was in your investment deck to get into tech stars. Like all of these breastfeeding ads are flagged, and they're not able to like. Be put on Instagram, you should just say, like, Imagine a world where all of these groups are not able to be advertised to, because it just keeps

163
00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:25.590
Lilliana Robinson: having the wrong annotations. Well, our 1st paying customer did this, and we helped them with this like it. It would just paint the picture.

164
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:31.340
Annie Brown: Yeah, yeah, give it. Give. Give a few more like broad examples.

165
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:33.990
Annie Brown: Okay.

166
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:39.389
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, cause like, I, I guess, like from a brand. If I'm a paying brand, what I would want to know

167
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:45.330
Andrea Perdomo: is, or even like on the technical side, right? Like, I'm building an AI, whatever

168
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:52.849
Andrea Perdomo: I would want to know, like how working with you is gonna help me expand my customer market.

169
00:18:53.344 --> 00:18:53.589
Annie Brown: Right.

170
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.960
Andrea Perdomo: Because that's kind of what you're doing. So

171
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:12.790
Andrea Perdomo: yeah. But I I think somehow, somehow, like all the feedback has been great. But like figuring out how to mesh that together, so that we're focused more on your name, your solution, and how you all have such a broad opportunity.

172
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.860
Annie Brown: Yes, I agree.

173
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.790
Annie Brown: Okay, I will. I will work on that. That's awesome. Thank you. Guys.

174
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.230
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect. Okay, thanks, Annie. Karim.

175
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:33.289
Lilliana Robinson: Krim is calling in from Scotland because he just had his wedding this weekend. So special bonus points for you to hear.

176
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.654
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I go into London, so I'm in London.

177
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.250
Lilliana Robinson: Calling in from London.

178
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.890
Andrea Perdomo: Congratulations.

179
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.209
Lilliana Robinson: So why don't you start with your objective, Krim? Who are you trying to speak to at Demo Day.

180
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:50.438
Kirimgeray Kirimli: We? We're not necessarily looking for funding. But we want to talk to people

181
00:19:51.770 --> 00:20:03.670
Kirimgeray Kirimli: an engineering leader who resonates with the challenges or someone who's influential in the space, who shares our belief that there might be a better way to lead engineering teams or

182
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:10.000
Kirimgeray Kirimli: someone who sees a potential synergy with snapshot like these could be

183
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:18.260
Kirimgeray Kirimli: someone who works for notion or shortcut or monday.com, or or ideally, even Github who might

184
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.469
Kirimgeray Kirimli: would be interested in helping us move the product forward.

185
00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:30.670
Kirimgeray Kirimli: We're still working on our like last call to action bit to reflect what I just sent.

186
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.199
Kirimgeray Kirimli: But I can go ahead with the pitch, and then you can.

187
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.820
Kirimgeray Kirimli: We can. And then you can tell me

188
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.710
Kirimgeray Kirimli: as an engineering executive, it's your job to have full visibility across your team.

189
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:49.840
Kirimgeray Kirimli: but if you ask any executive they will admit it often feels like they're flying blind.

190
00:20:49.960 --> 00:21:00.599
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I've been there, too, having worked my way up to managing over 300 engineers. I know that with each new rolling up the ladder comes bigger decisions, but fewer answers.

191
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.979
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I've found that to be a good leader. You need both the numbers and the story behind them.

192
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:11.740
Kirimgeray Kirimli: especially when reviewing performance, reporting up or answering tough questions on the spot.

193
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.530
Kirimgeray Kirimli: It's not just about who's hitting target.

194
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:20.629
Kirimgeray Kirimli: It's about knowing who's really delivering, who needs help. And when key projects will actually get done.

195
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.359
Kirimgeray Kirimli: My name is Kurum, and that's why I build snapshot reviews.

196
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:29.199
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Unlike other tools that just serve a broad number, snapshot dives deeper.

197
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.399
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Using AI to add clarity and context.

198
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:39.710
Kirimgeray Kirimli: We pull data from Github, Jira, and stand-ups to help you make decisions faster and with confidence.

199
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:45.299
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Whether you're reviewing performance, justifying headcount or optimizing costs

200
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.670
Kirimgeray Kirimli: snapshot makes it easier to spot, what's working and what's not.

201
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:55.049
Kirimgeray Kirimli: and where to focus your time. So you can lead more effectively and keep your team moving forward.

202
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.320
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Today our ask is simple

203
00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:03.080
Kirimgeray Kirimli: snapshot reviews has been self-funded from the start, and we're fully committed to this vision.

204
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:09.079
Kirimgeray Kirimli: But growth isn't just about what we built. It's about the connections and support that can help us grow.

205
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:17.390
Kirimgeray Kirimli: If you believe in what we're doing, we'd love your help through your network or insights to take this from great to unstoppable.

206
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.120
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Thank you very much for your time.

207
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.509
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, Krim. So the pace was great.

208
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:27.060
Lilliana Robinson: That was a minute 40. So you need to cut almost half of your pitch.

209
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.200
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Yep.

210
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.500
Lilliana Robinson: So I don't know if the mentors can help talk about anything that might have been superfluous, or places he can cut.

211
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.070
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, I'm happy to go first.st I think

212
00:22:42.530 --> 00:23:09.419
Andrea Perdomo: so. I was. Gonna say, it felt a little long. So I'm glad I'm not going crazy. the 1st thing I was gonna say is, I think the intro could be a lot shorter, like. One of the things that I wrote down is I wanted. I wanted to hear about you and the company name earlier, so like that that top part. I think you could probably cut a few things out of that section. Right before you do your introduction.

213
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:15.379
Andrea Perdomo: The other thing that I wrote is, I think you're so like the 2 bookends, I think, could be shorter.

214
00:23:15.704 --> 00:23:23.649
Andrea Perdomo: The call to action at the end, like, even though you said you weren't looking for funding. It kind of sounded like you were looking for funding. I wasn't

215
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.070
Andrea Perdomo: really sure.

216
00:23:25.388 --> 00:23:34.951
Andrea Perdomo: But it seems like you could probably cut like 80% of that call to action at the end, and just say, like, Check out our demo, or something like that

217
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.089
Andrea Perdomo: versus going to the extent of

218
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:43.080
Andrea Perdomo: I forget what you said exactly, but that those 2 pieces felt a little bit long to me.

219
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.270
Kirimgeray Kirimli: That makes sense.

220
00:23:49.854 --> 00:23:56.399
Thomas Cirone: Yeah, no, that's great stuff, Andrea. I think she really sum so. The 3 things I wrote down Karim

221
00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.459
Thomas Cirone: were that you were an engineering executive yourself, would you say 200 or 300 people? You managed.

222
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:02.220
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Yeah.

223
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:07.777
Thomas Cirone: Like that that, resonated I. Just these are things that resonated with me. And then the numbers in in

224
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:14.169
Thomas Cirone: to review performance. It's the numbers in a sort of like that was a great sentence. So I got that.

225
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:23.740
Thomas Cirone: And then I think when you, when you mentioned Github and Jira. I like that because that you're talking to the engineers in the audience at that point, right? Or people of that mindset. Right?

226
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:36.360
Thomas Cirone: And so those are the things that resonated with me like that was good right there. And I think Andrew is spot on on several things, including yeah, that end part just like, hey? If you're interested in the space, come and connect with us, that's all you needed to say.

227
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:41.389
Thomas Cirone: and and that there were 2 or 3 sentences there. We could have probably cut cut that as she noted so.

228
00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.660
Thomas Cirone: But I get what you're trying to do.

229
00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:49.149
Kirimgeray Kirimli: We'll

230
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:56.770
Kirimgeray Kirimli: when I was reading it like it also felt like the end was a bit too long. But it's I think it's partially because, like.

231
00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.709
Kirimgeray Kirimli: we're unsure how to relay that message

232
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:04.669
Kirimgeray Kirimli: of like, we want people to talk to us, but we don't really want money, but.

233
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:20.730
Thomas Cirone: We'll just just say it. Hey! Come, talk to us! You like this stuff. Come, talk to us. I I don't know if it's any more difficult than that right cause I'm assuming your video is cool and your Q. And A is cool. Right? So just for this, make it a minute. Give me to watch the video. Give me to watch the Q. And a. Give me to come. Talk to you right.

234
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.270
Dave Scott: Sure. And what about this?

235
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.990
Dave Scott: If you're an engineering manager or you manage engineers.

236
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:31.010
Dave Scott: come, talk to me so we can make your life a lot easier or something like that.

237
00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:38.210
Lilliana Robinson: And just so you know this closing statement or this ask, should not be in your pitch. This should be at the end of your Q. And a.

238
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.860
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Oh!

239
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:47.850
Lilliana Robinson: That already can cut out of your pitch because you're doing pitch, and then your video, and then your QA. So you don't want to have your ask in the middle, and then, like you're still on stage for 5 more minutes.

240
00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:56.710
Lilliana Robinson: It's the last question in your Q. And A. Should be the the Eir saying, How can the audience help you? What do you? What is your ask today?

241
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.250
Kirimgeray Kirimli: All right.

242
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.769
Lilliana Robinson: But I love what you said. Go ahead, Andrea. Sorry.

243
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:07.770
Andrea Perdomo: No, I was gonna just plus one. What Dave said. I think this is your opportunity to be very direct.

244
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.870
Andrea Perdomo: and

245
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:14.260
Andrea Perdomo: the last thing you want is people talking to you that you don't want to talk to so like, just ask

246
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:18.679
Andrea Perdomo: and and be very upfront about who it is you want to have a conversation with.

247
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.110
Kirimgeray Kirimli: That makes sense.

248
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.410
Lilliana Robinson: Cool any other questions. Krim.

249
00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:27.759
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I'm good.

250
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.340
Lilliana Robinson: All right, George.

251
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:37.149
George Reed - Noetic: Alright. Thank you. So yeah, thanks, Andrea. And Tom. So my goal here

252
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:44.210
George Reed - Noetic: will be mostly to speak to potential clients. I think I'm not going to fundraise until I get to a certain revenue threshold.

253
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.349
George Reed - Noetic: So yeah, sales. And Mrr is my

254
00:26:47.620 --> 00:27:02.800
George Reed - Noetic: main. I'll start the conversations. But that's the main thing. So yep, I will start now. So some of you in the audience might remember when 2 of the world's largest consumer brands Coke and Pepsi took a bet on natural sodas, Coke life and Pepsi. True.

255
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:14.949
George Reed - Noetic: Well, there's a reason why most of us don't remember, and both were 100 million dollars failures. And how about Hollywood's short form streaming service quibi, which imploded in its 1st month after burning through nearly 2 billion dollars of funding

256
00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:20.590
George Reed - Noetic: with an easy way to understand the consumers at every decision point these mistakes could have been avoided.

257
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:33.269
George Reed - Noetic: I'm George, founder of Noetic, and for consumer insight teams who need fast and accurate research, we enable constant collaboration with their market by reflecting consumers, own insights back to them through iterated conversation.

258
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.759
George Reed - Noetic: before the product launches before millions are invested, and before career-ending mistakes are made.

259
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:48.319
George Reed - Noetic: imagine if Coke had a super low friction way to know their natural soda would be rejected, or if Quibi had understood that viewers don't want short form, Hollywood, content.

260
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:54.620
George Reed - Noetic: Nobody could have saved them from career ending failure without democratized consumer directed research. Let me show you how it works.

261
00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.260
Lilliana Robinson: All right. That was 1 0, 2.

262
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.670
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, yeah, go to try and.

263
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.949
Lilliana Robinson: No, that's fine can be.

264
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.500
George Reed - Noetic: Just.

265
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.220
Thomas Cirone: I passed to Andrea on this one. Andrew, can you start us out? Please?

266
00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.020
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, of course, I was like, I thought we were naturally switching. But I can.

267
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.340
Thomas Cirone: No, I you had a look in your eye, and I didn't have that look. So you go.

268
00:28:21.044 --> 00:28:31.759
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah. Okay. So, George, I think, like, there are a few things that I want to call out that actually went really? Well. So one of them is the intro like the

269
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:40.100
Andrea Perdomo: I think the the question that I was gonna ask right was like, Well, how much is this saving companies, and you answered that in.

270
00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:40.520
George Reed - Noetic: The first.st

271
00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:52.910
Andrea Perdomo: 3 seconds, which was really valuable. 1 point of feedback is maybe just enunciating the name of the company a little bit better in your name because you kinda like read through that pretty quickly.

272
00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:53.270
George Reed - Noetic: Oh, yeah.

273
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.410
Andrea Perdomo: But overall, I actually thought it was pretty strong.

274
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.910
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah.

275
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.150
George Reed - Noetic: Thanks. Ajay.

276
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.050
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah.

277
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.484
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, I think one thing that Neil said was,

278
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:30.319
George Reed - Noetic: Are you sure that you know Coca-cola and Pepsi and these like big examples? Can you really help them, you know, like that was 1 1 objection he had. So I'll address that in the Q&A, but basically, this is trying to fill the gaps. So like, it's meant to be a continuous conversation. So they're still doing their big, expensive research projects. But this is improving those and reducing risk at every decision point. So when

279
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:37.999
George Reed - Noetic: when the survey is too big to do it like you don't need one, or you can't justify a big project for a small decision. You can use this all the time.

280
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:44.220
George Reed - Noetic: So that's how it could mitigate the risk of those big failures. Essentially, yeah. And I think, yeah.

281
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.999
Andrea Perdomo: Do you have the words like mitigate risk in your pitch? Did I, miss.

282
00:29:48.000 --> 00:30:00.839
George Reed - Noetic: No. But in the Q. And A, I'm gonna address that point because I know people be skeptical. I'm kind of like, okay with that, though making people skeptical. So they go. Who are you to say, like, you know? Talk about 2 billion dollar failures and stuff?

283
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:01.410
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah?

284
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.140
George Reed - Noetic: And like, use that as maybe

285
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.830
George Reed - Noetic: a hook, and then the demo, and then in the Q&A address like

286
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:16.289
George Reed - Noetic: well, actually, on Friday I have a meeting with the Insight Director of Coca-cola, Japan. So like, because he's interested in this idea, my one of my clients introduced it

287
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.060
George Reed - Noetic: to that guy cause they're.

288
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:25.270
Andrea Perdomo: Even even actually hearing you say that maybe if there is an opportunity to add that language into the pitch, like we

289
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.820
Andrea Perdomo: mitigating risk.

290
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.419
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

291
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:36.030
Andrea Perdomo: Because that is like, obviously like, I got the idea. But that is actually a question that popped into my head, which I'm glad you're gonna be addressing, which is.

292
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:46.649
Andrea Perdomo: you know, it's kind of like gambling like it may or may not work like you still might be dealing with like a myspace. It's just now I'm laughing because natural sodas are in

293
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:59.170
George Reed - Noetic: Oh, yeah, the way that yeah. The way do you know the way they did it? They mixed Stevia with normal sugar, Coke when they already had diet Coke, and it's in a green can. And it was like, you know, super weird.

294
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:07.020
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, but my head did go there. I was like, Oh, wait natural sodas. And now so maybe addressing to like how the timing of

295
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.390
Andrea Perdomo: the constant consumer feedback will help them.

296
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.100
George Reed - Noetic: Submitting.

297
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.020
Andrea Perdomo: Gate risks.

298
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:13.470
Andrea Perdomo: I don't know.

299
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.910
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, thank you. Yeah, I like that. Thank you.

300
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:32.970
Thomas Cirone: No, I echo that, Andrea. I think it like emphatic, if I may, George, be emphatic about that, because you had me on the problem, although I don't know much about the Coke Pepsi natural thing. But you got me with quibi like quibi still bothers me today, and I didn't even work that right? I'm like, God, what the hell were you guys doing

301
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:41.660
Thomas Cirone: right, Dave, too. So so you you had us on the problem, I think right? And I just wanted you to be emphatic about like, here's what we're doing. Like, we're we're mitigating this.

302
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.299
Thomas Cirone: You know what I mean. That's all other than that.

303
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:50.730
Thomas Cirone: you know, I'm gonna want to see that video. I'm gonna want to listen to your Q. And a. I thought I thought your pitch was

304
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.439
Thomas Cirone: was good in that regard.

305
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.130
George Reed - Noetic: Awesome. Thank you. Thanks. Guys, appreciate it.

306
00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.579
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect. Thanks, George. Okay, Nick, from tutor me.

307
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:16.339
Nicholas Li: Cool. Thank you. Guys. Yeah, our objective is like George and Talitha, we're not trying to raise. We're just trying to get introduction to potential like long term partnerships, which are in our case educators. Specifically, IP schools, in the area.

308
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:35.060
Nicholas Li: Most American high school students get accepted to college, and immediately they can enjoy senior riders, however, for international baccalaureate students worldwide, who dream of attending university in countries outside of North America. Getting accepted is only the 1st step. One failed. Exam, and your conditional offer is revoked.

309
00:32:35.590 --> 00:33:04.190
Nicholas Li: Growing up in Hong Kong. I lived this pressure my Imperial college London offer dreamed hinged entirely on passing a grueling set of exams like thousands of Ib students, I had tutors, but they couldn't be there at 11 Pm. When I was stuck on a practice problem questioning if I was good enough. I'm Nick and I built Tutorme for students who struggle the same way I did. Tutorme is a platform designed to work alongside educators. We give Ib students immediate feedback guided learning plans any time of the day.

310
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:20.859
Nicholas Li: We're not replacing traditional tutoring. We're filling the gap between tutoring and schools. When students feel most vulnerable and alone. Students no longer have to scour the Internet for pirated practice exams watch the same Youtube videos for hours on end or peer review each other's papers. Instead, they use Tutorme.

311
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.740
Lilliana Robinson: That was 1 0, 3, so perfectly fine!

312
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.460
Nicholas Li: Okay.

313
00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.780
Thomas Cirone: Okay, I'll go first, st Andrew. I'll take you off the hook on that one.

314
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.968
Thomas Cirone: you know, Nicholas, so admittedly, I don't. I don't know that market really? Well, right?

315
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:45.310
Thomas Cirone: you know. And I I'm curious. So I'm curious, Liliana, keep me. Keep me honest on this one. Do you want to, or can you? Or should you?

316
00:33:45.500 --> 00:34:01.260
Thomas Cirone: Aside from okay, you you fail one exam. You're out. You don't get into one B school. So what's your life like, if you don't get into that school like you like, you're like, I want to go to an international business school and study business, and if I don't get in. I'm washing dishes at my dad's restaurant like I I guess I I guess.

317
00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.610
Lilliana Robinson: It's fully through.

318
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:14.649
Thomas Cirone: Yeah, I I understand what you're doing. And I remember, you know, and and I think it's great, right. And it's a market. I don't know, so I want a little bit of an apology there. But so, Liliana, keep me honest. There like is is that had? Does that have a place, maybe in the.

319
00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:34.399
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I agree. I've been trying to push tutor mean to be a lot more emotionally compelling, because that's really like the play here. It's 1 of our only here in this group, and I think that makes it even stronger. It doesn't have to be exactly what Tom, said Nick. But basically like, what is their goal if their goal was to become a doctor and they don't get into the their

320
00:34:34.559 --> 00:34:40.219
Lilliana Robinson: dream undergraduate school like, what does that mean for their life. They're not going to be able to achieve their dreams.

321
00:34:40.649 --> 00:34:43.219
Lilliana Robinson: Tell us that. Make us feel that heartache.

322
00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.880
Nicholas Li: Cause. I'm already at time, so I'm like trying to figure out what I can. You know.

323
00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:50.428
Dave Scott: So this is a this is our dumb idea. But like

324
00:34:51.029 --> 00:34:52.489
Dave Scott: What if like?

325
00:34:52.709 --> 00:35:04.789
Dave Scott: What if you tied it to suicide rates? And and so hear me out. I was just talking to a university, my university, and they were talking about how suicide rates are higher than ever, and just the stress of getting in is an issue.

326
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:09.959
Dave Scott: I'm wondering what I mean. I'm wondering if that stat matters only because

327
00:35:10.339 --> 00:35:12.989
Dave Scott: what what's the downside of not getting in.

328
00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:16.689
Dave Scott: They go get a job and reapply next year right? Like, I mean, is there?

329
00:35:17.158 --> 00:35:27.679
Dave Scott: You know, they're not really washing dishes. Probably if they're already paying us a tutor for 300 bucks an hour. Obviously their parents are pretty well off, so like, I just wonder.

330
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.070
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I don't.

331
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.959
Lilliana Robinson: They can't just. They can't just apply the next year, Dave, that's.

332
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.920
Dave Scott: Yeah, to take.

333
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.840
Nicholas Li: No, you fail your offer. You go to your safety school.

334
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.489
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. And that's what happens in the Us. Too. Very few people.

335
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.820
Dave Scott: No people do it all the time. They take a gap year, and they reapply.

336
00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.759
Lilliana Robinson: Most people just take the second choice they got into, and and call it a day. I would say.

337
00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.539
Thomas Cirone: Ran up in commute.

338
00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.859
Dave Scott: But but their life doesn't end then. Okay, so instead of going.

339
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.200
Lilliana Robinson: So that's what Tom's saying.

340
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.670
Dave Scott: To northeastern.

341
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:59.600
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly. I agree with you, Dave. So like, that's why it's hard here, right? Because

342
00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:23.600
Lilliana Robinson: I think it being the international population I create completely agree with you, Dave. It being the international population has a separate set of it's clearly a set of circumstances that we don't understand as much in America, where, like a lot more, is riding on it, maybe their whole family is counting on them. Whatever it is like. Help us understand cause. Dave and Tom have great points. They're hearing your pitch, and they're saying like, What's the big deal?

343
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:26.720
Lilliana Robinson: But I want Andre to have a chance to also weigh in.

344
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:30.009
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, I have a. I have a lot of thoughts.

345
00:36:30.892 --> 00:36:48.340
Andrea Perdomo: Like, maybe we can go offline one. I'm married to a teacher. So I know a lot about the education space. And he works a lot with 1st generation college students, and international students. So I have kind of like that in my head right now. My.

346
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:58.470
Andrea Perdomo: I I like. I think I agree with everything. One of the things that I wanted to just be super clear on Nick. Is this a product just for international students.

347
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.219
Nicholas Li: International baccalaureate students.

348
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.040
Andrea Perdomo: Very specific.

349
00:37:03.486 --> 00:37:06.900
Andrea Perdomo: Who do you think is the paying customer.

350
00:37:08.353 --> 00:37:16.490
Nicholas Li: Initially be the student, which is just a parent, since they're like 16 to 18 year olds. But eventually we're thinking about like

351
00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.490
Nicholas Li: b 2 b. Via schools.

352
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.729
Nicholas Li: But right now be the parent.

353
00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.960
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, I think it's the parents.

354
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:42.140
Andrea Perdomo: yeah, I'm just. I'm just wondering, I think again, like making like Liliana, like the story

355
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:46.259
Andrea Perdomo: you have to pull on people's heartstrings a little bit.

356
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.325
Nicholas Li: Okay.

357
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:53.040
Andrea Perdomo: Back in my days at Texters. That's what we did very well twice.

358
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:58.560
Andrea Perdomo: I'm so happy to to help there, but like you're.

359
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.040
Nicholas Li: This offline.

360
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.950
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, yeah, I think so. Like your story is, is

361
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:13.889
Andrea Perdomo: is what should be leading the pitch. And even, I think because you can speak for yourself, being able to say something along the lines of like if I had not done Xyz like this is what.

362
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:14.400
Lilliana Robinson: But.

363
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:20.010
Andrea Perdomo: Could have happened. And that's why I am not only the right person to build this, but

364
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:26.770
Andrea Perdomo: this is why this is such a specific product use case and like customer.

365
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:47.880
Lilliana Robinson: Nick, you can reach out to Andre. Her email is in the calendar. Invite for this call. Dave and Scott are not. That's your last name, Dave and Tom. What I will say is something. I told Nick, and you might have heard this in a different session, but something that's so different about the International Baccalaureate program is how

366
00:38:49.250 --> 00:39:18.840
Lilliana Robinson: passionate people are about it, changing their lives. So like someone on the Investment Committee. For when we were putting tutor me through. So all of the companies here went through investment committee with, like David Cohen and Brad Feld, and, like all the big names at techstars, and one of the people on the panel said I would not be where I am today without the Ib program, and then he became the biggest cheerleader for tutor me to get through the investment committee to get into this program. So that's something I've shared, because, like, I think that's a really big sentiment that people feel.

367
00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:27.070
Dave Scott: So like, what's the what's the why, though, Liliana? Because I like where that takes me is like, maybe it's like a situation where it's a 1st time

368
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:43.389
Dave Scott: like like in in the United States. It's very, very big. If your 1st time going to college right in the African American community, the entire community surrounds the person who gets to college 1st and gets through that process. That's emotional for me. I get that. So is there something like that

369
00:39:43.390 --> 00:40:04.210
Dave Scott: that they could use to be able to say like this is a big deal, because, yes, the whole family is riding on it. The pride of the family, the reputation of the family. Also in other cultures. Maybe they maybe parents get taken care of their kids, not in America. But then maybe it's the investment that the parents go into. I'm just wondering if there's something that they could tap into, that we would relate to. Sorry for interrupting.

370
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:17.689
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, no, I wouldn't know, because I'm just saying what happened in the investment committee. I've only I've only done this process here. But, Nick, this is all for you. You don't have to answer now, because we're actually kind of out of time. But these are all just thoughts for you.

371
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.920
Nicholas Li: Will do. Thank you so much. Harvard.

372
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:27.850
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, so think about it. We'll talk to you guys. I think, on Friday. So try and like, marinate on that and have a new version, for when we talk to you again.

373
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.800
Lilliana Robinson: okay, near it.

374
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:36.369
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, wait! You're on a customer call. We'll come back to you, Dominique.

375
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:56.800
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Cool. Hi, everyone! Thank you. Andrea and Tom, for giving us your time. Really appreciate it. So I'm Dominique, co-founder, CEO of looney. 8. Our objective for Demo day is to really focus on growth and customers. So we pivoted during techstars

376
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:23.579
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: we've now launched. We've seen really great growth since then. So really, in my pitch, I want to show that I'm an expert. I spent my career in finance. So I want to have that authority and also tease a little bit to to create that excitement which will then shift to the video, which will show people how it's done, like the actual product, demo. And then QA. Will talk much more about the pivot and why? It's a pain point and a problem that needs addressing.

377
00:41:25.118 --> 00:41:29.149
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Okie Dokie, let me jump in.

378
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:33.140
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Okay.

379
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:42.719
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: we're currently in the greatest wealth transfer of all time. Millennials are set to inherit 90 trillion dollars in the Us. Alone.

380
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:50.930
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: with 8 out of 10 millennials seeking professional financial advice online. This presents a massive opportunity for wealth managers.

381
00:41:50.950 --> 00:42:03.470
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: but over 50% of financial firms are archaic. They're held back by outdated systems and lengthy compliance processes. This makes it really difficult for marketing teams to effectively reach this audience

382
00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:13.280
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: as the former global head of digital marketing at the world's largest wealth manager. Ubs, I saw this problem firsthand, and it cost the firm millions of dollars.

383
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:25.570
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: That's why we've built looneyate an AI powered platform that automates the creation and distribution of compliant sentiment. Driven content. This helps financial marketing leaders reach the millennial investor.

384
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:37.540
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: I'm Dominique, CEO and co-founder of looneyate. We hit 5 K Mrr. Only 2 weeks after launching. Let me show you how we're helping financial firms capture their share of the 90 trillion dollars. Wealth transfer.

385
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.690
Lilliana Robinson: 59 seconds.

386
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.869
Thomas Cirone: Am I first, st Andrea? Did you want go for it?

387
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:55.144
Thomas Cirone: I don't have a lot. I got a lot of love for Dominique. I think it's a good pitch.

388
00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:01.470
Thomas Cirone: I think you're a chief of your executive. I I do so I

389
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:07.954
Thomas Cirone: I and I think you can do more than just so. That's a huge market, by the way, and I'm I've been reading a lot about that market.

390
00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.075
Thomas Cirone: and

391
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:23.409
Thomas Cirone: and I think you probably have a bigger market than just millennials. But it's a great market to attack right away. So I'm okay with all that, right? Because I thought at the end. Maybe you didn't have to say millennials at the end. You could just like, you know, if you're

392
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:42.800
Thomas Cirone: if you're trying to attract people, you know, if you're trying to expand like, because because you're pitching to people that are trying to expand their wealth management practice, whether they're maybe an Ria or even a bigger institution, right? And they're probably thinking bigger than millennials. But there certainly is that mass opportunity. So I like it all. I'm going to leave Andrea to pick you apart a bit on this one, so I got

393
00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:43.910
Thomas Cirone: give you a hug.

394
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.294
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Thank you. Look back.

395
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.330
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Yeah.

396
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.270
Andrea Perdomo: I'm not gonna pick you apart. I don't mind.

397
00:43:54.117 --> 00:43:57.380
Andrea Perdomo: No, I think I was just I I

398
00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:05.360
Andrea Perdomo: so there were 2 things that I wanted to call out. I don't know how I feel about it, so I'll just say that one is.

399
00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.229
Andrea Perdomo: I was what I was left wondering if

400
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:18.329
Andrea Perdomo: you are building a product for, like small wealth management or larger institutions, because ubs is huge.

401
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:26.189
Andrea Perdomo: So my guess is that they're not your customer unless I'm wrong. Like? Is it like? Which? Who? Who is it?

402
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.180
Andrea Perdomo: Or is it everybody.

403
00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:47.040
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: No, it's a it's a great question. So I think Ubs ultimately would be where we strive to be. But to begin with, we would start small. So currently, we have a Fintech. We also have a regional bank as a customer. So the idea is that we can get more and more case studies and and build into it.

404
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:56.639
Andrea Perdomo: Okay, knowing that. Now, I I do wonder if if your goal again is to kind of do growth and customers, and maybe look to like

405
00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.079
Andrea Perdomo: folks in the room. My guess is, folks in the room who have

406
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:07.770
Andrea Perdomo: someone that they are currently using to manage their wealth and or our wealth managers themselves.

407
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:18.790
Andrea Perdomo: I think, using the example that, like you have, the experience of working at ubs is obviously really powerful. So don't remove that, but maybe add something along the lines of like.

408
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:30.569
Andrea Perdomo: We are empowering smaller to mid-sized wealth managers to be able to access this market quicker or something along those lines, if that truly is where you're starting

409
00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:36.399
Andrea Perdomo: and then the only other. Again, I can't decide if this is just me being

410
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:42.759
Andrea Perdomo: me, or if other people agree, but like the 5 K Mrr. Isn't like a huge number.

411
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.790
Andrea Perdomo: So I don't know. And I know you said like, within the 1st 2 weeks.

412
00:45:47.121 --> 00:45:52.250
Andrea Perdomo: but I'm just wondering if that is more valuable to keep or take out. I don't really.

413
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.680
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: I'm 20.

414
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.649
Andrea Perdomo: On that one.

415
00:45:53.960 --> 00:46:16.019
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: So that it's good feedback. I think the demo day we're tracking 15 K. That's like a live Stat from 2 weeks ago. So if we reach our goal, then I'd like to include it and increase it, just to show we're growing week on week. But I think you're right. If we're still only at 5 K. Perhaps in the QAI can address it like, what do you think.

416
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:17.850
Andrea Perdomo: About that.

417
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:32.469
Andrea Perdomo: I'm just wondering if it doesn't like. I don't know, Liliana, what you think, but like if it if if the number doesn't land above 10 to 15 K Mrr. I think leaving it out might do less harm than leaving it in.

418
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:40.809
Lilliana Robinson: If you're really proud of it, you can mention it offhandedly in the Q. And a. But since the I would say like word economy of the pitch is so

419
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:48.409
Lilliana Robinson: like, so strict. Every single word that you say here is going to really resonate with people, and people might be like pondering on it.

420
00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:52.080
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: So to put. Yeah, Tom, did you want to say something.

421
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:58.379
Thomas Cirone: Hey, just Dominic, just really quick. I'm going back to Andrea's 1st point, which I think is really good.

422
00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:05.809
Thomas Cirone: my understanding of your platform. And so I may maybe made a wrong assumption was that as a platform, you could

423
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:36.449
Thomas Cirone: basically like anyone of any size could use your platform like, I don't know. So you essentially can follow the money right so, and I don't know if that's worth saying in the pitch, or worth saying it all in the evening, but I felt like what I knew about you, and so so correct me if I'm wrong, was that the platform could be could be used by Ubs tomorrow, in theory, or could be used by an ria out of San Francisco who's got 20 customers and manages big wealth. Kind of thing am I did. I misunderstand you guys, and I'm going back earlier in the accelerator.

424
00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.669
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: No, you're correct. You're correct. I just.

425
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:45.980
Thomas Cirone: Is that something that should be worked into? I don't. So I'll leave that up to you and Leon and and other smart and Andrea, other smarter people than me.

426
00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:49.970
Thomas Cirone: If you feel the need to sort of say, like, like we can help

427
00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:57.019
Thomas Cirone: anybody of any size with the platform, and I don't know if that's worth saying or not, that's all my thought. It was just a thought. Sorry.

428
00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:10.560
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: No, it's helpful, I think the other. The only reason we're starting small is the sales. Cycles are much faster. So we're just trying to get runs on the board, but we're already speaking with larger financial. I think it's a good point.

429
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:15.100
Thomas Cirone: I mean, if Jamie Diamond shows up like you want him to come and get you and say, Oh, wow! She's not.

430
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:15.750
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Absolutely.

431
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.390
Thomas Cirone: We were looking at that. But now I can look at you guys.

432
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.956
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Yeah, we won't make fun.

433
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:25.830
Lilliana Robinson: You need to write down this question, Dominique, because what you just said as an answer should be in your QA.

434
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:26.200
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Okay.

435
00:48:26.469 --> 00:48:46.929
Lilliana Robinson: Tom's clearly wondering that after hearing your pitch, the Eir should ask you. And you say, Yeah, we're starting with these smaller ones, and that's where you can say, like, we just made 5 Kmr. In 2 weeks. The sales cycles are really fast. We're hoping to speed that up. But we are also talking to big firms like ubs, like, here's the the big vision that needs to be one of your 1st few questions.

436
00:48:46.930 --> 00:49:00.609
Lilliana Robinson: because that's what people are wondering right after. So I do agree with Andrea. Leave that out. I do think your personality isn't coming through very much in your delivery of this pitch. It's probably because you don't have it memorized yet. So you're not actually focusing on how you're delivering it.

437
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:20.129
Lilliana Robinson: But your personality is infectious, and I want that to come through. I don't want it to just be this like monotone. Oh, I'm in finance, and here is my business. People aren't going to listen like we need who you are to shine. So people are interested. So Fabio suggested more pauses. I would suggest more intonation, and that can be next week.

438
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.220
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Cheers.

439
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.589
Lilliana Robinson: Finalizing it. But just keep that in mind.

440
00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.249
Dominique Harrison-Bentzen: Yeah, perfect. Thank you. I really appreciate the feedback.

441
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:29.829
Lilliana Robinson: Did you have anything else, Andrea?

442
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.500
Andrea Perdomo: Very good.

443
00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.389
Andrea Perdomo: No, I think that's good.

444
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.600
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect. Okay, nurit, are you back yet?

445
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.820
Lilliana Robinson: You just let us know when you're back. He had a fire come up with a customer, so

446
00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.100
Lilliana Robinson: he'll come back at some point. Fabio.

447
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:52.939
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, cool. So the goal for my pitch is to get the audience excited about the problem.

448
00:49:53.630 --> 00:50:16.760
Fabio Caironi: Introduce the threat of the difficult access to computing power and outline our solution and vision. So really like, tell a quick story that gets them excited. With the video will leave the audience confident that we can solve the problem so they will feel like we are the right team, and and we have the right vision to tackle this challenge.

449
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:23.870
Fabio Caironi: and then the Qa. Q. And a will address the competitive advantage in more detail

450
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:31.609
Fabio Caironi: and common concerns about Icp go to market strategy and security, and also we'll announce our fundraising round.

451
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.870
Lilliana Robinson: It's a wide variety of objectives, so we'll see if we can cover it up.

452
00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:42.470
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, I'm trying to fit everything in one bin.

453
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:46.879
Lilliana Robinson: We might need to narrow that or target certain sections to different people.

454
00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.179
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, let's hear it.

455
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:57.939
Fabio Caironi: In the past 2 years AI has revolutionized industries with innovation spannings from creative tools to operational efficiency.

456
00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:02.249
Fabio Caironi: But all these applications are bound to one thing, computing power.

457
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:10.655
Fabio Caironi: even provided that you find a good deal in the cloud. Managing competing resources for your AI or data applications is still technically

458
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:15.319
Fabio Caironi: is still a technical hurdle, leaving 70% of startups struggling.

459
00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:21.209
Fabio Caironi: By the time they reach a stable solution they will have spent excessive time, energy, and money in the process.

460
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:34.629
Fabio Caironi: That's why I founded byte night we provide a serverless platform that simplifies access to application containers, so that each company that wants to utilize cpus and gpus at scale doesn't have to hire expert devops

461
00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.809
Fabio Caironi: or go through the pain of setting that up on their own

462
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:48.249
Fabio Caironi: using. Bytene allows them to get from 0 to functional in just a few minutes, and to use the power of distributed computing, whether you're a team of 50 or one person.

463
00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:58.760
Fabio Caironi: we are targeting, targeting a 350 billion market aiming to become the leading serverless Cloud provider within 5 years. Let me show you how we help companies succeed with by night.

464
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:07.960
Lilliana Robinson: 108, and Dave said the same thing. I said last time you didn't cut in the past 2 years. Remember, I told you that in Troy's pitch practice.

465
00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.379
Fabio Caironi: Well, I did cut it.

466
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.380
Lilliana Robinson: Did you not just say it?

467
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:19.400
Fabio Caironi: No, no, I just said, that's why I founded Byte night.

468
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.500
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, okay.

469
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.580
Dave Scott: Beginning in the first.st

470
00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.479
George Reed - Noetic: The first, st the first, st the first.st

471
00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:23.850
George Reed - Noetic: It's.

472
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:27.909
Fabio Caironi: Oh, well, oh, that's a different 2 years.

473
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:28.600
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, yeah.

474
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:35.829
Dave Scott: It's it's still, it's still. It's still happening. So 2 years, 3 years, 0 years doesn't matter. It's still happening.

475
00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:39.910
Fabio Caironi: I thought you were referring to different one.

476
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:41.680
Lilliana Robinson: No, you're right. I was wrong.

477
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:44.679
Lilliana Robinson: They're talking about something different. Okay.

478
00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.900
Lilliana Robinson: so cut that. Let's go to our mentors.

479
00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:52.730
Lilliana Robinson: Andrea.

480
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:59.811
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah. Hi, Hi, Fabio, it's good to see you again.

481
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:07.900
Andrea Perdomo: Where was my head at? Is what I was trying to think about. Oh, I, okay. So I think

482
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:10.939
Andrea Perdomo: I understand the problem.

483
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.110
Andrea Perdomo: So like you said, if

484
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:28.089
Andrea Perdomo: the problem excitement like I get it, maybe it's because I'm working in cloud. So I officially understand. I do think, though, like the part that is still a little bit unclear for me is the how

485
00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:43.600
Andrea Perdomo: like. I don't know if that's something you're gonna address potentially in the Q&A. But like, how are you different to other like serverless cloud providers? Is something that's really interesting to me. And then I just had a

486
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:51.279
Andrea Perdomo: tactical question around where that 70% of startups number comes from and like

487
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:57.340
Andrea Perdomo: from a financial standpoint like, what's the burden that those startups are facing.

488
00:53:59.093 --> 00:54:06.789
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, 70% comes from the estimated percentage of users of serverless solutions. So

489
00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:13.089
Fabio Caironi: already those startups are struggling. So they're looking for alternatives that

490
00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:19.650
Fabio Caironi: abstract the infrastructure layer and and help them spin up their applications faster.

491
00:54:21.025 --> 00:54:24.672
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, from the financial standpoint.

492
00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:36.770
Fabio Caironi: so I I don't know what your question was. No sorry for regarding the how we solve that. It's gonna be addressed with more detail in the video.

493
00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.989
Fabio Caironi: The reason why is that there's so much to share about this pace.

494
00:54:42.336 --> 00:55:00.403
Fabio Caironi: Literally, like there's a list of 15 different types of workloads that can be served by the cloud, and like it would take me like 30Â min to walk you through all of them, and explain what what bite night can serve and what Bytene can serve so I decided to put it all in a video

495
00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:06.589
Fabio Caironi: like a quick visual explanation of what we can do and how we do that differently.

496
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:14.670
Andrea Perdomo: Okay, yeah, I think that I think that that piece will help. I'm just trying to figure out like, if your customers are startups right like, how

497
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:23.619
Andrea Perdomo: what's what is the financial relief that they're gonna get by working with you versus like other.

498
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:27.720
Fabio Caironi: Yeah. So it's funny because I cut that part because.

499
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.500
Andrea Perdomo: Okay.

500
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:41.379
Fabio Caironi: I I didn't. It didn't fit, and and Neil told me to like touch upon the vision. But the part that I cut was, we make it half of half as expensive as

501
00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.080
Fabio Caironi: Aws and Google Cloud.

502
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:49.489
Fabio Caironi: So that was the financial advantage.

503
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:52.630
Dave Scott: Sounds pretty important

504
00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:59.189
Dave Scott: as an ex Aws executive employee.

505
00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.909
Thomas Cirone: Hey, Andrea? Can I have a thought here.

506
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:02.620
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, please.

507
00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:06.430
Thomas Cirone: It's gonna take me a minute to get out. So Liliana cut me off. If I'm talking too much here.

508
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.970
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

509
00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:13.729
Thomas Cirone: Seriously. So 70% of startups, Fabio, how many startups is that like

510
00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:24.190
Thomas Cirone: I used to have some stats on? How many startups, or how many people went through accelerators, or how many just startups, or how many new businesses were started in North America. Right? And it's a lot it's like.

511
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:29.930
Thomas Cirone: and and I forget. So I apologize. I forget the numbers, 10,000 or 50,000, something like right and

512
00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:34.860
Thomas Cirone: they and they all fail for various reasons, unfortunately, right?

513
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:38.299
Thomas Cirone: And you don't want them to fail because they don't have good cloud resources. Correct.

514
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:44.399
Thomas Cirone: And and so I'm trying to figure out like, what does that? How like if you want the audience excited about that? And you're gonna have a broad

515
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:47.800
Thomas Cirone: people there, and maybe some cloud experts and non-cloud experts I don't know.

516
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.920
Thomas Cirone: and if I want them excited, I want to try, and maybe

517
00:56:52.590 --> 00:57:01.210
Thomas Cirone: again keep me honest here. Everybody else like like just more more numbers or more like like they're not gonna because of us. They're not gonna fill because of this.

518
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:17.359
Thomas Cirone: right? Like, we can't control their market. But like you could, but you can help them with their cloud resources in a cost efficient way. Some of them go out of business because they spend too much money on infrastructure right away, right? And and I don't know how to say that I don't know if it's worth saying. So. That's that was my only thought like

519
00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.990
Thomas Cirone: to excite the audience. I didn't know if there was

520
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:26.150
Thomas Cirone: a a different way of saying that, or a different way of driving that home.

521
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:42.320
Fabio Caironi: Absolutely. I keep that in mind. Maybe I should be more on point. And yeah, because I say they are struggling, and then I say they will spend more time and money and energy in the process. But I don't see why. Maybe the the connection is not clear.

522
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:43.463
Fabio Caironi: I could.

523
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.040
Fabio Caironi: Yeah.

524
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.180
Thomas Cirone: Oh, no! So I'll defer to the smarter folks on. Why.

525
00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.530
Fabio Caironi: That's a good point.

526
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:54.150
Lilliana Robinson: I think we're gonna have to move on. Did you wanna do any final points, Andrea.

527
00:57:54.680 --> 00:58:01.779
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, I was. I think I was just curious. Like, if you're gonna announce your fundraising round during the Q. And A, why.

528
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:07.630
Andrea Perdomo: your that's not your focus for the the 1Â min.

529
00:58:09.079 --> 00:58:12.831
Fabio Caironi: So my goal is to both to find

530
00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:26.626
Fabio Caironi: potential customers and and potential investors. And there is there is a common trait here. I want my investors to be technical. So it's sort of like a filter if they don't get this

531
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:27.990
Andrea Perdomo: That's fair.

532
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:33.830
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, they should be already a little familiar with the problem. So I can just trigger them.

533
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:36.849
Andrea Perdomo: Okay, no, that's fair. I just wanted to get that clear.

534
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:38.899
Fabio Caironi: Anna, thanks for that. Thank you so much. Guys.

535
00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:48.140
Lilliana Robinson: Thanks, Fabia, all right, mentors. Just so. You know we have 3 left. I think we'll be able to get through them all. But I will keep an eye on time, Dave, you're next.

536
00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.059
Dave Scott: In a world where. No, I'm joking.

537
00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:55.861
Dave Scott: Hey, guys, Thomas got that joke?

538
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.530
Dave Scott: So

539
00:58:58.817 --> 00:59:08.030
Dave Scott: I'm trying to. I am trying to raise money. And the 1Â min script is really dedicated towards trying to figure out, just trying to give everyone a framing

540
00:59:08.396 --> 00:59:12.269
Dave Scott: and then the 1Â min script. The 1Â min video is a customer journey.

541
00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:15.589
Dave Scott: and then my Q&A. Goes into business model and stuff like that.

542
00:59:16.624 --> 00:59:22.929
Dave Scott: Alright, I just overall my, my script. So I'm curious to get everyone's thoughts, because this is newish for people, you ready

543
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:27.170
Dave Scott: alright, thanks to shows like stranger things.

544
00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:32.260
Dave Scott: tabletop role-playing games, like dungeons and dragons, are as popular as ever.

545
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:39.390
Dave Scott: Over a hundred 50 million gamers come together with friends and family every week to throw dice.

546
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:50.860
Dave Scott: But then Covid prevented the way prevented people from getting together in person and permanently disrupted the way this 50 year old game was being played.

547
00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:58.299
Dave Scott: This amplified the loneliness epidemic that so many people experienced during the pandemic.

548
00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:07.270
Dave Scott: I'm Dave Scott, founder of evil genius games. We're here to restore those social relationships and cure the loneliness.

549
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:18.360
Dave Scott: We make it easy to recreate the physical game experience on the computer, allowing friends to play, no matter where they are.

550
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:22.730
Dave Scott: We're ushering in the future of tabletop games.

551
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:31.759
Dave Scott: Today we have over 35,000 customers in our community, and we're on a path to hit 2 million dollars of sales in 2024,

552
01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:38.510
Dave Scott: we have created the perfect solution to make stranger things feel more familiar than ever.

553
01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:47.250
Lilliana Robinson: That was 1 13. I loved your pace. So you're gonna need to just cut like one sentence to get it down to like 1 0, 5.

554
01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:50.899
Dave Scott: Yeah, thank, you.

555
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:59.269
Thomas Cirone: In the interest of time. I'm just going to give Dave a cyber hug and and throw it over to Andrea.

556
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:11.460
Andrea Perdomo: Dave, it's so good to see you again. I have to say like since the last time I saw you at Sf. Tech week to. Now I understand your product significantly more in that pitch.

557
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:23.912
Andrea Perdomo: So that is much better. I am left with less questions and more excitement about how to get my family to play, so I think that is a really positive

558
01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:30.419
Andrea Perdomo: I agree with Liliana. The pace was wonderful, so just cutting something out might be

559
01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:41.799
Andrea Perdomo: good, and then being able to see the customer journey, I think, is gonna be really key because those are still the questions that I get which is like, how in the world does this work?

560
01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:49.020
Andrea Perdomo: So, being able to see it, I think, will kind of help that. And then I really loved that you added some of those numbers around

561
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.140
Andrea Perdomo: where you're at to date with customers as well as sales.

562
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.130
Andrea Perdomo: So I actually don't have a whole lot.

563
01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:02.252
Dave Scott: Thank you, and thank you, George, for being so uber excited about it.

564
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.790
George Reed - Noetic: That was great. Like, I said, in there, you're gonna do the community in the video thing like you normally do.

565
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:16.250
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, show some use. Yeah, I love it because that then it like it really kind of gives a prelude to that, because normally it jumps straight into the community thing.

566
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.879
George Reed - Noetic: but not giving that 1Â min like pitch initially.

567
01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:21.609
George Reed - Noetic: even knowing what you do. I think like it lands

568
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.800
George Reed - Noetic: much better, actually for a broad audience.

569
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.020
George Reed - Noetic: So love.

570
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.999
Andrea Perdomo: Dave. Sorry I did have one more question for you.

571
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:39.899
Andrea Perdomo: Are you at all trying to talk to investors that are direct to consumer.

572
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:41.290
Dave Scott: Yes.

573
01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:44.180
Andrea Perdomo: Okay.

574
01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.960
Dave Scott: Yeah, we're we're we're exclusively DC,

575
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:54.799
Dave Scott: well, not necessarily. We sell. We sell to retailers, too. So probably not. But yeah, mostly.

576
01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:59.709
Andrea Perdomo: Okay, I just had.

577
01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.949
Andrea Perdomo: Maybe this is a Q&A thing

578
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.479
Andrea Perdomo: but talking about that might be really helpful. Not necessarily

579
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.700
Andrea Perdomo: the investors. But your sales channels.

580
01:03:10.304 --> 01:03:18.049
Andrea Perdomo: Because, having done consumer, there's a it's a special breed of investors that will touch consumer product.

581
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:34.479
Dave Scott: Yeah, we're actually phasing out our physical product and doing more of a subscription model. And I'm gonna talk into the business model a little bit later on. Because yes, you're 100% right like there's Maveron and a few others that do the consumer stuff. But then everyone else doesn't. So we're moving away from that.

582
01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.470
Andrea Perdomo: Okay. Cool.

583
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:39.700
Dave Scott: We actually might, we're actually in negotiation potentially sell our physical product business.

584
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:43.029
Dave Scott: which could be kind of interesting and just focus on the technology.

585
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:58.859
Andrea Perdomo: Cool. I love that. That's awesome. Yeah, I think the more you can kind of highlight that to emphasize that investors should not be scared to talk to you because there are. It's not just a direct to consumer product that's going to be sold on shelf. It's going to be

586
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.430
Andrea Perdomo: big, so don't don't miss that part.

587
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:03.770
Dave Scott: That's good.

588
01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.940
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome any other questions, Dave.

589
01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:18.509
Lilliana Robinson: I think you the only feedback I had is like, I understand, in your wrap up. You're like tying it back to how you opened it with stranger things, but I felt that

590
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:21.455
Lilliana Robinson: the wrap up was not as

591
01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:51.520
Lilliana Robinson: relevant to what you're probably going to be speaking about for the rest of the time. I almost think like, just forget about what you used as your hook. Don't tie it back to stranger things in your closing remark. It should be something more about like the big vision, or like actual evil genius games, because that was just like an example to help people understand? Right? So if you loop it back, then it's going to make people think this is kind of the contained like you were saying to Annie like they're going to think you're only in skincare or something like that. So instead, your closing sentence should be.

592
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:57.410
Lilliana Robinson: I don't know more of a transition into everything else. You're gonna talk about what is well.

593
01:04:57.410 --> 01:05:06.929
Lilliana Robinson: value prop, like you said, like one step closer to bringing stranger things to life or something like that. Maybe just workshop that a little bit.

594
01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:07.990
Dave Scott: Okay.

595
01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:19.699
Dave Scott: yeah, I want to get in just one more sentence, which is now I'd like you to meet Haley, a real customer that'll thrive into drive into the video. But that means I need to cut 2 sentences in order to fit it in. So I'm working on it right now.

596
01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:21.279
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, keep working on it. I think.

597
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.489
Dave Scott: Or I just make it 1Â min and 15 seconds, and just suffer the consequences.

598
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.240
Lilliana Robinson: And have like a 15 cut from your Q&A, that's

599
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:42.199
Lilliana Robinson: that's an option. I I typically don't like people to go over like a minute 10, or else you stand out like a sore thumb of having a much longer pitch than everyone else, and like people, are like kind of rolling their heads like, Oh, you know, I'm done listening.

600
01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:43.480
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

601
01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:54.589
Lilliana Robinson: And so like, if we're training people to listen for 1Â min, it it becomes clear once you get into like the 15 second land. So we'll workshop it. I. When is your meeting with me tomorrow or Friday?

602
01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.580
Lilliana Robinson: I think it's tomorrow.

603
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:01.319
Dave Scott: Yeah, I gotta take a look. I think it's tomorrow.

604
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:09.409
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, so we'll workshop it together. But very good. So far, high praise from Andrea, saying she understands your business now. So that's a win for me.

605
01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.280
Lilliana Robinson: Let's go to cogniscope.

606
01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:21.265
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Okay. So I'm not looking for funding. But it would be nice to get some introductions as well. Of course.

607
01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:27.029
Ãoruh | CogniScope: I'm mostly looking for expanding my network in the gaming industry, and have some customers

608
01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:34.469
Ãoruh | CogniScope: and get connected to the big enterprise gaming studios, and most preferably the publishers.

609
01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.089
Ãoruh | CogniScope: So here we go.

610
01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:43.660
Lilliana Robinson: If that, if that's your goal, are you guys making sure that you really prioritize your invite list to make sure that the people you care about are going to be there.

611
01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.990
Lilliana Robinson: The invite list that's.

612
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:49.519
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, about that, like, are like, most of our

613
01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:53.340
Ãoruh | CogniScope: customers are in Europe right now. So.

614
01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:58.379
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. So more about the recording. So it's much more about not who's in the room, but the actual content here.

615
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.000
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

616
01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:01.960
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, whenever you're ready.

617
01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:09.979
Ãoruh | CogniScope: So over 1 billion dollars in gaming investment vanished this year just because studios didn't understand their customers.

618
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:17.820
Ãoruh | CogniScope: A minor update sparked over 300,000 negative reviews in just 3 days for Sony's game of the year. Helldivers 2.

619
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:19.999
Ãoruh | CogniScope: And what's the consequences?

620
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:25.079
Ãoruh | CogniScope: 65% of their players churn just in month in one month.

621
01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:30.810
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Do you remember when Facebook could predict breakups and also relationships before they even happened

622
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:45.850
Ãoruh | CogniScope: at cogniscope? We do that for gaming companies, our psychology-driven AI detect underlying motives and tendencies uncovering the why behind the what? From gaming communities, helping studios, create games, players truly love and even catch the issues before they emerge.

623
01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:53.389
Ãoruh | CogniScope: I'm Churu CEO, of a team of psychology-based psychology, obsessed gamers in today's community driven gaming world

624
01:07:53.430 --> 01:08:03.499
Ãoruh | CogniScope: understanding players is essential cogniscope ensures, gamers, feel, heard. Developers trust their decisions and give publishers confidence in their investment.

625
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:07.840
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Let me show you how cogniscope transforms studios to connect with their communities.

626
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.709
Lilliana Robinson: 1. 0, 3.

627
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:15.599
Lilliana Robinson: And I was saying, you're gonna need to practice your enunciation once you have this memorized

628
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:22.559
Lilliana Robinson: like Troy said, so that every word is understandable. I showed you snow. Who did run bear. He practiced.

629
01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:22.969
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Just.

630
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:38.369
Lilliana Robinson: Every word very well, because he was really, really not confident in his English, and it came out very clear. So I want you to finalize this earlier than everyone else. So we can start working on your enunciation. But I'll let Tom and Andrea weigh in on the actual content.

631
01:08:44.585 --> 01:08:44.950
Thomas Cirone: Real.

632
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:50.329
Thomas Cirone: I'll be out on this one. It was a market I don't understand as much, so would you.

633
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:53.620
Andrea Perdomo: I know it's funny. That's what I was. Gonna say, too.

634
01:08:54.834 --> 01:08:58.139
Andrea Perdomo: my, okay, let me tell you what I think you do. And then.

635
01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:25.759
Andrea Perdomo: That will hopefully clarify if the pitch was clear. So what I think you do is that you're basically working with gaming companies at a very large level, and allowing the community to give direct feedback to how the product is performing, and also being able to detect any underlying issues that might be coming up during a game, so that the company itself can be proactive about solving.

636
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:36.800
Ãoruh | CogniScope: So yeah, we are not providing any community channels. But we analyze their own community channels to see what's actually happening in the inside of their communities, about what?

637
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.680
Andrea Perdomo: That was half price.

638
01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.180
Ãoruh | CogniScope: He's health. Right? Yeah.

639
01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.200
Andrea Perdomo: Okay, that's helpful. I think

640
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:49.839
Andrea Perdomo: I think I I mean, I don't have anything like

641
01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:55.669
Andrea Perdomo: specific that I would focus on. But maybe just making sure that, like the part about

642
01:09:56.110 --> 01:10:00.419
Andrea Perdomo: community is clear that it's like monitoring community versus

643
01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:07.350
Andrea Perdomo: cause. You talk about community a lot. And I think people might have a different understanding of what that means.

644
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:08.440
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Okay.

645
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:16.369
Andrea Perdomo: But I mean honestly, if I'm assuming, if it was the, you know, if if that was my my space, I would. I would know a lot more about that.

646
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:23.040
Thomas Cirone: Hey, Korth, thanks, Andrea. By the way, thanks for saving me a bit there.

647
01:10:23.530 --> 01:10:30.270
Thomas Cirone: and and to look like the guy who hasn't written code in like 50, 40 years. So, as I recall.

648
01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:37.900
Thomas Cirone: you guys are plugging in in game like you're getting those stats in game, or did you kind of move off of that into just just analyzing the the comments in the community.

649
01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:41.220
Ãoruh | CogniScope: We are analyzing the comments in the community.

650
01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:45.899
Thomas Cirone: Okay. So so you're not getting real time in game. You're not. They're not. You're not hooked. They're not hooking in.

651
01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:46.500
Ãoruh | CogniScope: You guys.

652
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.790
Thomas Cirone: To the game anymore and grabbing stuff while I'm okay with it. I just curious.

653
01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:55.916
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, like, we also analyze engagement chats. But we are only analyzing chats, not the

654
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.370
Thomas Cirone: But in. But in okay, okay,

655
01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.850
Ãoruh | CogniScope: The logs of everything.

656
01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:05.690
Thomas Cirone: And is that? But if you're analyzing, okay, even if the even chats in game is that that's unique to you. Correct.

657
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:11.016
Thomas Cirone: like again, not my market. So apologize. Everybody. You guys can mock me later. But

658
01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.990
Thomas Cirone: is that unique to you guys.

659
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:15.579
Lilliana Robinson: Humorous, Tom. I'm very surprised to hear this.

660
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:16.380
Thomas Cirone: Why?

661
01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:19.410
Lilliana Robinson: I said. I pegged you as a gamer. I'm very surprised to hear this.

662
01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:25.399
Thomas Cirone: Yeah, well, yeah, like Pac-man, and like the original asteroids and stuff straight up.

663
01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.709
Lilliana Robinson: The answer is, yes, I think.

664
01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:31.850
Thomas Cirone: All my busboy money quarters went into those things back when you had to go to a place. So

665
01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:33.760
Thomas Cirone: but.

666
01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.559
Lilliana Robinson: Sure the the answer is, yes, right, that's your differentiation. Like you're the only one doing that.

667
01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:43.950
Lilliana Robinson: So I think Tom's getting at that. It doesn't come across in the pitch that the differentiation.

668
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:51.819
Ãoruh | CogniScope: We are not the only one who analyzed the community. We are giving it a little bit more perspective of the psychology based approach.

669
01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:53.350
Thomas Cirone: Okay, actually.

670
01:11:54.420 --> 01:12:02.020
Thomas Cirone: Well, if there, okay. But what? What if, whatever your uniqueness might be, I would might be helpful. I don't. I don't know. So I'll.

671
01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:02.500
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Okay.

672
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:07.890
Thomas Cirone: I'll bow, and I'll I'll bow to you and give you the cyber hug. But I was just curious.

673
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.010
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Okay.

674
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:21.560
Lilliana Robinson: Well, it's a good point, Tom, even if you're you're not quite sure about the specifics. Sure, I think Tom is saying like

675
01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:37.230
Lilliana Robinson: there wasn't as much Uvp in the in the pitch. So maybe just thinking about adding more about like, what makes you different, especially if you're speaking to people who completely understand the space their main question might be, What is the differentiation? Why would I go with you guys so.

676
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:37.740
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Okay.

677
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:48.810
Lilliana Robinson: Hint at it in the pitch, and then that should probably be your 1st question in the Q. And a. Just like I told Talitha. It's your number one question like, you sit down with the Eir, they remark on your video. And then they ask

678
01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:53.250
Lilliana Robinson: like, so what? Why? Why, you guys specifically what makes you different?

679
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:58.700
Ãoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, I would like to elaborate on that on the Q&A section to make it much more clear. Yeah.

680
01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:00.020
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

681
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.690
Lilliana Robinson: Do you have any questions about your pitch before we move on?

682
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:15.750
Ãoruh | CogniScope: No, but the like. It should be much more easy to understand for everyone. So I think maybe I can put some terminology out, and try to make it much more simpler.

683
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:17.090
Lilliana Robinson: Cool

684
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:28.320
Lilliana Robinson: and honestly, Andrea and Tom, it's helpful to hear people who are not like are outside of the industry, because then we know if it's actually coming across or not. So that's a that's a very helpful litmus.

685
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:33.400
Lilliana Robinson: Last, but not least. Okay, Tora, are you good to move on? We're gonna go over to health blocks.

686
01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.880
Lilliana Robinson: All right, mute.

687
01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:36.540
Lilliana Robinson: Bring us home.

688
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:37.270
Nirat Attri: Everyone.

689
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:38.720
Lilliana Robinson: That's your objective, and then go.

690
01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.130
Nirat Attri: That's true.

691
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:40.290
Lilliana Robinson: Ready!

692
01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:58.539
Nirat Attri: I think our objective is to start initial conversations with investors, to figure out whether we are in a good place to raise or not, and also with private equity companies or people that know them, because a good utilization of our platform, as we're finding out is in that industry. So anybody who can hook us up with them.

693
01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:01.319
Nirat Attri: I'll jump into it.

694
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:07.970
Nirat Attri: Healthcare is inundated in technology yet, ironically, it's making things worse.

695
01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:18.349
Nirat Attri: Across 350,000 Us. Healthcare practices, staff waste countless hours juggling disconnected systems leading to burnout and millions lost in revenue.

696
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:24.759
Nirat Attri: I'm neerat atri. And after successfully exiting my previous health tech startup. I knew there had to be a better way

697
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.920
Nirat Attri: at Healthlocks. We're building the strike for healthcare.

698
01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:35.659
Nirat Attri: a suite of plug and play Api modules that seemly connect seamlessly connect with existing systems without the need for expensive overhauls.

699
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:41.880
Nirat Attri: just like stripe revolutionized payments by making integration simple. We're doing the same for healthcare workflows.

700
01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:44.439
Nirat Attri: Our early results speak for themselves.

701
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:51.930
Nirat Attri: Poor healthcare companies already use our platform reducing manual work by 80% and saving over 200 K annually. On average.

702
01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.589
Nirat Attri: we're not just building another healthcare tool.

703
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:59.549
Nirat Attri: We're creating the infrastructure layer that will finally let healthcare technology work the way that it should.

704
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:05.069
Lilliana Robinson: All right. That was 57 seconds.

705
01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:11.454
Thomas Cirone: Okay, I'll I'll go, Andrea. So I cause I keep deferring you.

706
01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:19.290
Thomas Cirone: So as as I recall, you're targeting independent physician offices and not hospital providers, big pharma. Right? Okay.

707
01:15:19.492 --> 01:15:24.869
Thomas Cirone: I don't know if that was clear, and I don't know if it should be clear, or maybe that's in the QA. And that's cool. Right? So

708
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.630
Thomas Cirone: so I just wanted to bring that up. And then.

709
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:38.239
Thomas Cirone: so I think this was okay. Normally, I absolutely can't stand mentioning other companies and say, we're the stripe for healthcare, or we're the we're the Facebook of whatever. But for you, I think it worked here.

710
01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:46.920
Thomas Cirone: So I'll defer to other smart people on that. You know what I mean because it sort of could. It might bring it home for other people who don't know your space. I don't know

711
01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.120
Thomas Cirone: right?

712
01:15:48.886 --> 01:15:54.779
Thomas Cirone: But those are. Those are my only 2 thoughts, right? Cause I I know, and I know you do. You have a big grand plan and

713
01:15:55.218 --> 01:16:00.309
Thomas Cirone: I'm sure the video and QA. Will will drill down into some of those things.

714
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:09.980
Andrea Perdomo: I had a similar sentiment.

715
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:17.359
Andrea Perdomo: As far as like the well, 2 things. One like this is a huge market.

716
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:26.439
Andrea Perdomo: and I don't know if it's just me like venting. But I know I get frustrated by this. I'm like, how many times are you gonna ask me the same question?

717
01:16:27.230 --> 01:16:34.839
Andrea Perdomo: So anyways from that standpoint, like love, what you're trying to do. I think that on the stripe side

718
01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:42.049
Andrea Perdomo: is that the right analogy like I'm just trying to figure out if it's more like stripe, or more like zapier, or more like

719
01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:52.270
Andrea Perdomo: Do you know what I mean? Like I like stripe when I hear stripe I hate, I think, payment. And so then my mind went to like, are they trying to solve payment?

720
01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:58.019
Andrea Perdomo: So I don't know if that's the right analogy.

721
01:16:58.910 --> 01:17:03.289
Andrea Perdomo: but I do think it needs to be some sort of comparison to something.

722
01:17:04.650 --> 01:17:19.249
Nirat Attri: Yeah, I think the the place where it sits best is in between, like Zapier and plaid, funnily enough, but not a lot of people know plaid like, how plaid works internally or like. Why was it something that was revolutionary when building connectivity along bank interfaces.

723
01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.440
Thomas Cirone: Yeah, excuse me, I put investors no plan.

724
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:34.160
Thomas Cirone: True, like I might like, I know, a little bit. But like I, you want to hit investors. They they know plaid like. If you think it's more analogous to plaid than stripe, I won't argue that point. But go ahead

725
01:17:34.570 --> 01:17:40.870
Thomas Cirone: because, investors, this is, you know you're you're in the Mecca of of the tech world, and and I think they know plaid.

726
01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.320
Thomas Cirone: I'm sorry I didn't mean to jump in, and I just felt.

727
01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.630
Andrea Perdomo: No, no, no, I

728
01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:58.428
Andrea Perdomo: no, no, I agree. I mean, I think, like I know what plaid is, because I'm trying to connect all my stuff. So I've had to use it as a user. So investors, I think, will know what that is, and users will as well.

729
01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:23.999
Andrea Perdomo: so yeah, I don't know what the right analogy is. I don't. I don't think it's stripe. I think it's closer to Zapier or plaid and then in that vein. I think I was also left with a question around, like who the paying customer is. Like? Is it the all these different platforms that work with healthcare providers? Or is it the the hospital like when you talked about you had 4? Is it 4

730
01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:25.809
Andrea Perdomo: use cases already?

731
01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.979
Nirat Attri: Yep, who are those? For.

732
01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:31.299
Andrea Perdomo: Or like? What are they categorized.

733
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.510
Nirat Attri: To. I mean, they spread across different

734
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:50.820
Nirat Attri: verticals like one of them is a tell like 2 of them are telehealth clinics. One of them is a medical device fulfillment center. And one of them is a medical service org. So it's on the back of the same technology stack. But I don't want to complicate it too much in.

735
01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:51.260
Andrea Perdomo: Fix it.

736
01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:51.760
Nirat Attri: So.

737
01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:54.649
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, let's not complicate it too much.

738
01:18:55.661 --> 01:18:58.610
Andrea Perdomo: But I do wonder if it's

739
01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:10.060
Andrea Perdomo: if that is something that you can address in the Q, and A, which is kind of like who your initial like knowing that this is something that could obviously be used. And there's a huge market for it like, who are your initial

740
01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:15.240
Andrea Perdomo: customers? I think that could be helpful.

741
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:37.509
Nirat Attri: Yep, I think what we're doing in our product video is just like actually showcasing it like how it works. And like, they've rightly said, like, I think it's more to do with like Zapier of operating. But like plaid is very user, credential, based. And but what we are doing is doing it for the doctors.

742
01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.230
Nirat Attri: It's just like there's no perfect

743
01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:51.880
Nirat Attri: analogy for it. But the idea is the way the reason why we picked up stripe was because stripe did build all these interfaces eventually. What makes financial transactions easier? We want to

744
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.520
Nirat Attri: like the thought was, we wanted to do it for

745
01:19:54.790 --> 01:20:00.189
Nirat Attri: medical transactions like it's not payments. But medical data could also be

746
01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:08.219
Nirat Attri: something that constitutes a transaction. But again, I I know that's not something that put that gets put across in a 1Â min pitch, perhaps, or I could.

747
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:12.170
Andrea Perdomo: So the user would actually be the healthcare provider.

748
01:20:13.751 --> 01:20:24.339
Nirat Attri: They're the central users and all of this like it's all it's all around their consent and their ability to operate. If they're if they're dealing with other service companies.

749
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:27.779
Nirat Attri: is the doctors or their staff that does this work?

750
01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:28.980
Nirat Attri: Yeah.

751
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:29.700
Andrea Perdomo: Got it.

752
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:30.130
Nirat Attri: Yeah.

753
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:37.920
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, I think I think making that

754
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:42.329
Andrea Perdomo: is there. I'm sure there's some sort of stat around, like, how many

755
01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:48.610
Andrea Perdomo: of those people you just mentioned exist like as a

756
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:57.810
Andrea Perdomo: like to kind of go from this like huge 1 billion dollar market to like, who are the users like.

757
01:20:57.810 --> 01:20:58.600
Nirat Attri: Trillion.

758
01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.200
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah.

759
01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.070
Lilliana Robinson: So

760
01:21:01.210 --> 01:21:13.049
Lilliana Robinson: neera, I'm gonna I'm gonna pause this here because I just noticed Morgan came late and was not in the queue. So, Morgan, why don't you take the last 4Â min, Neera? I think that was some good feedback, so I think you're good.

761
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.270
Lilliana Robinson: Very

762
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:23.399
Lilliana Robinson: quickly, Morgan, and then maybe the mentors can each give like 1Â min of feedback to Morgan. Why don't you give them your objective? And then quickly, just go into your pitch because we have 4Â min left.

763
01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:24.560
Morgan Stanton: Okay.

764
01:21:25.657 --> 01:21:50.569
Morgan Stanton: so sorry about the background noise. My objective is, it's a very biotech focused company. So really, the the Intro pitch is just to get people kind of hooked in right. I'm not talking about much science. I'm just talking about the scope of the problem and why people should care and why people should remember me. So I'll talk more about the science and the video. And in the QA. But the the pitch is essentially a hook. Right?

765
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:58.580
Morgan Stanton: Everyone. Look at me. Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and get going exploring the deep blue sea.

766
01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:08.870
Morgan Stanton: the great unknown words from famed oceanographer, Jacques Cousteau. No, these are phrases used to describe female gynecological help.

767
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:19.940
Morgan Stanton: I'm Morgan Stanton. I'm the CEO of opal therapeutics. I have a phd in chemistry. I'm a scientist, and I'm passionate about helping people, and I'm here to ask, why are we still so lost when it comes to the uterus?

768
01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:38.390
Morgan Stanton: Even in a Us. Market valued at over 180 billion dollars. We've kept our ambitions so so small. Does that sit right with you? Do you think we should be going small for your health, your daughter's health for your mom's health, because right now, going small means women must settle for a much lower quality of life than men.

769
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:56.369
Morgan Stanton: The good news, biotech and pharma are waking up to this problem. Losing a few 1 billion dollars in bad experiments will do that to you. So let's forge a new path forward. No more treating women's health as uncharted waters at Opal. Female biology isn't just seen. It's deeply understood. It's prioritized. And it's value.

770
01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.090
Morgan Stanton: So let me show you how we got here. And, more importantly, how Opal is going to fix it.

771
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:02.620
Lilliana Robinson: 1 0, 3.

772
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:07.480
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, we have 2Â min left of the call. Why don't we just ratify.

773
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:11.078
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah, I just have some quick

774
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:19.780
Andrea Perdomo: And I think we met when I was in San Francisco. So it's good to see you again. I'm just wondering if the word, like small is the right word

775
01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.320
Andrea Perdomo: to really pinpoint the problem.

776
01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.250
Lilliana Robinson: That's been my! I.

777
01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:24.800
Morgan Stanton: Gave me the same feedback. Get rid of.

778
01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.450
Andrea Perdomo: I'm like it just.

779
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.830
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

780
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.057
Andrea Perdomo: Like she's gonna know.

781
01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:34.930
Lilliana Robinson: So in the interest of time we can move on from that. I've literally told her multiple times. Just

782
01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:37.693
Lilliana Robinson: yeah, I know I'm getting. I'm getting rid of it.

783
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:40.362
Andrea Perdomo: Okay, cool. Thank you.

784
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:42.980
Andrea Perdomo: I'll hand it over to Tom.

785
01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.877
Thomas Cirone: Hey, guys, I love the pitch. Love your delivery, your personality comes through.

786
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:54.830
Thomas Cirone: You had me at the beginning, and you and you rolled. And so that was great.

787
01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:00.460
Thomas Cirone: you might consider, you know, throwing in, you know what specifically

788
01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:18.289
Thomas Cirone: you're going to do to like, what specifically aspect of this space. You're gonna like, you know, almost a how or what I don't know. But I wanted to see the video after that. And I did it. So I actually, I liked it. It was a bit of an education. But then, like, what is Aki? What do you? Okay, so what part of that are you solving like you drew me in. You had me.

789
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:23.550
Thomas Cirone: and then I wanna make sure I know what you're solving, and then we'll talk about marketing stuff, but I thought that was cool.

790
01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:24.070
Morgan Stanton: Okay.

791
01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:30.729
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome, anything final. Andrea, in the last 30 seconds.

792
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:31.560
Morgan Stanton: So.

793
01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.759
Andrea Perdomo: Words, no, we're small.

794
01:24:34.996 --> 01:24:53.950
Andrea Perdomo: No, I mean, I think I just. I think you have an opportunity to pull heartstrings and like really kind of center this around the fact that everybody in that room knows a woman who has been through some sort of, or or could have used additional medical support. And so I'm just, I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to really

795
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.729
Andrea Perdomo: personalize the problem a little bit so that

796
01:24:58.143 --> 01:25:21.829
Andrea Perdomo: people can wake up to how big this is, and maybe this is something you're going to address. But I just know, like maternal death rates for black moms is like significantly higher, like. There are just thousands of stats out there that show meaningfully how our lack of investment in women's health has actually contributed to further disparities, and not just race, but gender, and like

797
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.910
Andrea Perdomo: I was just like craving some of that.

798
01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:55.950
Lilliana Robinson: Andrea so earlier, Morgan the same feedback. So in her 1st question of the Q. And a, they asked like, basically like, Why is this big deal, and she's going to go into not just the specifics, but also just in general, like female mortality rates from these reproductive diseases that unfortunately are killing a lot of people, and it doesn't need to if we just researched it and found the proper treatments and things like that, and also just quality of life which does matter like people are living with these terrible conditions only because we haven't researched it.

799
01:25:57.250 --> 01:25:59.101
Andrea Perdomo: Yeah. And I think Morgan just

800
01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:05.490
Andrea Perdomo: I know we're on time, but I know there's a lot going on politically. I don't want to get political. But I do think like

801
01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:11.929
Andrea Perdomo: there's there's a lot going on in this space right now. And so this to me, feels like an opportunity to really kind of like.

802
01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:17.261
Morgan Stanton: I agree. I think I, the Q. And a. I'm gonna try to put a question at the end about

803
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.690
Morgan Stanton: how? What the future is looking like for women's health right now.

804
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:25.190
Andrea Perdomo: And you can get me here. I'm cheering you on, so let me know how I can help.

805
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:25.930
Morgan Stanton: Thank you.

806
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:35.700
Lilliana Robinson: Great. Thank you guys for sending it over. That was great. I'm glad we were able to get through everybody. Andrea and Tom, thank you for your time, Andrea. Thanks for having.

807
01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:36.500
Andrea Perdomo: Having us.

808
01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:53.629
Lilliana Robinson: If you had any questions about Demo Day, I'm happy to stay on for a couple of minutes. Chloe mentioned that you might otherwise everybody will see you for the CEO Cxo. Small groups this afternoon. If you didn't see my post, Ceos, it's in person. Slash hybrid. Neil's in the office. If you feel like commuting there. Otherwise, Tom, we'll see you soon.

809
01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:57.970
Lilliana Robinson: probably not in person for Demo Day, but probably virtually in the spring. Oh, okay.

810
01:26:57.970 --> 01:27:00.659
Thomas Cirone: Go, Tom, come to Demo because it's a Friday.

811
01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:02.640
Thomas Cirone: Friday. I got a shot at being there, so.

812
01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.280
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

813
01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.769
