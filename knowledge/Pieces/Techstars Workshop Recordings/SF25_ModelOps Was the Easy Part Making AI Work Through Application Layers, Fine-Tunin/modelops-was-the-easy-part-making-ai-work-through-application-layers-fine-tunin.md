### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Thread Genius: when I'm on the investor side. These questions still get asked of like when you're building your company like, what? What's your like product roadmap like? Why is this stuff matter for me? I can tell you, investors are looking at this. They're thinking about it, not only just from a risk perspective, but like a scale perspective. And I've heard that more and more with investors of like is this a scalable business based on like the approach they're taking? Or there's some risks there that really are value driven
- Thread Genius: Yeah, future proofing is a huge part of our, you know, regulatory compliance aspect, because we want to make sure that people are aware of what's coming down the pipe, both in the us and the EU, the Us. We have more of a patchwork framework approach similar to how privacy law developed. Here and there was an executive order that was rescinded. And now the current administration has sent out an Roi
- Thread Genius: couple of yeah. And again, I I think choice matters right. We're seeing 2 different ways to approach this. Some. Sometimes, you know, very early stage companies are saying, we we need to prove prove the model. And we still need to prove the concept. And so we're gonna stick with one model developer. We're going to find some through their Apis and reduce our upfront costs.

### Key Insights

> "Thread Genius: focusing on kind of like, how much you're raising and what the ultimate dilution is. Even if you're an AI company is super important and unfortunately partners and track. AI versus non AI. But we certainly are seeing data there. That shows at least anecdotally that post money caps are higher for AI. So anyways nice to meet you all, at least wanted to give a plug for for some of the things we're seeing on the corporate side before turning it over to Katie and Amir, who are the real show. So nice to see you."

> "Thread Genius: copyright everything in between. We've worked on some deals and some financings and fundings, and we are excited to be here to share with you a little bit about our perspective throughout the last couple of years, watching the market, learning about the regulatory compliance considerations and seeing what's happening today, we're going to take a fine tune a little deeper, and and we'll go over some of the key topics that you should know about the current regulatory landscape here in the Us."

> "Thread Genius: their bailiwick is highly capable. Small models, right? But most of their models that they're developing are are under 40 v. 1 billion parameters. So you know you you would never hit that 10 to the 26 threshold. And and yet in benchmarks, you know, performance benchmarking. They're outperforming some of the very large models. Let me go to the next slide."

> "Thread Genius: patterns, statistical correlations, abstractions from that data. And so what's left is the model weights, right? The parameters. And that's sort of the key point of foundation model. So ways in which foundation models can be adjusted to adapt to specific tasks and specific domains include fine tuning, so it specializes certain abilities for different practice areas, different industries. And so what we've seen is"

> "Thread Genius: So you know this, we can fly through this. I mean, this is a little bit sort of technical about the different types of ways to fine tune models. You know. Look, I think you all are technical smart enough to know that. You know certain situations are going to demand different techniques. I think. You know, the the state of the art on this is always moving. We're gonna talk"
