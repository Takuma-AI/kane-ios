00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:30.630
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, guys. So this is Brent Payne. A lot of people, Brent, actually, on Monday, we're talking about how they need help with SEO. So I was like, oh, I have the perfect thing for you planned this week. Brent has been coming to our Chicago programs for years. Always a fan favorite. And now Super, grateful that he's willing to help out with our Bay area program. So he's really an expert in this. It's he helps startups all the time. So make sure that if you have any questions you ask this will be pretty interactive. So like.

2
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.499
Lilliana Robinson: feel free to just have a discussion, and he's going to go through the companies

3
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:43.839
Lilliana Robinson: in the order they were in in the look. So if we don't get to, you, feel free to reach out to Brent separately. I know Brent usually like companies to email you. Is that correct?

4
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.890
Brent D. Payne: Yup, that's great!

5
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.759
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, awesome. Well, I'll hand it over to you so we can make the most of our time.

6
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.079
Brent D. Payne: Great. Thanks for having me. Yeah, I've been doing this for quite a while with the techstars teams. At 1 point it was up to like 2025 locations.

7
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.830
Brent D. Payne: but that was during Covid and I kind of backed off because that was a lot

8
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:10.090
Brent D. Payne: but it was, it was a lot of fun. And and I'm enjoying working with. I think I have like 5 or 6 that I'm still working with out of the tech stores locations. Still.

9
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:36.777
Brent D. Payne: So this actually was built out of not being able to go to conferences. We used to do site clinics live at conferences. Have people throw their business cards in a bowl, and we'd pull a card and we go through it. We'd have beers on the table and shots at Tequila we'd have like trench coat, or like lab coats on from like doctors like clinic. It was fun by drop, most of the antics, and

10
00:01:37.110 --> 00:02:03.944
Brent D. Payne: you know, don't know the alcohol be the right thing to to be throwing into these as well. But it was fun in live and in in the clinics. So but we're gonna get into this summit. A lot of you are pretty new. So we're not gonna talk too much about link building and link structure with each of you individually. I will give some overall general things that you need to do. But we're not going to get into like the nitty gritty of link building for each individual.

11
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.810
Brent D. Payne: I guess company.

12
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:17.130
Brent D. Payne: If you have a specific question about link building, please do ask it when you're you know, when I'm going through your company, or if we decide to cut it off and do a. QA. At the end, which might be a good idea.

13
00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:22.869
Brent D. Payne: Then. We'll go ahead and open it up for QA. For anybody has questions specifically around link building.

14
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.340
Brent D. Payne: But with that I'm going to get started and just kind of run through like I said the lookbook and go from there saying, if people aren't here that's cool.

15
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.860
Brent D. Payne: We'll just move on to the next one. No

16
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.760
Brent D. Payne: offense taken, and I'm sorry for the reschedule.

17
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.510
Brent D. Payne: I'm like, you guys, I'm also very busy. So

18
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.539
Brent D. Payne: I've got a lot of things going on. I was sick for 2 days, and it just put me behind. So.

19
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.579
Lilliana Robinson: It's alright. Afford health.

20
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.360
Brent D. Payne: Priest did.

21
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:48.120
Brent D. Payne: Ford, health! Are you here?

22
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.330
Lilliana Robinson: Nelson.

23
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.279
Brent D. Payne: Hey, Nelson, talk to me! Tell me your elevator pitch. What do you guys do.

24
00:02:54.418 --> 00:03:04.390
Nelson Mitchell: We help patients manage their medical bills through organization error, checking and negotiation with healthcare providers and

25
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.590
Nelson Mitchell: insurers, and then also payments.

26
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:17.219
Brent D. Payne: Okay? So one quick question, have you guys looked into the all the medical codes as an option? Have you guys looked into that from like a content, perspective or not.

27
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.981
Nelson Mitchell: No, that's an interest. I mean, there's so many.

28
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:41.739
Brent D. Payne: There are, and there are a lot of searches around those that you may want to look into as soon as you can. The reason for that is that we have done a lot of work with other health, like insurance type companies, etc. And we've noticed that a lot of the

29
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:56.089
Brent D. Payne: search volume is really around these codes. And so that might be a good thing for you guys to jump into right away. You can just build out a lot of content around each of the codes. Individual landing pages for each one. Talk about what they mean.

30
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.629
Brent D. Payne: You know, just the, the, the given questions around what those might be would be helpful.

31
00:04:02.874 --> 00:04:05.340
Brent D. Payne: Do you feel that aligns with you or not?

32
00:04:06.624 --> 00:04:07.986
Nelson Mitchell: I mean, that's

33
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.512
Nelson Mitchell: that is interesting. Like to to try to to rank higher.

34
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.360
Nelson Mitchell: My source material would be

35
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.060
Nelson Mitchell: the you know the ama

36
00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:30.890
Nelson Mitchell: way that they describe the code, so I'd probably, I guess, to not violate copyright have to do some kind of word massaging on on the descriptions of the codes, is.

37
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.970
Brent D. Payne: Well, let's look at it real quick. So there's not a lot going on here, cause you guys are new.

38
00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:46.369
Brent D. Payne: But but this is a tool called a traps. What it does is it looks at your backlink profile. Primarily also gives you a lot of information on keywords information for SEO.

39
00:04:46.747 --> 00:05:09.199
Brent D. Payne: I highly recommend you guys at least get some type of login for this. Maybe you guys share it across the entire techstars group. I think that's conditions. But whatever you guys decide to do, it's a very helpful tool. So I'm gonna look at the keywords, explore real quick. And it. Do you know one of the codes or not? That's that. What are they called? I I are queue codes, or Icq. What are they called.

40
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.390
Nelson Mitchell: Cpt. Codes.

41
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.650
Brent D. Payne: Cpt code. Thank you.

42
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.250
Nelson Mitchell: Yeah.

43
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:22.090
Nelson Mitchell: Brent, I should just mention that. I updated my landing page, and now it's try dot afford health, so that the dub just goes to a.

44
00:05:22.735 --> 00:05:23.020
Brent D. Payne: Redirect.

45
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.750
Nelson Mitchell: Use that links through. Yeah.

46
00:05:25.246 --> 00:05:28.210
Brent D. Payne: So these Cpt codes things that make sense to you.

47
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.800
Brent D. Payne: Yeah.

48
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.859
Nelson Mitchell: Yeah. Yeah. Like, 9, 9, 2, 1, 3.

49
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:48.418
Brent D. Payne: Right? So oh, also someone watch my time, please, and let me know generally like 7, 10. Thanks. Alright. So yeah, these codes this, this is the search volume that's happening. Okay, so search volume just in the United States. And just Google.

50
00:05:48.750 --> 00:06:08.640
Brent D. Payne: and we are seeing a massive amount of searches happening for this 23,000 searches little difficult for you to rank for this is a keyword difficulty score. It's they're trying to mimic what the Google algorithm probably does. It's not super super accurate, but it's definitely a directional.

51
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:35.470
Brent D. Payne: And it is a logarithmic scale from 0 to 100. So as you can see 66, and 63 would be really hard for you guys to ring for. You have to be like a small media company really, to get that type of link structure. But the fours, the sixes, the threes, the fives, like all of these, are just gold for you at 6.8,000 searches a month, 5.2,000 searches a month, etc. And it could really drive some awareness and and get people to the website itself.

52
00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:48.300
Brent D. Payne: But you would need to write something about it and dig into it. I would lean on the Llms for this if I were you. You know I think that would be a really good place to start. You could even, you know.

53
00:06:48.610 --> 00:07:13.990
Brent D. Payne: scrape the Ama website, pull the data and pull that into your prompt with the Lm and have it be a little tighter as far as relevancy is concerned. And then we do have a fact checker that we just made today. Where you like. Go through. I'll let you guys borrow it and use it where you can go through and make sure that the facts are actually accurate, and and the Lm. Didn't hallucinate anything. So

54
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:30.180
Brent D. Payne: it would be a smart move. There are a lot of these, I think overall volumes, 2.1 million on the codes. So I got lucky with you on something to quickly mention. Outside of that, what would be your number one phrase you'd like to rank for.

55
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.679
Nelson Mitchell: Medical Bill Help.

56
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.320
Brent D. Payne: Medical billing, health or Medical Bill, Health.

57
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.010
Nelson Mitchell: Medical. Bill. Help. Yeah.

58
00:07:37.284 --> 00:07:38.380
Brent D. Payne: Medical Bill, help. Sorry.

59
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.069
Brent D. Payne: So Medical

60
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.220
Brent D. Payne: Bill.

61
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.040
Brent D. Payne: and 2 terms. Let's get

62
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.340
Brent D. Payne: help in there.

63
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.059
Brent D. Payne: Help assistance

64
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.279
Brent D. Payne: separate company systems.

65
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.289
Brent D. Payne: So medical Bill. Assistance is a little better than help, so number one might want to start with assistance.

66
00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:22.798
Brent D. Payne: Number 2. It's also harder to ring from Medical Bill. Help and look at the volumes. How low they are in comparison to what we were just looking at. So I I love what you guys are doing. I think that you need to come about it a little sideways. Because if people are looking for those Cpt codes

67
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:38.709
Brent D. Payne: pro might be on an insurance bill right? Trying to figure out what it is, how it works. Etc. So there are some other questions here for like who qualifies for financial assistance for medical bills. I don't know if

68
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.930
Brent D. Payne: that works for you a little better volume at 1.7,000 etc.

69
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:49.380
Brent D. Payne: So when you're building out the site. You're gonna wanna make sure you include some of these key phrases in there

70
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:54.090
Brent D. Payne: when I'm looking at your homepage. Obviously not a lot there. When we go here.

71
00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:20.810
Brent D. Payne: Master, your medical bills is close the Lms might be able to figure that out. Google might be able to figure that out. I think getting relevancy completely right for you guys as a startup is super important. So as you get more link structure, you get more established, you get more authority, etc. I think there's a scenario where you guys can be a little looser on relevancy.

72
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:31.350
Brent D. Payne: But now I would highly recommend that you guys get the key phrases that you want to rank for in the title tags in the H tags or the big bold text here.

73
00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:36.830
Brent D. Payne: you know, headlines of the pages. Try and get that key phrase in that first paragraph.

74
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.859
Brent D. Payne: and then you can kind of.

75
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:53.613
Brent D. Payne: you know, back off a year from now and get a little more marketing. Savvy? But you've gotta get people to the website. Obviously, you don't want SEO to get in the way of conversion or your brand. But we do need to make sure that we

76
00:09:54.030 --> 00:10:02.889
Brent D. Payne: you know, get people to the website used to joke. I I was the SEO director for Tribune for a number of years handled, but like 7 different newspapers and 70 different broadcast sites.

77
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:21.749
Brent D. Payne: and I tell them all the time. It's like peel surprisement and journalism is awesome. And it's really important. But we also need to make sure that we're relevant for the key phrases that we're trying to show up. For example of that was the Hudson River plane. Crash. We changed the headline from 2 wings in a prayer to plane crashes into Hudson River

78
00:10:22.197 --> 00:10:30.130
Brent D. Payne: New York Times. Did not. They had some other, you know, fairly relevant headline, and we ranked number one or 2

79
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.670
Brent D. Payne: for Hudson River plane. Crash got 6 million visits to the site.

80
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:42.829
Brent D. Payne: and we reported on an Ap story and just rewrote it. So they watched the plane sink in the Hudson, and they were on the fourth page of Google.

81
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:55.699
Brent D. Payne: So you know, relevancy really matters. Sometimes it really matters even with larger sites. But for startups it's absolutely imperative that you guys get that right? So highly recommend. I like medical bills here.

82
00:10:56.168 --> 00:10:59.670
Brent D. Payne: You know. Get help with your medical bills might be smart.

83
00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:09.269
Brent D. Payne: You know, whatever it is you're trying to do, or you know, medical Bill, assistance made easy, or something, you know through throughout the end of that would be would be good.

84
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.920
Lilliana Robinson: That's about our time for Nelson.

85
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.270
Brent D. Payne: Great?

86
00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:26.264
Brent D. Payne: Frequently asked questions. I love this. Okay? Frequently asked questions are great. How much does this cost? How much does what cost? What is this right, medical Bill? Assistance cost? How much time does it take to get?

87
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:36.770
Brent D. Payne: my medical bill help that I'm looking for? At least be a little more specific, and how these a Faqs happen. Also, there's a tool in here for questions

88
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.920
Brent D. Payne: that really would help out for you. We'll get rid of this.

89
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:49.870
Brent D. Payne: and you know what happens if you don't pay a medical bill like there's just a ton of questions in here that you could easily answer.

90
00:11:50.189 --> 00:11:58.860
Brent D. Payne: Either via a blog post or via fa ques on each of the pages. So happy to spend more time with you if you're interested 30 min

91
00:11:59.596 --> 00:12:14.100
Brent D. Payne: totally free. Brent allowed us to set that up, or Brent's calendar.com. If you want to dig into it a little bit more. See if I can get you farther down the road on the on the medical codes, as well as the medical billing stuff.

92
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.280
Brent D. Payne: Awesome, thanks, Brent, thanks, Nelson. Alright.

93
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:37.860
Lilliana Robinson: For every for everyone on the call. Everybody is a good example for everybody else. So everything you just did with Nelson. You guys can follow along on the platform as well after this. So I just wanted you guys to know, since we have 24, not everyone's going to go through. So make sure you're still paying attention because it's all extremely relevant to you guys as well. You're all at similar stages.

94
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.340
Lilliana Robinson: And, Brent, I already shared their your email in in our project management platform with them. So they know.

95
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:49.430
Brent D. Payne: This week. Look at you, a plus student. I love it. Awesome. Alright, alibi! Are you guys here?

96
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.540
Brent D. Payne: Come on. This was a fun one.

97
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.620
Brent D. Payne: So.

98
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.419
Lilliana Robinson: They pivoted. So this actually isn't going to be their website anymore. So we can skip this one.

99
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.470
Brent D. Payne: Okay, next, anywhere.

100
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.060
Lilliana Robinson: They're here. Antonio.

101
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.459
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I'm here. Hi, Lynn!

102
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.479
Brent D. Payne: What do you guys do.

103
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:15.200
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Okay, we have a wearable in a nap that measure your level of stress and anxiety and help you announce your mental wellbeing every day.

104
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:38.628
Brent D. Payne: Nice. I like it. I love wearables. I'm really into it. I've lost 55 pounds since Christmas Day, and so, like, I'm all about the wearables right now. It's like anything I can track at like anything at all. I am on the Gop one. So I am quote cheating. But it is awesome, and so totally into the wearables. Alright, so it measures some type of

105
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:49.019
Brent D. Payne: biometric to make you realize that you're all stressed out. You need to calm down a little or something. I'll access your calmness. Most centered self.

106
00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:54.440
Brent D. Payne: So what do you think the head phrases for this like, what is it? Do you like

107
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.220
Brent D. Payne: trying to really hit.

108
00:13:58.444 --> 00:13:59.099
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: It's

109
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:19.609
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: yeah. So we're revising the the the web website completely. I mean, this was the first draft. But we wanna we wanna address the cluster of users that are stressed. And they wanna measure. They like to measure just like you said by the way, I I lost 40 pounds myself, too, thanks to the apple watch. And now I just got the order ring.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:33.599
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So we wanna we wanna tackle those kind of users that you know, they wanna track their their progress, that mental mental wellbeing. Basically, I think the key would be mental. Well, being stress, emotional regulation and stress regulation.

111
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:34.660
Brent D. Payne: Cut.

112
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:40.549
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, like measure stress. Do you not want them to be into neurofeedback therapy anymore? So like, that's not.

113
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:50.619
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, we are kind of setting that aside, we're like with the new Jbds, we are more focused towards the continuous monitoring of stress. And so, yeah, yeah.

114
00:14:50.620 --> 00:15:03.570
Brent D. Payne: So stress management, you're never gonna ring for nor stress management techniques or skills. So we gotta stay away from what you really, really, really really want. And we gotta find other ways to get to it from an SEO perspective.

115
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:11.869
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So, Brent, if you can clarify these numbers. But I'm not following that well here. So what are we looking, and what what should we stay away from, and.

116
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.605
Brent D. Payne: Yup, can you.

117
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:13.400
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah.

118
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:34.810
Brent D. Payne: So stress stress management would be a very big key phrase, 17,000 searches a month. But it's super difficult. It's a keyword difficulty of like an 88. You're gonna have to be like a web, Md, or you know, one of the major hospitals in order to be able to rank for this. You're also in a space that's called your money or your life.

119
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:58.459
Brent D. Payne: So you know it's not super your money or your life, but it's like, right on the edge. It's health related. So Google has a full other algorithm of critiquing the content that's on the pages to verify its authority, backlink structure, etc, much, much, much more difficult to rank in the Yml section of the Internet.

120
00:15:58.872 --> 00:16:26.770
Brent D. Payne: So you need to be very careful with your citations, make sure you cite things as much as you possibly can in any of your blog posts. Make sure you have a a accurate bibliography, or or references at the bottom of the pages. Use things like medically reviewed by or you know, things like that. You're gonna really need to layer heavily into your website, authority and trust inside of the site.

121
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:46.570
Brent D. Payne: So what I would recommend are individual author pages that have a profile for the author a link back to their linkedin page, because it's a fairly trusted source for them to be able to scrape and see what's going on there. A link back to any other place you can vouch for the relevancy of whoever that author is that's writing content

122
00:16:46.908 --> 00:16:58.090
Brent D. Payne: and then go back from their example with Dr. Rivas, one of the weight loss management clients that we have. They, you know, have a special profile just for Dr. Rivas. We're

123
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:10.750
Brent D. Payne: changing that a bit to make sure that Dr. Rivas has his medical schooling background a link to where his medical clinics are. And we're really trying to exude authority and trust on the site.

124
00:17:11.201 --> 00:17:36.700
Brent D. Payne: There's a lot of detail there, but really just spend some time doing digging a little bit into some of the SEO best practices for banking profiles. Ex, you know, creating trust and authority on web pages. And you'll be much better off that, said stress management. Even with all of that, you're not gonna be able to win because it's got a keyword difficulty in 88, which is just outrageously high, almost like Cnn level.

125
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.510
Brent D. Payne: So

126
00:17:38.827 --> 00:17:47.519
Brent D. Payne: we gotta find ways to come at stress management from around something that's not mentioning stress stress management itself. Let's try stress

127
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.929
Brent D. Payne: straight up

128
00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.469
Brent D. Payne: and then dig into

129
00:17:51.500 --> 00:18:10.910
Brent D. Payne: the easier terms is a great one stress rash. You'd be able to talk about that. It's not quite where you are today. But by the end of most of these cohorts most of you will end up in the thirties or so you want to target lower thirties to, you know, somewhere in there is where you'll end up. Making that

130
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:39.059
Brent D. Payne: you'll you'll have enough link structure from enough to press enough of the things that happen throughout the, you know, accelerator program that you guys end up in a pretty good spot from a link structure perspective. So I would target this 30 range. If you guys use the tool later for you, stress rash might be one of those great topics to cover. You know, why is this happening? How you can help deal with it. Stress hives is another one.

131
00:18:39.749 --> 00:18:45.260
Brent D. Payne: See how I'm coming about it sideways on getting you relevant traffic.

132
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.059
Brent D. Payne: but also making sure that you

133
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.700
Brent D. Payne: aren't going after terms that are way way too difficult for you.

134
00:18:52.327 --> 00:18:58.912
Brent D. Payne: Stress synonym. And it's kind of useless CPU stress desk is not really thing stress balls.

135
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.220
Brent D. Payne: You could get into that. But it

136
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:21.109
Brent D. Payne: really important lately, with Google's algorithm is staying pretty tight to your taxonomy, to your words the information that's on your site and try not to go too far off in left field to capture traffic. They had a whole update that was just about targeting websites that are

137
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:49.960
Brent D. Payne: trying to just create content for SEO, and so stay tied to truly being helpful to your users. What they need. Ha! What you're related to, and stress balls might be like right on the cusp, for there, I would say, it falls outside of what you guys wanna do unless you really use them a lot for some reason. But let's focus more on what your app can do. And you know what what the the wearable can help you to to achieve.

138
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.210
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Emotional regulation. For example.

139
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.099
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, emotional regulation might be a great way to go around this. So

140
00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:02.370
Brent D. Payne: I don't think there'll be any volume for like people searching for. But let's find out I may be wrong.

141
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.890
Brent D. Payne: So emotional regulation. Yeah, 13,000.

142
00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.160
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Huh! Right? So.

143
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.600
Brent D. Payne: Not bad, but it's really difficult as well.

144
00:20:10.192 --> 00:20:15.610
Brent D. Payne: Then we drop off pretty significantly. So what is emotionally regulation.

145
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:34.580
Brent D. Payne: you know, it's only got a thousand searches a month. You know, and maybe that's enough for you. Right? Maybe you're trying to target that type of stuff and and let's not get too obsessed with the volume. Number volume numbers important because we wanna make sure any efforts are putting forth actually have people looking for this. But

146
00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:59.890
Brent D. Payne: if it's a perfectly matched key phrase for you, and it's only a couple of 100 searches a month, and you know that's exactly what your users, looking for high 5. Go for it, grab it, especially if it's an easy term to to manage. So you know, I don't know if you target kids or not. But you know there's some stuff here, Adhd, and emotional regulation. So there are some good ties here. It's just much lower volume.

147
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.300
Brent D. Payne: But what is a total 46,000 altogether.

148
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:07.240
Brent D. Payne: and the top 4 terms make up, you know.

149
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.910
Brent D. Payne: 15,000 20,000 of that.

150
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.369
Brent D. Payne: So you do have a longer tail here

151
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.110
Brent D. Payne: that might be

152
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.930
Brent D. Payne: useful.

153
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.709
Brent D. Payne: I I don't dislike emotional regulation.

154
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.750
Brent D. Payne: I think you did rank for that pretty quickly.

155
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.179
Brent D. Payne: I do think that stress

156
00:21:26.676 --> 00:21:32.110
Brent D. Payne: the key phrase stress, and then finding ways around it might be more helpful and get you quicker results.

157
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:53.933
Brent D. Payne: The idea of SEO is to put you on a path where you're getting free traffic to the website so that all your metrics look better. So you can pitch better to people that are gonna write you checks. So I love the techstars groups because we can truly make an impact to your overall pack right to your

158
00:21:54.410 --> 00:22:02.629
Brent D. Payne: just your overall model. And why people would want to invest in your business. So it's important. There, Vincent, you had a question.

159
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.636
Vincent Lucero: Yes, my question was,

160
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:17.889
Vincent Lucero: does the Google search engine work differently for not just finance and life stuff? I know that's true, but do are they able to separate between.

161
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:31.109
Vincent Lucero: direct to consumer Fintech versus B. 2 B sales Fintech, because consumers need to be protected for sure. I know that their policies are on that. But B 2 B, we might get caught up in that same algorithm. I was curious what your experience has been for like B, 2 B sales.

162
00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.949
Brent D. Payne: I would agree that

163
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.000
Brent D. Payne: Google is, gonna look at it more from a

164
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:48.429
Brent D. Payne: key phrases, taxonomy level, which would probably affect B, 2 BI don't have a

165
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:58.329
Brent D. Payne: perfect answer for you. So I I will research that and get an answer to you if you reach out via email Brent at loudus but

166
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:03.449
Brent D. Payne: I would assume that you will have the same problem. Okay, Alejandra.

167
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:26.350
Alejandra Guillen: Yes, I work with Antonio in aware, and about the authoring of the articles. We are actually writing some of the articles and asking our advisory scientists in therapies to edit them, and so they would be editors with their profile. And Linkedin, as you were saying, is that equivalent or good enough.

168
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:48.460
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, it is. As a matter of fact, we are using AI generated content for a number of telehealth companies and then having them medically reviewed by Xyz with a big, fat certification or medical degree, or something. But verifiable is the core here, and think of verifiable from a search engine perspective

169
00:23:48.848 --> 00:24:04.419
Brent D. Payne: not just a human perspective. You want both because humans also need to trust you. But the SEO side of it is that you need to be able to crawl the pages, link to pages and have words on the pages that you're going to that would allow them to trust it.

170
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:27.859
Brent D. Payne: So don't you know? Don't use like Dr. Jp. Morgan right like we gotta have. Dr. I don't know what the Jane the P. Stand for. I should know that sorry but like we needed, you know, spell out the full name. Disambiguate is the core problem. Gotta disambiguate that Brent pain from the Brent pane that sings country music. Okay?

171
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:34.169
Brent D. Payne: So that's that's really important. Alright, we have a couple of questions, Malcolm.

172
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:50.199
Malc: Yeah, you got it right. Thanks, Brent. This has been excellent so far. Really appreciate it. Just pulling up a question from the chat. So I think a few of us are curious if you can just orient us to what we're looking at more specifically, the other columns. So just kind of thinking strategically, like I see cost per click some other things. So just curious. How you go about breaking all that down for us.

173
00:24:50.200 --> 00:25:18.950
Brent D. Payne: Yeah. So again a tool, a traps 6, 70 bucks a month or something. I don't know what it is. I spend 2 grand a month on it, because I have some crazy late login emotional regulation. As obviously the key phrase key. Katie stands for keyword, difficulty, logarithmic scale 0 to 100. So it takes twice as much effort to go from 10 to 20, twice as much effort again to go from 20 to 30 etc, etc, etc. So junior high math plays really important here. It is not like linear.

174
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:25.989
Brent D. Payne: You have to have a doubling effect for each 10 that you move, which becomes outrageously difficult when you start getting.

175
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:38.509
Brent D. Payne: you know, above, like 50, 60, etc. This here is search volume, for the United States. That's currently flagged here for Google, which is currently flagged here. You can look a bunch of other stuff in here if you want

176
00:25:38.923 --> 00:25:57.456
Brent D. Payne: I pretty much use Google. But Youtube's useful Amazon sometimes, etc. You can pull down. Then you have the chart of kind of the last 13 months of what it looks like. So you can see like cool spikes and drop. So Adhd, emotional regulation has significant drop off. Not sure. Why,

177
00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.630
Brent D. Payne: don't know.

178
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:08.910
Brent D. Payne: Gsc, is global search volume. So this is country based. This is global. Md is mobile versus desktop breakdown. It's usually about the same always you can see

179
00:26:09.638 --> 00:26:13.000
Brent D. Payne: looks like there are a couple here. So this is mainly a desktop

180
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.420
Brent D. Payne: query.

181
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:24.080
Brent D. Payne: and then tp, I don't remember what this stands for traffic potential is worthless. Ach, like, algorithm is horrific when it comes to this.

182
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:46.960
Brent D. Payne: So they're trying to mimic like, how much traffic they think the website gets mostly used for black hat SEO and buying links and saying that you have a market for it because they're real links. In reality, guys, it's just a bunch of crap. I can show Google search console data which has accurate information. Google analytics data.

183
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:59.879
Brent D. Payne: And it is sometimes 17 x off. From what this traffic number is, Cpc is literally cost per click. I don't do cost per click, so I don't know how reliable the Cpc number is, but it is very directional

184
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:19.045
Brent D. Payne: cps is a a number of clicks per search. So some searches are more research oriented, so they'll go to more than one click looking at, you know, buying airline tickets or something. You look at 5 or 6 of them as you can see here. This has a lot much higher cps or clock clicks per search

185
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:28.419
Brent D. Payne: than others. So they're clearly researching emotional regulation activities. They want to look at more than one get a bunch of ideas from a bunch of different blog posts, etc.

186
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.380
Brent D. Payne: So that's how that works. Parent topic.

187
00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:46.180
Brent D. Payne: Sf, is search features. So search engine results, pages, features. What's all the crap that's on the website for Google other than blue links. And then when a transfer saw this particular

188
00:27:47.345 --> 00:27:49.619
Brent D. Payne: don't know a particular something

189
00:27:50.538 --> 00:27:55.469
Brent D. Payne: the the keyword. And then last time it was updated. Usually it's pretty good over here.

190
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:01.701
Brent D. Payne: so so that's what it is as we go through the rest of the thing. Great question. Sorry. Alright!

191
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.400
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, that's our time for aware, Antonio, if you have a super fast question. But then we need to move on.

192
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.270
Brent D. Payne: Yep, sorry, Angela.

193
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:32.229
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Question which which is extra for everyone, probably. So how am I gonna use this? So if I look at those key words, basically, I need to try to use as many as possible on the content I generate on the web page. And so, instead of writing just emotional regulation, maybe in a title put, what is emotional regulation, emotion regulation skills, for example, try to try to write the content in every page on my on my website.

194
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:36.440
Brent D. Payne: So we target 3 key phrases for a home page.

195
00:28:37.207 --> 00:28:41.209
Brent D. Payne: About 5 key phrases, maybe 10

196
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:48.579
Brent D. Payne: on a category level page, and then as much as 20 key phrases in a blog post. Now

197
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.859
Brent D. Payne: the ais

198
00:28:50.870 --> 00:29:09.230
Brent D. Payne: and search engines are much smarter than what they ever have been, so do not keyword stuff your articles, do not make your content crap by putting it in a bunch of key phrases. So smartly. Integrate these key phrases where you can

199
00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:29.604
Brent D. Payne: the length of the post is not what matters. It is the breadth and depth of the content on the page around the core key phrase that usually means. The more words you put on the page, the easier it is to accomplish breadth and depth. However, it's not keyword count that matters. Okay.

200
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:54.029
Brent D. Payne: So typically it takes 1,500 to 2,500 words on a blog post to really get that depth that you need. But if you're doing a great job mentioning awesome like entities, novel entities different types of key phrases that you just completely nailed Ontonio right? Being able to work these into a blog post as best you can.

201
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.050
Brent D. Payne: awesome, totally and completely awesome. But

202
00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:04.069
Brent D. Payne: if you make the content, crap, the ais and the search engines will know.

203
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:10.309
Brent D. Payne: and it's not going to work. Also, you need to have positive feedback loop from the users.

204
00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:14.799
Brent D. Payne: So if you have, poor user engagement on your content

205
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:36.339
Brent D. Payne: doesn't matter what you do, you're going to have a really hard time ranking. Not impossible, but a really hard time ranking your content unless you do crazy things like rent residential Ips and Amazon aws, and you have it fakely. Crawl your pages, and, you know, go through this whole rigor or to like in impact those type of metrics that Google might be looking at

206
00:30:36.962 --> 00:30:50.340
Brent D. Payne: so anyway, there are ways around a lot of stuff, but usually just doing it. The right way is much smarter and frankly, much more sustainable. Okay, alright. Then move on again. I'm available.

207
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.650
Brent D. Payne: Cicada music. What do you guys do.

208
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:55.529
Lilliana Robinson: They're here.

209
00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:06.570
Mark Kirzhner: Hey? Hello, so we we help musicians get monetization. Better monetization of their concerts, their gigs.

210
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.379
Brent D. Payne: Nice. Okay, you picked a rough time to pick the name Cicada.

211
00:31:10.926 --> 00:31:16.449
Brent D. Payne: So you were. You're aware that, like, there's like a massive brood of cicadas happening this year, right?

212
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.249
Mark Kirzhner: I am I. I was not, but.

213
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:38.617
Brent D. Payne: Yeah. So you're gonna have a hard time ranking on Cicada because of all of the news in and around all of these bugs that are like this big that come out and start flying around. And it's like one of the biggest years and 17 years for cicadas to be released from the ground. It's gonna start happening as soon as spring comes.

214
00:31:39.523 --> 00:31:40.450
Brent D. Payne: Not saying.

215
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:40.790
Mark Kirzhner: Right.

216
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:41.109
Brent D. Payne: You like.

217
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.119
Mark Kirzhner: Here to yeah, to promote ourselves in the other ways with the.

218
00:31:44.370 --> 00:32:01.550
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, I mean, maybe you could. But you're gonna have a lot of noise in your search results for the word cicada. So I would try and integrate into your name. Cicada music. I know that your your domain is cicada music. But I would almost put it into your logo as well.

219
00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:06.359
Brent D. Payne: Just because you're gonna be fighting a significant uphill battle on the word cicada for a while.

220
00:32:06.737 --> 00:32:09.860
Brent D. Payne: I am not a brand marketer. I'm an SEO.

221
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:21.139
Brent D. Payne: So if you hate it from a brand marketing perspective, that's your call to make. But be careful, because the news is going to be all over these stupid cicadas for a while at least, through the end of summer.

222
00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:25.880
Mark Kirzhner: So we we yeah, we were just thinking, you know, cicada cicada music. It started.

223
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.209
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, I think.

224
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:35.130
Mark Kirzhner: Like, spotify music, and then became spotify. So so we thought, start the security music, but then move to Cicada. But if you, if you give us different advice, will.

225
00:32:35.520 --> 00:33:01.159
Brent D. Payne: No, I think cicada, music's great. But I think you should integrate it here and get people to say it, and every time you mentioned your entity, you need sophisticated music, redoing interview for anything, podcast or whatever it is, you guys are doing to promote this, say, cicada music. So when the Ais Lms and the search engines, I'll pick up this data. Your entity is tied to cicada music more than just cicada

226
00:33:01.456 --> 00:33:29.879
Brent D. Payne: where you're gonna get squished by the the bugs that are out there. That was a fun. That was a fun plan. Words, okay, security music. You guys also are doing much better on link structure than everybody else. You're already at a 17, for example, most of the sites out here are not getting this many links already. You have 34 different links from 17 different domains. What are you doing? And how are you getting these? Looks like you fill out a bunch of play of company profiles.

227
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.500
Brent D. Payne: So guys.

228
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:41.210
Brent D. Payne: great example of what you should be doing to get just the baseline stuff going for SEO link structure. They have a

229
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:57.443
Brent D. Payne: crunch space. They are on player FM, they have a link from techstars which every single one of you should have a link from techstars to your site. If you change your domain a thousand times during this, make sure you get that link updated to be going to your new

230
00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:19.060
Brent D. Payne: you know, domain, whatever might be. So that's really important. I don't know if Jp. Morgan is giving out links to everybody. But wow! That'd be a nice ask for tech stars to get done for you guys. I'm not sure where Jp. Morgan's had on this, but a link from Chase or Jp. Morgan would be outrageously powerful for all of you.

231
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:32.609
Brent D. Payne: So thinking about that from a link buildings perspective. Again, you know more profiles and things set up. How did you get all these set up? Did you just go through and manually do this? Or is there a submission tool?

232
00:34:32.882 --> 00:34:35.329
Brent D. Payne: This is quite a few, for as young as you are.

233
00:34:35.894 --> 00:34:47.069
Mark Kirzhner: So so some of the things that I can tell you how some of them I don't know this is should be a question to our CEO, yeah. Been been in some some of the.

234
00:34:48.050 --> 00:35:07.809
Brent D. Payne: I love podcasts for at for a link building. By the way, the podcasts are still very viral. They tend to like automatically populate to dozens of other podcast sites. So if you can get a podcast set up for yourself, have a a decent, conversation, be mindful of the words, you say in the podcast

235
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:20.699
Brent D. Payne: try and have, like some notes written down next to you with different key phrases, need to hit on cause. It does get, you know, picked up and understood. And then be careful how you mentioned your entity and what you guys do. etc.

236
00:35:21.272 --> 00:35:28.780
Brent D. Payne: I think podcasts are a great way to build some links for you. It's even smarter because you're in the music. Industry. So it makes a ton of sense for you

237
00:35:29.057 --> 00:35:32.800
Brent D. Payne: but I did like your link structure, and you're one of them that I wanted to dig into

238
00:35:33.373 --> 00:35:48.310
Brent D. Payne: overall anchors. So anchor text matters the blue underlying links that are like the text that's in the blue underlying link matters. So think about that when you're building out your site, how you want to be

239
00:35:48.926 --> 00:35:58.539
Brent D. Payne: jumping to each of these different pages. So monetization, maybe music, monetization, artist monetization will be a little stronger

240
00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:12.049
Brent D. Payne: if you don't like the way that looks you can put a title attribute on your a tags. It is not a title. Tag is a title attribute, and what it does is, can I quickly do this in the code or not?

241
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:22.409
Brent D. Payne: I'm not gonna do it. It'll take too much time. What it does. It gives you an a helper text over the top of this, and it also sends a pretty strong signal to Google.

242
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.040
Brent D. Payne: what the pages relevancy it it

243
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:32.728
Brent D. Payne: it allows you to add more. Here, I'll just do it this way. I'll give you an example.

244
00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:39.650
Mark Kirzhner: So so. So, I think live performance or concert monetization. Do you mean, like you hover above it? And you see some text.

245
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.898
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, yeah. So we did it for

246
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:56.649
Brent D. Payne: for this is one of our current clients. 5, 11 tax bill. You'll see here that it says new arrivals, but, as you help protect it says new men's taxable gear, much more relevant for us on the title attributes here

247
00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:14.199
Brent D. Payne: training is men's workout clothes outdoors, actually, men's outdoor clothing. See what we did? We kept the nav clean, cause I couldn't get Brand the division to sign off on the ones I wanted. So we snuck them in with title attributes instead. It's a good way. This one's a little long, I think that's a coding issue.

248
00:37:14.535 --> 00:37:29.970
Brent D. Payne: But normally you want to keep this succinct but and accurate, because you don't want to. Mess up your aria you're like, more or less for all the blind people and stuff crawling the Internet. There are certain laws actually, that you can't.

249
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:40.539
Brent D. Payne: you know, break. So you have to stay relevant to where it's going, but you can take some liberty as to what you're doing. So men's outdoor clothing versus outdoor

250
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:46.720
Brent D. Payne: still passes the aria regulations and and guidelines so anyway.

251
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.550
Mark Kirzhner: Attribute is just a low, level HTML attribute.

252
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:55.939
Brent D. Payne: Yup. It's just the it's in your. A tag title equals double quotes inside your a tag.

253
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.720
Mark Kirzhner: Really.

254
00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.130
Brent D. Payne: I see.

255
00:37:57.445 --> 00:37:57.760
Mark Kirzhner: Okay.

256
00:37:58.707 --> 00:38:00.800
Brent D. Payne: And then monetization

257
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.940
Brent D. Payne: engagement. QR. Codes

258
00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:06.480
Brent D. Payne: got it blog?

259
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.200
Brent D. Payne: I do.

260
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:10.880
Brent D. Payne: I do. I

261
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.689
Brent D. Payne: I don't like

262
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:19.100
Brent D. Payne: people sticking blogs only in the footer like the blog link. It doesn't have enough weight

263
00:38:19.594 --> 00:38:30.919
Brent D. Payne: to really make an impact. And you're really doing a disservice to your blog content if you hate your blog so much that you won't give it a nav link, then you should fix your blog

264
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:44.989
Brent D. Payne: so like that is the more important aspect of this. So I love that you have a blog link in the nav. We do currently have clients that still have the blog link only in the footer. It's just silly, so

265
00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:50.510
Brent D. Payne: try and make that always happen, at least somewhere in the nav. It can be under a subnab if you want

266
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.070
Brent D. Payne: but at the very, very least get it up

267
00:38:54.300 --> 00:39:03.613
Brent D. Payne: top and not just in the footer. Oh, you don't have a footer. You may want to have a footer for like terms and conditions, and like all the garbage pages that don't really matter.

268
00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.509
Brent D. Payne: but I would recommend getting that getting that done.

269
00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:11.830
Brent D. Payne: So your anchor text for inbound link structure, try and make it.

270
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:28.320
Brent D. Payne: Oh, either. Branded. Okay, so I like this because Google is not gonna get, you're not gonna get in trouble with Google is very normal link structure and anchor text with that link structure you have, you know, couple of URL types. Right? You have your brand, and that's it.

271
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.689
Brent D. Payne: If you can get.

272
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.030
Brent D. Payne: you know.

273
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:42.909
Brent D. Payne: artist monetization as anchor text and a few of your links that would be hugely helpful for you to rank for artist monetization, for example.

274
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:49.689
Brent D. Payne: So try and get some specific anchor text links. But if you start getting just

275
00:39:50.491 --> 00:39:53.860
Brent D. Payne: anchor text links that are for

276
00:39:55.430 --> 00:40:21.130
Brent D. Payne: your exact key phrase, it's not gonna work as well. So see this, we're keeping a really strong balance here between branded terms, the URL, the full URL, and then this is their money term right here. They they are an in home pet euthanasia Company. We only have 35 anchor text links coming in with that. We have branded terms and URL terms well above

277
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:31.070
Brent D. Payne: what we have for in home, pet euthanasia. But this is core to them ranking so well, for in home, pet euthanasia, we have some down here.

278
00:40:31.444 --> 00:40:39.475
Brent D. Payne: Here, so you know smart ways to kind of lay out your anchor text as you start to get inbound link structure. So

279
00:40:40.625 --> 00:40:41.370
Brent D. Payne: especially

280
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.646
Brent D. Payne: strong for

281
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:56.820
Brent D. Payne: you know, media mentions podcasts things like that making sure you get that right if you're not gonna get a lot of links, the one from the New York Times. Try and get that anchor text. Awesome. Okay? If you.

282
00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.200
Lilliana Robinson: I think.

283
00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.209
Brent D. Payne: And then that's cool. Run with the brand name. Okay?

284
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.228
Lilliana Robinson: Ali has one question for you, Brent.

285
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:03.330
Brent D. Payne: Sorry go ahead.

286
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.667
Lilliana Robinson: We ran out of time now.

287
00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:12.119
Alejandra Guillen: Yes, super quick is is it relevant to call it blog or newsletter, or community? Does it change at all?

288
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:29.990
Brent D. Payne: It. It doesn't really matter. Google News used to hate the word blog. They've gotten away from that recently. If you're trying to get into Google News. I would maybe stay away from Blog. If you're not trying to get into Google News, which is, you know, quite a bit harder than it used to be.

289
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:44.939
Brent D. Payne: I don't know if it matters too much. We do like branding them usually, so, you know, like, I don't know the cicada corner or something, or you know what I mean, and something like that it does get in the way of

290
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:52.470
Brent D. Payne: the users finding the blog easily, so, keeping the word blog in there is helpful for the user

291
00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:58.316
Brent D. Payne: but there's really no SEO benefit to changing it to something outside of blog

292
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:04.080
Brent D. Payne: and I don't think it even matters for Google news anymore. But I'm a little rusty on on that particular.

293
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.300
Alejandra Guillen: Thank you.

294
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:12.719
Mark Kirzhner: Brett, can you just quickly point on the anchor text link on our website?

295
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:21.519
Brent D. Payne: Yeah. So anchor text link would be. You know, these are all anchor text links. They're also navigation links. So they're both the

296
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:26.560
Brent D. Payne: a anything in the blue of the

297
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.339
Brent D. Payne: here, let me show you a better example is one that I like.

298
00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.960
Brent D. Payne: So another client

299
00:42:34.367 --> 00:42:35.830
Brent D. Payne: get my dog

300
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.189
Brent D. Payne: die naturally sure. Is there a link in here somewhere?

301
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.070
Brent D. Payne: So

302
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.959
Brent D. Payne: quality of life scales decent example.

303
00:42:46.927 --> 00:42:50.099
Brent D. Payne: Read more is a terrible example of quality. Anchor text.

304
00:42:51.407 --> 00:42:52.240
Brent D. Payne: Can I get?

305
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:56.509
Brent D. Payne: See how she even she's a doctor right? We don't have a profile set up yet, but we will

306
00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.579
Brent D. Payne: in hompet euthanasia. There's a great example.

307
00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.390
Brent D. Payne: So that helps to drive

308
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.879
Brent D. Payne: relevancy to the in home pet youth and Asia Page, which is here

309
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:13.888
Brent D. Payne: for us to be able to rank for in home, pet euthanasia. Look at all this text. Oh, my gosh! I love it, cause I built it

310
00:43:14.496 --> 00:43:18.410
Brent D. Payne: but try and get a lot of content on your destination.

311
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:21.559
Mark Kirzhner: It is actually linked to myself, to my website, to some content.

312
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:45.579
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, yeah, you can link within your internal links don't matter as much. So you know, asking your mom if you're good looking, it's like, sure. Yeah, of course, thanks, mom. But Mom usually says you're good looking unless you have one of those moms that are brutal and mean. But you know, getting a poll from like total strangers at the bar. That's a little different. Then you get a little better feedback, similar with off page SEO, or off.

313
00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:49.769
Brent D. Payne: you know, off site links coming into you. Google, trust those a lot more

314
00:43:50.151 --> 00:44:06.540
Brent D. Payne: because they find them to be much more valid than internal ones, but internal ones helps Google to understand what you would like to be seen as, and so sticking with the analogy. If you know you think blue eyes are awesome. Then tell Google that a million times if

315
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:15.699
Brent D. Payne: but it may not matter if no one else thinks you have beautiful blue eyes. Okay. So there you go. Alright. I personally think bald guys are awesome. Okay.

316
00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:25.339
Brent D. Payne: alright trying to throw some jokes in here to keep this. Keep this going. Alright! Who is next I've got that's not you. There we go.

317
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.589
Lilliana Robinson: You had Circopus.

318
00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.459
Brent D. Payne: Thank you. Yeah. Circle plus perfect.

319
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:29.670
Lilliana Robinson: And is here.

320
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:31.520
Brent D. Payne: Circle plus what do you do?

321
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:44.460
Brian Simiyu: Hi Brand, happy New Month. So we basically help accelerate our programs, manage the portfolio data. A good way to think about us is what content does for startup tables we're doing for startup metrics.

322
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.250
Brian Simiyu: Our landing page is not updated.

323
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.270
Brent D. Payne: Okay.

324
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:49.640
Brent D. Payne: So

325
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:51.310
Brent D. Payne: you are doing.

326
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.590
Brian Simiyu: Metrics, trades.

327
00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:55.680
Brent D. Payne: Some metrics.

328
00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:57.780
Brian Simiyu: Part of metrics.

329
00:44:58.340 --> 00:44:59.900
Brian Simiyu: so startup metrics.

330
00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:00.350
Brent D. Payne: Start, okay.

331
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:01.880
Brent D. Payne: start or.

332
00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.522
Lilliana Robinson: For accelerator programs.

333
00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.150
Brent D. Payne: Accelerator programs. Okay.

334
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:10.750
Brent D. Payne: so your clients or your the clients you want are techstars.

335
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:11.860
Brian Simiyu: Yes.

336
00:45:12.463 --> 00:45:21.650
Brent D. Payne: You're in a great spot. Man. Good job ready to go. Okay. Alright. So startup metrics is probably the term we're going for. Let's see.

337
00:45:22.965 --> 00:45:25.590
Brent D. Payne: Wow! Lots of links. Look at these.

338
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.870
Brent D. Payne: How did you get that to happen?

339
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.950
Brent D. Payne: how did you get all these links.

340
00:45:33.487 --> 00:45:45.100
Brian Simiyu: This is spontaneous, not by design. I was just like randomly use case scenarios. I'd probably try to source information, and we also have our own like distribution channel

341
00:45:45.537 --> 00:45:46.699
Brian Simiyu: that we think

342
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:59.519
Brian Simiyu: would generate traffic to us. We use a website what do you call it? An encyclopedia quote unquote, whereby we would source our data. We open this, our data, and from there we have links coming back to us. That's the

343
00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:01.260
Brian Simiyu: the rationals are hoping also.

344
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:22.400
Brent D. Payne: These are kick ass links. Man like this is awesome. I mean, the scores here are are great. They're like real websites, and tell which I won't get into how, I can tell, but, like most of these are pretty good, have an article, maybe not. Might be a spammy site, but, like most of these, are pretty pretty amazing. The keyword number, by the way, is usually the date giveaway

345
00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:37.349
Brent D. Payne: on the number of keywords that they rank for the fact that this one only rings for 8 keywords probably means that there's something wrong with this site. And Google isn't ranking it so but the rest of these are pretty good. This one here is definitely a spam site

346
00:46:37.723 --> 00:46:43.786
Brent D. Payne: a. It's got the word SEO in the in the domain which I hate to say that about my own industry. But usually they're all spammers.

347
00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:46.830
Brent D. Payne: and then keywords are 0.

348
00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:50.770
Brent D. Payne: So so that's the entire domain doesn't ring for anything at all.

349
00:46:51.522 --> 00:47:05.630
Brent D. Payne: Which, you know, it's kind of a red flag unless it's a startup. But startups don't usually have really high scores. So these guys are just gaming the system a lot. You know, some of these are gaming the system. So be careful on. You know who you're trying to pick off

350
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:13.120
Brent D. Payne: from your competitors. So that's one thing I didn't mention is that this URL can be anybody. It can be your competitor.

351
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:23.229
Brent D. Payne: Put in your competitors. Url here, grab their link structure, look and see where they're getting links from. You. Find some really, really cool ideas in here.

352
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:29.259
Brent D. Payne: but try to stay away from anyone that doesn't ring for any key phrases. The traffic number is directional.

353
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:35.240
Brent D. Payne: But Google or not, Google, all of the spammers have done a great job of figuring out how to get the traffic number up.

354
00:47:35.639 --> 00:48:03.129
Brent D. Payne: Hence it's just rent a bunch of residential Ips from Amazon and go hit the page a billion times after you go to Hrs. It's really simple. But for keywords it's much more difficult, because this is indicative of what Google is allowing to rank, and so to just be careful on how much you steal from your competitor here, and which ones you grab. So I like your main structure you rank for some key phrases now only one. Why.

355
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:16.309
Lilliana Robinson: Can. Can you go back the people on the chat are asking what we're looking at here. So what is Dr. And is it correct that those are people who are linking your page on their page, and it increases legitimacy.

356
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:44.959
Brent D. Payne: Yes. So these are domain rating. Okay, so this domain rating is based off of a H refs, it's not a Google domain rating, but it is directional and tries to mimic what they're doing. So the Dr. Is for the overall domain itself, and it's also on a 0 to 100 scale a logarithmic scale. So the 0 to 100 scale is also tied back to the key phrases. So

357
00:48:45.250 --> 00:49:02.980
Brent D. Payne: in a perfect world which nothing is perfect and SEO tech stars would be able to ring for any key phrase that's up to an 83 on that other. On that other list which I can't really give it a good example of, because you only got one. But over here this key keyboard difficulty

358
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.760
Brent D. Payne: would be the same as the Dr. They would correlate. Okay? So.

359
00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.280
Lilliana Robinson: Connor.

360
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:15.770
Brent D. Payne: Getting a link from techstars like I've mentioned getting a link from an 83 domain. Rating score is phenomenal.

361
00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:25.439
Brent D. Payne: So the closer you get to the homepage the better, and and all links period. So homepage links are awesome the farther away you get from that it becomes less powerful.

362
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:35.595
Brent D. Payne: so I mean, I could spend 2 h just talking about link building, but but in this case try and stay focused on the on the domain, rating

363
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.109
Brent D. Payne: generally directionally

364
00:49:38.729 --> 00:49:42.159
Brent D. Payne: and then be careful if that domain

365
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.090
Brent D. Payne: doesn't rank for anything or close to anything like this

366
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:47.850
Brent D. Payne: or

367
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.770
Brent D. Payne: this one. For sure.

368
00:49:50.090 --> 00:50:04.499
Brent D. Payne: Right? It just means that they're just a spam site that's doing a great job inflating these fake numbers and then selling links for hundreds of dollars per link and actually makes no impact to you whatsoever when you get links from these types of sites.

369
00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:05.520
Brent D. Payne: So

370
00:50:06.475 --> 00:50:08.250
Brent D. Payne: you know, was that helpful.

371
00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:10.857
Brian Simiyu: Yeah. Very helpful, very helpful man.

372
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.360
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly.

373
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:13.455
Brent D. Payne: Great

374
00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:21.390
Brent D. Payne: other questions in the chat. I'm not monitoring it perfectly, but I saw one that said, You know, if your websites change what's the question around that.

375
00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.210
Lilliana Robinson: Nope, Nope, that was me responding, I'm managing the chat, so I'll just keep telling you.

376
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.490
Brent D. Payne: Cool. Thanks. Yep.

377
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.599
Brent D. Payne: alright. Any other questions from circle plus.

378
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.350
Lilliana Robinson: Allie.

379
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.980
Brian Simiyu: I just one quick question if you scroll down.

380
00:50:36.247 --> 00:50:38.090
Brian Simiyu: I don't know if let's just scroll all the way down.

381
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.299
Brent D. Payne: So one thing to be careful here.

382
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:41.955
Brent D. Payne: Okay,

383
00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:47.049
Brent D. Payne: search engines don't interact with the page.

384
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:48.420
Brent D. Payne: So

385
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:54.849
Brent D. Payne: you might be fine. I haven't looked at your code or how you work. But if you don't load content

386
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.460
Brent D. Payne: unless there's a user interaction, Google will not see it

387
00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:03.669
Brent D. Payne: so super important. And all these cool, whizbang technologies that look cute and fun.

388
00:51:04.187 --> 00:51:06.219
Brent D. Payne: If you are not

389
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:10.759
Brent D. Payne: loading all of the HTML and all of the content

390
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.580
Brent D. Payne: upon page load in the dom.

391
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.750
Brent D. Payne: You are shooting yourself in the foot.

392
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.369
Brent D. Payne: maybe worse than the foot

393
00:51:18.832 --> 00:51:25.717
Brent D. Payne: because Google won't see anything. Because they don't interact. So anything that requires user interaction to load

394
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.230
Brent D. Payne: which I think your site's doing.

395
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:36.279
Brent D. Payne: Would be a problem, see? So I I have to scroll beyond this point in order for more content to load.

396
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:44.469
Brent D. Payne: So the only thing Google seeing on your site, which might be, why, you're only ranking for circle plus is whatever is here.

397
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:48.279
Brent D. Payne: Whatever you load. Dom, okay, so change that today.

398
00:51:48.901 --> 00:51:52.150
Brent D. Payne: and get it to load everything.

399
00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:04.249
Brent D. Payne: without user interaction. And that goes everybody on the call. Okay, I know it's really fun to have infinite scroll crap on your websites, but it doesn't work for SEO. Okay.

400
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:12.410
Brian Simiyu: So yeah, this one quick question. If you scroll down to encyclopedia, just scroll to the bottom. Second section from bottom. There you go

401
00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.410
Brian Simiyu: repeat

402
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:21.149
Brian Simiyu: exactly. Just click, that I don't know if it load. So now, what we do is we're directing traffic from here.

403
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:25.880
Brian Simiyu: Is this a strategy? I mean, I would call it almost an equivalent to a blog. But what we're doing.

404
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.370
Brent D. Payne: So do you own disrupting dot Africa.

405
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:29.530
Brian Simiyu: Goo.

406
00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.140
Brent D. Payne: Yeah.

407
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:30.730
Brian Simiyu: Yeah.

408
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.920
Brian Simiyu: I'm so a.

409
00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:37.049
Brent D. Payne: The Hrs will give you lots and lots and lots and lots of credit for this.

410
00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.160
Brent D. Payne: Google won't.

411
00:52:38.280 --> 00:53:05.609
Brent D. Payne: So be careful on that. This goes back to the similar scenario of like asking your mom if you're looking but now you're asking like a cousin that didn't need to sound as weird as it did, but it just accidentally fell that way. Sorry? But like, it's like, it's still fairly easy for Google to know that you're all one big happy family. Your IP addresses your logins, the users that go there. Who you're

412
00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:23.810
Brent D. Payne: who registered the domains. You know. Just all of that stuff is just really easy for Google to see. Like, okay, they're all in the same family. Sure, we'll give them some credit here, but it's not gonna weigh nearly as heavily as getting completely

413
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:28.720
Brent D. Payne: honest. Real links coming into the site that are not associated with you.

414
00:53:29.115 --> 00:53:45.920
Brent D. Payne: Should you do it? If you own 50 sites, of course, absolutely. But don't think it's going to be the thing that solves it. We did a lot of this in 2,004, 2,005, 2,006. Now we isn't allowed just for one. It wasn't even around then, but we, as in the industry, we

415
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.671
Brent D. Payne: generated tens of thousands of blogs. They're called

416
00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.101
Brent D. Payne: purchase a private blog networks, Vbn's private blog networks.

417
00:53:54.510 --> 00:54:01.629
Brent D. Payne: and we would point 10,000 links at a certain page because we own 10,000 different domains. And it worked really, really well.

418
00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:11.340
Brent D. Payne: Well, Google crushed it by the end of 2,006, or somewhere in there might years might be off slightly, and that was the end of that. So this is really

419
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:16.310
Brent D. Payne: especially, it's small scale. 1015 sites, you know. You're not gonna hurt yourself.

420
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:25.990
Brent D. Payne: but it's not going to be as nearly as powerful because we exploited this at the level of 10,000. You know, private blog networks back in.

421
00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.720
Brent D. Payne: I don't know 20 years ago, and I'm old.

422
00:54:29.356 --> 00:54:34.000
Brent D. Payne: So that's what happened. Okay do it. But

423
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:44.149
Brent D. Payne: you gotta do more than that. Okay. And traps will think because they can't figure it out. And their algorithm doesn't share it. They'll think it's just a super powerful, awesome link

424
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:48.517
Brent D. Payne: like Google will know it's your cousin. So okay, alright.

425
00:54:49.237 --> 00:54:52.710
Brent D. Payne: circle plus. Thank you. Feel free to book more time. If you want

426
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:55.269
Brent D. Payne: club wreck, what do you guys do? And are you here.

427
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.217
Arthur Fields: Yes, we're here.

428
00:54:57.770 --> 00:55:07.109
Arthur Fields: thanks, Brent. So far it's been great learning. But so what we do with club record is we help companies, review vet and hire quality candidates, faster.

429
00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:08.580
Brent D. Payne: Cars.

430
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:09.910
Arthur Fields: At least. But yeah.

431
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.710
Brent D. Payne: Higher quality candidates for what?

432
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.670
Arthur Fields: For

433
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:19.117
Arthur Fields: we're kind of we're industry agnostic. So higher quality.

434
00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.240
Brent D. Payne: Ways.

435
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.470
Arthur Fields: Yup for full time. Students.

436
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:25.560
Brent D. Payne: So not like house stuff. I thought I saw one of those. But maybe I was wrong.

437
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.880
Brent D. Payne: so you're recruiting company.

438
00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:32.260
Brent D. Payne: What

439
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.300
Brent D. Payne: is it. Software that does it is the AI that does it.

440
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:53.719
Arthur Fields: Yeah, alright. So yeah, I wasn't complete my pitch. But yeah, so essentially so. We take AI scoring and matching and partner with gig industry, expert interviewers to create a quick turnaround time from application to to interview.

441
00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:54.630
Brent D. Payne: Car.

442
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:58.629
Brent D. Payne: And so you analyze the applications that are there to get the best

443
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:01.400
Brent D. Payne: possible like applicants. I guess right.

444
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:14.849
Arthur Fields: Right sorry. Oh, yeah. Yup, sorry. AI. It creates a comprehensive job. Matt. Score and then pushes it off to a industry expert interviewer to conduct the first round interviews within within that 48 h of the applicant.

445
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:16.510
Brent D. Payne: Got it. Okay? So

446
00:56:17.543 --> 00:56:18.790
Brent D. Payne: a interesting

447
00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:26.239
Brent D. Payne: very, very cool tech. I would love to work with it because it's scraping data and analytics. Anyway, it sounds fun.

448
00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:28.410
Brent D. Payne: freelance interviewer.

449
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:36.019
Brent D. Payne: That's what you're ranking. Number 12 for. Why, why is it so high for just the freelance interviewer? What did you do on this page?

450
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.850
Brent D. Payne: Comma callbook interviewer?

451
00:56:40.115 --> 00:56:43.829
Arthur Fields: To be honest, I think it's so we we've actually went out and

452
00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:48.180
Arthur Fields: did some sourcing. And and to to pull some

453
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.699
Arthur Fields: expert interviewers onto our platform.

454
00:56:51.323 --> 00:56:53.498
Arthur Fields: To get them to sign up. And so

455
00:56:54.040 --> 00:57:15.210
Arthur Fields: we utilize Linkedin, just like direct messaging to individuals in certain industries that we're servicing. So for for example, for our Beta test clients is in the health and wellness space. So we reached out to a lot of health and wellness, like therapists and things of that nature. To introduce ourselves and try to get them back to signing up as a expert interviewer.

456
00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:23.883
Brent D. Payne: So this is probably anchor text I haven't seen yet. I would assume it is you are. This is a perfect example, and I could have done on the last one, I guess.

457
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:28.830
Brent D. Payne: But notice what content is actually being seen by Google here.

458
00:57:29.577 --> 00:57:33.339
Brent D. Payne: It is very limited in comparison to

459
00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:36.335
Brent D. Payne: this page I heard, it is,

460
00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:40.460
Brent D. Payne: this is what Google's actually saying for text on the pages.

461
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.420
Brent D. Payne: Is that

462
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:50.350
Brent D. Payne: and this, and then I don't even know what this is. What is this crap inside your page?

463
00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:53.120
Brent D. Payne: It's somewhere we need to get rid of it. Okay.

464
00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:58.569
Arthur Fields: Yeah, so we're actually redoing our marketing page. So it's gonna have less.

465
00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:00.030
Arthur Fields: But but.

466
00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:02.149
Brent D. Payne: This isn't in English, right? This is like.

467
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.790
Arthur Fields: Says.

468
00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:03.859
Brent D. Payne: Regular stuff, right.

469
00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.622
Arthur Fields: Yeah, placeholder, stuff.

470
00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:17.390
Brent D. Payne: Careful of that. And then you're scrolling of some sort is causing the same issues, the last one where it's not picking up a lot of the content. So again, get rid of anything that has to do with user interaction

471
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.430
Brent D. Payne: in order to load content.

472
00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:25.630
Brent D. Payne: So that might be part of it. What I liked about this is that freelance interview is ranking number 12.

473
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.469
Brent D. Payne: Not a lot of search volume.

474
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:33.140
Brent D. Payne: But there is a lot of relevancy here. I'm gonna bet there's probably

475
00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:35.130
Brent D. Payne: the

476
00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:40.139
Brent D. Payne: anchor text coming in. Find out.

477
00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.250
Brent D. Payne: I don't have any anchor text data. Yeah.

478
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:48.169
Brent D. Payne: no backlinks, either, to the exact page.

479
00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.340
Brent D. Payne: I don't know what it is.

480
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:57.650
Brent D. Payne: but someone interesting. Alright. So you are in the Hr Space.

481
00:58:58.700 --> 00:58:59.385
Arthur Fields: Yes.

482
00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.830
Brent D. Payne: Each of our blocks can be my way.

483
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:17.180
Brent D. Payne: Who is a competitor of yours? Give me that.

484
00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:19.650
Arthur Fields: So I would say like indeed.

485
00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.310
Brent D. Payne: Anyone.

486
00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.670
Brent D. Payne: You have anyone closer to.

487
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:27.720
Arthur Fields: Actually actually use another one. Could you use paradox.

488
00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.640
Brent D. Payne: That'd be better

489
00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:34.939
Brent D. Payne: actually know the indeed guys. At least I used to paradoxcom or something else.

490
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.860
Arthur Fields: It's a paradox, dot IAI.

491
00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:39.210
Brent D. Payne: AI got it.

492
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.350
Brent D. Payne: Okay, strong, strong competitor

493
00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:52.009
Brent D. Payne: 113,000 back links, etc. So what are we gonna do here? We're gonna get a look at the keywords, find out what they rang for. We know they're gonna ring for the brand. So whatever

494
00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:56.169
Brent D. Payne: Great Wolf Lodge this, I guess, is one of their clients.

495
00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:57.170
Brent D. Payne: Yep.

496
00:59:57.340 --> 01:00:03.080
Brent D. Payne: So they are ranking for client names by having individual companies in here.

497
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.029
Brent D. Payne: decent strategy to rank for the company that you're targeting

498
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:35.110
Brent D. Payne: more like an account. It's like there's a certain buzz word for this, but you're trying to get in front of the people that are doing the queries at the company. So you're kind of doing A, B 2 B Se. Play here, and your goal is the target. Vanity searches so as the Gray Wolf Lodge team searches for Gray Wolf Lodge. You want to try and show up high enough that they see you.

499
01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:56.500
Brent D. Payne: and they're like, Hey, what the hell is this? So maybe Gray Wolf Lodge isn't perfect. But Gray Wolf Lodge hiring Gray Wolf Lodge jobs? Grey Wolf Lodge. Things like that could be an interesting play for you to build out thousands of profiles on companies and put the word hiring or jobs, or something like that inside of there, not because

500
01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:16.380
Brent D. Payne: people will be necessarily searching for it, but the Hr managers might be searching for it inside of the company. It's a very powerful way to, you know. Show up, and you don't have to shop number one. You can show up somewhere on the first page, second page, because these Hr. People are going to be digging a little bit deeper and that's true for all vanity metrics.

501
01:01:16.681 --> 01:01:20.178
Brent D. Payne: Fountain blue. I just actually stayed there a couple of weeks ago.

502
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:24.150
Brent D. Payne: they, you know, when you're doing a search for this term.

503
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:26.139
Brent D. Payne: They're a little low. 58.

504
01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.590
Brent D. Payne: See what else they got in here compass group.

505
01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.480
Brent D. Payne: Most of the stuff they ranked for seems to be that.

506
01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:36.479
Brent D. Payne: But let's get positioning in the top 20 so you can target something real

507
01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.710
Brent D. Payne: earmark. See airmark jobs.

508
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:47.299
Brent D. Payne: AI. Recruiting. That's an interesting key phrase. Only 1.9,000 searches.

509
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:55.009
Brent D. Payne: Olive Garden Camp Creek. See great wolf lodge jobs. See? Look at that so smart

510
01:01:55.711 --> 01:02:02.210
Brent D. Payne: paradox, one of the other that's bit blah. Blah! Alright! Give me

511
01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.469
Brent D. Payne: give me indeed! Instead.

512
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:06.469
Brent D. Payne: let's do this again.

513
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.659
Brent D. Payne: A top 20 sure volume. Yep.

514
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:12.630
Brent D. Payne: wrong way.

515
01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:13.720
Brent D. Payne: There we go.

516
01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.960
Brent D. Payne: Dee jobs, Amazon jobs, recruiting. See? They do the same thing.

517
01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:21.959
Brent D. Payne: So you you need to build up profile pages by the company.

518
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:27.070
Brent D. Payne: and then add maybe something it has to do with AI and Hr. Together.

519
01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:38.382
Brent D. Payne: I won't be able to get you amazing advice in the next 3 min, but spend more time with me, and we'll figure this out together. I helped, indeed, and shift gig.

520
01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.459
Brent D. Payne: do this exact same thing. We're beating career career builder

521
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:57.655
Brent D. Payne: from shift gig. I don't think they were tech stars, but they're a Chicago company and we rang for bear for bar back jobs, bartender jobs, waitress jobs, etc, for shift gig beating out

522
01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.299
Brent D. Payne: career builder, monster and all those. This is like almost 10 years ago now.

523
01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.220
Brent D. Payne: But.

524
01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:07.350
Arthur Fields: Regardless you work, you must work, you work, work with Paul Wolf.

525
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:20.699
Brent D. Payne: yeah, it may have been, Paul. I know I worked with Eddie Lou the most and Shawn something we're the the 2 owners at the time. Eddie is a unique character, but a really smart guy. So

526
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.480
Brent D. Payne: the.

527
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:27.530
Brent D. Payne: let's let's spend some time together. Figure out exactly what this is.

528
01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:28.520
Arthur Fields: But it up.

529
01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.729
Brent D. Payne: It's going to include creating company profiles, 100%.

530
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:37.079
Brent D. Payne: And then let's try and figure out a couple of other ways to do it, because these might be getting really difficult

531
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:38.780
Brent D. Payne: on the companies that matter.

532
01:03:39.099 --> 01:03:50.469
Brent D. Payne: Unless we go after a niche or a bunch of smaller companies, which might be a good play, too, or we stay after a certain geography. We one with shift gig by getting links from Salt Lake City

533
01:03:50.940 --> 01:04:00.619
Brent D. Payne: companies to the Salt Lake City page. We got links from DC. To the DC. Page. We got links and we didn't pick calip. We didn't pick La

534
01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:06.090
Brent D. Payne: Chicago or New York. We picked smaller, like 1 million

535
01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:21.631
Brent D. Payne: 800,000 population cities. And then we got links from there. The big big win for us, for shift gig was getting links from bartending schools and college recruit a college job board pages.

536
01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:37.390
Brent D. Payne: So maybe look into college job board pages, find niches of like weird Institute schools, etc. They kind of break into there. We did something similar for Capex back in the day with their college rankings, pages, etc.

537
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:40.500
Brent D. Payne: So there might be some fun things to

538
01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.450
Brent D. Payne: the playoff of there. And the guys that's for everybody on the call

539
01:04:43.490 --> 01:05:10.231
Brent D. Payne: right ways. You can find localized links from the local area back to your business. If you're a local focus business, we do the same thing with, we're doing the same thing with coda pets every time they launch New City we make sure we get links from the different areas. Chamber of Commerce is a really easy one. You know, mayors, offices, etc. Talk about whatever it is that makes unique and interesting to a city or or municipality.

540
01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:30.850
Brent D. Payne: getting links from, you know, local colleges and schools and stuff not even like necessarily colleges. You could give a seminar or give great information to a high school. You know, trade schools, even church schools, etc, easy links to get from a hyper local level, but

541
01:05:30.880 --> 01:06:00.230
Brent D. Payne: needs to go to your hyper local page, not to your homepage, or if you script all of your link structure for your site, unless you're only located in one spot. Cut hair, you know your hair salon and one particular city not gonna go anywhere, and you can send it to your homepage, but generally send it to your individual like location pages. When you get those types of links. If you can control, if you can't, it's not that big a deal unless you do it mass, then it becomes a problem for your homepage. So I'm going off into tangents, but helpful ones, I hope.

542
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:03.130
Brent D. Payne: Alright club wreck. I'm moving on.

543
01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.449
Arthur Fields: Follow with you great thanks.

544
01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:09.860
Brent D. Payne: Thanks, man! Dub prime, are you here? And what do you do?

545
01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.750
Lilliana Robinson: Let's see, are the Dev prime guys still here?

546
01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.780
Lilliana Robinson: They may have jumped off.

547
01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:16.990
Lilliana Robinson: Vincent.

548
01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:18.770
Lilliana Robinson: Good.

549
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:20.240
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. Next.

550
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:21.965
Brent D. Payne: Go house, go house.

551
01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.560
Lilliana Robinson: Fully both here.

552
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:25.550
Felipe - Gohaus: Hi, there!

553
01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.139
Felipe - Gohaus: Hi, everyone, we today, we are

554
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:35.600
Felipe - Gohaus: AI power platform for home, personalized. Really, core redesign renovation.

555
01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:42.160
Felipe - Gohaus: So today we are focused more more in the core. And we integrate this platform with the retailers company.

556
01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:48.120
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah, so we work with the retailer integrating this platform and their customer can have this experience of

557
01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.710
Felipe - Gohaus: renewing or redecorating, redesigning their home.

558
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:58.329
Brent D. Payne: Okay? And are you redecorating with furniture, or are you painting thing? Are you doing everything? Got it.

559
01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:11.060
Felipe - Gohaus: We are. We are today focus more in in decoration and elements, like furnitures and decorative elements. And then we are going to move into more paintings and maybe construction of. But today is more decoration.

560
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:16.962
Brent D. Payne: Okay, so one of our clients, like a furniture rental company, or they were

561
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.219
Brent D. Payne: are you renting the furniture? Or are you

562
01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.929
Brent D. Payne: selling the furniture.

563
01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.730
Felipe - Gohaus: We are, and and we are only the integrator here. So we integrate.

564
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:28.520
Brent D. Payne: You're the designer.

565
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.559
Felipe - Gohaus: Very weird. Yeah.

566
01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.560
Brent D. Payne: Like. So like the interior decorator, interior designer.

567
01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:53.149
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah. For example, if you go up you can try the platform with Walmart in Chile a bit more up. We have 3 platform today, the living room, the terrace, and the baby room. So you can design you the 3 of those and the checkout process of every furniture that you buy is with.

568
01:07:53.647 --> 01:07:56.152
Felipe - Gohaus: Walmart, or leader in this case.

569
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:58.130
Brent D. Payne: Got it.

570
01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.130
Brent D. Payne: Okay, you will.

571
01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:10.019
Felipe - Gohaus: To this platform. You put your size, you know we discourage your decorative style, and then we show you a mood for, and then, with the checkout. It will be everything from to from the retailer.

572
01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:11.750
Brent D. Payne: Okay.

573
01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:14.480
Brent D. Payne: got it. Got it? Got it? Okay?

574
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:17.740
Brent D. Payne: So you have an app that walks you through this, etc.

575
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:20.240
Brent D. Payne: And this is

576
01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.720
Brent D. Payne: Spanish mostly.

577
01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:23.660
Felipe - Gohaus: Sorry.

578
01:08:23.968 --> 01:08:27.049
Brent D. Payne: You're mostly Spanish folks, your Spanish, or is it something.

579
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:31.600
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah, we is Spanish or or language in Chile. I'm based in Chile.

580
01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.990
Brent D. Payne: Oh, nice. Okay.

581
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:34.479
Brent D. Payne: my

582
01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.460
Brent D. Payne: entire one side of my family is from Chili, like.

583
01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:39.579
Felipe - Gohaus: But nicer.

584
01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.760
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, so, so.

585
01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.330
Felipe - Gohaus: Happy, to.

586
01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:44.140
Brent D. Payne: Fun. I've never been there.

587
01:08:45.559 --> 01:08:46.799
Brent D. Payne: Alright. So

588
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:50.319
Brent D. Payne: what can we do here? Go back to start? Yeah.

589
01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.849
Felipe - Gohaus: Done. You have to return to the web page. We'll host data. Yeah.

590
01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:56.890
Brent D. Payne: Umhm baby.

591
01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:02.600
Brent D. Payne: This is the app. So I gotta get out of here, too. So let's find out

592
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:06.710
Brent D. Payne: what we're doing with these different sections. So we have 13 links.

593
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.050
Brent D. Payne: the whole domain.

594
01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:13.020
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, we have anything going into here.

595
01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:18.499
Felipe - Gohaus: And we just change this. This web page 2 weeks ago is the new one.

596
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:23.240
Brent D. Payne: Got it? One referring domain ghouse. What is goo house? Do you know.

597
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.970
Felipe - Gohaus: The the latest one before.

598
01:09:26.627 --> 01:09:27.100
Brent D. Payne: That we have.

599
01:09:27.515 --> 01:09:28.760
Felipe - Gohaus: Name. And yeah.

600
01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:29.240
Brent D. Payne: They got it.

601
01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:29.850
Felipe - Gohaus: We changed.

602
01:09:30.157 --> 01:09:35.689
Brent D. Payne: Let's look and see what you're doing with Google House. This be a good thing to dial everyone.

603
01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:39.000
Brent D. Payne: Okay? So

604
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:41.380
Brent D. Payne: go to your house.

605
01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.439
Brent D. Payne: What happens? Okay, you do redirect.

606
01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:53.286
Brent D. Payne: So everyone need to make sure you do 3, one redirects from any of your previous companies or domains that is relevant to your current business.

607
01:09:54.068 --> 01:10:01.940
Brent D. Payne: Really important that you take the time to do that. Think through any companies that you may have done before example for me. I

608
01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:28.690
Brent D. Payne: started a lyric website back in 2,003. And I was super excited about it. Managed to rank on a bunch of nickel back lyrics specifically so I couldn't understand what Chad Kroger was saying when you said, Look at this photograph. And I ended up ranking really well for a bunch of nickel back stuff, I think. Got sued for 57 billion dollars by the music industry, because I guess lyrics are legal. So oops

609
01:10:28.988 --> 01:10:47.820
Brent D. Payne: and then I had the choice of either. Continue to get sued for 57 billion dollars from Warner Chapel music, or unplug my server. That was literally in my closet. So I unplugged my server from my closet hindsight. I probably would have fought them, and probably one. And I'd probably be a billionaire by now. But that is okay. Okay, So

610
01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:50.570
Brent D. Payne: point to this is that

611
01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.730
Brent D. Payne: I've

612
01:10:51.830 --> 01:11:02.054
Brent D. Payne: forwarded lyric vault.com to loud interactive in 2 in 2,011 when we started lyric fault or sorry when we started loud, interactive.

613
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:05.770
Brent D. Payne: I rank for Nickelback lyrics on

614
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:23.200
Brent D. Payne: loud interactive without any nickel back lyrics on the site for another 2 years, because that's how powerful it was. The inbound link structure coming in from all the press negative press that I got from Warner chapel music and me having nickel back lyrics. Okay? So

615
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:27.210
Brent D. Payne: hey, I love nickel back. Don't judge number 2.

616
01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:41.909
Brent D. Payne: relevancy does pass through to your domains. So please. 3, one redirect anything relevant? We're not trying to ring for nickel back on an SEO website. But we are trying to pass anything forward that we possibly can.

617
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:53.089
Brent D. Payne: I truly believe that the authority that came from that help loud to be successful and being able to rank for terms that we had no right ranking for that were in our industry.

618
01:11:53.435 --> 01:12:11.169
Brent D. Payne: But I don't know if that would be applicable now. You know, 15 years later. So your mileage may vary on the authority push, but I think if it's relevant, you should absolutely get it d1301 redirects are better. And I'm glad to hear that you guys are up are updating that.

619
01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:12.990
Brent D. Payne: The next thing.

620
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:19.582
Lilliana Robinson: That was an amazing story, Brent. Also that that's our timer for cohouse, so that we can get through a couple of. So if you wanna just wrap.

621
01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:29.889
Brent D. Payne: I wanna mention one thing for the group. When you do an update for any type of 3, one redirect, you need to get a few of the old links

622
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:32.030
Brent D. Payne: manually changed

623
01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:34.280
Brent D. Payne: to go to the new website.

624
01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:37.510
Brent D. Payne: Google just doesn't trust old

625
01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:42.639
Brent D. Payne: like and domain changes. They don't. They don't trust the main changes

626
01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:47.829
Brent D. Payne: unless they have some other signals to verify that that domain legitimately changed. Why.

627
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.940
Brent D. Payne: there's a lot of

628
01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:58.190
Brent D. Payne: seos are buying expired domains of companies that went out of business, and they're 301 redirecting them to their site.

629
01:12:58.796 --> 01:13:08.059
Brent D. Payne: And so for $12 they can grab 12,000 15,000 links and get it redirected to their site. Google is trying to stop this

630
01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:19.639
Brent D. Payne: by making sure that some of the links that were on the Internet did truly change from Goohouse to go house in the HTML itself, and not just relying on the 301.

631
01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:25.709
Brent D. Payne: So you guys would be really wise to go update your crunch, base techstars, etc.

632
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:26.110
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah.

633
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:31.587
Brent D. Payne: Sites that you can change from Google House to go house. Okay? And that goes to everybody.

634
01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.310
Brent D. Payne: Alright. Who's next?

635
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.520
Lilliana Robinson: Graham.

636
01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.600
Brent D. Payne: Gift. Graham.

637
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:43.600
Brent D. Payne: join once. Yeah.

638
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.199
Kevin: Hey, Brent?

639
01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.480
Brent D. Payne: They are great. What do you guys do? So.

640
01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:56.850
Kevin: So we are in the process of pivoting. But we're converting digital gift cards into nft memberships for independent restaurants, to drive loyalty

641
01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:59.060
Kevin: and guest identification.

642
01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:05.690
Brent D. Payne: Love it. We work very closely with Race for quite a while. Until George moved to Florida.

643
01:14:06.444 --> 01:14:14.619
Brent D. Payne: So we aren't working with him much anymore. And he also was associated with some pretty crazy things that happened in Chicago around a different startup.

644
01:14:14.670 --> 01:14:16.990
Brent D. Payne: But anyway, so

645
01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:21.730
Brent D. Payne: I like the idea here. Be careful of fraud. It's really, really, really big deal.

646
01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:23.070
Brent D. Payne: And.

647
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:26.159
Kevin: I used to work for race, so I know very well.

648
01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:30.219
Brent D. Payne: Great. Yeah, alright. So you know everything about it. I'm glad.

649
01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.040
Lilliana Robinson: And would it?

650
01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:36.179
Lilliana Robinson: Is it helpful to go through this website? If you're pivoting like? Would this be a good use of time.

651
01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:41.780
Lilliana Robinson: Or do, you would just want high level advice, since you're not gonna use this as much.

652
01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:46.240
Kevin: Yeah, I mean, we, it's it's still gonna be different. I/O, so yeah.

653
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:47.300
Brent D. Payne: So.

654
01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.350
Kevin: So gonna be the I/O.

655
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:51.949
Brent D. Payne: Sharing with the I/O, so! And you're moving to nfts now, right, that's about.

656
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:52.560
Kevin: Like right.

657
01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.010
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, correct.

658
01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:53.449
Kevin: Acts. Yeah.

659
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:55.689
Brent D. Payne: So let's look at nfts specifically.

660
01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.651
Brent D. Payne: Oh, I just get my tongue.

661
01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:07.240
Brent D. Payne: alright, we're gonna filter immediately.

662
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:12.710
Brent D. Payne: Get the keyword difficulty of being like a 30 or below and see what's left on the nfts.

663
01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:14.070
Brent D. Payne: One.

664
01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.899
Brent D. Payne: Okay, so Nfc news.

665
01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:30.760
Brent D. Payne: And this is, you're doing an nft to subscribe to a restaurant. So what restaurants are using nfts and explain how that works and what the scale is on the nft and restaurant tie in.

666
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:45.009
Kevin: Yeah, so there's really not many right now that are, it's it's very relatively new. So we're we're kind of gearing it towards a purpose to really drive guest loyalty and engagement.

667
01:15:45.596 --> 01:15:49.921
Kevin: So it's a it's a membership type of situation that we're gonna create the nft.

668
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:52.160
Brent D. Payne: Oh, someone who's doing.

669
01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:52.890
Kevin: Provided with it.

670
01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:57.840
Brent D. Payne: I know someone who's selling tickets like culture tickets on the blockchain

671
01:15:58.194 --> 01:16:18.290
Brent D. Payne: and nfts and stuff. May be a great guy to connect you with, so I can't remember his name right now, nor the company but he's being very successful in the Chicagoland area. One of our top clients back in the day was like a a Chicago ticketing broker. Cold coast tickets, to be exact, but I can't remember what the.

672
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:20.100
Lilliana Robinson: Is that Michael Saunders.

673
01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.292
Brent D. Payne: It is. Yes.

674
01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:28.780
Lilliana Robinson: Crazy. I used to work for that company as a coder before they pivoted. They used to be in restaurants that I worked there when I was Captain.

675
01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.504
Brent D. Payne: Oh, well, there you go. Yeah, captain, that that is his name. Yes, captain. So

676
01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.130
Lilliana Robinson: That is crazy. Brett.

677
01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:48.528
Brent D. Payne: He? Yeah, he actually introduced me to Mr. Beast, which I thought was really cool of them to do. And you had to talk to their team, not not him specifically, etc. Alright, we're off on on a tangent. We got time. So

678
01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:51.190
Brent D. Payne: nfts. And

679
01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:58.880
Brent D. Payne: is it gifting? Is it? Restaurants like? What? What is my, what's my filter word here like? What? What is it? Is it going to be restaurants.

680
01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:02.490
Kevin: Yeah, independent restaurants or restaurants.

681
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:04.580
Brent D. Payne: Let me try restaurant, see what happens.

682
01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.129
Brent D. Payne: Know if we're gonna get anywhere here?

683
01:17:08.285 --> 01:17:09.379
Brent D. Payne: No, not really.

684
01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:12.239
Brent D. Payne: But it starts. Yeah. You know, we have

685
01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.469
Brent D. Payne: a hundred.

686
01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:15.660
Brent D. Payne: Yes, not 0.

687
01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.470
Brent D. Payne: What's Fly Fish Club? What is this.

688
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:23.770
Kevin: Flyfish Club is Gary Vee's place, so he's trying to establish the First Nft restaurant.

689
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.560
Brent D. Payne: That's fun.

690
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.569
Brent D. Payne: So can we get Gary v

691
01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.430
Brent D. Payne: terms and static? Can we play off of there?

692
01:17:34.125 --> 01:17:35.640
Brent D. Payne: This is complicated.

693
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.219
Brent D. Payne: We could write for some Gary v stuff. But, Gary, if you would.

694
01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:41.129
Brent D. Payne: might come after you, too.

695
01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:42.820
Brent D. Payne: There's a whole other story about

696
01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:53.120
Brent D. Payne: how I got in trouble with Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift. 22.com once. So be careful on how you go after some of these people, cause they have really aggressive trademark people.

697
01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.460
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, May

698
01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:01.959
Brent D. Payne: Gary might be one of them. Alright, I am going to beg you to get a hold of me. Offline.

699
01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:03.840
Brent D. Payne: And we're gonna walk

700
01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:15.020
Brent D. Payne: through things much more detailed, and spend a lot more time giving me a headache on trying to figure how to get this done right for you. But this is too complicated during this short amount of time. So I'm gonna skip you, Kevin. I'm sorry. Please.

701
01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:15.830
Kevin: Joyce.

702
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:18.644
Brent D. Payne: We can talk about George, and apparently captain. Now, too. Okay.

703
01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.899
Kevin: Yes, love it.

704
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:22.740
Brent D. Payne: Corzo! What do you guys do?

705
01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:26.379
Brent D. Payne: Are you there.

706
01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.509
Jeremy Banning: Hey? We are a Fintech company. Corezal helps. People

707
01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:37.519
Jeremy Banning: know when and where their money is being spent, and how it can be used to work harder for them in their daily lives.

708
01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:43.479
Jeremy Banning: This site here is a landing page. We changed this, maybe 2 days ago.

709
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.590
Jeremy Banning: maybe 2, 3 days ago.

710
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:53.819
Brent D. Payne: Got it. Are you linking out here? No good. Don't be putting Logos on your homepage and then linking out, okay.

711
01:18:54.190 --> 01:18:58.600
Brent D. Payne: I like the Logos really really awesome for like social proof.

712
01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:12.280
Brent D. Payne: But Jp. Morgan and techstars and Vm. Plug and play don't need your links, so do not do that. And you're not. But I see a lot of techstars. Companies do this. You need to be very, very like

713
01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:18.229
Brent D. Payne: conservative with where you're linking out to. And it shouldn't be these. Okay.

714
01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:22.210
Brent D. Payne: this is just brutal man, brutal. Okay.

715
01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:27.390
Brent D. Payne: I get that, we need to have terms and conditions and certain industries. And Yeti Yeti

716
01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:36.279
Brent D. Payne: like, make this load only upon user interaction. Please. Okay, so that we can get all of this crap out of Google's algorithm.

717
01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:45.009
Brent D. Payne: And this thing does not load until you scroll down the page, and then you can load all the terms and conditions and crap that you want down here.

718
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:54.640
Brent D. Payne: This will kill your site if you don't get rid of all of this text, so make it only happen under user interaction.

719
01:19:54.760 --> 01:20:09.879
Brent D. Payne: Put it in an image like there's like a million things you can do but I don't want Google. Seeing this on your pages, we worked closely with unrealistic.com. Now they used to be something else adobe

720
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:13.989
Brent D. Payne: back from one of the techstars company, I think 2013

721
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:15.420
Brent D. Payne: and

722
01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:39.330
Brent D. Payne: they took 7 months to get rid of their terms and conditions. Crap! It was like 3 times longer than this. It was just brutal. We finally figured out a way to do it. I didn't think of. I don't think it was the option for a a upon user interaction. But get rid of this. That is your biggest problem with this page than anything else. Talk to. Your money is also super vague and ambiguous. Don't you know what it means?

723
01:20:39.773 --> 01:20:42.859
Brent D. Payne: It's cute, but it's 2 wings and a prayer.

724
01:20:43.437 --> 01:20:57.339
Brent D. Payne: Versus, you know, plane crashes in the Hudson River. So be mindful of being relevant like I opened with in this entire seminar, because you're not being relevant with this title? Tags.

725
01:20:57.590 --> 01:21:03.719
Brent D. Payne: Talk to your money again. So what is this whole talk to your money thing like what? What? Why are we all in on talk to your money?

726
01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:05.790
Brent D. Payne: That might be.

727
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:32.599
Valentina | korzo: Been here a little bit, and it would have been nice to have the older website. So really, this is a lot of advice that we've received from some of the textors mentor. And it's all about connecting to our customer from like a more emotional lens. So we had a website with all the different sections, and about the product and our mission and vision, and all these things, and we temporarily, since we're preparing for the land, the launch of our app. By end of this month

728
01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:38.599
Valentina | korzo: we decided to have a more taser type of landing page that we're going to be using across different

729
01:21:38.905 --> 01:21:46.550
Valentina | korzo: social and marketing channel. So that's why this one is not intended to like really tell you much, because it's going to be a company.

730
01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:50.190
Valentina | korzo: Other different efforts on, you know, the whole go to market.

731
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:51.270
Valentina | korzo: But

732
01:21:51.710 --> 01:21:56.810
Valentina | korzo: for our actual official, we're working on the actual official website that's going to be

733
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:59.370
Valentina | korzo: released soon, maybe in a couple of weeks from now, too.

734
01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:07.919
Valentina | korzo: So we will. I'll definitely hole in your word, and we'll definitely bug you after that main website is launched, so we can have some of your feedback.

735
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.469
Valentina | korzo: But going back to the

736
01:22:11.284 --> 01:22:30.879
Valentina | korzo: going back to like the section of you were saying like the terms, and how heavily regulated it is. It is something we do struggle to. And even if even if you go to our blog, not anymore, but even below. Like the blog post, we had at least closure in the past about how this is. Educational content not meant to be doing financial advice. Da da da.

737
01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.560
Brent D. Payne: Hi.

738
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:37.691
Valentina | korzo: So how do we? How do we go about that? We thought cause we never! I never even thought this could hurt our.

739
01:22:38.210 --> 01:22:47.069
Brent D. Payne: Yeah. So everything I told everyone to stop doing upon the user interaction scrolling because Google can't see it. I want you to do that instead.

740
01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:51.200
Brent D. Payne: So put it under code that is only

741
01:22:51.480 --> 01:23:04.590
Brent D. Payne: visible upon user interaction, some type of Javascript thing or a G query thing or something. I'm not a coder. But that's what you're looking for. And then it still shows up on the page for the humans.

742
01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.049
Brent D. Payne: because the humans need to see it, or else. All of the lawyers freak out.

743
01:23:08.549 --> 01:23:15.559
Brent D. Payne: But it doesn't need to be there for the search engines. So let's get that removed. Be careful.

744
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:20.920
Brent D. Payne: because some of your partnerships will require that some text shows up. We're also gonna audit you.

745
01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:22.640
Brent D. Payne: And so

746
01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:29.099
Brent D. Payne: you should work with your partners because, for example, with the Mls. And real estate stuff.

747
01:23:29.553 --> 01:23:45.310
Brent D. Payne: On real estate.com had to be very cautious about, you know, when they were using content from the Mls. There had to be a certain disclaimer on there, and the Mls audits it. So they see their text on the website. Because they're scraping the web, grabbing this stuff.

748
01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.750
Brent D. Payne: they and they don't see the disclaimer.

749
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:50.230
Brent D. Payne: Then you get in trouble. So

750
01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:58.239
Brent D. Payne: you know, you're gonna need to have a fairly decent programmer. Look at how you're gonna do this. But the secret to this is put it under

751
01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:02.210
Brent D. Payne: upon user interaction, and then communicate well

752
01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:10.212
Brent D. Payne: with your suppliers or lawyers, or whatever on what you guys are doing in case they're doing some type of automation to

753
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.650
Brent D. Payne: to to audit you. Okay.

754
01:24:14.096 --> 01:24:16.813
Brent D. Payne: so that's the biggest thing. Do talk to me in 2 weeks.

755
01:24:17.050 --> 01:24:21.209
Brent D. Payne: As for the talk to your money thing, I'm not a brand marketer. I

756
01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:30.739
Brent D. Payne: I see ones and zeros people like whatever like, if that's what you guys want to do, that's that's awesome. I don't like it because it's not relevant.

757
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:33.210
Brent D. Payne: So we need to find some

758
01:24:33.230 --> 01:24:35.890
Brent D. Payne: some way to win on both.

759
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:43.060
Brent D. Payne: so that you guys can get the brand message that you want, you know. Speak to the warmth and fuzzy feelings of people's emotions

760
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:46.059
Brent D. Payne: and also get, you know.

761
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:51.300
Brent D. Payne: the math and science people. Probably a lot of finance people

762
01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:55.182
Brent D. Payne: to to your pages as well. So

763
01:24:55.930 --> 01:25:04.083
Brent D. Payne: you know. Relevancy need relevancy. I don't see it here, but it's a landing page, and it's for a different purpose. So talk to me. In 2 weeks I'm moving on

764
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:05.260
Lilliana Robinson: Brent.

765
01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:05.710
Brent D. Payne: Yep.

766
01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:08.999
Lilliana Robinson: Since we only have 3 min left. Could we just open it to any questions before.

767
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:09.710
Brent D. Payne: Oh, yeah, sure.

768
01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:10.570
Lilliana Robinson: We wrap.

769
01:25:10.570 --> 01:25:13.619
Brent D. Payne: Go, guys hit me with your QA.

770
01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:20.528
Lilliana Robinson: Does anyone have any questions? Anyone we didn't get to? Specifically, I wanna open the floor for you guys.

771
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:23.909
Lilliana Robinson: anything that Brian can help you with before he leaves. Yeah, go ahead.

772
01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:28.740
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah, so our site using the client side rendering.

773
01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:34.729
Snow Lee / Runbear: And then, yeah, as far as I understand, as far as I I know Google sees that.

774
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:37.870
Snow Lee / Runbear: But we tried with the A. A.

775
01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:41.184
Snow Lee / Runbear: H. Ref. And I don't think they'd see.

776
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:43.165
Brent D. Payne: Or what's your brand, or what's your

777
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:44.470
Snow Lee / Runbear: Rum, Rumbert.

778
01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:45.400
Brent D. Payne: Run there!

779
01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:49.639
Snow Lee / Runbear: floppair.com, and yeah rumbale rumbale dot I/O.

780
01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:50.120
Brent D. Payne: Like here, but.

781
01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.620
Snow Lee / Runbear: It will be redirected to the primary. Yeah.

782
01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.150
Brent D. Payne: Okay? So

783
01:25:56.210 --> 01:26:03.329
Brent D. Payne: Google does read Javascript. Okay, Google has a a system to do this. So one, they come to your page.

784
01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:08.670
Brent D. Payne: They determine whether your page is worthy or not to have Javascript done.

785
01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:10.420
Brent D. Payne: and that's a huge

786
01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.980
Brent D. Payne: hurdle right there

787
01:26:12.090 --> 01:26:14.779
Brent D. Payne: and then they'll come back with a Javascript reader.

788
01:26:14.850 --> 01:26:22.369
Brent D. Payne: and read the page from the Javascript reader, the Javascript reader still does not interact with the page.

789
01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:31.410
Brent D. Payne: So that's still a huge difference. Google can read the Javascript, and all the cool things you have as long as it's loaded in the Dom.

790
01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:38.030
Brent D. Payne: But if you need to interact, they no longer are going to see any of that stuff. I don't like Javascript

791
01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:39.859
Brent D. Payne: content that matters

792
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:47.030
Brent D. Payne: because you have to get past the first barrier of entry of. Are you important enough to send out the Javascript crawler.

793
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:48.430
Brent D. Payne: and for a startup

794
01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:50.659
Brent D. Payne: you don't want to be in that situation.

795
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:54.679
Brent D. Payne: so hydrate your pages from next Js.

796
01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:00.749
Brent D. Payne: Make sure you have very little things in Javascript that that are important. Like, don't put nav and javascript, etc.

797
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.500
Brent D. Payne: And then go from there.

798
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:04.380
Brent D. Payne: Okay?

799
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.950
Brent D. Payne: Great change. Yeah.

800
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:06.590
Lilliana Robinson: And so.

801
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:07.350
Snow Lee / Runbear: Thank you for that back.

802
01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:14.039
Lilliana Robinson: Dan, from web. Video, do you have any questions? Because I feel like yours? Is super relevant to this. And we didn't get to you?

803
01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:15.599
Lilliana Robinson: Or does he have to drop.

804
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:41.774
Dan Ponomarenko: No, I'm here. Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, I I do actually have a question. I I brend, I I I do have some mark digital marketing the ground myself. So and I we already like we already have like keep. We already did the keyword search. We already did the keyword allocations. We already have some content strategy in place with

805
01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:52.790
Dan Ponomarenko: you know, commercial intent versus in a in, in in intentional or informational intent. My question is regards to keyword. Can you believe cannabilization?

806
01:27:53.200 --> 01:28:12.479
Dan Ponomarenko: Because I talk with different agency, and some of them saying that E, like. So, for example, you have a target keywords that most of your competitors are ranking off right. And we have specialized industry pages for like feature by feature. Right so, and we using this keywords on this particular page.

807
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:31.459
Dan Ponomarenko: But the same time what I did before I use the same keywords on for my home page or any other pages. do you think like like? And Edges is usually saying that it's kinda cannibalize if you use the same group of keywords

808
01:28:31.650 --> 01:28:34.370
Dan Ponomarenko: between multiple pages.

809
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:47.487
Dan Ponomarenko: and they offer us some like very unreliable keywords with the like low keyword search which is, I don't know if it's like really true, because I don't see that much

810
01:28:48.732 --> 01:28:50.600
Dan Ponomarenko: effect of like

811
01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:58.360
Dan Ponomarenko: that. New keywords that, like brand new compared to our target keywords on the home page.

812
01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.350
Brent D. Payne: Here's an example of you.

813
01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:01.619
Dan Ponomarenko: Organization. It's a, it's a thing.

814
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:13.609
Brent D. Payne: Yes, so perfect example of this is right here in Google Search Council. If you don't have Google Search Council set up for your site should have started with this, go get Google, search, console. It is a direct line of communication from Google.

815
01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:18.420
Brent D. Payne: How do you know about cannab cannibalization? In other words, Mo, you have multiple pages

816
01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.959
Brent D. Payne: on your site

817
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:21.640
Brent D. Payne: ranking for the same stuff.

818
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:27.630
Brent D. Payne: How do you find it? How do you know it's occurring? Easy Google search, console. Pick the query that you're trying to target

819
01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.049
Brent D. Payne: and then go to your pages. Report.

820
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:36.300
Brent D. Payne: this is heavily embedded real data. So please don't screenshot this heavily in Bennett for April's.

821
01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:50.360
Brent D. Payne: They are getting 178,000 impressions to the apron's page. The essential brown apron is a product. Page can't really get rid of that. That herbal garden. One is another one, but the home page. Here is another term.

822
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:53.029
Brent D. Payne: There's another page that also rings for aprint.

823
01:29:53.060 --> 01:30:06.179
Brent D. Payne: Now, should we freak out and go? Oh, my God! Like where you have 2 pages ranking for the same thing? No, because there's only 1,700 impressions happening on the homepage. Who cares?

824
01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:24.579
Brent D. Payne: A 178,000 is the impressions for the all aprons page who's winning here? Obviously the all aprons page. So that's the one we want to focus on. When we get into a much more difficult scenario like their new knife knives or knives, chef, chef knives, etc, we get into a situation where

825
01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:49.709
Brent D. Payne: we have a bit of more of an issue. Okay, now, this is 26,000 29,000 impressions and 53,000 impressions. This is true cannibalization. Why? Because you have a high percentage of the impressions going to 2 different pages that are very similar. Knives and chefs knives. You have clicks at 43 and 20. So again, very, very tight a knife here.

826
01:30:49.750 --> 01:31:04.280
Brent D. Payne: this should be resolved. How do we resolve it way? Too much time for me to be able to handle for you. But you want to pick a word for here and pick a word for here. You gotta do some research find out which one's which. But this is true cannibalization.

827
01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:09.316
Brent D. Payne: the one before. But the lower percentages is not okay.

828
01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.059
Brent D. Payne: hey, Fred.

829
01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:12.099
Lilliana Robinson: One. Yeah, yeah.

830
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:14.710
Brent D. Payne: Okay, this is not a big deal.

831
01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:18.079
Brent D. Payne: because these are products. You can't get rid of them.

832
01:31:18.564 --> 01:31:24.080
Brent D. Payne: Although great tip here for you guys, if you were to link to the

833
01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:25.490
Brent D. Payne: on

834
01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.240
Brent D. Payne: this page

835
01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:44.789
Brent D. Payne: all these pages kind of link to each other. Just pick one. You pick all 5 of these and link back to one of these pages, you would also solve the problem of cannibalization, so find the ones that are that are almost cannibalizing each other are cannibalizing each other, and then try and link to one option.

836
01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:46.379
Brent D. Payne: And versus

837
01:31:46.809 --> 01:31:48.789
Brent D. Payne: having a flat link structure internally

838
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:53.590
Brent D. Payne: works better if it's external links. But internal links will make the difference here, too.

839
01:31:53.891 --> 01:32:16.909
Brent D. Payne: We solved a lot of these problems with Groupon, for example, by what we put in the nav and what we put in the footer mostly the nav, in order to solve these internal issues. But they are a very large site, with hundreds of thousands of pages with decent inbound link structure from external. So they are not anywhere near being the same type of of site that you are. But that is, those are ways you can solve it. Love? The question that was awesome.

840
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:20.140
Lilliana Robinson: Question, Dan Brent, do you have time for one more cause? Valeria.

841
01:32:20.410 --> 01:32:23.349
Brent D. Payne: I'm good for another 10 min, and then I need to get out of here.

842
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:23.980
Lilliana Robinson: Amazing.

843
01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:26.310
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, if if you guys want to stay, if you don't, that's cool.

844
01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:56.209
Valeria Brenner: Awesome. Well, Brian, first of all, thank you so much. This was incredibly informative. I am just like I've just been taking notes like the entire meeting. It's been crazy. But I was gonna say, like, SEO is something that I'm not well versed in. And so like, this was a big learning experience for me, and I feel like there are a lot of turns that like flew over my head. And like, while I was googling some things like something new would come up, and I just got torn a lot of different directions. Do you have any kind of recommendations of like a good starting place to really get the fundamentals.

845
01:32:56.746 --> 01:32:57.489
Brent D. Payne: I'll see you now.

846
01:32:57.762 --> 01:32:58.849
Valeria Brenner: Like a crash. Course.

847
01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:03.330
Brent D. Payne: I like the SEO Starter guide.

848
01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.059
Brent D. Payne: by Google.

849
01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.290
Brent D. Payne: why

850
01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:12.210
Brent D. Payne: not only is this tell you a good starter guide for SEO,

851
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:16.140
Brent D. Payne: but it also tells you Google's perspective on everything SEO.

852
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:17.360
Valeria Brenner: Huh!

853
01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:20.389
Brent D. Payne: You gotta know what the speed limit is if you're gonna

854
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:37.490
Brent D. Payne: decide whether you're gonna follow it or break it. Okay? So this tells you what the speed limit is like. I'm best friends with the chief of police in town, so I can go 45 and a 30 and not worry about it. Okay, same thing with Google regulations. You gotta know where you're at and what you need to do.

855
01:33:37.849 --> 01:33:52.389
Brent D. Payne: And then if you choose to break those rules. That's your own choice, but at least you're informed on what they are. So I prefer this one first. It's not a bad read. You can also just chat cpt at a few times. If you wanna like, give some synopsis and do the cliff notes version.

856
01:33:52.887 --> 01:33:56.090
Brent D. Payne: Mars is decent. It gets a little

857
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:59.489
Brent D. Payne: self promoting. That's not bad.

858
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:02.050
Brent D. Payne: Backlinko!

859
01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:08.089
Brent D. Payne: He was pretty good. He's sold recently, so I don't know what his company is like now that he sold it.

860
01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:14.951
Dan Ponomarenko: Alright! Where's a where's checklist I used before from several like from Sam Rush. I think it's pretty decent

861
01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:22.640
Brent D. Payne: Same rush is good search engine land or search engine journal. I like overall for decent info

862
01:34:23.251 --> 01:34:25.619
Brent D. Payne: but really, you know.

863
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:27.540
Brent D. Payne: anything

864
01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:33.500
Brent D. Payne: looks like most anything that shows up for SEO starter guide is not bad. Your Sam Rush is right here.

865
01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.110
Brent D. Payne: you know, but anybody can make these now, because

866
01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:46.050
Brent D. Payne: with the Lms like this, one's pretty good. It does cover a lot of stuff. It's kinda just quickly, quickly scrolling through.

867
01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:55.720
Brent D. Payne: So, Dan, I I'm impressed. I like your your guide. Read the Google one first and just pick one that you like if you get bored flipped to a different one. Okay.

868
01:34:56.235 --> 01:35:02.619
Brent D. Payne: it's SEO. So it's not gonna be like super unfrailing. But I won't be too bad. Okay.

869
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:04.750
Valeria Brenner: Awesome. Thank you, sir.

870
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:06.542
Brent D. Payne: Careful. Be careful on

871
01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:12.230
Brent D. Payne: careful in reading too many blogs on SEO, cause

872
01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:16.160
Brent D. Payne: you'll start to get confused and wonder why we don't agree on anything

873
01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:19.519
Brent D. Payne: like we don't have the recipe to the Colonel's chicken.

874
01:35:19.670 --> 01:35:36.650
Brent D. Payne: We just eat a piece of chicken, and we're like, yeah, kind of feels like there's some flour in here, a little bit of red pepper flakes, and we go do it like it's like hell's kitchen like when they try and mimic chef. Gordon Ramsey's stuff right.

875
01:35:37.150 --> 01:35:42.439
Brent D. Payne: Like we. We don't know what the hell we're doing exactly. We're getting it together generally.

876
01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:47.410
Brent D. Payne: So you'll see a lot of conflicts and and opposing opinions in the industry.

877
01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:48.450
Brent D. Payne: So

878
01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:56.785
Brent D. Payne: Google, so source of truth, Google always will tell you what to do to improve the users. Blah blah blah. But

879
01:35:57.510 --> 01:36:01.270
Brent D. Payne: You know they're going to be all about content. Content is King blah blah blah.

880
01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:15.100
Brent D. Payne: They're also not going to lie. They might say something today and then tomorrow, change something and not tell you for 10 years. They're very good at that, but they're not gonna lie in the moment that they say it, because it's too much of a legal risk for them.

881
01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:22.019
Brent D. Payne: Too many people are involved. So listen to Google, Google has a really good podcast called Search off the record.

882
01:36:24.150 --> 01:36:25.880
Brent D. Payne: which I like as well.

883
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:27.640
Brent D. Payne: so more interesting.

884
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:28.460
Valeria Brenner: Really.

885
01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:36.819
Brent D. Payne: so and you get to learn the personalities of the people that are involved in Google search console as well.

886
01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:41.099
Brent D. Payne: so they're very, very, very, very nerdy people.

887
01:36:41.488 --> 01:36:55.949
Brent D. Payne: I like Gary a lot. But he's more my personality. He's very blunt, bold, rude, like just aggressive Guy. John Mueller. Super nice, but a little too nice, and then they got something. Spliff can't remember his name right now.

888
01:36:56.577 --> 01:37:00.001
Brent D. Payne: That's a little more alt if you would.

889
01:37:00.970 --> 01:37:02.370
Brent D. Payne: let's see what else.

890
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:07.009
Brent D. Payne: Anyway, this isn't a bad one. I'll put in the chat so you guys can go look at it.

891
01:37:07.777 --> 01:37:12.150
Brent D. Payne: Again, Google is, gonna tell you from Google's perspective. So

892
01:37:12.370 --> 01:37:18.889
Brent D. Payne: pay attention to who the author is, pay attention to who's writing, giving the the advice. Everyone has.

893
01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:22.880
Brent D. Payne: you know, a motive. So be careful. Okay.

894
01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.480
Brent D. Payne: Alright. What else? Any other questions.

895
01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:35.300
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, we have time for, like one more question. Let's see, like talks lexer Travaris. All the companies we didn't get to do any of you have any questions.

896
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:37.180
Lilliana Robinson: or are you good to go.

897
01:37:37.730 --> 01:37:40.100
Lilliana Robinson: or anyone? We have time for one more

898
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.330
Lilliana Robinson: jump all.

899
01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:44.410
Brent D. Payne: Alright! We.

900
01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:46.720
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: Email, I think we're working. Yeah.

901
01:37:46.720 --> 01:38:11.999
Brent D. Payne: Yeah, yeah. So shoot me an email Brent at loud Us. If I don't answer in 24 HII won't see it. So I get about 300 emails a day. So hit me again. Brent at you know. Sorry Brent's calendar.com for booking meetings with me. Don't book more than 30 min. If I blow you off, it's because I do have paying clients keep coming back. I won't blow you off 3 times in a row, but I might get you once or twice. And

902
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:28.130
Brent D. Payne: I love all you guys. You are amazing people. I love entrepreneurship. I would never, ever, ever go work for the man again. So I love what you guys are doing. And I pray that a high percentage of you guys are successful, and for those that aren't

903
01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:51.310
Brent D. Payne: figure it out like you'll try third, fourth, fifth company from now you'll nail it, and it's still better than making 12 bucks an hour somewhere. Okay, so congrats on all of you for making it this far techstars. I'm super proud of you. I wanna help you as much as I possibly can. I got a business to run to. So okay, talk to you all soon, hopefully. Okay. And.

904
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.840
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you.

905
01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.349
Brent D. Payne: I'll talk to you guys later. Alright, see? You.

906
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:54.920
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, thanks for your time.

907
01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.929
Brent D. Payne: Thanks, my friend, talk to you later.

908
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.710
Lilliana Robinson: Bye.
