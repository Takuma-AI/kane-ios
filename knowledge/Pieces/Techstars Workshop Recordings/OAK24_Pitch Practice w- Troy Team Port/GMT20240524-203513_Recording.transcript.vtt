00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.600
Lilliana Robinson: That you can get your feedback. Okay, cool. Go ahead.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.520
Circle Plus: Let's set up here real quick. Okay? Great. So my objective, for I'm using the video.

3
00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.389
Circle Plus: Go first in the order of the video, the peach.

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.590
Circle Plus: and then the Q. And A, my objective for the videos to showcase my objective for

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.060
Circle Plus: the

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.570
Circle Plus: each presentation is to entice. And then, finally, my objective for

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.060
Circle Plus: the Q. And A is to validate.

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, entice. Let's go. You got 60Â s. Entice me.

9
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:45.929
Circle Plus: Alright! So, as a founder, I realize that in as much as I understand what I'm supposed to do I still have a hard time trying to figure out what my Kpis should be.

10
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.680
Circle Plus: Over the past few weeks we have been speaking to innovators who like us

11
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.759
Circle Plus: of this problem. And this is what they're telling us.

12
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.379
Circle Plus: More often than not.

13
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.340
Circle Plus: Kpis, to them seem to be arbitrary.

14
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.649
Circle Plus: bolted, bolted on, or just outrightly inappropriate for their business

15
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.759
Circle Plus: at a minimum. The price they pay for this is 3 to 4 days spent every month making updates. When a report is due.

16
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:21.100
Circle Plus: They also don't like budgeting almost $25,000 a year for multiple applications that do a a bit and pieces of the same job, if at all.

17
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:35.459
Circle Plus: Ultimately we decided to tackle this pain points by powering founders toward the right kpis for the businesses using an easy to use command center that guarantees they always have. They're always on top of their game

18
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:52.120
Circle Plus: when they don't have the answers, we are there to help them anticipate what they should track or visualize while giving them actionable insights instead of bland summaries. Dear fellow founder, if your metrics matter to you, you should sign up for psychoplast today.

19
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.830
Circle Plus: first draft of something, everyone for your previous.

20
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.610
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

21
00:01:58.485 --> 00:01:58.780
Circle Plus: More.

22
00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.380
Lilliana Robinson: In.

23
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So it was a little bit long, and it was a little bit boring.

24
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.970
Circle Plus: Well, Clay.

25
00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:06.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't check.

26
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.880
Circle Plus: No, no.

27
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Brian, I.

28
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.500
Circle Plus: Here's my take! Let me.

29
00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let me try something. I'm gonna just make some stuff up on the fly. You ready.

30
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.410
Circle Plus: I'm ready.

31
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What gets measured gets done.

32
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:29.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I've heard that from investors all the time. My problem is, I don't necessarily what know what to measure as the Kpis for my business. It's so frustrating.

33
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Enter circle plus

34
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:43.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: circle plus is the tool that will help you marry the investors, requests, and your kpis to help you measure the right things to help you grow your business.

35
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's like having a coach in your pocket.

36
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:57.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Maybe you raise up your phone like a coach in your pocket who's helping you identify the right things to measure blah blah blah! I kind of forgot what the rest of the pitch was, but

37
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I does that opening resonate with you.

38
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.514
Circle Plus: Oh, yeah, it does. I can see also.

39
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You to have passion, and I need you to do something that's going to get their attention right.

40
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So like, you know, I love the phrase, what gets measured gets done. I believe in it firmly.

41
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But then then to say like.

42
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't. But I don't know what to measure. So how am I gonna ever be successful?

43
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I am so glad circle plus exists.

44
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It helps me identify, you know. Blah blah blah blah blah.

45
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.839
Circle Plus: Gotcha like, okay?

46
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And tell it with passion.

47
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.860
Circle Plus: And all right.

48
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You were just sort of reading, and Lolly gallery being along. And if you practice that way, that's how you're going to come off on stage.

49
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: This is why I want you guys. And you were standing up, obviously. But this is why I want you to stand up and deliver it with passion

50
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: when every time you practice. Because, however, you practice, that's how you're gonna perform on stage.

51
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.850
Circle Plus: Gotcha! Alright.

52
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That is like.

53
00:03:55.836 --> 00:04:03.433
Circle Plus: Yeah, that's actually very helpful. Thank you. That's my job this morning. But yeah, back to the drain board again. Thank you.

54
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right. Let's go.

55
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.063
Lilliana Robinson: Gift, Graham.

56
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:15.039
Kevin: Hey, hey, Troy? Alright. So objective is for the pitch is to state the problem the video is gonna show.

57
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Hold on, hold on! The objective should be given from the perspective of the audience.

58
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what is the objective? You you're stating? The problem doesn't help anything you want that. What do you want the audience to receive.

59
00:04:28.912 --> 00:04:32.540
Kevin: We want the audience to know that there's a problem

60
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.480
Kevin: like a serious problem.

61
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, so maybe, can we make it stronger than just know? There's a problem. We want them to feel the problem that restaurants have right.

62
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.760
Kevin: Yup!

63
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You see the difference between state the problem and make the audience feel the restaurants problem.

64
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.990
Kevin: Yes. Yeah.

65
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

66
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.410
Kevin: Okay.

67
00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:00.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So we want the audience to feel the restaurants problem. And then what are you doing with the video and with the with the QA.

68
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:12.650
Kevin: Yup, the video is showing how that problem is actually being solved. And the QA is about traction. The the market play the size of the market, and milestones.

69
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:23.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So again, I'm gonna tweak those. And I'm gonna say, it's not showing how it's solved. It's convincing the audience that we have the solution to the problem, because it's all about the audience.

70
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:32.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then the third is convincing the audience that we have the traction and the milestones to take over this market.

71
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:40.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Because if the audience believes there is a difficult problem, you have a great solution, and you have the traction they're going to invest in your company.

72
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm just taking your words and twisting them a little bit, but it really makes a difference.

73
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.530
Kevin: Oh, it's it's amazing. Okay.

74
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright!

75
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.850
Kevin: Lost!

76
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Make me feel the restaurant's problem and pain.

77
00:05:52.050 --> 00:06:01.770
Kevin: Okay. So just a quick preference. The song that we're gonna have going into this is gonna be from cheers. So that will make sense when I start the first paragraph. So here we go.

78
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.470
Lilliana Robinson: Wait! Wait! Wait, Kevin, is that something that you know Troy? Neil and I were having this.

79
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh yes!

80
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.639
Lilliana Robinson: Than yesterday. Okay.

81
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, my God!

82
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.700
Lilliana Robinson: Someone older than him would know it. But all of us who've heard it we keep telling him we don't understand.

83
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All the investors will know it. I watched it every Thursday night in college as it came out. It was awesome.

84
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.615
Lilliana Robinson: There we go! Alright.

85
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Term Sam coach, what do you? What do you want.

86
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.280
Kevin: Like time.

87
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.690
Lilliana Robinson: It breaks.

88
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.140
Kevin: Okay, here we go.

89
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:44.970
Kevin: So for those of you that might not recognize that song that was just playing. It was a famous TV sitcom called Cheers and Cheers was a bar that was run by Sam. The reason people went to cheers was because of the relationships that Sam built

90
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:58.809
Kevin: this year the restaurant industry is forecasted to reach a record of 1.1 trillion dollars in the Us. Economy that will employ over 15 million people. Yet 4 out of 5 restaurants will fail within 5 years.

91
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.440
Kevin: Let that sink in.

92
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:11.750
Kevin: I'm Kevin Malley, and I'm the CEO of Gift Grant, my co-founder, and I built over 30 restaurant relationships with digital gift cards and generated nearly half a million in transactions.

93
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:28.559
Kevin: Our over 10 years industry, experience, has given us the insight to know how the lifeblood of the restaurant industry is built on frequency and to have frequency. It's the restaurant's job to build relationships. But you can't build relationships. If you don't know who your customers are.

94
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.759
Kevin: and with the restaurant staff turnover being more than 80% restaurants have no idea who their customers are

95
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.560
Kevin: for an industry that's built on relationships. That's a recipe for failure

96
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:51.449
Kevin: at Giftgram. We're empowering restaurants with a platform that will forever change how restaurants interact with their guests so they can have meaningful relationships that make them want to return.

97
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.639
Lilliana Robinson: That was 1 20.

98
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. It was long.

99
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.350
Kevin: And I.

100
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:10.783
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It was a little meandering. So there's a line in the Cheers Song. That's you know. What's the line that you're gonna end with we all we know who you are. We know.

101
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.540
Kevin: Everybody knows your name.

102
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:22.368
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Everybody knows your name exactly. Everybody knows your name. See! Not only do I know this, the sitcom. I know the land, the words to the song, Liliana,

103
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.480
Lilliana Robinson: I'm so glad to hear it. This is what we're hoping for. So 100.

104
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So so yeah, people.

105
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: yeah, it. It was a very popular sitcom.

106
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: okay.

107
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: everybody knows your name.

108
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: God. I gotta think about how to. So I know what I want to do. I just don't know how to say it.

109
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: This is hard.

110
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:15.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Something about so you opened with cheers, you know, hopefully that brought back some great memories, the sitcom cheers where everybody knew your name. Sam built the bar based on relationships. They built an entire sitcom based on the relationships.

111
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, in today's restaurant industry

112
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:29.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: with high turn. You know that today's restaurant industry, today's giant restaurant industry with 15 million workers and whatever bazillion dollars.

113
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: God! I don't know how to do this.

114
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Today's restaurant industry has become transactional.

115
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:53.139
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: People come in. They get the meal they leave. They leave a review on, on on yelp. If you're lucky, and that's it.

116
00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:02.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We want to change that. We want to go back to the days of cheers. We want to give rest. We are giving restaurants the power and the tools

117
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to be able to

118
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:13.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: actually know your name and not just your name, but your preferences where you like to sit, what you like to eat, how you like to, how you like to

119
00:10:14.148 --> 00:10:17.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know how you like to order the order in which you like to order.

120
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We are making restaurant dining, a personal experience. Again.

121
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: let me tell you how we do it.

122
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We've developed relationships with 30 restaurants. Blah, blah, blah, blah blah.

123
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I this is far from perfect. But it's a little bit of a different line that feels to me

124
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:40.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like with some refinement, can be more engaging, and you can get there shorter.

125
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.386
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Life is in place about 30 years weekly. It's a restaurant exchange gift. Yes,

126
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:56.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so, and the real thing that you're the. So the pain. Let's just distill it down to what you said. You want the audience to feel the restaurants pain

127
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:11.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and the restaurant's pain. I'm not trying to give you a pitch. I'm just trying to articulate. The restaurant's pain is that today's restaurant experiences become transactional. How do I get more turns of my tables? How do I get more? You know? How do I ring the register more often.

128
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:17.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And the problem with that is that we've lost the personal experience that the people at Cheers had.

129
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so we don't have the loyalty, and we don't have the frequency.

130
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: which is the thing that really makes restaurants win

131
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so

132
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:38.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: incomes gift. Gram, we are the tool that lets you really understand. Your customer lets you know their name, lets you know their preferences and lets you build the relationship with them. So the next time

133
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: they make a reservation

134
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:47.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you'll know they prefer to sit at the tape if they prefer a booth near the window, with flowers on the table.

135
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:57.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and that's what's going to get you the deep relation as a restaurant tour, the deep relationships, the returning customers, the frequency, and ultimately the profitability you want.

136
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know is that does that feel right?

137
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.341
Kevin: Yeah, no, that's that's right. I will.

138
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.110
Kevin: I will refine this. That's great. It's really great.

139
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:18.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So this is why this is for everybody. By the way, this is why identifying the objective makes creating the pitch so much easier.

140
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:43.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I was struggling, and then I said, well, wait a minute, he said. The objective was to make the audience feel the pain of the restaurant, and so I went back and focused on that objective. And I said, Okay, what is the pain of the restaurant and the pain of the restaurant is, I'm torn between these 2 worlds of wanting to chat everybody up and have. But I need more transactions. And so how can I do both? And this lets us do both. Alright, that's our time. We're going to the next one. Liliana's keeping us honest.

141
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.310
Lilliana Robinson: Danny.

142
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.603
Danny Pereira: Cool, so

143
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:56.859
Danny Pereira: objective for the intro is for the audience to understand how the current way of doing things is hurting their work and introduce the concept of a decision relationship manager.

144
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:06.720
Danny Pereira: The video is to show how it works and how it feels. Using this drm, and the QA. Is showing how we will execute, and where we are now.

145
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Awesome.

146
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Show me the the errors of my ways.

147
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.415
Brian Simiyu: Yeah.

148
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.084
Danny Pereira: 2Â min I can see my screen. Alright.

149
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:28.620
Danny Pereira: Life is all about decisions. There are big ones like what should I name my newborn? And there are small ones like which function I use for this presentation.

150
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:36.350
Danny Pereira: But every decision matters, especially in our work lives. We're being trusted to decide how to best use our time on a daily basis.

151
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:49.590
Danny Pereira: But instead of being focused on deciding the right product, direction or client strategy, we're spending our time contact switching between busy work and all these ad hoc requests, the average knowledge worker spends 41% of their day doing remedial busy work.

152
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.610
Danny Pereira: Let me repeat that 41% of their time, 2 days a week.

153
00:13:53.750 --> 00:14:10.289
Danny Pereira: Reclaiming those 2 days is why we're here introducing a new category of software called decision relationship managers or drms. Our drm links to all your different communications and apps, picks up on the incoming requests and tasks, and your AI copy can accomplish them just like you would.

154
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.569
Danny Pereira: So instead of having to do the busy work, you just get to decide how it's getting done.

155
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:24.929
Danny Pereira: Our go to markets, gonna borrow from tried and true playbooks like slack and base camp. We're making our end users fall in love with us first and turning them into evangelists as we develop conductor for teams

156
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:32.640
Danny Pereira: by enabling a world of more decision makers and less busy workers. We want to create a world where most problems can be solved with one click.

157
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.222
Danny Pereira: That is it.

158
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.729
Lilliana Robinson: Was 110.

159
00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:51.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So generally I think it's it's good, Danny, it's the best I've heard you articulate this so far. So I think it's generally pretty good a couple of things to push back on.

160
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:59.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I call bullshit when you say all. And I, when you say most decisions can be this decided with one click.

161
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't think that. You know I do like the I,

162
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:11.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and as soon as I call bullshit on something, then it I tend to question everything else.

163
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right? So.

164
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But I do think you're opening right? You talked about the 40%.

165
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Imagine a world where 40%

166
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: a veered

167
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:26.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: hang on.

168
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what was rewrite? Reread your first couple of lines.

169
00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:39.439
Danny Pereira: Life is all about decisions. There are big ones like, what should I name my newborn? And there are small ones like which font I use for this presentation.

170
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:46.479
Danny Pereira: but every decision matters, especially in our work, lives where we're trusted to decide how to best use our time on a daily basis.

171
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Keep going. The 40%.

172
00:15:49.440 --> 00:16:01.540
Danny Pereira: But instead of being focused on deciding between the right product direction or client strategy, we're spending our time context switching between busy work and ad hoc requests. The average knowledge worker spends 41% of their day doing remedial busy work.

173
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:05.470
Danny Pereira: Let me repeat that 41% of their time, 2 days a week.

174
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:12.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. So what if you shortened up the examples a little bit before you get to the 41?

175
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then you said 41%.

176
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What would

177
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the remedial busy work? 40 burns of remedial busy work?

178
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: these are perfect tasks

179
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for today's AI engine

180
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to

181
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:41.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: take off our plate. What I'm trying to do. I'm not going to get the words right. Here's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to say that there is stuff that we do that is repetitive

182
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:56.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: fact based finding. What font did you use in that presentation? Where does this thing exist? What is the total number of re? What's the revenue from last March. All of those examples are things that you don't need to be a human to answer.

183
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: There are things that the computer can answer.

184
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And if we could have the computer answer.

185
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:07.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: scan and answer your inbound text email slack

186
00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:12.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for those fact-based things, we can free up 41% of your time

187
00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: giving you 2 days a week back

188
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to spend on the important decisions.

189
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It both makes employees more productive.

190
00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And

191
00:17:24.391 --> 00:17:30.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know what the right word here is but and happier in their jobs, cause you're doing the more interesting work right.

192
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:30.750
Danny Pereira: Yeah.

193
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:50.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what I would try to do cause it's not totally clear how you're doing this. What I would try to do. I like your beginning opening, I'd shorten a little bit. So you get to the 41 sooner and then say, and the thing about that 41 is, it doesn't require any intelligence. It just requires memory and guess what computers are really good at that

194
00:17:51.220 --> 00:18:11.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: our tool can answer roughly, 41% of the requests that come in. So what does it do? It scans your inbound, slack email text. It finds the things it knows the answer to, because it's not an opinion. It's a fact, it replies immediately freeing up 41% from knowledge workers giving those knowledge workers 2 full days a week back

195
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in time to work on the things they really care about.

196
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We make them more productive

197
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and

198
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: much happier in their jobs.

199
00:18:22.251 --> 00:18:24.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: This is gonna change the way we think about knowledge work.

200
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.531
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let me show you how it works.

201
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.345
Danny Pereira: Yeah, that is phenomenal. Okay, yeah, I will adapt.

202
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So focus on that problem. And I really like

203
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:47.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the idea of as opposed to saying it can answer all your questions or most of your questions, which is where I started to call bullshit. I was trying to differentiate because there are questions that are fact based, and fact questions that are opinion based

204
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: as a human. I don't want to answer another fact-based question ever again.

205
00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.250
Danny Pereira: Pair.

206
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right. I want the computer to do that for me.

207
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.025
Danny Pereira: Yeah, exactly.

208
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Me when you have something interesting to ask.

209
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.305
Lilliana Robinson: Alright. We gotta move on, Danny.

210
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.829
Danny Pereira: Yes, yeah. Thank you so much. Troy. Yeah.

211
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.580
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, Burhan, you're next.

212
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:19.207
Burhan Syed: Alright. So the objective of my. So I'm gonna go pitch video, then QA. Objective. The pitch is to feel the problem of dentists by putting them in the shoes of a dentist who owns their own clinic

213
00:19:19.904 --> 00:19:24.020
Burhan Syed: the video is supposed to show how the product works

214
00:19:24.373 --> 00:19:25.789
Burhan Syed: and the Q, and a.

215
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Them that it's a better solution.

216
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.719
Burhan Syed: Yep.

217
00:19:29.694 --> 00:19:34.709
Burhan Syed: and the QA. Is addressing go to market, and how we're going to scale.

218
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Kay.

219
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.159
Burhan Syed: Cool. So I'll start with the patch.

220
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:50.019
Burhan Syed: Dmitry is a Ukrainian immigrant who moved to the Us. Not knowing any English, became the youngest ever dual board certified dentist in his specialty, and now owns 2 dental practices.

221
00:19:50.150 --> 00:20:02.880
Burhan Syed: Dmitry isn't just dentists. He's also a business owner, and he makes money when his receptionist Rhonda schedules appointments with patients. The issue is, Rhonda can only take one call at a time, manually scheduling every single appointment.

222
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:08.300
Burhan Syed: As a result, 30% of the calls coming into the clinics are missed, and most are never returned.

223
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:14.690
Burhan Syed: On top of that Rhonda has no time to call and remind patients who are due for appointments, but haven't booked one yet.

224
00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:28.979
Burhan Syed: So Dmitri has a problem. How can you maximize the number of deployments? But when Rhonda, who's trying her best isn't able to. My name is Bernard, and I'm the CEO for Rhonda AI. Dmitry is actually my co-founder, Alan's dad, and we built Rhonda AI to solve his problem.

225
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.720
Burhan Syed: Rende AI is a receptionist that works 24, 7, schedule every single patient's appointment.

226
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:44.530
Burhan Syed: and cost a fraction of the cost of a human receptionist. The best part. Nothing changes for the patient. They still call the clinic. But now Rhonda AI answers, here's a video showing our product that work.

227
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.999
Lilliana Robinson: 102.

228
00:20:47.320 --> 00:21:04.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. So I like the concept. It starts out a little slow. It doesn't have the signature, Troy big opening, but when you but it has a great payback when you say Dimitri is actually my co-founder. You know the Allen's father. Blah blah blah, so that I part I really like.

229
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:12.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think it's a big mistake to name the Re, the real human receptionist, Rhonda, and to name the AI Rhonda. It's very confusing.

230
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.290
Burhan Syed: Yeah, bye.

231
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:19.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I would have very different names for a very different name for the human receptionist.

232
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Bye,

233
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is there a way we can get their attention. So they don't fall asleep.

234
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: before

235
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.381
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: they get to the payoff here.

236
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Trying to think about it.

237
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What if I'm gonna make stuff up. I have totally the wrong numbers. I don't even know if I'm in the right order. Magnitude.

238
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.790
Burhan Syed: Hmm.

239
00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:02.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Dentistry is a much bigger business than anybody realizes in the Us. Alone. It's 18, you know, 18.5 billion dollars a year.

240
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:11.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The interesting thing about dentistry is that every single one of those dollars came from an appointment, and every one of those appointments had to be scheduled.

241
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and until now it had to be scheduled by a human

242
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: at both sides. 2 humans.

243
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:30.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: as someone who runs dentist dental practices. It's very expensive and aggravating to have to staff reception desks with humans to take appointments.

244
00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:38.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Sure, there are new. There are some places where they could schedule online. There are new tools that allow you to schedule online.

245
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But most of the patients still like to talk to a voice.

246
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:43.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

247
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: we invented Rhonda AI

248
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:52.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Rhonda sounds like a human acts like a human is indistinguishable from a human, but

249
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: she doesn't get paid an hourly wage.

250
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:04.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Blah blah blah! Not only can she receive the calls she can make the outbound calls to schedule. She can make the outbound calls for the reminders.

251
00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Rende! Aye.

252
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know just a brainstorm.

253
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.117
Burhan Syed: Okay. I just wrote all this down. Thanks. Troy.

254
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Being recorded. So you can go back and listen to the recording.

255
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.620
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, you don't have to take your time to write it down. Any final question, Bernhard, before we move on.

256
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:29.560
Burhan Syed: Do you think it was boring up until the point that we sort of brought it back to? It's Alan's dad.

257
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.739
Burhan Syed: Yeah. Now.

258
00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:40.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Someone's. Dad made it a little interesting from a story perspective, but it didn't make it interesting from an investor perspective. So I was trying to get make it. I was trying to feel the pit like

259
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:51.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know how big dental industry is. It's some billions of dollars, and like, when you think about it, every single one of those was scheduled with a human and usually a human on 2 humans, one on each side.

260
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's a bottleneck. We're gonna eliminate that entire bottleneck.

261
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.020
Burhan Syed: Okay, boom.

262
00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:17.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then. And I'm using the technique of, you know, if you watch late night TV, the you know, there's infomercials. And then there's like, Wait, but if you buy now, you also get the bamboo steamer and the Chinese Ginsu knife. So the the Rhonda equivalent of that is, it takes the people out of that. But wait. Rhonda can also

263
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:32.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: confirm appointments. Reach out to people who don't have appointments. Stop all of it, you know, without ever missing a phone, and she won't get tired of dialing the same number over and over again, right like there's there's a there's a bamboo steamer in there.

264
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.150
Burhan Syed: Go ahead.

265
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.550
Burhan Syed: Thank you, Troy.

266
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.359
Lilliana Robinson: Alright tune, day.

267
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.070
Tunde IO : I try? So yeah, we're doing the order of the pitch, the video.

268
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:51.430
Tunde IO : and then the QA. The objective of the pitch is, we want the audience to feel the problem of the compliance teams and financial institutions.

269
00:24:51.808 --> 00:24:59.209
Tunde IO : The objective of the demo is to convince the audience that our platform is the solution to the problem and is already doing that.

270
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:06.160
Tunde IO : And the objective of the QA. Is to create the confidence in the audience that we have the right team to not only solve the problem but kill the business.

271
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay. And you're gonna do your pitch with a lot more energy than you did that little delivery right.

272
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.460
Tunde IO : Sorry. Sorry I wouldn't.

273
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.379
Tunde IO : I need. I need to sleep. But yeah, okay, let's go

274
00:25:19.705 --> 00:25:20.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Go.

275
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.675
Tunde IO : Yep.

276
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:31.880
Tunde IO : So over the last 10 years, digital payments in Africa have grown by 1,500%, due to the adoption of financial products unique to Africa, such as mobile money, Ussd and agency banking.

277
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:41.579
Tunde IO : Unfortunately, the necessary prevention processes and anti-money laundering studios have not kept up space with this growth. And so the compliance teams of financial institutions are struggling to keep up.

278
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.580
Tunde IO : So what's the result of all of this

279
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.609
Tunde IO : payment for it is out of control.

280
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.280
Tunde IO : one in 2 Africans, at risk of, have been victims of payment. Fraud.

281
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.010
Tunde IO : The Regulators are not happy about this, and they're clamping down hard

282
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:59.490
Tunde IO : in Nigeria, where we have launched over 4,000 regulated entities, have lost their operating license in the last 15 months.

283
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.680
Tunde IO : So we have fraud pushing from one side, and the Regulators pushing from the other side.

284
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.140
Tunde IO : The compliance teams don't know where to go to for help.

285
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.499
Tunde IO : Well, we're excited to rescue

286
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.809
Tunde IO : Webex is the one stop toolkit. That simplifies compliance in Africa.

287
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:15.990
Lilliana Robinson: Does work.

288
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The end.

289
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, but.

290
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.820
Lilliana Robinson: 8Â s. So you still had a little bit of time.

291
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: A couple of things. One is, you're gonna need a transition into the video.

292
00:26:28.404 --> 00:26:32.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You know, can be something as simple as let's take a look, but you need some sort of.

293
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.620
Lilliana Robinson: Let me show you.

294
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let me show you whatever

295
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

296
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think you're gonna have to speak a little more slowly.

297
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.829
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I had a little trouble

298
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:50.179
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: with, and part of this is your accent. Your accent isn't bad, but you do have some accent that made it hard

299
00:26:50.360 --> 00:27:03.705
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for me to. I had to pro it. Just I need a little more time to process the words, and when you start speaking really fast you put the words together, and I I miss some stuff. So I think you're gonna have to slow. So we're gonna have to cut out a little bit of the

300
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:10.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, you're gonna have to cut out a little a couple of words.

301
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you had a bigger opening before.

302
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: if I remember correctly, you had said something like, you know.

303
00:27:20.841 --> 00:27:24.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't. I guess it's one out of 2, you know.

304
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Half of all of the people in Africa have experienced.

305
00:27:29.412 --> 00:27:32.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Fraud! It's not fraud. What do they experience. What do you call it?

306
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:34.550
Tunde IO : Payment for.

307
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Payment fraud

308
00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:43.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then you had a personal experience that said, you know I've been. I've been subject to that twice.

309
00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:49.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: losing, for you know the and and didn't you have a number on what the average fraud was? Wasn't it a big number.

310
00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.698
Tunde IO : There wasn't a number on that on that pitch.

311
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.390
Tunde IO : we had gone with 40%

312
00:27:57.912 --> 00:28:03.660
Tunde IO : we we thought the the bigger number of 1,500%, or like the the growth of

313
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:19.750
Tunde IO : of payments. Because better. And then I think that was because we were trying to. So. The reason why I moved away from that we was it was the the feedback was that it was heavily centered on, on my experience, and from a customer perspective, and we wanted to communicate the pain point for.

314
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:20.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Got it.

315
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.739
Tunde IO : The the financial institution.

316
00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:31.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Totally got it. So. By the way, on the 105, or 1,005, I did do a bunch of math in my head, and but I think it's much simpler to say over Tenx.

317
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:33.489
Tunde IO : Like good.

318
00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's grown by over 10 x

319
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and it's simpler, it's faster, and there's less less translation. So

320
00:28:43.220 --> 00:29:01.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And in general, people don't do well with big numbers. So if you have a percentage 40, it's better to say 4 out of 10 or 2 out of 5. People can do that in their head. But like 40 confuses people. So anyway, and if you're in thousands of 10 x would be way better. So your opening line is what.

321
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:11.160
Tunde IO : So the the opening line currently is over. The last 10 years digital payments in Africa have gone by now 10 x

322
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:17.570
Tunde IO : due to the adoption of financial products that are unique to Africa, such as mobile money, Ussd. And Agency banking.

323
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:24.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright I would flip that around. I don't know why, but I would say.

324
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, something like

325
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Africa has a plethora

326
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:42.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: of financial tools for sending money. There's SSD, there's us mobile banking. Blah blah! Blah! Blah! Blah! It's grown by over 10 x in the last 10 years.

327
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The problem is, so has the fraud.

328
00:29:46.740 --> 00:30:00.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You see, the fraudsters have come in, Bob. Boom! Boom, boom! Boom! Boom! And the Regulators are clamping down on it, having closed 1,500 into, or whatever it was, 400 institutions in the last 15 months. This is a real problem.

329
00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: incomes Red Fee.

330
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let me tell you what we do.

331
00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:15.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We are a tool that lets the financial institutions lock down their systems so that they are less susceptible for to fraud, so that we can reduce that prop. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

332
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I I don't know if that resonates with you or not.

333
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but

334
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it feels more

335
00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:26.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: story like to me.

336
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Africa has all these things that you guys haven't heard of.

337
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's grown by 10 x in the last 10 years.

338
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's awesome.

339
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But so has fraud.

340
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And that's a real problem.

341
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:46.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You use your fact about how many, how many have been shut down due to fraud in the last 15 months?

342
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.009
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And you say

343
00:30:48.230 --> 00:31:01.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: we gotta do. You know the wheels are coming off the bus, whatever your expression is. But incomes. Reg, we are the tool that can prevent this from happening, we're already installed. And how many institutions are you in.

344
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.800
Tunde IO : 17 or 18. Now.

345
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:11.258
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Already installed in 18 institutions. Do you have any data you can share? So like when I have

346
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:20.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I use the Euro Amazon web networking tool for Wi-fi, and it reports to me how many.

347
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:27.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: how many things it's blocked every day, and how many, how many phishing attacks it's blocked like, do, could you say? And we've already blocked

348
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 2,700, you know. Fraudulent attacks.

349
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:37.690
Tunde IO : We. We talked a bit about the efficiency of the the the software in the in, in the in the demo.

350
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:40.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah.

351
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:50.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Anyway, if if you have data that you could throw out in one short sense, you know, we're in 17 institutions, and we've already blocked over 4,000 fraudulent attacks.

352
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! We're running out of time. Lillian is keeping us honest

353
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:56.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: alright.

354
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.129
Tunde IO : Thanks, Troy. Thanks. Everyone.

355
00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.070
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. Nelson.

356
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But I on reg file, I just want to say to you guys.

357
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:17.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you may not like my approach, that's totally cool. You have to do something that is going to be authentic to you, and that you're going to be passionate about and be able to deliver. Go back and listen to it. You decide I won't be insulted at all if you don't take any of my stuff

358
00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: alright.

359
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.350
Tunde IO : Thanks, joy.

360
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:32.500
Nelson Mitchell: Alright, hey? Everybody. So it's gonna go pitch. Video. QA objective of the pitch is, introduce the problem.

361
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.390
Nelson Mitchell: make make it personal for people.

362
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:42.529
Nelson Mitchell: give them a sense of the scope, get them really pissed off about it, and then give them hope at the end that afford help can help

363
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.430
Nelson Mitchell: that make sense.

364
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:47.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, get them pissed off. Get me pissed off. Let's go.

365
00:32:47.554 --> 00:32:48.859
Brian Simiyu: I'll do my.

366
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.149
Nelson Mitchell: That I got it.

367
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:56.964
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let's make this fun, guys. I've been doing this all for the last 2 weeks. It feels like it gets boring. If I don't make it fun. Let's go.

368
00:32:59.480 --> 00:32:59.880
Nelson Mitchell: Okay.

369
00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.929
Nelson Mitchell: I know something everyone in this room has in common.

370
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.570
Nelson Mitchell: We have all overpaid for our medical care.

371
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:14.689
Nelson Mitchell: How do I know? According to the Federal Government. One out of every 2 medical bills has an error.

372
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:26.939
Nelson Mitchell: It doesn't matter if you have insurance, it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor. Everyone has a personal story about a trip to the doctor that ended in an unexpectedly high bill

373
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:43.239
Nelson Mitchell: in the Us. We have the most expensive healthcare in the world in 2022, out of pocket expenses topped 471 billion dollars. That's about $2,800 per household

374
00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:50.259
Nelson Mitchell: for the average person. It's difficult to know when you're being overcharged, or what you can even do about it.

375
00:33:50.940 --> 00:34:05.129
Nelson Mitchell: What if you had an expert by your side helping you to fight this unfair system, double, checking every bill for errors, making sure you get every discount you deserve, and connecting you to a loan if and when you need it.

376
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:11.470
Nelson Mitchell: afford health. Is that expert we're building AI enabled tools that catch errors in real time.

377
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:17.470
Nelson Mitchell: We help we. We provide help and guidance, so you'll never overpay, for your care again.

378
00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:22.309
Nelson Mitchell: Afford health helps you simplify, save, and take control.

379
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.380
Nelson Mitchell: Thank you.

380
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. I think it's all. I think it's awesome.

381
00:34:28.478 --> 00:34:35.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I have one comment for you. Which is, there is some confu potential confusion

382
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: between

383
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:57.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: out of pocket expenses and what's yours and overpaying for medical care where your insurance company pays too much or your company pays too much. And so I wanna make sure you make it crystal clear that this is about saving the consumer from paying too much of their deductible out of pocket whatever blah blah blah is.

384
00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:24.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and so what I would encourage you to do is in the back half. So the front half you did that we all had bills out of pocket, but I'd every opportunity you have to put in the words, you know, like you're deductible, or you're out of pocket, or you're like, make it clear in the back half that you're talking about the consumer. You're making this a personal thing. It's not about saving your company money. It's about saving you your money.

385
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:41.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I think it's really the matter of inserting like a word like, you know your deductible payment, or you're out of pocket pay like you're gonna say it. It's inserting what that word deductible or out of pocket, or whatever term you want a couple of times in that back half, and you'll have nailed it.

386
00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think it's really great. I was pissed off listening to it.

387
00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.789
Nelson Mitchell: Awesome. Thank you. Thank you so much.

388
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.799
Lilliana Robinson: Good job, Nelson. Okay, let's go to talks.

389
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:10.759
David Akinyemi: Awesome. Alright. Our objective, for we're going pitch video. And then QA. The objective for the pitch is that people in the crowd, resonate and feel the pain of companies and employees.

390
00:36:11.123 --> 00:36:22.109
David Akinyemi: The goal of the video is to sh show people and teach them how our solution works and how it solves this problem. And then Q. A's to address concerns and questions that we're hoping

391
00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:26.520
David Akinyemi: we can kind of train people to ask from the pitch and the and the video.

392
00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:27.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

393
00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I want to feel the pain.

394
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:39.669
David Akinyemi: Company issue 270 billion dollars per year and stock based compensation to attract and retain talent.

395
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:52.049
David Akinyemi: aligning the values of employees, executives and shareholders, but when the stock goes down it causes employees to churn which forces companies to spend billions in stock refreshers and increases shareholder dilution.

396
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:58.220
David Akinyemi: I was one of these employees that received half of my compensation in stock, and I said, Mama, I made it.

397
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:04.939
David Akinyemi: My stock dropped 40%, ruining my plans to buy my first home.

398
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:15.530
David Akinyemi: we learned Mark Cuban had the same issue back in 1999, but turned to Goldman Sachs to create a financial insurance for him which saved him billions after the.com bubble exploded.

399
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:23.559
David Akinyemi: Stock volatility impacts 5.2 million employees. But, unlike Mark, most don't have the tools and knowledge to protect themselves.

400
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:30.490
David Akinyemi: I'm David Eckeni, CEO of Tux, or democratizing sophisticated financial insurance for the everyday employee.

401
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:34.649
David Akinyemi: We reduce employee turn by protecting their downside here's Tux.

402
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Maybe it's cause you and I.

403
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:39.460
Lilliana Robinson: Now Martin.

404
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:45.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Maybe it's because you and I have talked so much, and I understand your business so well. But that was pretty clear.

405
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm curious what other people think.

406
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.910
Lilliana Robinson: David and I work together.

407
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:50.330
Nelson Mitchell: Awesome.

408
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.150
Lilliana Robinson: And I said the same thing. It's really good, David.

409
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:53.950
Lilliana Robinson: the best.

410
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.410
Tomiwa E: So. The description of the business.

411
00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.338
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, you've really nailed it finally, like, it's taken you a while, David.

412
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but I feel like you've nailed like that is what your business is.

413
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:11.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and you have a good balance between your personal experience. Mark Cuban, 5 million

414
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: employees, real dollars like I.

415
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think it's great. You deliver that with passion. And you have a great video, and you're gonna do awesome.

416
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.254
David Akinyemi: Thanks, Troy. Thanks. Everyone.

417
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.510
Lilliana Robinson: Alright.

418
00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:30.819
Lilliana Robinson: Positive Finance.

419
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:44.750
Fabien | Positive Finance: Yes, I'm all sick, so I I can't speak too loud. But our objective for the pitch is for people to understand that climate is an issue for businesses.

420
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:58.899
Fabien | Positive Finance: Our video is for people to feel that the product is really easy to use. And the QA is about the business model and then surveys. You know about the market and and so on the market opportunity.

421
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.040
Fabien | Positive Finance: Have you heard of climate quitting

422
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:11.070
Fabien | Positive Finance: 40% of Genesee and millennials are ready to chant jobs due to climate concerns

423
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.749
Fabien | Positive Finance: with 14 million that already did it.

424
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:19.639
Fabien | Positive Finance: I'm one of them. I left my corporate job to work on climate.

425
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:27.699
Fabien | Positive Finance: Hi, I'm Fabian CEO of positive finance. We offer a new type of employee. Financial benefits.

426
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.640
Fabien | Positive Finance: social and climate. Friendly

427
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.660
Fabien | Positive Finance: employees can save, invest

428
00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.860
Fabien | Positive Finance: and donate with employer machine.

429
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:40.859
Fabien | Positive Finance: And of course this helps businesses retain talents and meet sustainability goals.

430
00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:44.120
Fabien | Positive Finance: The timing for this is perfect.

431
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:49.399
Fabien | Positive Finance: since climate regulations are on the horizon adding pressure on businesses.

432
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.990
Fabien | Positive Finance: We must act now.

433
00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.649
Fabien | Positive Finance: It's a 10 billion market opportunity growing at 14% year over year.

434
00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:00.539
Fabien | Positive Finance: And we just launched our first client during textiles.

435
00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.639
Fabien | Positive Finance: But let's let's hear directly from them.

436
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:12.670
Lilliana Robinson: So that was 54Â Si love how slowly you spoke, Fabian. It helps us be able to understand a lot more.

437
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:13.570
Lilliana Robinson: Yep.

438
00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: No, your articulation was good. Can you redo your first sentence?

439
00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.879
Fabien | Positive Finance: Have you heard of climate quitting.

440
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah.

441
00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.310
Fabien | Positive Finance: Son of Gen. Z.

442
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:30.120
Fabien | Positive Finance: 40% of Gen. Z. And millennials are ready to change jobs due to climate change.

443
00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:31.699
Fabien | Positive Finance: We 14 million.

444
00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I would change that.

445
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:35.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I don't like opening with a question.

446
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:50.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because you said, Have you heard about quiet clinic? Quite climate quitting, and I'm like, I don't know, have I? And am I supposed to raise my hand? Am I not? What am I supposed to do? It's sort of awkward. Now I don't know. Wait, he's still talking. Okay. I'm going to sit on my hands. That was weird.

447
00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:55.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? So I would prefer you to say something like

448
00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: climate quitting.

449
00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You may never have even heard of it.

450
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but 40 million Gen. Z's are contemplating it today.

451
00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let me tell you what it is

452
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right. And here's what happens

453
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:19.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: when you do that. If someone hasn't heard a climate quitting, they're like, Wait, I've never heard of climate quitting 40 million people. What what the hell! I better pay attention.

454
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: By the way, the other group who has heard of it is like.

455
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:28.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, I know what climate quitting is, I'm really smart. He just complimented me. I like him

456
00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:37.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right, and so it plays both ways for you, so I would much prefer you to deliver it that way than asking the question, and having that uncomfortable moment.

457
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I still don't. Well.

458
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I still don't fully understand what climate quitting is.

459
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:50.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That might be okay. That might be part of what you're setting up.

460
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:51.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But, like.

461
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, I

462
00:41:54.515 --> 00:41:56.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: if I go to work for techstars.

463
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm going to work for techstars like.

464
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: am I upset? Cause what

465
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:12.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like? I understand. I may not want to work for the coal mine, because, or the power company that's burning coal, cause, you know. But like

466
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't understand, I don't. What I didn't get from this is how this applies to most white collar jobs.

467
00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:21.340
Fabien | Positive Finance: And okay.

468
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:24.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm just, and maybe it doesn't.

469
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But you said 40 million. That's a really big number.

470
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Is that 40 million worldwide or 40 million in the Us.

471
00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:35.309
Fabien | Positive Finance: In the Us. Yeah. But did it? Actually, it's not just winning.

472
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.200
Fabien | Positive Finance: you know.

473
00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:38.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So

474
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:49.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: do you have the opportunity to explain it a little further, so can you explain it to me real quickly? Forget about the pitch. Just explain it to me. What exactly is climate? Quitting that 40 million people have done.

475
00:42:50.170 --> 00:43:02.367
Fabien | Positive Finance: But yeah, people that are not aligned with what their company is doing, related to environment and are leaving for another company. That is, you know, more friendly to it, and that can be, for there I don't know.

476
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:07.779
Fabien | Positive Finance: Business model what they are doing or supply chain, or whatever. But that's all really acting on it.

477
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:15.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So 40 million is like a third of the adult population in the Us. The working population.

478
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:16.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh.

479
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.100
Fabien | Positive Finance: One full.

480
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:19.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: One fourth. Okay, that was my guess. Okay. So.

481
00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.000
Fabien | Positive Finance: It's a.

482
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The patio.

483
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.880
Fabien | Positive Finance: No 14, I mean

484
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.099
Fabien | Positive Finance: one full

485
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.400
Fabien | Positive Finance: millions.

486
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, 14 million, not 4 d. 1 million.

487
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:32.640
Fabien | Positive Finance: Right.

488
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, 14 millions, about 10% of the adult population.

489
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.307
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, that's still a big number 14 million.

490
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:44.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so you're gonna have to work on alliterating that 14 months. So

491
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:53.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you believe that 14 million people have already quit their jobs because they they feel their company isn't doing enough for the climate.

492
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yes. And where? Where's that data come from?

493
00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:03.038
Fabien | Positive Finance: Yeah, different reports. But yeah, Deloitte, Kpmg, and even Mackenzie, you have. You have

494
00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:22.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay. I don't know what else you could cut out, but you would add a lot of credibility if you were to say so. If you opened up, you know you may not even know what climate quitting is. But according to Deloitte, Kpmg, and Mckenzie, over 14 million people have already quit their jobs because of it.

495
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.600
Fabien | Positive Finance: Okay. Hmm.

496
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:33.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right. Let me tell you what's going on here. Blah! Blah, blah blah blah! And you got to get that 14, 1 4 really clear. I thought you said 40.

497
00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:49.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And and you want to say 14 million in the Us. Because I was your again your credibility. I'm like 40 million people. Gen. Z. Are there even 40 million? Gen. Z's like this is what's going through my head. You want to make sure you're crystal clear. And one of the worst things. This is for all of you.

498
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:55.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: One of the worst things you can do is put something out there that causes the listener to question your veracity.

499
00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:01.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right? So if you say something that doesn't make sense, it'll question everything else in your pitch

500
00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:15.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? And it's part of David. I think it's part of why yours was so good, yours was so crystal clear. There was nothing like you had facts you had. It was it was crystal clear. There was nothing I was questioning along the way.

501
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so figure out so like by by

502
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:26.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: supporting the 14 million Gen. Z's have already quit their jobs. According to Mckinsey

503
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Deloitte, but that.

504
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.609
Fabien | Positive Finance: Maybe we go with 12. That will be easier.

505
00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:42.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Maybe you say more than 12 million. Yeah, 12 would be a better, a better word to say more than 12. According to Mackenzie, delay both more than 12 million have. I think that'd be great. Alright! Give it some thought.

506
00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:43.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Thanks for so much.

507
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:45.310
Fabien | Positive Finance: Yeah. Yup.

508
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:53.609
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, we have 10Â min left. So it's a jump ball between Vincent and Pardo. Neither of you volunteered. But you're here.

509
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.710
Lilliana Robinson: so.

510
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Parto I worked with already today. So let's do, Vincent.

511
00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.060
Lilliana Robinson: Let's do, Vincent.

512
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:00.390
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: Alright.

513
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:04.030
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: let me screen share real quick.

514
00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:16.299
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: So we actually do video first, if you guys are okay with that, I'm gonna play that real quick cause. It says the context for the problem. And then our objective in this is the solution with the pitch.

515
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.529
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, we have time.

516
00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:35.229
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: A typical payday loan has an Apr. Of about 400 millions of Americans. Learn this the hard way each year. There are more payday lenders than Mcdonald's. Less than half of Americans can access prime credit despite 80, never missing a payment.

517
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:55.790
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: Why, lenders have an incomplete credit picture that introduces human bias and errors. Today, one in 5 Americans have a credit report error hurting their score, which ultimately reduces their ability to borrow, while credit unions want to help their community. They don't have the technology to lend on more inclusive data.

518
00:46:55.790 --> 00:47:10.620
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: rental payments and 1099 gig work. None of that counts in the traditional system. Fintech are trying to help, but 0% buy now pay. Later solutions are unsustainable like those Vc subsidized $5 ubers.

519
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:25.160
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: Fintech aren't banks. So they struggle to scale due to a lack of capital access. Lenders are saying No. When they could safely say Yes, costing the economy billions annually. Well, we found a better way.

520
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:45.230
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: and that's where I'm already on stage. And I say so, what is that better way? Gov. Prime makes it easier for lenders to provide more capital more safely to more consumers. According to the Federal Reserve, traditional lenders miss out on billions that penny lenders reap every year from 17 million Americans. Just because humans can't assess complex risk.

521
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:53.899
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: Dubpr for lenders combines industry expertise across explainable AI loan decisioning and debt capital into a single regulator. Friendly solution.

522
00:47:53.900 --> 00:48:16.930
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: Our explainer. AI uses a vast amount of data from a variety of inclusive sources to accurately predict those who will pay back their balance. So now, gig work, wages, rental payments, phone bills. It all counts after being featured in a report on AI by this week in Fintech and Visa, we're finalizing a 9 figure, debt, deal with the largest credit bill or card to safely expand into unsecured credit cards with a growing wait list

523
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:40.419
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: with 164 billion dollars paid every year, and credit card interest and fees. Lending is the lifeline of the global economy, and we expect to double it. Join us and revolutionizing and modernizing the lending industry by expanding credit products for millions and providing meaningful yields to capital providers. Sorry I was supposed to this one's supposed to be dead. Actually, we're removing that last section to make up some time.

524
00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:43.863
Lilliana Robinson: Okay? Well, with 105. So it's fine as is.

525
00:48:44.390 --> 00:49:01.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So I think it's pretty good. And I do like that. You did the video first, and then you did the explainer. Second, I think what you're gonna have to address is in the QA. My initial question is, yeah, but you're gonna let more more you know more people through who aren't gonna pay.

526
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:17.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And you know, how. How are you gonna result? So I think you're gonna have to dig deep into that objection like, okay. But if we start lowering the bar for credit, we're gonna get a bunch of people aren't gonna pay in our returns. And blah blah, and you're gonna have to address that in the credit in the QA.

527
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:25.059
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: And we address that immediately by saying, the Vp of data, science and experience has verified our math, and he says nobody's taking the approach that we are, and that it works.

528
00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:28.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah.

529
00:49:30.693 --> 00:49:33.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: now you. Maybe you get him to invest.

530
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I work.

531
00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:37.770
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: Come on as an advisor. He is technically he has.

532
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:41.989
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: No, he hasn't. If he he's not an investor, if he hasn't put his own money at risk.

533
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.729
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: That's fair.

534
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: There's a big difference.

535
00:49:45.450 --> 00:50:00.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: now being able to say he's an advisor is is interesting. But yeah, no, I think it was pretty good, and I it. It's a little unfair, because we had the whole picture. We got to see the video and then see your comments. But I think those 2 paired really nicely together?

536
00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:00.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah,

537
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I I just refine your delivery.

538
00:50:05.645 --> 00:50:10.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You've got to slow down at points. You gotta figure out what you want to emphasize, and I think it would be a better pitch

539
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: if you cut out 10% of the words.

540
00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:17.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and you were able to slow down in your delivery.

541
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:25.929
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: Would you agree that this section down here about joining the revolution to modernize lending like, it's not really meaningful. I think I can just drop all of that and slow down across everything else. Right?

542
00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:26.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah.

543
00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:27.990
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: Okay, I'm gonna drop.

544
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:31.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The fluff for for all of you, Fluff is. No, it it

545
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:39.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: generally doesn't work. So yeah, let's strike it alright. You guys are in a great spot. I'm excited. It's gonna be fun to see you all in person, too.

546
00:50:41.062 --> 00:50:42.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Any last minute questions.

547
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:56.179
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you so much for your time, Troy. I know you've given us so much every time with the 24 companies, and your brain is probably full of pitches, so just know that it we noticed, and we really really appreciate it.

548
00:50:56.450 --> 00:51:05.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Thank you it, but it is fun, and the most fun part for me is watching all of you progress and get better and get more confident.

549
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:10.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and and then watching you on Demo Day, stand up there, and Rocket is awesome.

550
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:13.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so alright be well.

551
00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.960
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you. See you next weekend.

552
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: See you in person next week. Bye.

553
00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.039
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, safe Travels.

554
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:21.530
Lilliana Robinson: Hi, everybody.
