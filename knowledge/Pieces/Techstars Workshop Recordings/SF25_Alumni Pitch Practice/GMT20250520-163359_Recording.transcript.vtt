00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Need to know.

2
00:00:02.173 --> 00:00:18.800
Sambhav Mehta: Nothing. I just started the recording. If we could have both of the alumni, I think everyone knows each other anyways. But if if they want to just introduce themselves other than that just in the chat. If you guys could just drop the order that you guys want to go in, and then we'll get this thing kicked off.

3
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:31.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Perfect, all right. Well, look, Miser Andrew, I'm gonna let you guys take it because I gotta grill the rest of these founders this afternoon on pitch practice, and I met with a bunch of them yesterday. But I'll check in on how this goes, and see if you guys actually do your job right?

4
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Good luck.

5
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.449
Mircea Gogoncea: Amazing. Sounds good. See? You see you later.

6
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.463
Mircea Gogoncea: Alright, do you? Wanna do you wanna kick off the introduction?

7
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.680
Mircea Gogoncea: or should I go first.st Yeah, you you should go. You should do it. Andrew.

8
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:55.499
Andrew Penner | Milo: Alright! What's up, guys? Andrew Penner, founder, and CEO of Milo? We went through techstars, Chicago with Neil in 2023, the end of 23

9
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.800
Andrew Penner | Milo: Since then, you know, raise some money, been growing

10
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:13.419
Andrew Penner | Milo: almost to profitability, which is like my promised land. I'm not the guy who wants to raise a ton of money all the time. But, you know, we just want to run a good profitable business here and still grow quickly, and that's what we've been doing.

11
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:43.089
Mircea Gogoncea: Amazing, amazing. I've also met most of you already. My name is Mirchan. Don't worry about the pronunciation. It's not obvious in English, but I don't mind at all. I went through techstars, Oakland 24. So exactly one year before you, and the last cohort that was called Oakland instead of San Francisco, but very much the same program just on the other side of the bridge.

12
00:01:43.360 --> 00:02:13.249
Mircea Gogoncea: I'm a 3rd time founder. I'm a professional guitarist and a guitar professor at Ucla, even though that's very much a side gig, and only takes about 4 or 5 h of my week. And because of my job as an artist I have coached, and I have performed very many times in a public setting, and you know anytime that Neil or anybody else on any form asks me, what can you help the community with? One of the 1st things that I put down is.

13
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.349
Mircea Gogoncea: you know, public speaking, pitching, and being confident in front of an audience, and all of that. So hopefully, we can derive some value out of that today.

14
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.798
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I remember you killed it when

15
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.679
Andrew Penner | Milo: when I was trying to help out with your pitches.

16
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.900
Mircea Gogoncea: Alright, thanks so much.

17
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:49.110
Mircea Gogoncea: man, appreciate it. Yeah, I remember you are there, and I really appreciate your help. I forgot to say also, you guys will all you've all heard from me already because of the virtual brochure. So you will be using our product cicada. In fact, I would like to take this opportunity to encourage whoever hasn't submitted it, because last time I looked at it yesterday morning, I only had, like 3 out of 10 submissions, and I believe

18
00:02:49.110 --> 00:03:10.270
Mircea Gogoncea: last night was the deadline. That's okay. If you miss the deadline, the only thing that's going to happen is you won't have a chance to review it. So I'm about to do the 1st public draft today, and if I don't have your info, then you'll have less time to tell me what changes you'd like to have to have made. So yeah, and I will be seeing you all at Demo day as well.

19
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.210
Mircea Gogoncea: Alright.

20
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.840
Sambhav Mehta: Awesome.

21
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.020
Meg Hall: You need to submit.

22
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.519
Meg Hall: That's a form that we need to submit.

23
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:38.890
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, you got you got an email from me. If you haven't received it, let me know. I'd be happy to send it again. It says something like what Chloe made me send a specific subject line. That said something like tssf, cicada, tssf, virtual brochure, or something like that.

24
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.370
carloscaglia: We got them a while ago, I think, like last week, or something. So.

25
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.369
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think, like, 10 days ago, something along these lines.

26
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.989
Meg Hall: They? They, when we were prepping us for Demo Day they had us all watch yours so.

27
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.800
Mircea Gogoncea: Nice seen your demo day.

28
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.560
Mircea Gogoncea: I didn't know that I'm really. I'm really proud. I'm really happy to hear that that's awesome.

29
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.150
Mircea Gogoncea: Nice.

30
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.899
Mircea Gogoncea: Alright. So who's gonna go first? st

31
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.069
carloscaglia: I'm happy to run it.

32
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.764
Mircea Gogoncea: Nice, and in the meantime, maybe the rest of the people can put the volunteer list in the in the chat. Just so we have a run of show.

33
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.410
carloscaglia: Is this just like the 1 min spoken pitch.

34
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:52.630
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah. So what we heard from Chloe, is that it's gonna be the spoken pitch the 1 min pitch, and she encouraged us to give feedback both on the presentation style and also on the business itself, because she mentioned that if there are still big questions there is still a little bit of time to workshop the Q. And a. But that all of you have already had your massive session with Neil. And so you know a lot already. Does that sound? Does that sound? Okay?

35
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.325
carloscaglia: Yeah, yeah, cool. Cool with me.

36
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:06.939
carloscaglia: my presentation will probably still lack a little bit, because I'm still like learning it and refining it. So read it. But I'll do my best from a reading point of view. So anyways.

37
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.310
carloscaglia: let's get going.

38
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.340
carloscaglia: So

39
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:22.470
carloscaglia: when I showed the 4 videos, exhorty did for Bayer pharmaceuticals to a producer of a famous agency. He said this would have taken them 3 to 4 months and 150 K. To 200 K.

40
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.599
carloscaglia: It took exhorty 4 days on 4 and a half K.

41
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:38.360
carloscaglia: You see, traditional advertising is collapsing. Last year agencies fired thousands of people, but content demand increased by 200%. That's not a contradiction. It's the failure of the Old Guard and the rise of the new power.

42
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.169
carloscaglia: Our commitment to excellence is why Exodi will lead this charge.

43
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.589
carloscaglia: Last year we delivered 500 piece of content across 30 plus countries with 0 reshoots in record time.

44
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.020
carloscaglia: This is why Fortune 500 brands trust us, and why we've quickly scaled to 20 K. In Mrr.

45
00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.590
carloscaglia: But we're only getting started. Exhort is here to take over the content, landscape and cater to every single direct, to consumer business out there. Thank you.

46
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.359
Sambhav Mehta: Awesome. That was 50 seconds. So we are under the minute. Oh, just one quick note.

47
00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:21.080
Sambhav Mehta: just one quick note before you pitch. If you could. Just quickly say your goals or customers investment talent

48
00:06:21.508 --> 00:06:30.730
Sambhav Mehta: and then also talk about the pitch border. So if you're going video first, st or pitch first.st I just need to note that down. But yeah, this was under the time.

49
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.805
carloscaglia: Alright. I'll give you the context around it. We're just going for customers in this pitch, not investors.

50
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:46.189
carloscaglia: we're using this one to tee up the video. Actually, so 1st I thought I was gonna go video first, st then pitch now decided to go pitch 1st and video and I wanted to use this one as kind of like

51
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.900
carloscaglia: gaining curiosity of the people and then showing a killer video.

52
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.250
Mircea Gogoncea: Nice.

53
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.540
Mircea Gogoncea: Let's start with Andrew. What what are your thoughts.

54
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.549
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I'm imagining that you're gonna use the QA. To talk more about

55
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.640
Andrew Penner | Milo: landscape and things like that, because that wasn't there. But I actually really liked the pitch. I thought

56
00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:16.660
Andrew Penner | Milo: the substance of it was really strong. I think your hook was good. And I think you backed it up well.

57
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.680
Andrew Penner | Milo: and so you you have the social proof. You have company traction, I think that's all great.

58
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.010
Andrew Penner | Milo: The beginning. I found myself just

59
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:53.389
Andrew Penner | Milo: trying to. And and I ended up doing it. So I think it's okay. But I found myself trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle at 1st of. Okay. Oh, that's his brand name. And this is the impact that they're having. So I would be super clear in how you enunciate there and just take your time, your 53 seconds. There, take your time, pace yourself. The beginning of that, I think, is really strong, and you should give it a little bit of extra room to breathe there, so it can really sink in properly.

60
00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:08.200
carloscaglia: Cool. Thanks. Yeah. I want to use the Q&A to go into a little bit more of the process and the details while keeping the 1 min pitch a little bit more more high level. But yeah, the timing is good, and I think I should definitely, as you say, take a little bit more time at the start.

61
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:21.190
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, I want to mention on that note as well. If your text has been approved by Neil and Chloe, and we know from seeing it now that it's only 50, something seconds

62
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:35.529
Mircea Gogoncea: you don't have to worry about. Oh, what if I breathe too long? And I end up at 1 0. 5 will they cut? And they won't cut you off if they've already approved your text, you know. So you know it's it's it's strict, but nobody's gonna interrupt you if you're saying what they're supposed to be saying.

63
00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.739
carloscaglia: Oh, yeah, that's good to know.

64
00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.834
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah. So my only comment,

65
00:08:40.939 --> 00:09:07.239
Mircea Gogoncea: well, I have 2 comments. But 1st of all, yeah, I must admit that I didn't immediately remember what Exordi did before you said it, and as soon as you started saying it, it took maybe 1015 seconds for me to realize sort of what what is going on. What your business does, I know that's going to be explained more in the next sections of the pitch. But

66
00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:25.079
Mircea Gogoncea: if I came in completely with a clean slate where I hadn't read about you because I had read about all of you before, I would have been possibly even more confused. Can you give us the 1st 15 seconds? Again, can I just do the 1st 15 seconds? And this is how we practice in music? We just do section by section.

67
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.850
carloscaglia: True.

68
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.555
carloscaglia: I'm pretty sure that was just the opening bit.

69
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.630
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah.

70
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:44.939
carloscaglia: So say, when I showed the 4 videos exhorde created for Bayer pharmaceuticals to a producer of a famous agency, he said this would have taken them 3 to 4 months and 150 k. To 200 k. Took Exhorde 4 days and 4 and a half K.

71
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:51.660
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, it's good, man, it's good. It's good. Yeah.

72
00:09:53.050 --> 00:10:12.019
Mircea Gogoncea: yeah, I don't have criticism there. It's the sentence is a little long, right? Like. The very 1st sentence is, you're packing. So I know what they're trying to do. You're trying to pack a lot of lexical density, are trying to pack a lot of meaning in a very short time. Right? So my only advice in general is.

73
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:18.569
Mircea Gogoncea: consider breaking it up into 2 sentences, or or or you can practice

74
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:28.050
Mircea Gogoncea: which which words are gonna accentuate and which words are gonna lean back on and and not say them so loud. So when I showed.

75
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:45.539
Mircea Gogoncea: can you? Can you show me? Do you have a text? Do you have it? Do you have it? Can you copy paste? Since you're reading it? Can you put it in the chat. I'm sorry I'm going a little. I'm going a little hard here, but that's what Chloe told us to do to be a little, you know, to go into details here, and we still have quite a bit of time. Right? This goes until 1130, or how long? Okay? Until.

76
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.709
Sambhav Mehta: 1130, yeah.

77
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:57.719
Andrew Penner | Milo: And I'm glad you had a reread it, because just one note I have there, too, that you could potentially do number one, it becomes a lot more clear, I think, if you say just to produce like 1 50 to 200 k. To produce.

78
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.260
Andrew Penner | Milo: and then let that sit for a second

79
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:09.979
Andrew Penner | Milo: after you say, produce, that's your time like, let that number sink in. Let people feel the weight of that. You have time, and then say that same video, you know.

80
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:20.799
Andrew Penner | Milo: cost us $4,500 to produce. Right? So you're creating that nice juxtaposition. And you're giving it time instead of just jumping straight into it. It won't feel like one long sentence.

81
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.280
carloscaglia: Okay. Yeah.

82
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:48.230
Mircea Gogoncea: As I look at the text, thank you for pasting it. As I look at the text in the chat, I know it is the issue. The issue is, there is a lot of characters in a really small short time. There is 4 videos. There is Xori, which is the name of your company. There is biopharmaceutical. There is a producer and the famous agency. There's a lot of nouns. There's a lot of nouns. I understand. You need to pack it. You need to pack it like that because it's a picture. It needs to be dense. But

83
00:11:48.230 --> 00:12:09.439
Mircea Gogoncea: that sentence to me is too long and too many characters are introduced too soon. So if I say, when I go to the hotel that is run by my wife's friend's dog sitter you lost track of who runs the hotel right? So it's a little bit too many characters.

84
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:26.000
Mircea Gogoncea: I would even, you know my my 1st suggestion. There might be a better way to do this, but my my 1st suggestion would be to even go like I showed 4 videos exorted, did so. I showed the producer of a famous agency. 4 videos we did for biopharmaceutical, he said. Like it doesn't have to be, you know.

85
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.460
carloscaglia: Okay.

86
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:52.429
Mircea Gogoncea: In speaking, we do shorter sentences, and we don't worry about repeating as much as we do in writing. In writing. Repeating is a big no-no right? But in speaking this could easily be 2 or even 3 sentences exhorted 4 videos of biopharmaceuticals. I showed them to the producer of a famous agency, he said they would have taken him 3, 4 months. That's so much more clear in my mind. Now you don't have to go that hard.

87
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.179
carloscaglia: No, no, I get it.

88
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.070
Mircea Gogoncea: Lot. But yeah, yeah.

89
00:12:55.787 --> 00:13:04.659
Mircea Gogoncea: and then, if you have a complicated sentence like this, you can make it work by pausing at the right moment. And then you really have to rehearse that when I showed

90
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:17.549
Mircea Gogoncea: the 4 videos that we did for biopharmaceuticals to the producer of a no, it's still too long. Sorry I can't. I can't make it work. I can't make it work. So okay, that's my feedback. Other than that. I think it was great.

91
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.270
carloscaglia: Thank you. Thank you. Guys.

92
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.180
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah.

93
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.410
Sambhav Mehta: Awesome.

94
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.330
Sambhav Mehta: Meg, do you wanna go next.

95
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.490
Meg Hall: Yeah, sure.

96
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.680
Sambhav Mehta: Perfect.

97
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:39.309
Meg Hall: And, Mirja, I'm at that conference that I was telling you about the one we were talking about. I'm at now today. Yeah.

98
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.310
Mircea Gogoncea: Amazing. I hope it goes well.

99
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:46.789
Meg Hall: Thank you. I already got 2 leads this morning, and I've only went down there at 7 am. So it's good.

100
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.840
Mircea Gogoncea: Awesome. Okay? So you might need to drop off after some point right.

101
00:13:51.840 --> 00:14:16.080
Meg Hall: Yeah, after after I go, I'm probably gonna hop. Okay. So the enterprise sales industry is broken and sales teams are struggling to close large deals. We've made it far too easy for sales. Reps to buy a list and spam it. You've probably felt this. Your inbox is flooded with spam messages. Which is why, in the last year, cold emailing response rates are down by more than 30%

102
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:29.739
Meg Hall: for enterprise sales reps who have a limited number of named accounts that they can prospect into spamming, hurts their brand reputation, and ultimately leads the sales, reps to chasing small deals, leaving millions of dollars of revenue on the table.

103
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:38.619
Meg Hall: Well, sales play is the opposite of that. We help enterprise. Sales reps to win bigger deals by being more thoughtful and strategic about how they prospect into large accounts.

104
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:46.049
Meg Hall: We do this by surfacing the latest news and insights, and creating a unique point of view on why that business needs your business

105
00:14:46.610 --> 00:15:01.529
Meg Hall: and then generating personalized slides and documents throughout the sales cycle. Yes, cold emailing is still part one of the ways that we encourage reps to reach out. But it's just one of the many channels that reps can use to deliver a more thoughtful and impactful message. Let me show you how.

106
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.249
Mircea Gogoncea: And do you do video first, st or pitch 1st congrats? By the way.

107
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.130
Meg Hall: Pitch first.st

108
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:14.139
Mircea Gogoncea: Pitch. First, st okay, pitch, first, st video, second. And what's our goal is to get investors or customers or.

109
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.247
Meg Hall: Both I want. I want it all.

110
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.959
Mircea Gogoncea: Give me everything.

111
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.665
Meg Hall: Yes.

112
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:28.009
Mircea Gogoncea: So I have a thought I'll let Andrew go. I have a very short thought.

113
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.520
Mircea Gogoncea: About halfway through the pitch.

114
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:44.329
Mircea Gogoncea: I would still have been confused about whether you're a spam guard or what exactly you do like. I know you. I know I know your product. You've shown it to me, one on one. It's great. I love it. But

115
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.069
Mircea Gogoncea: it's it's just like yours, almost.

116
00:15:47.430 --> 00:16:03.449
Mircea Gogoncea: that you're so worried about people seeing you as a spam tool. I think that for the 1st solid 30 seconds I felt like you were. Gonna sell me one of these like delete me incogni services that like protect your inbox from from spam, and that

117
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.539
Mircea Gogoncea: yeah, not what you do. I understand what they're trying to say, but I would be.

118
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.489
Mircea Gogoncea: I would be careful with that impression. I'm curious to hear what Andrew thought.

119
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:12.500
Meg Hall: That's interesting.

120
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:18.329
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah. And I love coming into this blind, not knowing what you guys do, because it gives me a a

121
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:24.929
Andrew Penner | Milo: pretty blank slate with which to operate. It's interesting because I actually

122
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:42.798
Andrew Penner | Milo: liked a lot of that pitch and always, I mean, I'm sure you guys have heard this from a thousand people. But we're an end of one, right? So occasionally, we're gonna agree with each other or disagree with each other, whatever it might be. And just take our feedback into consideration, maybe nothing more. But

123
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:56.739
Andrew Penner | Milo: I thought actually, I really liked the juxtaposition of here's you know, you laid out a pretty clear world that I think all of us have felt, which is, we deal with this bullshit of spam every day.

124
00:16:57.228 --> 00:17:05.339
Andrew Penner | Milo: And I love the Stat. That cold email reply, rates have dropped by 30% year over year. I think that's a great one. And it's poignant. And again, something we can all feel

125
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.770
Andrew Penner | Milo: I think.

126
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:20.230
Andrew Penner | Milo: where? Where I agree with Mircia is that you might have lingered on that a little too long, and it didn't feel like I got the payoff at the end with how your product totally solves that right.

127
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.579
Meg Hall: The demo comes into play because the demo you get it a lot more.

128
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.510
Andrew Penner | Milo: Okay, that's good cause.

129
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.880
Meg Hall: You want to say hi to everybody.

130
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.590
Andrew Penner | Milo: I found myself.

131
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.806
Meg Hall: Sweat is right here.

132
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:37.200
Meg Hall: Hello, everybody everybody knows she's my co-founder. Okay, go ahead. Keep going.

133
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:46.509
Andrew Penner | Milo: No, I found myself just kind of wanting to close that loop, and I'm not sure it got closed. Maybe the the video or Demo pay pays off on that.

134
00:17:47.183 --> 00:17:57.509
Andrew Penner | Milo: But I think you could maybe trade 5 seconds or something like that of the spam talk, for you know, 5 seconds of a little more detail on the product, and setting yourself up.

135
00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:04.730
Meg Hall: Okay, like a little bit more of like what we do. And you think, moving it up a little bit more like in the talk track so that way, it's clear.

136
00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:14.219
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I think so. Like, I think the 1st 20 seconds I probably wouldn't touch. I think it lays a really nice landscape after you hit with that 30% reply, Stat is

137
00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:20.540
Andrew Penner | Milo: kind of in my mind when I really wanted it to go towards, okay, well, what do you do? And how do you solve that.

138
00:18:21.143 --> 00:18:24.040
Andrew Penner | Milo: And I I feel like it might have dragged down a little longer than that.

139
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.290
Andrew Penner | Milo: I wouldn't be concerned about the time I know it, said 1. 0 5

140
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:37.810
Andrew Penner | Milo: big thing that all of you are gonna do is just rehearse, rehearse, rehearse right. You need to know this stuff cold, and you're not gonna worry about any of the slip ups or pauses.

141
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.280
Andrew Penner | Milo: but save that for once you nail it down. I think that was really strong overall.

142
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.400
Meg Hall: Cool thanks.

143
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:53.359
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, and I have some notes about that for everybody. We can talk about them at the end. Or however, you want about like how to rehearse that like some music principles.

144
00:18:53.724 --> 00:19:00.330
Mircea Gogoncea: In fact, I'll I'll say them really quick. I think you were. You were. You had them memorized right. Meg, like that was from memory.

145
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.819
Meg Hall: No, I don't have a I don't have a memory.

146
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.380
Meg Hall: I was.

147
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.210
Meg Hall: I was reading.

148
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:26.439
Mircea Gogoncea: All right. So I have some suggestions that really helped in my pitch, and these come from music practice the pitch differently. So practice saying it super slow half speed practice saying it extremely fast, and practice starting in the middle, starting in different spots. That's the most. That's how a musician practices.

149
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:53.610
Mircea Gogoncea: and it's easiest. If you take the last bit, you learn that, and then you take the bit before that, you learn that, and then it feels like you're coming home. You're coming to the part that you know the best, because you know the end better than the beginning. Otherwise we always tend to emphasize. If we always just practice the whole pitch, we tend to learn the beginning much better than the end, and that can mess with us like if we lose it, we need to be able to catch it where we where we are. And the only way to be able to do that is to just know every section and be able to start at every section.

150
00:19:53.906 --> 00:20:04.523
Mircea Gogoncea: So I think you know, as you practice it slow and fast, you'll have versions that will be 1 min and 20 seconds. You'll have versions that are going to be 55 seconds. Yeah, that's

151
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:16.340
Mircea Gogoncea: I'm not worried about that as well. I also love the statistic with the 30% down. For reply reply, rates, I'm like, Hey, I have an excuse now for why people are not replying to my campaigns.

152
00:20:16.867 --> 00:20:20.030
Meg Hall: Yeah, definitely, those are great tips.

153
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.369
Mircea Gogoncea: And my last thing which is related to what I said before.

154
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:37.489
Mircea Gogoncea: take away that part where you say like, even though we do also do cold email like that sounds like you're embarrassed of what you do. That sounds I for me that that sounds like it's not.

155
00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:47.709
Meg Hall: Yeah, that wasn't the pitch before, but they had me add it back in last time, because they were saying like, Well, if you don't do a cold email. What do you do? Is what they were. They felt wondering.

156
00:20:47.980 --> 00:21:04.199
Mircea Gogoncea: I, you can. You can answer that question a different way. You can be like from cold email to scripts for phone calls to blah blah! We do it all now. That might be longer. That might be too long. But but something like that it just

157
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:16.469
Mircea Gogoncea: it just shouldn't. I mean to me. I had the feeling that you were a little embarrassed, and and maybe that's not true, but that but that's how it came came off to me, and again, N. Of one, don't listen to me too much. I might be totally wrong.

158
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.450
Meg Hall: I appreciate it.

159
00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.470
Meg Hall: Anything from the the rest of the techstars team cohort.

160
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.360
Ankur Toshniwal: I thought the intro was awesome.

161
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.079
Ankur Toshniwal: I tell you I thought this was even better than last time.

162
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.140
Meg Hall: Okay. Cool.

163
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.910
antoinecarriere: Yeah, it was. It was really good.

164
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:39.400
antoinecarriere: I think the the point that Mersha has about the the spam or

165
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.479
antoinecarriere: protector. I would. I would wonder.

166
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:52.069
antoinecarriere: I don't know that it's a problem, even if you can get derailed a little bit. I don't know if it's a problem.

167
00:21:52.630 --> 00:22:01.659
antoinecarriere: so I wouldn't over rotate on that, because it felt it felt very, and there was a there was value in the repetition. And so that's.

168
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:09.509
Meg Hall: Okay, cool. I mean, hopefully, I just hook them long enough to keep listening right? And then they watch the video and they love it.

169
00:22:09.899 --> 00:22:11.019
Meg Hall: That's what we want.

170
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.460
Meg Hall: Well, I'm sure you will cool.

171
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.090
Meg Hall: Thanks, guys.

172
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.419
Sambhav Mehta: That was an awesome pitch, but, Ismel, if you wanna.

173
00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.220
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Yeah, sure.

174
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:37.909
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Yeah. So just to explain. So the purpose of this page for us would be like getting some warm intros to like manufacturers in the field, like part manufacturers, manufacturing industry, and everything in this regard.

175
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:49.070
Esmaeil Sadeghi: And we start with video first.st And I have a short note actually in my page as well, like connecting linking to the video, basically. So that's I mean, we start with video, okay.

176
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.980
Esmaeil Sadeghi: initially.

177
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.529
Alex Nativelle: So shall I start?

178
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:59.639
Alex Nativelle: Can you just walk us through what the video is like? Really fast? So that we have the context. For, like your pitch.

179
00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.774
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Oh, yes. So video would be about like,

180
00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:08.308
Esmaeil Sadeghi: the overall. I mean, just like

181
00:23:09.595 --> 00:23:17.210
Esmaeil Sadeghi: giving some intro like about our product, basically. So from a very like broad perspective.

182
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:43.419
Esmaeil Sadeghi: like manufacturing issue. And then there are, there is like a hero like our solution optifab. And then there would be like some some example, like like some perfect part, for instance, in the airplanes. So these are like some very general topics that we are covering in the video. But then, in the pitch, we would be trying to go deeper into the details like what we do, what, how we do it

183
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.530
Esmaeil Sadeghi: and what is the market, for instance?

184
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:55.110
Esmaeil Sadeghi: But we would think like, if you start with pitch. Probably the audience doesn't make like a connection to what we are offering.

185
00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.430
Esmaeil Sadeghi: That was.

186
00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:05.999
Mircea Gogoncea: The video. So the video introduces the context and the solution. Pretty much so. They know they know that we, we imagine we must imagine. We know that in the beginning.

187
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.829
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Yeah, at least, you know, at least they know it's all about manufacturing, like, kind of like. So this, like the contest, is like manufacturing now

188
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.530
Esmaeil Sadeghi: is different from the other team members.

189
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:28.329
Esmaeil Sadeghi: So okay, let's start. Now, do you know what the space rockets Ct scanners and wind turbines have in common.

190
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:39.009
Esmaeil Sadeghi: They all rely on mission critical parts, and even a tiny defect can cause a million dollar failure sometime it costs human lives.

191
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:46.939
Esmaeil Sadeghi: The failure you saw in the video. It wasn't due to bad design. It was how the power was made under unstable

192
00:24:47.090 --> 00:25:00.140
Esmaeil Sadeghi: shop floor conditions. That's when manufacturer lose more than money. They lose time, trust, and reputation. And that's where optifab comes in. We help manufacturers get it right. The 1st time

193
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:10.310
Esmaeil Sadeghi: our AI software reads sensor data predicts failure points and recommends optimal process. Setting before a single dollar is spent on a scrap.

194
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:25.240
Esmaeil Sadeghi: We are built for manufacturers like Siemens Honeywell, Ge. Aerospace operating in a 2 trillion dollars North American manufacturing market, where 20% of output still ends up in rework delays or failure.

195
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.890
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Thank you very much.

196
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.940
Mircea Gogoncea: Guys, I'll let Andrew go first.st

197
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.919
Andrew Penner | Milo: I'm always going 1st here. I guess you you went 1st last time.

198
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.690
Mircea Gogoncea: I can do it if you want. I just want to be.

199
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:40.280
Andrew Penner | Milo: I got it.

200
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.760
Mircea Gogoncea: I don't want to monopolize. I tend to like monopolize. So yeah.

201
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:54.844
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, no, I think you've been doing having really good feedback. I mean, I I have a few things. And we'll probably bounce back and forth between me and Misha. But

202
00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:03.157
Andrew Penner | Milo: First, st I question the order, but we can talk about that. Secondly, when it comes to the opener

203
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:11.020
Andrew Penner | Milo: There might be a stronger way to introduce it. I think you probably, if you're saying, if you're asking a rhetorical question.

204
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.510
Andrew Penner | Milo: especially one like that, there's

205
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:40.229
Andrew Penner | Milo: you might be able to play a humor angle if you pause on it for a minute, and then you're like No, No. One, really. And then you keep going, but that's 1 angle. Another angle might be to really emphasize. I think it's so important what you said maybe 15 seconds, in which is that for a lot of these companies there's human lives at stake, right? I think everyone at this point is probably familiar with

206
00:26:40.793 --> 00:26:43.270
Andrew Penner | Milo: what was it Boeing with that rocket.

207
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:58.639
Andrew Penner | Milo: and people got stuck, and Spacex had to save them right. I'm not sure how much of that was was related to equipment, manufacturing or not. But I think there's some stories you can pull from, and you can make people feel that a little more emotionally, I think, creating an emotional connection. There.

208
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:04.719
Esmaeil Sadeghi: That was actually the video. So the video we have, it's like a like engine like airplane engine like on fire.

209
00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:12.779
Esmaeil Sadeghi: And so we hope that this emotion would like, come up there in that video, and then we would follow up that with our pitch.

210
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.329
Esmaeil Sadeghi: But yeah, so you're right totally here. So it has to be.

211
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.000
Esmaeil Sadeghi: or connection like emotional connection. Here.

212
00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:28.194
Andrew Penner | Milo: So that makes a ton of sense. So if you're gonna tee that up in the video, follow up on the video right like you can double down on that.

213
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.340
Andrew Penner | Milo: You know. People probably have mixed thoughts about rhetorical openers. I generally kind of think that

214
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:50.830
Andrew Penner | Milo: unless you're making a joke or something with them. It probably there's probably a stronger way to lead into a pitch, because, just like on social media right, the 1st 3 seconds are the most important part, you gotta hook people, and you have to earn every additional second that somebody is listening. And so

215
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.620
Andrew Penner | Milo: that's kind of where I would start, and I'll let Mirsha interject and and follow up with some of my other thoughts.

216
00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:18.869
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah. So I don't mind the rhetorical start. I think it's cool. I do have a suggestion for it. You don't need to say, do you know what? Just say? What do these 3 things have in common? What do rocket? Blah? Blah? I forgot the things. But what start directly. Not do you know yet I don't know. You tell me right.

217
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.279
Andrew Penner | Milo: Other way of doing it.

218
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:25.545
Mircea Gogoncea: I have more questions or more feedback about the delivery than the content.

219
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:34.740
Mircea Gogoncea: my only content feedback is when you say 20 trillion dollar manufacturing market. I immediately think top down. Tam

220
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:54.309
Mircea Gogoncea: equals useless, like, I immediately think you know. Yeah, it's a big, big value, but it doesn't mean anything that's not your damn. You're not going to manufacture everything. And so, you know, it's it's I understand what you're doing. But my immediate thought was like discount that discount that and slightly less credibility. Now that was my thought.

221
00:28:54.310 --> 00:29:06.940
Mircea Gogoncea: But most of the feedback that I have is is about the delivery. So some sentences you swallowed the end you didn't fully finish, and you immediately went to the next.

222
00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.369
Mircea Gogoncea: and on some others

223
00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:20.469
Mircea Gogoncea: kind of the opposite happens happened where you were a little stuck on one sentence a little bit too much. I'm gonna ask you the same that I did at the very beginning. Can you? Can you redo the 1st

224
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:27.029
Mircea Gogoncea: 20 seconds of the pitch, or however much I'm not, wherever is a natural place to stop. I just want to hear that again.

225
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.288
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Okay, so I'll start with you. Now then.

226
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.850
Mircea Gogoncea: Sure you don't have to apply it right now. But yeah.

227
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:39.160
Esmaeil Sadeghi: So do you know what the space Rocket, Ct. Scanners and wind turbines have in common?

228
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:46.089
Esmaeil Sadeghi: They all rely on mission critical parts, and even a tiny defect can cause a million dollar failure

229
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.640
Esmaeil Sadeghi: sometime it costs human lives.

230
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:57.640
Esmaeil Sadeghi: The failure you saw in the video it wasn't due to a bad design. It was how the part was made under unstable shop floor conditions.

231
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:04.469
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, so very good this already. I think it was better. The 3 items that you enumerate in the beginning.

232
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:31.299
Mircea Gogoncea: I don't rush over them don't rush over them because I ct scanners especially. It's like 2 words. It's like Ct. Scanners. I keep hearing CD like I'm thinking of Cds a little bit right? And maybe that's my bias as a musician. But even with those, what do rocket launchers? Ct scanners? And it's also it's annoying, because right? Is it? Rocket launchers? Is the 1st one rocket launchers.

233
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.529
Esmaeil Sadeghi: It was a space. Rockets.

234
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:51.199
Mircea Gogoncea: Space rockets. There you go. Space rockets. Ct, that's annoying. Right space rockets. Ct, there's rockets. And then Ct, can you reverse them? Can you say space rockets, whatever else? Oh, no, because whatever is going to be in plural is still going to start with, it's gonna end with an S right. So it doesn't help.

235
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:57.960
Esmaeil Sadeghi: I feel like jet engines, for instance, like jet engine like instead of cities. Kind of. I wanted to like cover. Different sectors

236
00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.710
Esmaeil Sadeghi: stay safe.

237
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:00.380
Mircea Gogoncea: Just.

238
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:29.600
Mircea Gogoncea: I suggest saying, space rockets, jet engines, and Ct. Scanners that's going to flow off the tongue more naturally because you don't have to say, rockets. Ct, that's annoying when you have to do that. And an actor, if they had that to say, because sometimes it's unavoidable, you can use it a loud pause. Right? So you could say, space rockets. Ct scanners like you almost breathe in, and that separates the 2 words.

239
00:31:29.923 --> 00:31:46.410
Mircea Gogoncea: yeah. And then, after that it was pretty good. It was pretty good. You took more time in between the sentences, and I know that your time is limited, and you have to keep within the 1 min limit, but if it doesn't fit within the 1 min limit with these

240
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.870
Mircea Gogoncea: breaks, then it is too long.

241
00:31:49.980 --> 00:32:03.339
Mircea Gogoncea: The breaks are not optional, the breaks are more important, almost in the content. And I saw somebody. Oh, yeah, Andrew said, said. That comment about pregnant pauses in the in the chat. Yeah, I agree with that. 100%.

242
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:10.650
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, thank you very much.

243
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.020
Andrew Penner | Milo: Can I ask you to just read the last half? One more time, too.

244
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:20.140
Esmaeil Sadeghi: That's from like the second half, almost, or.

245
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:21.240
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yep.

246
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:27.719
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Okay? And that's where artifact comes in. We help manufacturer get it right? The 1st time

247
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:37.289
Esmaeil Sadeghi: our AI software reads sensor data predicts failure points and recommend optimal process. Setting before a single dollar is is spent on the scrap.

248
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:52.880
Esmaeil Sadeghi: We are built for manufacturer like Zmas, Honeywell and Ga. Aerospace operating in a 2 trillion dollar North American manufacturing market, where 20% of output still ends up in rework delays or failure.

249
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:55.489
Andrew Penner | Milo: Got it.

250
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.340
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I think

251
00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:04.129
Andrew Penner | Milo: I don't have a ton of feedback on the content there. I think it's just going to be really important to emphasize those numbers. You know.

252
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:13.570
Andrew Penner | Milo: 2 trillion dollar market, where 20% of the output like, pause a little bit, give those numbers a little bit of room, and I think you'll

253
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.530
Andrew Penner | Milo: it. It feels very

254
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:21.490
Andrew Penner | Milo: congested right now. But I think if you just do that one little thing, it's probably gonna space it out and make it a lot more digestible.

255
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:32.489
Mircea Gogoncea: And time it with the spaces. If it's too long, you have to shorten it also. What's that word you're saying, scrap or something? I don't know much about manufacturing, but what is that? The word.

256
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:35.240
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Waste, waste, waste.

257
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:44.679
Mircea Gogoncea: But he said something before, yeah, okay, that. So it is crap. That's that's what it is. That's what it is. Okay. Okay. I just wasn't sure if that was the right word, I got it.

258
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.860
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Yeah, so I think these are great points.

259
00:33:55.270 --> 00:34:01.215
Mircea Gogoncea: Cool, and I agree with with Andrew and all all his comments.

260
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:13.179
Sambhav Mehta: That's awesome to smell, and I really like your pitch as well. Encore! I believe you're next awesome.

261
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:20.942
Ankur Toshniwal: Alright. Honestly, I just changed up some stuff even now. So

262
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:29.260
Ankur Toshniwal: we'll see. Okay, so context is our primary. Primary audience is early investors.

263
00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:31.909
Ankur Toshniwal: And we're

264
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:48.149
Ankur Toshniwal: gonna have the video. First, st the video is a demo of a specific use case with sales play and there we're gonna have. We're gonna have Meg be talking about her use case using harvest all the way from

265
00:34:48.350 --> 00:35:09.530
Ankur Toshniwal: her specific problem, like hyper specific problem down to using it, getting the benefit, and then finally saying, Hey, like this is how it saved my company. 11 h of work and reduce it to 15 min, and this much money. And finally, that's kind of like where it's leaping off like basic things to harvest.

266
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:16.840
Ankur Toshniwal: And so that that intros me into nice

267
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:29.959
Ankur Toshniwal: scaling up from sales. Play X sales Intelligence Giant Zoom Info spent over 80 million dollars last year on labor and infrastructure to extract web data.

268
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:44.799
Ankur Toshniwal: their analysts and engineers manually flip through websites and maintain thousands of lines of code to serve researched information to their customers. These operations don't scale efficiently and drain resources away from product development and cost customer onboarding

269
00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:51.369
Ankur Toshniwal: 96% of the world's web data is trapped behind logins, search bars and load more buttons.

270
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:56.819
Ankur Toshniwal: Extracting this data normally takes 30 data engineers and analysts working together

271
00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.400
Ankur Toshniwal: with harvest. One person can do the work of 30.

272
00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:08.049
Ankur Toshniwal: Harvest gives businesses an unfair information advantage by automating web data extraction without coding or manual research.

273
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:09.839
Ankur Toshniwal: I know you guys want to know.

274
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.199
Ankur Toshniwal: I don't have the transition ready, but does it.

275
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:43.966
Mircea Gogoncea: Nice, nice. I am biased because we love your product, and we want to use it as well. So I I think that's great. I think that's really cool. And I'm also really selfishly, very happy to hear behind login as one of the things that you mentioned in the pitch itself. That's awesome. That means that guys are really considering it cool. So maybe Andrew should go 1st on this one, just because I know your business too. Well.

276
00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:49.990
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I don't have a ton. Sales play X was that the

277
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:53.640
Andrew Penner | Milo: Can you remind me of how that intersects here.

278
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.369
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah. So they're they're that's the next business. Sorry? Yeah, that's.

279
00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:05.652
Andrew Penner | Milo: And that's from the video. I got it. Okay, that was the only point of confusion which would not be a point of confusion to anyone else listening, I think overall.

280
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.190
Andrew Penner | Milo: The pitch was really strong, it was clear the value proposition is definitely there.

281
00:37:11.608 --> 00:37:15.740
Andrew Penner | Milo: Your pacing, I think, was really strong like I I don't have a ton of notes.

282
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:23.089
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah. Oof, what am I gonna say here? I'm not sure this is very good. This is very good.

283
00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.540
Mircea Gogoncea: scaling up from sales. Play X,

284
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:34.130
Mircea Gogoncea: intelligence giant zoom info spends. Blah. Blah, yeah, yeah, no, this. I

285
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:47.757
Mircea Gogoncea: I don't. Can you say it again? That's it. It's very good. Yeah. I agree. I agree with that scaling up from sales play X, you can just say, beyond sales, play X or something like that, you know.

286
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.390
Mircea Gogoncea: yeah.

287
00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:58.550
Mircea Gogoncea: just you know what? Just do it again. This is what teach. This is what music teachers do when they don't have much to say, because then the second time you can

288
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.519
Mircea Gogoncea: you amplify some of your feelings right? Some of your initial feelings.

289
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.569
Ankur Toshniwal: That's right.

290
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:04.210
Mircea Gogoncea: Again.

291
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.220
Ankur Toshniwal: The Intro.

292
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.000
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, just the whole.

293
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.020
Mircea Gogoncea: No, the whole pitch.

294
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:09.757
Ankur Toshniwal: The whole thing. Okay?

295
00:38:12.334 --> 00:38:21.720
Ankur Toshniwal: Well, alright, is there a different thing? I can? I mean, I I thought, scaling up because it well, any rec. Any anyone have a recommendation from, instead of scaling up.

296
00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.460
Mircea Gogoncea: Throw it out! There!

297
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:25.990
Ankur Toshniwal: Beyond.

298
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.969
Alex Nativelle: Sounds good. I think it's better.

299
00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:33.365
Andrew Fernandes: I would say something, maybe something to the effect of businesses.

300
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.679
Ankur Toshniwal: From small to large, or something to that effect.

301
00:38:38.475 --> 00:38:41.204
Ankur Toshniwal: See how it works. And then.

302
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:54.860
Ankur Toshniwal: beyond sales play X sales Intelligence Giant Zoom Info spent over 80 million dollars last year on labor and infrastructure to extract web data.

303
00:38:55.050 --> 00:39:03.840
Ankur Toshniwal: their analysts and engineers manually flip through websites and maintain thousands of lines of code to serve research information to their customers.

304
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:10.589
Ankur Toshniwal: These operations don't scale efficiently and drain resources away from product development and customer onboarding

305
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:16.910
Ankur Toshniwal: 96% of the world's web data is trapped behind logins, search bars and load more buttons.

306
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:22.819
Ankur Toshniwal: Extra extracting this data normally takes 30 data. Engineers and analysts working together

307
00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.509
Ankur Toshniwal: with harvest. One person can do the work of 30.

308
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:34.370
Ankur Toshniwal: Harvest gives businesses an unfair information advantage by automating web data, extraction without coding and manual research.

309
00:39:38.600 --> 00:40:02.250
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, no, no, no notes. I mean, the only thing I thought of is why 30? Why, exactly what you said, 96% of the world's data. And I'm like, Wait 30 people can get all of it. 30 people can get 96% of the world's data. I then understood the play with like, okay, so we make the same as 30, like we make, you have the power of 30. But before that the 30 confused me

310
00:40:02.506 --> 00:40:15.580
Mircea Gogoncea: because it really sounded to me like you were saying, 30 humans can extract 96% of the world's data. So then how is this a business. You can just get 30 people and do it. And that's and it's done. I understand that's not what you meant. But yeah.

311
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:23.779
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah. So I'll tell you where it comes from, and maybe you can help me fix it. Antoine. I think you maybe have something similar, or

312
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:24.830
Ankur Toshniwal: that's why.

313
00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:31.959
antoinecarriere: My my version of that is the the bigger the number, the harder to believe.

314
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:43.570
antoinecarriere: and so find a number that is big enough that it's meaningful, indisputably, but not too big. And so I don't know if 30 is the right number for that.

315
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:49.239
Ankur Toshniwal: Does 30 feel too big. So the reason I use 30 is that's a real number that we have been told.

316
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:53.380
Ankur Toshniwal: like we know that number by actually speaking to

317
00:40:53.680 --> 00:41:06.780
Ankur Toshniwal: sales. Intelligence orgs at Enterprise scale that are like 1 billion dollar company. So that's what we know. And that's where that number comes from. I can even say, after you know, we we've spoken to enterprise companies as like A,

318
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.209
Ankur Toshniwal: you know, just to

319
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.119
Ankur Toshniwal: I don't provide some.

320
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.730
Ankur Toshniwal: I don't know credibility on that, or I'm not sure.

321
00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:18.150
Mircea Gogoncea: Instead of we've spoken to, you could say

322
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:29.960
Mircea Gogoncea: enterprise companies say, or enterprise companies have told us that they need 30 people for blah blah! Maybe that's like I'm super nitpicking at this point.

323
00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:31.080
Mircea Gogoncea: Only thing.

324
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:31.440
Alex Nativelle: Yeah.

325
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.600
Mircea Gogoncea: That I could. Yeah.

326
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:44.299
Alex Nativelle: Well, maybe maybe I didn't understand correctly, but I heard like, it takes 30 days for a team to do that. And then one person replaces 30 people. So I had a bit of confusion between 30 days and 30 people.

327
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:51.280
Ankur Toshniwal: Oh, I said, I said, 30 data engineers, I can say I can probably just remove data. I can just say 30 engineers, simpler.

328
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:51.780
Alex Nativelle: I remember.

329
00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:52.630
Ankur Toshniwal: Data yeah.

330
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:53.719
Alex Nativelle: Okay, my, bad.

331
00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:59.340
antoinecarriere: And if you say if you say customer, I'll

332
00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:22.149
antoinecarriere: the other day you know you don't have to say your customer the other day, my one of our prospect, or whatever, if you if you name it, then the credibility issue doesn't. Doesn't kind of trigger, you know. If you're quoting someone who said, 30, and it's very clear you're quoting perfect.

333
00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.150
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, but it was. It wasn't zoom info. I don't want to introduce another person.

334
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:27.429
Ankur Toshniwal: You don't even yeah.

335
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:35.530
antoinecarriere: No, no, but that's the so. Something you make it so natural. It's like the other day.

336
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:45.340
Ankur Toshniwal: You're right. I could do that. I like that. I'll try that. I'll try. How many, how many seconds was I? I had a couple of seconds left. Okay, I'll I'll try it. Then I'll try that. Thanks. Yeah, that's a good idea. I like that.

337
00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:52.609
Andrew Penner | Milo: One man's opinion. I wouldn't sweat 30 too much. I didn't question it. What was the last sentence.

338
00:42:54.265 --> 00:43:11.439
Ankur Toshniwal: Well, I guess so. Also I haven't put in a a transition to the Q&A. So I, aside from that. But the ending of the main pitch is harvest gives businesses an unfair information advantage by automating web data extraction without coding. Manual research.

339
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.210
Andrew Penner | Milo: Got it, and then you'll have the transition. Yeah, I like it.

340
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.649
Ankur Toshniwal: I does. Okay. One thing I was curious about is

341
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:30.322
Ankur Toshniwal: the the question that we always get or is like, is it clear? Or to you guys?

342
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:35.099
Ankur Toshniwal: it does it come into your mind like, why Chat gpt is different, like

343
00:43:35.785 --> 00:43:39.390
Ankur Toshniwal: because we were, we were trying to decide whether or not we even bring them up.

344
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.949
Alex Nativelle: I feel like.

345
00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.530
Ankur Toshniwal: That seems like a common question.

346
00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.290
carloscaglia: Not even quite my mind.

347
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.420
Ankur Toshniwal: Okay, cool. I feel like the fact.

348
00:43:46.420 --> 00:44:02.059
Alex Nativelle: You said, 96% of the web is hidden between login buttons, etc. This feels I'm like, yeah, it feels right, like most of the time when I'm scrolling, I click on those buttons. And I'm like, Yeah, Chatgpt doesn't do that like, of course, the question is still looming, but

349
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:07.050
Alex Nativelle: it's not as strong as it was on previous iterations of the pitch. I would say.

350
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:12.310
Ankur Toshniwal: Okay, great. So then I won't even bring it up. I don't even wanna like confuse people or, okay, awesome. Thank you.

351
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:20.390
Andrew Penner | Milo: I completely agree with Vivian. Save it for the Q. And a like. That's your your pitch is doing its job. Let's let the Q. And a. Do its job.

352
00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.140
Mircea Gogoncea: I agree. I think that's awesome.

353
00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.110
Ankur Toshniwal: Thanks, all.

354
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.280
Sambhav Mehta: Perfect. Alex, you're up next.

355
00:44:38.534 --> 00:44:44.639
Alex Nativelle: We said. We're we're still figuring out what we do. So we we can go last if you want, and then let Vivian start.

356
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.350
Sambhav Mehta: Oh, okay, cool. Yeah. That's fine.

357
00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.750
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Hello.

358
00:44:50.230 --> 00:45:05.738
Vivian @makingautoeasy: so my objective is not. I'm not fundraising. So my objective is to get everyone to want to help me connect with all of their automotive connections, and because most people don't know who they know in auto and don't realize it, my goal is to get them to to make that search. So

359
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:12.329
Vivian @makingautoeasy: that's my pitch, my objective. I'm going pitch 1st and then Demo second.

360
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:14.120
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Okay.

361
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:32.700
Vivian @makingautoeasy: car shopping sucks, and we all know why. Yes, there are too many options. But the real problem is that no one trusts the process. The truth is, salespeople today are at the mercy of a reputation. They did not create, based on decades of bad behavior and every moment of silence, every unexpected number, only tightens that stereotype

362
00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:51.840
Vivian @makingautoeasy: salespeople aren't the enemy. They actually want to help you. They just don't have the right tools. The industry's tried training, marketing and even rebranding salespeople to product specialists. But they're trying to deliver a world class experience still using the same process. And I've personally worked with over 100 dealerships, and I hear the same thing. The process is

363
00:45:51.840 --> 00:46:03.280
Vivian @makingautoeasy: broken. The industry is still running on paper forms and memory to close deals, and it burns through people. Dealerships flip up to 80% of their sales teams every year, and it costs them $45,000 every time.

364
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:16.000
Vivian @makingautoeasy: The next generation of car buyers and sellers are already here, and we are giving them the tools to help them rewrite that narrative. The future of car buying isn't sales. It's personalized, intelligent, and built on trust, and it's inevitable.

365
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:18.649
Vivian @makingautoeasy: I think I sped up at the end.

366
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:20.730
Vivian @makingautoeasy: because I feel like it's getting long.

367
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.580
Mircea Gogoncea: Nice nice!

368
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:29.429
Mircea Gogoncea: How long was that? I know that you've been a 1 on one perfect.

369
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:30.079
Sambhav Mehta: One on one, yeah.

370
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:45.560
Mircea Gogoncea: That's a good. That's a good length. Okay? So I have a thought. I, 1st of all, you're a rock star. That sounds so good. There's so much charisma, and it's personable and real and just like 10 out of 10 on delivery.

371
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.609
Mircea Gogoncea: my only issue with this is that it sounded like you were. Just.

372
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:59.449
Mircea Gogoncea: you're just talking about the problem like 90% of the pitch. And I understand that maybe that's resolved in the video.

373
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:03.320
Mircea Gogoncea: The general wisdom that I've received from

374
00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:20.179
Mircea Gogoncea: from all my pitch coaches is you can spend about 15%, maybe 20% of your time on the problem maximum, absolute maximum. Beyond that, you're not really proving a solution. You're just proving that there is a market. But

375
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:25.680
Mircea Gogoncea: for an investor it wouldn't be necessarily convincing that you have the solution to it. So.

376
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.120
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Remember I'm not, but I'm not looking for an investor.

377
00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:33.950
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, I know. I know. I know that's right. That's right. But I I am I

378
00:47:34.410 --> 00:48:04.100
Mircea Gogoncea: I would strongly encourage you to talk more about what you do. That's my big thing. Now, if Neil said, this is okay, and you've been practicing, maybe with some of the other people, you know. Don't. I know nothing, don't! Don't take my word over theirs, but my opinion is, I want like twice as much about what you do 3 times about what you more than I mean. I only got that it's personalized and and smart, that's all I got from it like this process sucks.

379
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:12.410
Mircea Gogoncea: which I knew already. I've bought a car, and I would have believed you if you only spent 10 seconds on it. You know.

380
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:13.000
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Hello!

381
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.860
Mircea Gogoncea: But yeah, what what did you think? Andrew?

382
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:24.480
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I actually am gonna plus one that I couldn't actually make sense of whether you were b 2 b or B to C,

383
00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:33.020
Andrew Penner | Milo: which is probably something you want to make clear. And I think that's a consequence of focusing on the problem, because in my head

384
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:41.290
Andrew Penner | Milo: I mean your delivery was incredible, like, really, really good. And I wanted so badly to understand what the product was.

385
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:49.580
Andrew Penner | Milo: And for me, I jumped back and forth between. Okay, her product is empowering existing salespeople.

386
00:48:49.700 --> 00:49:02.369
Andrew Penner | Milo: Then I thought, Wait, is it helping with salesperson retention? Because she mentioned the attrition stat? And then you talked about the future being more personalized and kind of consumer centric

387
00:49:02.843 --> 00:49:15.420
Andrew Penner | Milo: which then made me think it was B to C. So there was a lot of jumping there. And I think that jumping happened because so much time was spent on the problem. And so there's probably a more clear way to connect those dots?

388
00:49:16.126 --> 00:49:19.530
Andrew Penner | Milo: Can I ask you like, what do you do?

389
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:37.100
Vivian @makingautoeasy: So. So I've designed it this way. And it's hard like, this is the feedback I get without the context of the video and the QA. Because everything you asked is exactly what I answer, and like the 1st 2 questions of the QA. It is like, the problem is like the like. Who am I building this for?

390
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:49.589
Vivian @makingautoeasy: The and I? My answer, part of that is like it is, this is a 2 sided problem, and everybody looks at it from the side of only the dealership, and my advantage is I come from the consumer side.

391
00:49:49.660 --> 00:50:13.380
Vivian @makingautoeasy: So I bridge that gap because the ultimate root problem of everything. Every time that I've tried to build my product, which is originally started as matching people to the right vehicles, then it became matching people the right vehicles in the dealership, solving their process because their process is broken. There's gaps in the information that goes into their Crm. And they're not asking the right questions. So our system does all of those things. But the root problem is that

392
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:23.059
Vivian @makingautoeasy: people coming in don't want to tell salespeople anything, because they don't trust them. And then when they don't tell them the information because the salesperson doesn't have what they need to work with.

393
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:43.440
Vivian @makingautoeasy: and then it just repeats the cycle over and over again. So this what we're building is an intake system and a customer experience that allows both sides to show up to the party and get what they want out of it in like a different way. So that's why it's been very much focused on the problem. And then the video shows the interaction of how it's being used in store.

394
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.387
Vivian @makingautoeasy: And then the QA. Answers those questions that you mentioned.

395
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:50.170
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, okay.

396
00:50:51.080 --> 00:51:17.369
Mircea Gogoncea: I want to say something about that. So I did something similar in my 1st draft of my of my pitch. I thought, I'm gonna use the different sections of the pitch for different things, and I will have one section dedicated to one thing, another section dedicated to another thing, and I decided not to do it after the feedback that I received from other people. And I want to introduce a concept to you that you might be aware of. But

397
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:25.500
Mircea Gogoncea: it comes from many years decades of experience. So as a teacher, as a professor.

398
00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:30.289
Mircea Gogoncea: we have this concept of the knowledge spiral, which is that

399
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:51.840
Mircea Gogoncea: you say something once, and it doesn't mean anything, and you say it again deeper, and it means more, and you say it again, deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. And that's how you learn. I want to tell you from the experience of having taught thousands of students and having pitched, you know, a lot, not only with my business, but in general. If you tell people something once.

400
00:51:51.890 --> 00:52:12.750
Mircea Gogoncea: there's 0 chance, they will remember. And I tell my student to do a thing with their fingers a certain way, or to do something, or to not to do something, come back the next week, and they're doing it again right? And so the only thing to actually the only way to actually put something in people's minds is repetition. And this 3 section format lets you

401
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:31.879
Mircea Gogoncea: repeat and go deeper with every one of the sections. So instead of having one having the pitch dedicated to one thing, the video to another, and the Q&A to another, they should be. They should all contain all information, and just get deeper into it with each iteration, and that will let you have

402
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:49.279
Mircea Gogoncea: that will actually stay in people's minds in the same way that in music a chorus comes back again and again, and again and again within a song, and that's what makes it catchy. That's what makes it stay in your mind. So I would strongly encourage you to consider

403
00:52:49.550 --> 00:53:17.359
Mircea Gogoncea: imagining each section as an opportunity to go deeper into each problem rather than as an opportunity to present a totally different aspect of it. That's just my feedback, and I realize that I'm asking a big change of you, so please don't do it. If that's not the right thing, consult with everybody else. But but keep in mind that people will not understand everything in the first, st in in the whatever amount of time you have for each section. So yeah.

404
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:34.500
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Off more on the side of like what we do where it is right now and then. I've gotten the feedback to to talk about the root problem. So this is like the ping pong, like, maybe I need to just find a balance and find something to get rid of. So I can end off with more about

405
00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:35.620
Vivian @makingautoeasy: the business.

406
00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.450
Mircea Gogoncea: Mentor, with.

407
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:38.590
Andrew Penner | Milo: If you

408
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:43.309
Andrew Penner | Milo: if you get one thing, one thing you want people to remember by the end of this, what is it.

409
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:58.880
Vivian @makingautoeasy: I want. So the ultimate goal is when I need them to pay attention for the full 6 min like that is key thing is like holy shit. This is cool. This is important. I want them to recognize that the future of car buying is inevitably going to be in this direction.

410
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:18.820
Vivian @makingautoeasy: and then I want them to want to help me like it's it's less about like. And the whole point is, I want to have more conversations. But if I come out of this and coming to techstars, I was like, I wanted more connections into the industry. I want to find my future investors, which will be automotive people. I walk out of this demo day with 50 automotive connections. That's a win for me.

411
00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:23.931
Andrew Penner | Milo: Those, and I'm I'm pushing back a little bit.

412
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:30.060
Andrew Penner | Milo: and I don't. I don't want you to take it the wrong way, but those feel more like outputs

413
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:35.670
Andrew Penner | Milo: like those will be the consequence of of a bunch of things that you do. But what

414
00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:43.810
Andrew Penner | Milo: what is the big thing you want people to remember it's not going to be. I want to help this person, because that's a consequence of everything else you do right.

415
00:54:44.305 --> 00:54:54.379
Andrew Penner | Milo: It's not necessarily going to be unless you can present some really good data and create a pretty irrefutable picture that the future of car buying is almost certainly this way.

416
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.920
Andrew Penner | Milo: Maybe you can do that. But if

417
00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:03.109
Andrew Penner | Milo: you know the things you can control, you might want people to remember the problem. You might want people to remember

418
00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:08.079
Andrew Penner | Milo: something about your company, something about you like, what? What is it?

419
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.999
Andrew Penner | Milo: I'm gonna ask you to go one level deeper.

420
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:19.039
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Yeah, I've always been focusing on the product of like this works really well.

421
00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:24.850
Vivian @makingautoeasy: But I've I've always had a hard time of talking about where I go from here.

422
00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.319
Andrew Penner | Milo: Well, why does it work really well?

423
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:28.959
Andrew Penner | Milo: What does it do that makes it work so.

424
00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.950
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Faster, and it's easier. There's less friction. It's transparent.

425
00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.129
Ankur Toshniwal: But for who? For both.

426
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.160
Vivian @makingautoeasy: For both.

427
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.530
Ankur Toshniwal: I think you need to say that

428
00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:49.500
Ankur Toshniwal: I think I think that that's okay. I think that it's like being honest about the fact that you are addressing both, I think, is actually okay, because you have a really good reason to do it.

429
00:55:50.048 --> 00:56:06.629
Ankur Toshniwal: And and you don't need to like like everyone else, is picking sides. In fact, that could be your your unique point of view. Every like, you know, some people are solving for this, and people are solving this. We understand this key point here and this key point here, bridging them.

430
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:13.487
Ankur Toshniwal: And I feel like that is, if you say that in a you know, in your story which you're really good at.

431
00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:20.480
Ankur Toshniwal: I think that there's you're you're you actually have a great story of what you said everything afterwards.

432
00:56:20.978 --> 00:56:25.710
Ankur Toshniwal: About. And we answered Andrew's question about like, so what exactly do you do?

433
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:32.890
Ankur Toshniwal: Was like the felt like the the full, honest truth. and and like I think you you

434
00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:39.220
Ankur Toshniwal: I don't know. It's hard. You get a lot of you got a lot of a lot lot of people saying things to you. But

435
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:47.176
Ankur Toshniwal: you just. It's it's tough to see it, because I I know this stuff. Well, I know your your entire issue as well. And

436
00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:55.800
Ankur Toshniwal: It's every time that you speak about it in a super frank or honest way. Of like what you're really trying to accomplish here where the magic comes out?

437
00:56:56.313 --> 00:56:58.329
Ankur Toshniwal: And so I think, like.

438
00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:13.989
Ankur Toshniwal: I think it's okay to just be like, really, really honest about what exactly you understand and saying like you come from the consumer side. I I think that's a little. It's a little weak. Because

439
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:17.330
Ankur Toshniwal: it it feels like you like you're

440
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:32.399
Ankur Toshniwal: it feels like you're coming from one side. But then, like you're trying to solve the other side, I think that the real and the truth is that you, you understand both. And that's the that's the magic that you have. And that's that's that's an incredible opportunity. I think. And you should. You should definitely tell people that in a

441
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.190
Ankur Toshniwal: your way at least, that's.

442
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:41.240
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I think it kind of all just clicked for me when you gave me those explanations, because

443
00:57:41.450 --> 00:58:10.550
Andrew Penner | Milo: I work in a similar vertical. I know I didn't really talk about my company, but like we work in real estate, right? And our original mission was to completely replace real estate agents. But there's this fucking cartel of real estate agents that will not let themselves be replaced right? And it's also the biggest transaction that somebody makes in their life. And what's right behind that? It's it's auto, right? And so I think there is an angle to be had that is, look, salespeople have gotten a bad route, like everything that you kind of started with.

444
00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:23.809
Andrew Penner | Milo: But say, you know you, the solution that can't necessarily just be going direct to consumer. Right? You need to bridge these 2 things is the one of the biggest purchases that people make, certainly the biggest purchase that people make with any degree of frequency.

445
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:49.980
Andrew Penner | Milo: And they need somebody to guide them through it. So we help take that consumer autonomy, or whatever you want to say, and bridge it with the with the professional, and I think there's probably a way you can construct that story where it becomes abundantly clear what you do in a really compelling way that then solves. Oh, you know what? Yeah, that I could totally see myself getting on board with that being the future of where this industry is going. I'd love to help her, and then it all comes full circle.

446
00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:51.749
Vivian @makingautoeasy: That's helpful. Thank you.

447
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:52.020
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah.

448
00:58:52.290 --> 00:59:04.890
Ankur Toshniwal: Also I had 1 1 small thing for the beginning. You you always say car buying sucks which I don't necessarily disagree with, but I don't see as a user or a consumer. I don't see car buying as an activity that I do.

449
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:11.940
Ankur Toshniwal: because it's not something I do multiple times, so I would consider shifting it to buying a car sucks

450
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:24.879
Ankur Toshniwal: right or or something that is directly like what I relate to as an individual, rather than because, like, I don't do it multiple times. So like I don't know the entire process. All I do is buy one car. And I've bought a car that sucks. Yeah.

451
00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.540
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Okay.

452
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:39.620
Andrew Penner | Milo: It was really strong, and whatever your ultimate pitch ends up being the way you delivered, it was 10 out of 10.

453
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:41.460
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Thanks.

454
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:50.099
Mircea Gogoncea: That was, that was really something special. I mean, really, really, clearly, very, very, very, very, very strong.

455
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:54.080
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Thanks, guys, I'll I'll see how I can incorporate that.

456
00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:58.620
Mircea Gogoncea: Great.

457
00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:01.899
Sambhav Mehta: Trina, do you want to go up next.

458
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.100
Trina Das: Yes, for sure.

459
01:00:05.429 --> 01:00:16.069
Trina Das: Okay. So I will go. Video first, st where I'll show the features on my product, on, like, how we are helping radiologists and lab tech teams

460
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:18.500
Trina Das: in the Us.

461
01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.115
Trina Das: And we will be targeting

462
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:29.919
Trina Das: contacts to radiology labs. And anyone who's connected to the Med tech or biotech industry in the Us.

463
01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.149
Trina Das: And of course, obviously investments are welcome.

464
01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:40.179
Trina Das: So here I go.

465
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:51.190
Trina Das: Last year I lost my aunt to undiagnosed stomach cancer after suffering for many months in silence. Sadly, she's not the only one

466
01:00:51.190 --> 01:01:10.859
Trina Das: in the Us. Over 11 billion medical diagnostic tests are conducted annually, yet up to 20% result in missed detections or false positives leading to unnecessary treatments, patient suffering, and over 20 billion dollars in lost money for medical imaging labs.

467
01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:19.390
Trina Das: radiologist burnout human error and overwhelming test volumes contribute to a multi-billion dollar problem in healthcare

468
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:25.889
Trina Das: trins is on a mission to eliminate miss detections and false positives in imaging diagnostics.

469
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:54.560
Trina Das: Our all-in-one platform provides real-time radiology reading support, AI reading and pre-reading assistance. Trince also has tool stacks for lab tech teams to deploy FDA cleared AI reading assistance powered by clean structured data, real time support and automated error tracking compliantly trins, meticulously tracks, reading trails and errors and makes precision diagnostics and targeted medical treatments, a reality.

470
01:01:54.600 --> 01:02:06.749
Trina Das: Our deep tech platform reduces diagnostic reading time by 90% and minimizes errors and fragmented lab workflows into scalable AI driven systems.

471
01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:16.119
Trina Das: We are building trains because no one should suffer or lose a loved one due to misdetection or receive treatment. They didn't even need. Thank you.

472
01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:35.679
Mircea Gogoncea: Nice, all right. So I must preface this by saying that I'm not a doctor, nor at all involved in the medical field, so I have to tell you. I lost you a little bit. It got too technical. It got a little technical.

473
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:54.879
Mircea Gogoncea: It sounds like I'm saying the opposite to what I just said to begin. But I'm not. I think the balance of you know how much it talked about. The problem versus the solution in this case was very good. I just lost you. It was very technical for me in the in the middle, so I would encourage you.

474
01:02:55.030 --> 01:03:00.940
Mircea Gogoncea: I mean, it depends. Who do you think is going to be in the audience like, do you think there's gonna be people that will understand? Because in that case.

475
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:10.319
Mircea Gogoncea: maybe that's okay, right? But I would encourage you to to make it a little bit more accessible to dumb, normal people like me.

476
01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.920
Trina Das: Okay. Sure.

477
01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:13.720
Andrew Penner | Milo: I have.

478
01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.179
Andrew Penner | Milo: Oh, go ahead!

479
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:30.560
Trina Das: I'm actually struggling because we are such a niche technical, deep tech problem that we are solving. I'm really struggling to make it clear for audience who's not from the radiology or imaging background. So that's 1 of the challenges that we have.

480
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.789
Mircea Gogoncea: Thank you. Need to make.

481
01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:34.090
Mircea Gogoncea: Oh, go! Go ahead, Andrew.

482
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:41.415
Andrew Penner | Milo: No, I I just think you had a really good start with painting that picture to non technical people.

483
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:45.739
Andrew Penner | Milo: where you know you talked about. You gave a good story.

484
01:03:46.436 --> 01:03:54.963
Andrew Penner | Milo: You talked about false positives leading to a lot of you know, excess cost of healthcare and and mistreatment.

485
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:58.750
Andrew Penner | Milo: The solution, especially for a pitch.

486
01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.049
Andrew Penner | Milo: doesn't need to be in detail.

487
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:02.030
Trina Das: Okay.

488
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:15.519
Andrew Penner | Milo: E, even when you're selling like you're gonna speak to technical decision makers who need to know the ins and outs of the product right. But in a lot of marketing that companies do. A lot of companies make the mistake of trying to promote features and benefits.

489
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.440
Andrew Penner | Milo: People don't care about features and benefits right? They care about outcomes.

490
01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:24.440
Andrew Penner | Milo: And so ultimately I would try and distill that down into

491
01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:34.610
Andrew Penner | Milo: what is it ultimately that that your product solves and you can talk a little bit of how you get there. Probably better for the Q. And A, you're gonna probably need to cut

492
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:38.520
Andrew Penner | Milo: 2030 seconds off of it, because

493
01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:45.389
Andrew Penner | Milo: you're gonna also need to leave time for some pauses for the places where you do get a little more technical. And in the weeds.

494
01:04:46.138 --> 01:04:49.320
Andrew Penner | Milo: That's where your pacing is gonna need to be really

495
01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:55.259
Andrew Penner | Milo: on point. The more you let that bleed into the next paragraph kind of thing it's it's just gonna lose people.

496
01:04:55.988 --> 01:05:04.671
Andrew Penner | Milo: But you might be able to trim a lot of it. I think you had some interesting stats in there. I just they kind of went over my head again with everything that was said.

497
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:14.273
Andrew Penner | Milo: But I think if you focus on the higher level problem and solution that you have, and it is kind of funny, because it's almost the opposite of of Vivian.

498
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:31.919
Andrew Penner | Milo: But if you focus a little more on the higher level, then you can dig into the technical a little later. But I think people want to know, what are you doing? How are you different? How does this solve the problem, and then you can get into the deep tech and the stuff that really sets you apart. You just got to lay the groundwork first.st

499
01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:33.080
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah.

500
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:46.269
Mircea Gogoncea: I I think you're gonna have to shorten it by a lot, because I see the time is 1 35. And if you're gonna have some rest, some breaks you might need to shorten like a solid 40 seconds off of it, which is about half.

501
01:05:46.350 --> 01:06:05.559
Mircea Gogoncea: So I again I encourage you to follow the going deeper model. That's just what I think is the most successful model kind of what I was telling Vivian as well. But you know. Don't talk about maybe anything that you do. Just talk about the outcomes that your tool that your solution provides.

502
01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:24.560
Mircea Gogoncea: You set the problem up very easily. Very well, then, set the outcomes of your solution like, set that expectation of we're gonna I don't know. Cut back on misdiagnosis. We're, gonna you know, our system will help you reduce the risk of getting something wrong. I think that's kind of what it does like. Did I understand correctly?

503
01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.710
Mircea Gogoncea: That's the primary thing that you do right?

504
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:46.680
Mircea Gogoncea: So say it like that, and then you can go into how you do that later. Maybe you did it in the Q&A or maybe the video has some nice visualization of like, Oh, we take this data from here. And we, you know, compare it against something else. And whatever. But yeah, I would say, the 1st order of business is okay, clear problem.

505
01:06:47.000 --> 01:07:00.709
Mircea Gogoncea: clear outcomes of your solution. Then after that you can go into how those outcomes are achieved, or how it's better than the current solutions that are available or anything like that. I think that's my primary piece of advice here.

506
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.930
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I think you can say, you know, with

507
01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:22.280
Andrew Penner | Milo: whatever you know, however tangible you want it to be. But it can be with our product. People can live better lives without, you know, with the lower risk of misdiagnosis, save X on healthcare costs right? Those are probably the outputs.

508
01:07:22.927 --> 01:07:37.770
Andrew Penner | Milo: Families can stay together and not be disrupted by this kind of thing. Right? Like whatever the emotional and functional triggers can be like, draw on those. And then, just like Mirsha said, like, get into more depth in the Q. And A, yeah.

509
01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:47.989
Mircea Gogoncea: And you can say our product is a set of tools for practitioners, or it can be something else like that's that's fine. But then what it does is the most important thing, you know. That's that's it.

510
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:53.080
Andrew Fernandes: So thank you so much, Marcia and Andrew, for your detailed feedback.

511
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:54.529
Mircea Gogoncea: Now, of course.

512
01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:57.537
Andrew Fernandes: I had a couple of things.

513
01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:01.280
Andrew Fernandes: one sorry you lost your aunt 2

514
01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:16.939
Andrew Fernandes: who suffered many months in silence. It's not clear whether you're referring to her or or you and your family. So just tweak the wording a little bit there. I think you're headed in the right direction compared to the past. Versions still need to, like everyone said, trim down on the technical stuff so specifically

515
01:08:17.433 --> 01:08:25.496
Andrew Fernandes: the 2 sentences toward the end one, you talk about structured data. So if you're using long compound nouns so

516
01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:36.880
Andrew Fernandes: structured, clean structured diagnostic data, that's 4 words for one noun. And you're using, like 3 or 4 of these compound nouns in one sentence that are very technical. You lose me by the second one

517
01:08:37.333 --> 01:08:52.819
Andrew Fernandes: and you'll probably lose a lot of the audience who's non technical about this. Similarly, the sentence about scalable lab driven decisions that's in a list with, like 3 other again, compound nouns. You're going to lose most of the audience with these, especially when you have a list of them.

518
01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:59.440
Trina Das: No, thank you so much, Andrew. I'll work on it.

519
01:09:02.064 --> 01:09:17.699
Ankur Toshniwal: Can you do the intro one more time, if you don't mind. I don't know how much time we have. I don't want to take it. But you're doing one thing where you're merging the end and beginning of 2 set sentences, and it's it's I think you have an opportunity to just pause

520
01:09:17.909 --> 01:09:24.449
Ankur Toshniwal: and just let it let it hit right I lost my mom to stomach cancer last year

521
01:09:24.759 --> 01:09:37.819
Ankur Toshniwal: period and then go to the next thing right? I think. You're. I think you're merging. It's just like a how are you speaking? Do you want to? Do you want to try it again. If if people are okay, I think we have only one more person after this right? Just Chris.

522
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:40.839
Trina Das: Yeah, sure I can do that.

523
01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:52.329
Trina Das: Last year I lost my aunt to undiagnostic, undiagnosed stomach cancer. After suffering.

524
01:09:52.330 --> 01:10:11.080
Ankur Toshniwal: Period period. Just wait. That's that's a good, just just stop right there and then start a big thing to say, let that sink in for a sec. You don't have to do it for every sentence after that. That's like a really momentous experience to go through. Right? So let that let that sink in. Let that weight of that be heavy. Yeah.

525
01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:15.060
Trina Das: Last year I lost my aunt to undiagnosed stomach cancer.

526
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:18.810
Ankur Toshniwal: And then and then continue, yeah.

527
01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:23.209
Trina Das: Sadly, sadly. She's not the only one. And then I can continue. Yeah.

528
01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.360
Trina Das: thank you so much, uncle, this is super helpful.

529
01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:31.880
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah.

530
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.169
Mircea Gogoncea: there you go. Okay.

531
01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:39.860
Mircea Gogoncea: Nice.

532
01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.880
Mircea Gogoncea: Alright. Should we go on to the next person?

533
01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:50.910
Mircea Gogoncea: I don't know who they are.

534
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:54.840
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah. Chris or Antoine?

535
01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:01.749
antoinecarriere: No, no, Chris would be great. And then Alex and I would like to kind of do a side by side for you guys.

536
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:06.869
antoinecarriere: And so we just want to be last because we realize that we are, we're going to take time.

537
01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:27.140
Chris Wong: Cool. Yeah. So for me, I think it's gonna be pitch 1st and then video demo after goal for us is that we want to get intros or meet lawyers for our customers. Particularly small medium sized law firms.

538
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:28.983
Chris Wong: and then

539
01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:40.169
Chris Wong: for the for a lot of the kind of business metrics, Tam and all that is gonna be in the QA, so yeah, just kind of giving you a heads up about kind of like the logic behind

540
01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.770
Chris Wong: cool. I'll hop right in.

541
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:51.509
Chris Wong: When I became a lawyer I never thought that I'd have to be a data entry bookkeeper.

542
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:56.409
Chris Wong: I left my big law job because I hated tracking my time.

543
01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.529
Chris Wong: We hate tracking time. We hate tracking invoices.

544
01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:04.209
Chris Wong: These are not my words, but words of the lawyers we serve.

545
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:31.579
Chris Wong: I'm Chris CEO, and co-founder of legalese, and before this I was also a lawyer at Cooley, and, like most lawyers, I charged an uncomfortably high hourly rate, and spent hours each month justifying it. I track every task that I did, how long I did them and describe them in my client bills, but I also hated it because it's time that you can't, bill for time. You'd much rather spend helping your client, and frankly, time I'd rather spend with my family.

546
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:41.740
Chris Wong: and this is a common story felt by lawyers from different practices and firms. In fact, most lawyers across the United States spend about 10 h each month on legal bills.

547
01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:54.730
Chris Wong: So at Legalese, we're on a mission to save lawyers time for what really matters. And we're doing this by building an AI assistant that automatically tracks what a lawyer does in real time, and describes that work in their bills.

548
01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:59.550
Chris Wong: So they cut the amount of time they spend on legal time tracking and invoicing by 90%.

549
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.290
Chris Wong: Here's how we're doing it.

550
01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:09.450
Mircea Gogoncea: Very good, very strong. Okay. A little long, I see.

551
01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:11.020
Mircea Gogoncea: Very good.

552
01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.029
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah. Nice.

553
01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:33.830
Mircea Gogoncea: don't they? When I was doing techstars? I don't know if this is still the case, but they drilled it into our heads to not spend time presenting our name and title because they're like we had 24 companies pitching at the same time they were like, I don't want to hear 24. My name is so, and I'm so and so, and I'm CEO of such and such.

554
01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:48.880
Mircea Gogoncea: I thought that was kind of funny. I think you're the 1st person who did it today. I understand why it flows naturally, because you're saying I'm a lawyer, you know, but I also think it could just be. I'm a lawyer.

555
01:13:49.180 --> 01:14:03.170
Mircea Gogoncea: and that will save you like 5 seconds out of the whatever 15 seconds that they need to cut. So it's an easy win. Right? Yeah, I don't have a lot of comments. I thought this was very strong. Andrew, what did you think.

556
01:14:04.639 --> 01:14:09.879
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I mean, I do think there's a little time that can be saved because you said you're a lawyer twice.

557
01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.029
Andrew Penner | Milo: So one of those can probably go, whichever one is least important, probably the second

558
01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.549
Andrew Penner | Milo: And then, you know, I found myself thinking.

559
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.109
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, this is a really big problem

560
01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:32.689
Andrew Penner | Milo: I could see like this takes time away from people. I love that. And then you said 10 HA month, and for some reason that felt underwhelming to me.

561
01:14:33.243 --> 01:14:49.230
Andrew Penner | Milo: Which maybe could just be different framing and just a thought. But if you're thinking 10 HA month, you're talking about 120 HA year. Right? You're talking about effectively. 3 weeks worth of of full time employees work?

562
01:14:49.794 --> 01:14:53.520
Andrew Penner | Milo: So you could say something to the effect of, you know.

563
01:14:54.040 --> 01:15:01.839
Andrew Penner | Milo: corporate attorneys spend the equivalent of 3 weeks out of the out of the year doing this type of work and that

564
01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:15.070
Andrew Penner | Milo: kind of hits a little different, I think, with me. I know that I I haven't met an attorney who only works 40 HA week, so I know it's not actually really that. But it's the equivalent right? And it's it's a different way of framing that kind of problem.

565
01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:18.980
Andrew Penner | Milo: Otherwise I thought the pitch was really strong.

566
01:15:19.687 --> 01:15:24.200
Andrew Penner | Milo: Things that stood out to me for what it's worth. Founder market fit. That's always a big one, right?

567
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:27.419
Andrew Penner | Milo: And you were able to establish that. And I think that's great.

568
01:15:28.014 --> 01:15:39.370
Andrew Penner | Milo: Time tracking pretty indisputably is a problem being able to reduce that by 90%. If those are the things that you want people to take away. Then I think you did an excellent job.

569
01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:56.419
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, I was. Gonna say, you can also multiply your hourly rate with the amount of hours that you save and put it like, if it's if you if you charge, you know, some lawyers charge a thousand dollars an hour right like that's not crazy, and so that's

570
01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:12.120
Mircea Gogoncea: 10,000 a month. So that's 120,000 a year. So say that you save one lawyer $120,000 a year, and that's a lot more powerful. I made those numbers up. But oh, there we go. Alex is saying exactly the same thing in the chat. Yeah, I agree. 100%.

571
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:38.290
Chris Wong: Got it. Yeah, super helpful. They make on average about a hundred 50 an hour on average, up to about 2 50 a range around that. So I can, I appreciate all the comments. Yeah, they're like, it's like magnifying the numbers to be a lot more impactful in different ways, either in a dollar amount or like, yeah, we're capturing the amount of time into a much bigger set. So it is like has more impact. Let me play around.

572
01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:39.090
Mircea Gogoncea: I,

573
01:16:39.170 --> 01:17:02.810
Mircea Gogoncea: if you go high on that range, and you say you take the higher end, 250 that still comes out to 30,000 per lawyer per year, and multiply that by however many lawyers there are that bill in A in a large firm, and maybe they have a hundred lawyers, and then that 30,000 becomes 3 million. So we serve, we can say we can save a single

574
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:21.740
Mircea Gogoncea: big law firm 3 million dollars a year. That's pretty significant, because you can argue that you can easily charge 4, 500,000 if you're going to save them 3 million right? And so that's that's how I would think about it like, multiply the numbers. Yes, take the higher range, but make it believable, and I would I would believe that math that I just.

575
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.659
Mircea Gogoncea: you know, did based on what you said.

576
01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:25.090
Andrew Penner | Milo: Also.

577
01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:41.610
Andrew Penner | Milo: I looked at Cooley. And those people are not making 1 50 to 2, 50 an hour. I would love the intro to the 1 50 to 2, 50 an hour, attorney, but, like even our attorneys when we closed our fundraise, were, I think, 7, 50, and that's well below what Cooley had quoted us. So

578
01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:56.971
Andrew Penner | Milo: you know, depending on how you want to frame it. You could even say because you mentioned your experience at Cooley, right? You could say for cooley attorneys that would be the equivalent of X, and I'm pretty sure they're around a thousand dollars an hour, so you could. You could mess with it a little bit, but

579
01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.200
Andrew Penner | Milo: Otherwise really strong.

580
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:09.889
Chris Wong: Got it. Yeah, that's helpful. I was trying to do most lawyers that are at law firms. So I took like, kind of like the average of all lawyers. But you're right. I mean, Cooley's charging around a thousand like on average. Yeah.

581
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:12.339
Chris Wong: yeah, okay, got it.

582
01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:35.410
Alex Nativelle: One thing that felt a bit weird was the time with your family. I don't remember exactly what you said, but the opening is really strong, and the delivery is amazing about the hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. And then, when you're transitioning, there's something a bit weird, I felt like a bit of. I don't remember the exact wording, but I felt like you. You repeated hate, and I hated it again, and so it felt a bit

583
01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:45.579
Alex Nativelle: a bit weird on that regard. And then the family, you know we have like, I hate this. I hate this, and then the billing. And maybe you you talk about money, and then you talk about family, and I'm like, Oh.

584
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:51.570
Alex Nativelle: this is, you know, a bit conflicting my head just 1 point. I don't know.

585
01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:53.109
Ankur Toshniwal: You. You said

586
01:18:53.110 --> 01:19:02.170
Ankur Toshniwal: you said you said spend time away from doing. Xyz, I think. That's I think, what that's what Alex is referring to. Maybe when you say, Spend time away from.

587
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:14.109
Ankur Toshniwal: just be precise about. I probably stay in the pocket of either like high leverage work, or like right, because otherwise, once you say family, I agree it

588
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:26.689
Ankur Toshniwal: technically, you could say skiing, and there's no if it if, as soon as a word is replaceable with any other kind of activity. Then it it means it doesn't have a lot of like weight, probably. so yeah, I agree with thoughts. There.

589
01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:30.540
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah. And if you're gonna cut time because you need to cut like.

590
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:40.420
Chris Wong: I think we lost Mirtha.

591
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:47.929
Mircea Gogoncea: That enumeration might be a bill for those hours, and frankly, is much rather spend it than my family.

592
01:19:48.171 --> 01:19:49.860
Andrew Fernandes: You cut out for about 5 seconds.

593
01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.129
Mircea Gogoncea: Enough, I think that's that's like all all we need.

594
01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.139
Chris Wong: You cut out just now.

595
01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:57.989
Mircea Gogoncea: I was just saying that could be an an easy. I'm so sorry. Can you guys hear me now?

596
01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.220
Mircea Gogoncea: 12345678910.

597
01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:01.690
Chris Wong: Yep.

598
01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:07.960
Mircea Gogoncea: Okay, cool. I was. I was saying that that could be an easy win to cut the few seconds.

599
01:20:08.835 --> 01:20:09.580
Mircea Gogoncea: So.

600
01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:10.180
Chris Wong: Sorry, what.

601
01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:18.040
Mircea Gogoncea: I'm a lawyer. Cut some of the enumeration of things that you'd rather be doing. One or 2 is enough, I think.

602
01:20:18.190 --> 01:20:18.530
Mircea Gogoncea: got it.

603
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:24.449
Mircea Gogoncea: and that will take that will give you like 5, 10 seconds extra, and then you're very close to the target duration.

604
01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:34.389
Chris Wong: Got it. Okay, cool. Yeah. I've been playing with the pauses a little bit. So that's why it usually comes around a minute. But I think I played around too much with the pauses on this one. But yeah, I think there's.

605
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:37.839
Mircea Gogoncea: I'm sorry I'm gonna push back on that. I think your pauses were excellent. You?

606
01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.320
Mircea Gogoncea: Oh, okay.

607
01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:59.519
Mircea Gogoncea: as they are, and take more, more content off just because otherwise that's the thing I mean, you're doing a very good job. I just want to encourage to keep doing what you did today, because I thought that was great. What you do when you sacrifice the pauses is you sacrifice everything like you take. It's like a depressive mechanism on the entire pitch, so I would rather cut.

608
01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:19.229
Mircea Gogoncea: you know, with intent cut convincedly where you want to cut, and that will allow the rest to shine rather than just saying too much, and saying it very fast, which will make everything shine less so I think this amount of pauses that you had was great personally. That's just my opinion again. N, of one got it? Yeah.

609
01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:31.700
Andrew Penner | Milo: If anyone is deciding between, do I pause more, or do I, you know, cut this piece of content, cut the content, never cut the pause, because it makes everything stronger. And

610
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:52.049
Andrew Penner | Milo: it it's gonna be tempting to say, well, if they just knew this one thing, then then it would be different. But that's why. For instance, I pushed back on Vivian with like, what's the one thing you want people to remember? Right? It's better to pick and choose the one or 2 things you want people to remember and be super intentional about that, and have the right delivery and maximize the probability that people understand it.

611
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:56.920
Andrew Penner | Milo: That's that's so much more important than trying to say everything you want to say.

612
01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.369
Chris Wong: Got it super helpful. Thanks.

613
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:06.061
Ankur Toshniwal: Chris, I wanted to add one more thing.

614
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:07.110
Chris Wong: Yeah, shoot.

615
01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.600
Ankur Toshniwal: It was.

616
01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.798
Ankur Toshniwal: I'm forgetting it now. Shit

617
01:22:11.943 --> 01:22:15.170
Ankur Toshniwal: I think it was when you you say

618
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.360
Ankur Toshniwal: oh, oh, if you're struggling to I know, like some of your early vision was like

619
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:32.169
Ankur Toshniwal: like kind of all admin work. Right? If you're struggling with just the timekeeping to keep it like to to make it feel big and make it feel like a really big problem.

620
01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:43.339
Ankur Toshniwal: I think you should. I think it is appropriate. It might be appropriate, and we can be happy down like try it out here, or something is, you can start with either that larger vision or start with your

621
01:22:43.360 --> 01:23:11.259
Ankur Toshniwal: specific thing, and then either build it up. So you say we're starting with this. And then this is the larger thing. Or say, here's the larger thing overall. We're starting with this and then that way you can frame it as as a part of a larger kind of thing, and that might make it feel it might. You might be able to use bigger numbers. You might be able to use a lot more kind of like people, you know, admin Admin lawyer, admin work takes up this much time.

622
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:26.119
Ankur Toshniwal: Timekeeping alone takes up this. We're starting there right? And like we're going. And then you kind of set up like the story for how you're starting with this, and you're gonna build up to other ones. If you're finding it difficult to justify. Maybe that 1st part.

623
01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:27.080
Chris Wong: Possible.

624
01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:31.160
Ankur Toshniwal: But I know that that can be confusing for people, too. So

625
01:23:31.450 --> 01:23:33.579
Ankur Toshniwal: you have to do it carefully. I don't know if you're trying.

626
01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:38.870
Mircea Gogoncea: Such a good pitch I like. Don't want to touch it anchor. Are you sure? That's what you want to suggest? I don't know.

627
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:43.781
Ankur Toshniwal: I don't know. I'm just. I'm just saying it's like you're finding a hard time making it feel bigger.

628
01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:47.669
Ankur Toshniwal: from a from a money perspective. I don't know. I'm just like

629
01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.679
Ankur Toshniwal: I was. That's the only reason I bring it up.

630
01:23:52.250 --> 01:24:01.672
Chris Wong: I was gonna put that in more, the QA part which is like kind of like. If if people were questioning the size and the the pain, the pain of the the size of the pain point.

631
01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.160
Alex Nativelle: I feel your goal is to connect with lawyers, so they don't need to have.

632
01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:05.600
Chris Wong: That's right.

633
01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:12.639
Alex Nativelle: Big point like the pain point. They probably felt it or like, if people know lawyers, they're like, Oh, that's probably something they experience.

634
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.590
Alex Nativelle: So I feel like it's more like an investor. So stuff.

635
01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:20.240
Ankur Toshniwal: You're probably right about that. Nick's what I'm saying. You're right. I agree.

636
01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:22.569
Chris Wong: It's a good point.

637
01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:33.239
Chris Wong: Well, cool. Thanks. Everyone really appreciate it. Mira Andrew, thank you again. And thanks everyone else. Yeah.

638
01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:36.200
Mircea Gogoncea: Thank you, Chris. Great stuff!

639
01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:48.239
Alex Nativelle: All right, let's bring it home. Thank you guys for hammering us. We've been having a bit of back and forth into who needs to do the pitch. So we're brio. Our

640
01:24:48.921 --> 01:24:58.200
Alex Nativelle: goal for this thing is to have people connect us with people in who are looking for a job, or who, with their Alma mater

641
01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:00.199
Alex Nativelle: universities and schools.

642
01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.890
Alex Nativelle: Okay, that's gonna be easier to do it. Standing.

643
01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.250
Alex Nativelle: Can I go cool?

644
01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:16.249
Alex Nativelle: I feel like I'm stepping into a world I don't know anything about.

645
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:20.589
Alex Nativelle: That's what a student told me last week about Job search.

646
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:31.280
Alex Nativelle: Getting a job is life-changing yet. Millions navigate this crucial process, blind facing confusing expectations and soul-crushing rejection.

647
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:43.599
Alex Nativelle: For recent graduates. This unknown word means they miss out on life defining opportunities trapped in underemployment simply because they never learned the rules of the game.

648
01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:46.570
Alex Nativelle: That's why we've built brio.

649
01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:52.600
Alex Nativelle: We're the AI interview coach that provides highly personalized actionable feedback 24 7.

650
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:59.700
Alex Nativelle: So everyone, regardless of background, gets a fair shot at the job and the life they deserve.

651
01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:05.319
Alex Nativelle: That student. She spent 2 years managing in retail yearning for an office role.

652
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:11.410
Alex Nativelle: but often the office looks down on the field, and navigating that jumps takes 5 years.

653
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.130
Alex Nativelle: She practiced tirelessly.

654
01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:17.839
Alex Nativelle: She landed the job, thanks to Brio

655
01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:30.109
Alex Nativelle: in under a year. We've partnered with over 10 universities, surpassed 50 Krr. And had our 1st profitable month. We're not just improving interviews. We're democratizing opportunity.

656
01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:33.710
Alex Nativelle: experience the brio difference and the video.

657
01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:41.500
Alex Nativelle: It might be a bit long. I don't know.

658
01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:46.080
Alex Nativelle: Oh, yeah, I had to cut down on a few things, but I think I get deposit. So.

659
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:48.330
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah.

660
01:26:48.330 --> 01:26:51.809
Ankur Toshniwal: Do you want to go first? st Or, yeah, I'm sorry.

661
01:26:52.310 --> 01:27:00.820
Mircea Gogoncea: Sorry. Do you guys want me to do 2 pitches and tell us which one we like best and maybe give feedback on? Is that. Is that what you're what you're trying to do?

662
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:21.779
antoinecarriere: Yeah, there's a little bit of that. But if you think it's better to give feedback to Alex first, st I'm happy to go right now, if you if you want, it's really kind of it's similar pitches, but different ones, and we do wonder which one will resonate the most.

663
01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:26.190
Mircea Gogoncea: I vote for listening first, st because otherwise we'll forget the previous one.

664
01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.360
antoinecarriere: So you want me to to go ahead.

665
01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:32.970
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, I think it should.

666
01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:39.950
antoinecarriere: Okay, so let's go.

667
01:27:40.050 --> 01:27:52.039
antoinecarriere: Imagine interviewing for your dream job. You spend countless hours preparing. You're super stressed. You can feel your heartbeat. You open the door. It's showtime.

668
01:27:53.470 --> 01:28:01.020
antoinecarriere: except within a minute, you know it's not going well, fast forward to the end. You have the crushing feeling that you blew it.

669
01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:08.810
antoinecarriere: Most of us have a version of that story. I know I do. My name is Antoine, and I failed. My 1st Google interview.

670
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:20.440
antoinecarriere: I got hired there eventually and ended up interviewing hundreds of applicants. And I saw the real problem often. The best candidates aren't the best interviewees.

671
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:22.650
antoinecarriere: That's why I built brio

672
01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:31.090
antoinecarriere: to give everyone, no matter their background or interviewing skills, a fair shot at the opportunity they deserve

673
01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:44.029
antoinecarriere: available. 24, 7. Brio gives you supportive yet incredibly personalized and actionable feedback. So you're confident yet authentic on D-day.

674
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:57.929
antoinecarriere: and it works in less than a year over 10 universities have become paying partners, and we achieve profitability in March. But at the end of the day we do this to positively impact our users. Let's take a look.

675
01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:01.349
antoinecarriere: And the video roles.

676
01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.100
Mircea Gogoncea: Nice. How long was that

677
01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:10.979
Mircea Gogoncea: that felt even longer? I might be wrong, but I thought it was even longer.

678
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.990
Sambhav Mehta: Is 1 17.

679
01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:17.270
Mircea Gogoncea: Oh, so it was 2 seconds short there, nice, all right.

680
01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:21.980
Mircea Gogoncea: Cool. So I.

681
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:27.361
Mircea Gogoncea: My opinion is that the 1st pitch was a little stronger.

682
01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:34.050
Mircea Gogoncea: I think there was a little bit too much time spent on the problem in the second pitch

683
01:29:34.960 --> 01:30:04.200
Mircea Gogoncea: in both of them. I kind of wish I had heard more about the size of the opportunity. I am scared about universities as a professor and doctor, you know. Technically I could call myself Dr. I am skeptical about the amount of money that these institutions pay, and there is a stigma about that in in Silicon Valley, so I wish there was a little bit more about like

684
01:30:04.641 --> 01:30:09.280
Mircea Gogoncea: what the how much money you could make long term.

685
01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:19.159
antoinecarriere: I don't remember if if Alex clarified at the beginning our objective, so we're not ready to fundraise. If we fundraise, we'll fundraise next year

686
01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:20.440
antoinecarriere: right?

687
01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:27.580
antoinecarriere: And and we are trying. We are trying to launch in the Us a b 2 c product.

688
01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:33.399
antoinecarriere: And so at the end of the the we. We really want people to kind of

689
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:45.150
antoinecarriere: register for themselves or for a friend. And and we're happy to to take. We want to take contacts with universities.

690
01:30:45.370 --> 01:30:55.280
antoinecarriere: But we don't. We're we're not. We're not talking to investors. I'm saying that because initially we had that and we cut it off because that's not the goal.

691
01:30:55.590 --> 01:31:02.570
antoinecarriere: and but I again don't. I'm not kind of say I'm not trying to convince you one way or another. I'm more.

692
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:07.099
Mircea Gogoncea: No, I totally understand. There, the focus on on that is more. It's.

693
01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:07.700
Alex Nativelle: Investor.

694
01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:16.790
Mircea Gogoncea: That's more of an investor thing. But at the same time, if you want to inspire people that they're going to be the next big thing that they should sign up for, because your business will be around in 5 years.

695
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:40.489
Mircea Gogoncea: You do need to make that case. I like the way that you presented Antoine the profitability better than in the previous pitch. When you said we were profitable in March I understood the nuance of like you. Just you're just saying that you're profitable in March. You're not saying that you're always going to be profitable. But at the same time it was more convincing than just. We've had our 1st profitable month, I thought anyway.

696
01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:42.970
Mircea Gogoncea: I would let Andrew chime in as well.

697
01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:53.150
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, so interestingly. I like the second pitch a little better when I

698
01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:58.710
Andrew Penner | Milo: approached it with a fundraising hat on second pitch. Had

699
01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:11.430
Andrew Penner | Milo: founder market fit. It had profitability and some strong traction numbers right 1st pitch, I think, had a more compelling story, and I'm wondering if there's a way that you can marry those together.

700
01:32:11.986 --> 01:32:16.740
Andrew Penner | Milo: Cause. At 1st my my gut reaction to what you said at the beginning was.

701
01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:28.630
Andrew Penner | Milo: I didn't really have one of those and and maybe other people in the audience will have one of those that they can identify with. But there might be some portion that didn't. They might have thought like, I think

702
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:39.750
Andrew Penner | Milo: I don't know. A lot of people maybe feel like the resume screening process is is more daunting in a lot of ways. But the interview process is so real and tangible.

703
01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:44.929
Andrew Penner | Milo: And so I love the story about the girl. If you're

704
01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:50.220
Andrew Penner | Milo: objective, is to go B to C, that's probably the one to do.

705
01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:53.479
Andrew Penner | Milo: If you're trying to get more b 2 b traction.

706
01:32:54.360 --> 01:33:03.050
Andrew Penner | Milo: you know, I think marrying those 2 is probably good, I mean out of curiosity. Why go B to C when you've already closed 10 accounts and achieve profitability? B, 2 B.

707
01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.570
Andrew Penner | Milo: Is there a reason for that.

708
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:09.729
Andrew Penner | Milo: Do you feel like you're tapping out market on the.

709
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:28.620
antoinecarriere: No, we. We think that the. So right now we have a product we can sell in France. And and we're we're stay. We're staying. b 2 b in France. It's just in the Us. Schools are larger, and the the concern is always around like the speed of the go to market.

710
01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:52.169
antoinecarriere: and we think that it's a better way to get into universities by having a few paid customers among the students, and then letting that be our kind of our seeding into selling directly to universities. So a lot of it is kind of experimenting with go to market and trying a different go to market motion in the Us.

711
01:33:53.730 --> 01:33:54.580
Andrew Penner | Milo: Okay.

712
01:33:57.430 --> 01:34:06.476
Andrew Penner | Milo: yeah. I'm happy to to share some thoughts separately. If you want on business model and and potential to parlay it into the Us. But putting that aside,

713
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:13.029
Andrew Penner | Milo: I think, yeah, that 1st pitch. I would keep the story.

714
01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:24.220
Andrew Penner | Milo: and I would bring in some of the founder level stuff, though, like, I think it's important that you say I used to. I used to hire thousands of people at Google, right? And this is this is built from that.

715
01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:34.620
Andrew Penner | Milo: I think that that tells a good story. The profitability I think I would leave because it's a good trust builder. The university traction, I think, is great.

716
01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:48.889
Andrew Penner | Milo: So, all told, I think the substance of each pitch was really strong. If if I had my way I'd probably bring the second story into the 1st or the 1st story into the second, and use that. But ultimately, that's your decision.

717
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.130
Alex Nativelle: Cool.

718
01:34:51.690 --> 01:34:53.170
Alex Nativelle: Thanks. That's useful.

719
01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:58.760
Mircea Gogoncea: And you guys need to decide what to cut.

720
01:34:59.200 --> 01:34:59.590
Alex Nativelle: Yeah.

721
01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:00.079
Mircea Gogoncea: It does need.

722
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:04.359
Alex Nativelle: We need to bring stuff in and then get from the problem.

723
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:13.159
Mircea Gogoncea: I think from the problem like you can say the same thing in fewer words, was my impression. My impression is that you can.

724
01:35:13.410 --> 01:35:24.620
Mircea Gogoncea: You can convey the fact that you used to run interviews at Google, or that you had a bad interview, or one of your customers had a bad interview experience. I think you can convey that in fewer words.

725
01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:48.119
Mircea Gogoncea: just literally like, literally go to chatgpt, put in that whole problem statement. Be like, reduce this by 50%. You're not gonna like what comes out, but like it will inspire you that you know there are faster ways to say that that same thing that's my, that's that's, I think, where you can cut a lot. I don't know if that will cut 20 seconds. That might not be all you need to cut, but but I think you can say it in fewer, fewer words.

726
01:35:48.760 --> 01:36:00.589
Ankur Toshniwal: I think Antoine story was closer to what I think is your core insight and your core problem. And I think you guys just need to get to that faster, and it needs to be one

727
01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:05.910
Ankur Toshniwal: freaking sentence, which is what I believe it is, at least from my understanding of everything. Is that

728
01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:12.900
Ankur Toshniwal: interviewing doesn't, or being a good interviewer, is not equivalent to being a good employee.

729
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:16.429
Ankur Toshniwal: and so bridging that gap is.

730
01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:21.690
Ankur Toshniwal: you know, that it takes effort or help, or something something of that line, right? There's some gap between

731
01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:28.959
Ankur Toshniwal: the process of interviewing and being useful to the company. And Brio helps people bridge that gap.

732
01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:36.680
Ankur Toshniwal: That that's line, I think, just needs to be ultra clear with some evidence

733
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:41.069
Ankur Toshniwal: right? Like, I don't know if that's even if that if that if you feel that that is the real gap

734
01:36:41.449 --> 01:36:52.500
Ankur Toshniwal: or something like that, then it just, I think, that. Say that line on the head. Here's why I know. Here's my! Here's where. Why, we know. Here's the feedback we've gotten. So we know it's even verifiable from our users

735
01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.419
Ankur Toshniwal: business opportunity, or something like that right? I don't know.

736
01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:00.840
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong if this isn't your primary target. But

737
01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:06.979
Andrew Penner | Milo: I think the problem statement could be as simple as, and and I wouldn't dispute this. It could be as simple as

738
01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:12.249
Andrew Penner | Milo: students coming out of university trying to get their 1st job are woefully underprepared for the interview process

739
01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.280
Andrew Penner | Milo: like that's

740
01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:31.397
Andrew Penner | Milo: that's something I've experienced over and over, because, like you, I've hired tons of people. And that's 1 of my biggest issues with recent grads, is, it's really hard. You have to really like you're playing therapist at times in the interview, to actually try and get to what their core skills are. You have to get past this little shell of

741
01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.490
Andrew Penner | Milo: Sometimes it's nervousness, sometimes it's like they've never done this type of thing before.

742
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:47.460
Andrew Penner | Milo: and you have to really dig to get into their core skills. And so saying that your platform helps bring that out. And people can serve as that echo chamber and be the training that they never had, I think, is really powerful.

743
01:37:52.440 --> 01:38:01.729
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, I would agree. And those problems. This is similar to what I was telling Vivian. But those problems are so believable like, you don't need.

744
01:38:01.730 --> 01:38:28.900
Mircea Gogoncea: I know that you have a lot of proof for it. It's like, we all know, you know, getting your 1st job is super stressful. Students are underprepared for that buying a car is horrible for all the parties involved. You know I buy that. I feel that deep in my soul, if you're trying to convince me that, like I don't know. Landscapers are wasting gas by using a certain type of engine for their weed whackers other than another, I would. Okay, I don't know. Maybe I guess right.

745
01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:35.550
Mircea Gogoncea: But this is like such a clear problem. I don't need it to explain too much. You know, it's it's it's obvious.

746
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:40.880
Alex Nativelle: Thanks. That's that's really helpful.

747
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.870
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, maybe like one sentence for the problem. That is like people. Yeah, of course, obviously. And then.

748
01:38:48.290 --> 01:39:17.539
Chris Wong: Yeah, I I agree with the the problem statements and all the comments made. I think another thought that I had as an option is like, if you're having testimonials in your demo video that could be already powerful because it's the person speaking on behalf of how helpful it is. So you could at the end. I think, Alex, you had like a testimony or a case study of a of a user that could be like, cut out if you have a demo video of an actual person saying that it's like really helpful. I was just kind of considering like how you're shaving talk time. But yeah.

749
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:22.099
Chris Wong: but I know that it's also powerful story to have it in there. As like supporting evidence. So

750
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:24.200
Chris Wong: I have to weigh it. You know.

751
01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:31.549
antoinecarriere: Super helpful

752
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:43.750
antoinecarriere: doesn't help us kind of choose between the the the speaker and the and the the story, because it sounds like and and Alex hasn't prepared much.

753
01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:51.630
antoinecarriere: and he's naturally better at at speaking public speaking. So I think

754
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:54.040
antoinecarriere: it's really it's really kind of a.

755
01:39:55.050 --> 01:40:04.350
antoinecarriere: So here's the difficulty we have, and the reason why we're going back and forth is at the end of the day. There's a little bit of

756
01:40:04.930 --> 01:40:05.740
antoinecarriere: well.

757
01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:30.384
antoinecarriere: from a fundraising perspective. I'm likely to be front and center, because I'm just a lot more experienced. When people look me up on Linkedin they would expect me to be the CEO as opposed to Alex to be the CEO. And so so, but at the same time we're not fundraising on this one and

758
01:40:31.130 --> 01:40:34.590
antoinecarriere: And and so so that's kind of the the

759
01:40:35.150 --> 01:40:56.300
antoinecarriere: I mean. Sorry to kind of bring you all into that mess, but that's that's kind of the and it's not. It's it's totally, it's not a. It's not a big deal, it just at the end of the day we need. We need to to pick one. And we are. We're not fully satisfied with my performance to date on this one, and we we want to do what's best for brio.

760
01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.550
Mircea Gogoncea: Are you? Are you in the office, Antoine? Today?

761
01:40:58.740 --> 01:40:59.270
antoinecarriere: Yep.

762
01:40:59.901 --> 01:41:06.170
Ankur Toshniwal: I I today's a little bit lighter. I'd I'd be. I would. I have some thoughts on that. I'd love to talk to you guys separately.

763
01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:36.339
Mircea Gogoncea: I just wanted to say, it's gonna be your decision like you're gonna have to make that decision eventually. Yourself. I, my opinion personally is, don't over index for what might be a problem tomorrow. Focus on the best result today. So like, don't overthink. Oh, what if people think I'm not this, or I'm the CEO. If I think if I do this, and then what if that like deal with the problem in front of you? How can I get the best demo date today and forget about you know the the next? The next thing?

764
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:50.808
Mircea Gogoncea: yeah. But I'm sure you guys, I mean you're both good, so it doesn't matter. You you'll be fine either way, like you can't choose wrong. The only thing you might lose is the opportunity cost of what if the other person was better in this case? But like you're gonna be fine, it doesn't matter.

765
01:41:52.650 --> 01:41:53.369
antoinecarriere: Yeah, that's helpful.

766
01:41:53.370 --> 01:41:55.470
Alex Nativelle: Thanks for humoring us guys.

767
01:41:56.150 --> 01:41:59.227
antoinecarriere: And I I see that Vivian is is

768
01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:05.139
antoinecarriere: kind of asking if she can retry. I don't want us to kind of take over the whole

769
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:06.749
antoinecarriere: end of the.

770
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:08.779
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, that sounds good to me.

771
01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:09.900
Andrew Penner | Milo: Good Vivian!

772
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:11.279
Mircea Gogoncea: Let's do it.

773
01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:35.419
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Yeah, I don't have to redo the whole thing. It's but I I want to take your feedback seriously, because I do think that would be a better transition into what I'm gonna show, which is in the video. It's very much a tool for the salesperson, but it bridges that gap. So maybe if I can just read the last couple of lines, if that's okay.

774
01:42:36.532 --> 01:42:37.710
Vivian @makingautoeasy: as much as.

775
01:42:37.710 --> 01:42:40.630
Mircea Gogoncea: Want. It's a it's a minute pitch. Just read whatever you want.

776
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:43.352
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Yeah, that's fair.

777
01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:50.619
Andrew Penner | Milo: Okay, sorry. Can you just read the whole thing that way? We can understand in the context of the greater pitch. It's a minute like Marsha said.

778
01:42:51.310 --> 01:43:16.930
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Car shopping sucks. We all know why. Yes, there are too many tools. But the real problem is that no one trusts the process. The truth is, salespeople today are at the mercy of a reputation they didn't create, based on decades of bad behavior and every moment of silence and every unexpected number every time they have to ask. The manager only tightens that stereotype salespeople aren't the enemy. They actually want to help you. They just don't have the right tools.

779
01:43:17.010 --> 01:43:31.989
Vivian @makingautoeasy: the industries, tried training, marketing and even rebranding salespeople product specialists. But they're trying to deliver world class experience. Still using the same old process. And I've personally worked with over a hundred dealerships, and I hear the same thing. The process is broken.

780
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:43.530
Vivian @makingautoeasy: This industry is still running on paper forms, and memory to close deals, and it burns through. People. Dealerships flip up to 80% of their sales teams every year, costing them $45,000 each time

781
01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:54.759
Vivian @makingautoeasy: may redefines the 1st 10 min of the car buying experience. It's a dynamic co-pilot that supports real time conversations making car buying faster and frictionless for everyone.

782
01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:01.860
Vivian @makingautoeasy: or it's made completely changes. The 1st impression of car buying in the in the 1st 10 min something like that.

783
01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:16.710
Mircea Gogoncea: I like the 1st one more. This between these very last 2, not not the 1st pitch, this one. This pitch was much better. I think I have some. So my thought is, this is a clear improvement. It tells me a little bit about what the product actually does. I love it. That's that's great.

784
01:44:16.710 --> 01:44:41.590
Mircea Gogoncea: I still think the problem is too long by a lot. But that's just that's just me, the one sentence that I think you can really lose and replace it with something more impactful is the industry has tried rebranding like. So what the industry has done many things that to me is irrelevant to your product, and it's irrelevant. You've already explained the problem. By the time you get to that we don't need that, they might have done a lot of dumb shit doesn't mean we need to

785
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:43.730
Mircea Gogoncea: enumerated and hear it in the pitch.

786
01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:51.013
Vivian @makingautoeasy: That's a good point. I I might be inviting dealerships into the into the crowd. So I think this is also speaking to them.

787
01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.689
Vivian @makingautoeasy: But that's a good point.

788
01:44:53.690 --> 01:45:01.171
Andrew Penner | Milo: Well, if you're speaking to them, they already know what they've tried to. Right like that. That sentence is not terribly value, added I. I felt the same way.

789
01:45:01.570 --> 01:45:10.953
Andrew Penner | Milo: and it gives you more room either helps you be on time or gives you more room to put something else more substantive about the product. Because, yeah, that was definitely a big improvement.

790
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:18.450
Andrew Penner | Milo: I feel like one more sentence would be nice. So trading that sentence for another would be

791
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:22.670
Andrew Penner | Milo: perfect in my mind, but that was much better, for sure.

792
01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:29.629
Vivian @makingautoeasy: And what would I replace like if I had the time? What would be the one thing you wanted? Answered

793
01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:31.300
Vivian @makingautoeasy: the answers.

794
01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.059
Andrew Penner | Milo: Good question. I mean, that's something.

795
01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:35.310
Mircea Gogoncea: Up to you, I think, but.

796
01:45:35.690 --> 01:45:36.240
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Okay.

797
01:45:37.170 --> 01:45:43.029
Andrew Penner | Milo: That's best coming from you like, what do people need to get a 360 degree of your product and where it fits in.

798
01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:52.130
Andrew Penner | Milo: yeah. Good cause. Now the last 2 sentences. If you could read them one more time now we have the context again.

799
01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:53.670
Andrew Penner | Milo: It's what.

800
01:45:54.350 --> 01:46:04.709
Vivian @makingautoeasy: May redefines the 1st 10 min of the car buying experience. It's a dynamic co-pilot that supports real time conversations, making car buying faster and frictionless for everyone.

801
01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:16.580
Mircea Gogoncea: You could insist, you could say for everyone that includes buyers and sellers, or something like that, that could be a sentence that you add, it's like relatively short, and you know.

802
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:18.220
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Hmm.

803
01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:22.729
Mircea Gogoncea: But it should be. Whatever you decide. I don't know your business.

804
01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:29.082
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I'm personally just still like

805
01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:49.179
Andrew Penner | Milo: super. Curious about how it redefines the 1st 10 min. And so I love that. You say that that's perfectly high level. You might not need more, because I think you're probably getting into that detail. So yeah, I think you're either cutting that sentence, just for time and clarity, or you're cutting it to add another sentence. But

806
01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:52.405
Andrew Penner | Milo: the one feedback that I think should stay is

807
01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:55.349
Andrew Penner | Milo: cut that one. I don't think it's adding anything.

808
01:46:55.670 --> 01:47:04.222
Vivian @makingautoeasy: I realize, as you're saying, that like the reason why you don't know how I change that in the 1st 10 min is because I'm replacing the starting point at every conversation

809
01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:08.066
Vivian @makingautoeasy: like this is the tool that they start with when they meet the customer.

810
01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:14.265
Andrew Penner | Milo: I love that like. That's 7 more words, and and you make it really clear right?

811
01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:16.180
Vivian @makingautoeasy: I think that's great.

812
01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:21.239
Andrew Penner | Milo: But again, nice nice reaction in pretty real time to the feedback. It's a big improvement.

813
01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:22.590
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Thank you.

814
01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:33.340
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, amazing. And once again, really, great delivery like this is, this is great. They're gonna do great whatever you do. And your passion and energy are gonna come through, no matter what.

815
01:47:43.450 --> 01:47:46.445
Sambhav Mehta: This has been awesome. Thank you so much.

816
01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:51.589
Sambhav Mehta: Do the alumni have any last, any feedback, or anything like that?

817
01:47:53.220 --> 01:48:13.200
Mircea Gogoncea: No, go rock it, go rock your practice. Remember, remember my suggestion. Practice extra slow practice, extra fast, and practice from the middle. Not always the whole pitch from the middle from the end. Section by section. You should be able to say it once you've decided exactly what they're going to say, and let's grab a drink after Demo Day. I'm going to be there.

818
01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.676
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, I love that. I mean this. No matter what I mean. You guys should put a lot of effort preparing in.

819
01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:35.830
Andrew Penner | Milo: you know. Put a lot of effort into preparing for this, but this will not make or break your business right. Everything else you do, the way that you execute the way that you strategize the way that you sell the way that you fit with your customers. That's what's going to make or break your business. So don't put the weight of the world on your shoulders here

820
01:48:36.340 --> 01:49:01.040
Andrew Penner | Milo: definitely treated seriously. It could be a huge opportunity, but we had one person in our cohort who completely blew it, being honest. And and he ended up just fine, right? Because he built a good business after it, and so don't get nervous. You're gonna do great. All of you have really strong pitches, no matter how you interpreted our feedback, everyone has clearly come a long way and is ready for the stage. So wish you guys the best of luck.

821
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:02.839
Alex Nativelle: Thanks a lot guys.

822
01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:08.019
Andrew Fernandes: To elaborate anonymously on blowing it.

823
01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:10.789
Andrew Fernandes: What does that look like?

824
01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:15.102
Andrew Penner | Milo: So I'll I'll say broadly, without telling anyone out.

825
01:49:15.690 --> 01:49:25.239
Andrew Penner | Milo: He just got super nervous, and it it showed in the practice, and we kept, you know. We practiced a lot as a group. But he lost his way twice

826
01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:29.918
Andrew Penner | Milo: and apologized to the crowd at 1 point said, I'm sorry.

827
01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:36.497
Andrew Penner | Milo: And all of us were like no, and then, you know, we gave him a big round of applause, tried to cheer him on and keep him going

828
01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:50.180
Andrew Penner | Milo: But again, at the end of the day, that doesn't matter too much. It's only a net positive for you guys depending on how you do right. If you guys do a great job, you can get some action out of it if you don't do a great job.

829
01:49:50.430 --> 01:50:04.619
Andrew Penner | Milo: The other 3 months that you spent in this program are the main value and the time you will spend building your business and listening to your customers and building the new frontier of whatever technology you're working on. That's what's most important.

830
01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.458
Andrew Penner | Milo: So yeah, it was, it was a tough one to watch

831
01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:13.080
Andrew Penner | Milo: But he ended up, okay, and you guys will, too, if the same thing happens.

832
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:22.150
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, I had 24 companies in my cohort. We were enormous. We were a double cohort, and it used to be 12, so

833
01:50:22.170 --> 01:50:42.880
Mircea Gogoncea: I can point to like 3 or 4 people who did a pretty bad job, and one of them raised a lot of money after, and also built a very great business, and I was just thinking back to the people that have recently signed big customers or raised big rounds, and it's totally all over the place. Some of them did great on Demo Day. Some of them did medium, some did not do great

834
01:50:43.222 --> 01:51:02.379
Mircea Gogoncea: we had one person get super nervous, and she took like 20 seconds within each sentence. So her pitch was like 3 min, and it was very, you know, very extreme. We had somebody lost their way. Get a lot random applause as well we've had. I've seen. I've seen everything, so you'll you'll be fine.

835
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:04.730
Andrew Penner | Milo: Yeah, agree.

836
01:51:09.850 --> 01:51:11.930
Alex Nativelle: Thank you. Guys, thanks guys.

837
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:12.590
Chris Wong: Thank you.

838
01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:13.350
antoinecarriere: Yeah, it's.

839
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:14.080
Chris Wong: Yeah.

840
01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.580
Mircea Gogoncea: Alright! Have a good one, everybody see you soon.

841
01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:18.260
Vivian @makingautoeasy: Thanks.

842
01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:19.540
carloscaglia: Thank you.

843
01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:20.860
Mircea Gogoncea: They!

844
01:51:23.210 --> 01:51:25.790
Sambhav Mehta: Bye-bye, Antoine, I'll see you soon.
