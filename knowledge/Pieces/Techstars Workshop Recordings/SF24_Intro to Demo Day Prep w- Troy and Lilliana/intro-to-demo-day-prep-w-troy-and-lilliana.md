## Overview

This foundational workshop introduces SF24 founders to Demo Day presentation principles through Troy Henikoff's years of experience coaching hundreds of companies. The session covers universal presentation concepts, analyzes a masterful demo day performance (Routific), and provides live elevator pitch coaching with detailed feedback. Troy emphasizes the critical distinction between different presentation types and the strategic content allocation required for each format.

## Key Themes

1. **Presentation Type Distinction**: Different presentations (elevator pitch, VC pitch, Demo Day, pitch competition) require fundamentally different approaches and content
2. **Signal vs. Noise**: Every word must serve a purpose - eliminate all filler content to maximize impact
3. **Three Takeaway Rule**: Audiences can only remember 3 main points, so focus relentlessly on the most important messages
4. **Emotional Engagement**: Stories and emotion create memorable experiences that transcend information transfer
5. **Opening Hook Strategy**: First 15-20 seconds determine audience attention - lose them early, lose them completely

## The Strategic Foundation: Understanding Presentation Types

### Elevator Pitch Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Binary outcome - immediate interest or polite dismissal

Troy's philosophy: > "So you see in sales? Yes, is the best answer, but no is a very good answer. Maybe when you don't know if someone's interested or not, you gotta waste time on them. It's horrible. You want to get them out of maybe land. So the elevator pitch is to really get to that next step."

**Success Metrics**: 
- Excited follow-up questions ("Wow, that's really cool. How do you do X?")
- Clear disinterest ("Oh, it's cool. Well, did you see the World Series game last night?")

### VC Pitch Strategy

**Primary Goal**: Secure the next meeting, not immediate investment

> "The goal of that is typically to get the next meeting right. So we talked about it a little bit on the financial modeling. I would use my Vc. Pitch to get the next meeting, which was the in my case many times was the financial model meeting, because it takes multiple meetings to get an investment."

### Demo Day Pitch Philosophy

**Primary Goal**: Entertainment and relationship initiation

> "It's really about entertaining the audience, and your goal is to get them to come up to you afterwards and set a 1st meeting."

**The 24-Hour Rule**: 
> "So when I ran Techstar, Chicago, which I did for 7 years. I would tell our teams before Demo Day that the company that wins Demo Day I'm using air quotes was the company that gets the most meetings scheduled in the next 24 h, and you only have 24 h because people forget about it after that."

**Strategic Approach**: "Really, what you're trying to do is not tell your entire story, but tell enough of the story that they want to hear the rest of the story."

### Pitch Competition Complexity

**The Rules Problem**: 
> "Most people who do them have no idea how they're being judged, have no idea what the criteria is for winning the pitch competition."

**Troy's Judge Experience**: 
> "And I know this because I judge these things, and many times when I judge these things, I show up, and they have a little meeting beforehand for the judges. And the 1st question I have I raised my hand really high? I'm like, what's the criteria? They're like, well, the best pitch wins."

**The Baseball Analogy**: 
> "You can't win a game if you don't know what the rules of the game are... They could not have stepped out on the field and played the game because they didn't know the rules. What makes you think you can step out and win a pitch competition if you don't know the rules."

**Critical Action**: "So what I implore, implore you please, when you enter pitch competitions long before the competition starts, you should email the people who are running competition say, Hey, can you give me the rubric? What's the criteria for winning this competition? How are you judging it."

## The Attention Economy: Demo Day Fundamentals

### The 15-Second Window

**The Phone Competition**: 
> "1st thing is, you have a very short time to get the judges attention or the audience's attention in a Demo day pitch. Because you're fighting against this thing. The phone is beeping and buzzing and saying, Give me attention. Give me attention. Give me attention."

**Critical Timeline**: "You gotta have a big opening, and you have like 15 to 20 seconds to get their attention. If you don't have their attention in 15 or 20 seconds. They're gonna be on their phone."

### The Three Takeaway Rule

**Memory Limitation Reality**: 
> "If they talked about like 8 or 10 different big bullet points. I my brain's not that good. I could only remember like 3 of them. And so I roll off the 3 that I remembered, which may not have been the most important 3 to the founders."

**Strategic Solution**: 
> "When you are crafting your pitch. think about. What are the 3 takeaways that you want the audience to remember? And those are the only ones you talk about, because if you talk about something else it's going to potentially take away from one of the primary ones."

**Example Framework**: 
> "So if I'm being very generic and you should not be this generic, the more specific you are the better. But if I think about if I'm pitching a company, and I know there's a giant market. we have great margins and a great go-to-market strategy. If you, as an investor, believe big market big margins, great go to market strategy, you're gonna write a check."

### Call to Action Imperative

**Audience Motivation**: 
> "Everybody in the audience at Demo Day is there because they want to help. Some are there because they want to. You know, they want to see what's what's around. But they want to help. They care about you all."

**The Empty Feeling**: 
> "And if you give a great pitch. And like, Yeah, we're this great company. And we got great big market, and we got good go to market. And you know, good margins. And you know. Thanks a lot. It feels empty."

**Specific Call to Action Examples**:
- "We're opening around. If you know anybody who wants to invest, please reach out."
- "We're looking for customers. So if you know any b 2 b companies that are in this space. And and, you know, look like this. That would be great."
- "We're talking to Hr. Managers at companies of 500 to 5,000 employees. I would love connections to any that you have."

**Psychological Impact**: "People want to help, and giving them a call to action makes them feel good and helps them help you."

## Show Don't Tell Philosophy

### David Cohen's Principle

**Core Concept**: 
> "This one I have to give credit to David Cohen show. Don't tell. It's so much more compelling when you show them your product. This is why we call it Demo Day."

**Format Integration**: 
> "You're gonna have a minute video specifically to show them your product... And that's because this team has realized how important that is that everybody has to like focus, show, and make sure you show."

## The Power of Storytelling

### Stories vs. Information

**Memory Formation**: 
> "Stories are what make people. Remember what you said. Tell a story. There is a great book. If any of you have any time to speed, read, or to look at a book it's called Made to Stick."

**Made to Stick Framework**: 
> "It's by the Heath Brothers, Heath and Heath... and it's all about how you use stories to get your ideas to stick, and of course they do it too. So they open with a story."

**Creative Differentiation**: 
> "So you gotta use stories, but you gotta be creative about your stories... if you, when you hear 12 of those in a row, it's really boring [referring to generic 'Meet Jane' customer stories]."

### Emotional Engagement Excellence

**The Goosebumps Test**: 
> "People don't remember what you say nearly as much as they remember how you made them feel."

## The GiveForward Master Class

### Historical Context and Setup

**Demo Day Evolution**: 
> "The very 1st demo day that we did for Chicago before we were even techstars. We were called Accelerate Labs in 2,010. We had no idea what we were doing... We had the House of Blues in Chicago. 3 stories of people it was amazing, packed with with investors."

### The Jessica Story

**The Introduction Setup**: 
> "Things were quiet. The lights went down, and this kind of mousy woman, who was very uncomfortable. She clearly didn't want to be out there, and she kind of scurried out on to the stage, and she said, Hi, my name's Jessica and I'm here because of give forward."

**Desiree's Masterful Storytelling**: 
Troy's powerful retelling demonstrates emotional storytelling excellence:

> "Jessica was born with some sort of birth. Defect has had a litany of health issues over over her lifetime, including a heart transplant. one lung transplanted blah blah blah blah! She has exhausted all of the medical insurance that blue cross blue shield will provide to her over 2 million dollars worth of benefits."

**The Crisis and Resolution**: 
> "She found out 2 years ago that she needed a kidney transplant to survive... her sister tested positive to be a exact match for her kidney transplant, and her sister was willing to donate her kid one kidney to help Jessica survive. but the family didn't have the money. and Blue Cross wouldn't pay for it."

**The Platform Impact**: 
> "But fortunately a good friend found. Give forward the 1st crowdfunding medical site. put Jessica's story on. Get forward! Raise the $35,000 they needed for the surgery in less than 2 weeks. Jessica's sister donated her kidney. Jessica is healthy today, and she's here on stage because of give forward."

**Lasting Impact**: 
> "I don't know if it's just my memory, or if it, if if it, the story is that good? But I got goosebumps when I was telling you that story."

### The Memorability Formula

**Standing Out Strategy**: 
> "And here's the reality. There are going to be 12 of you up there. and you know if people in the audience you want to stand out... if if you're just yet another, you know, slide deck and video and boring interview, they're not going to remember you."

**The Emotional Connection**: 
> "But if they're like, but like with give forward, they're like, Oh, my God! I want to talk to that woman with the kidney transplant like. That's what people were like the woman who saved the life like, I want to talk to her."

## Signal to Noise Ratio Mastery

### Engineering Principle Applied

**Definition and Context**: 
> "Signal is actually the information transfer noise is the inevitable... the inevitable transformation of non-intended information."

**Radio Analogy**: 
> "For those of you who are old enough to remember when cars had radios that had a dial where you had to turn it. What would happen is when you were zeroing in on an FM. Radio station would be all. and when you got it just perfect. The music was louder than the static... That's the signal to noise. Ratio"

### Zero Waste Principle

**Filler Elimination**: 
> "Pitches. It is so important you should have 0 words that are not signals... You should not have Filler. This is not like an 8th grade book. Report where they say it has to be 3 pages. And so you're gonna make up stuff and and fill in with garbage just to make it be 3 pages."

**Time Management Philosophy**: 
> "If you have 10 min to give a pitch, and you only have 7 min of content, give them 7 min. and have no filler. Have incredible direct signal. No noise."

**Demo Day Application**: 
> "In your case, you're gonna have 1 min for your video. You're gonna have 1 min for your individual pitch. There should not be an extra word. There should not be an in your 1 min pitch, because that's noise."

## Low-Fidelity Prototyping for Presentations

### The Iteration Process

**Starting Point Philosophy**: 
> "So what I do when Slide and I'll go through the slide version and we'll just do text version next. So what I do... is the very 1st version of their deck... I like this, the format that that the team does now better. I think it's much more interesting."

**Black Text, White Background**: 
> "We would start out, and the 1st version is black text. white background. one slide for every slide. You think you're going to have put the black text on it. White background. Spend no time. This is this is gonna get thrown out. It's gonna get changed. You don't want to have any investment in it."

### Objective-Driven Development

**Slide Objectives**: 
> "Each slide should have an objective. If you don't have an objective for a slide, you shouldn't have the slide translating for you for this 1 min. If you don't have an objective or something you want to see. you want to say you shouldn't say it."

**Low-Fidelity Focus**: 
> "At this level in your low fidelity prototype. No pictures, no graphs. You do not invest any time in beauty. What we have to do is create a story. And so the 1st few iterations were just about the story."

**Text Version Approach**: 
> "Now, since you're not using slides, you do the same thing with an outline. and your outline could be. Here are the 3 big points I want to make under each point. Here are the sub points I want to make. You should be dealing with it at that level."

**Content Before Polish**: 
> "Don't be writing text and dealing with word choices and all that. Let's focus on the points you want to make. because if you have the points right and you have the sub points right, the text will flow."

## The Deck Hostage Strategy

### One-Page Executive Summary

**Content Strategy**: 
> "I feel really strongly that I do not send a deck unless I have presented it first.st And I'm even happy to share with you guys, I have a little video about that... I hold the deck hostage to get the 1st meeting. So what I have, and I feel really strongly about this, and most people agree, not everybody. But I have a 1 page executive, summary."

**Teaser Components**: 
> "Or overview, that I send out all the time you interested in my company. Here it is, and it should have all the pieces it should have like a little graph going up into the right, it should have problem solution, maybe faces of the people who are there and some Logos about the great work they've done. It's a teaser."

### The Meeting Requirement

**Pushback Script**: 
> "And then, if you want the meeting. we'll go over a deck in the meeting, and I push back hard. If an investor says, hey? Send me the deck, and then I'll decide. I'll say, you know my deck really isn't meant to be sent it it doesn't. It's just meant to be a background for a discussion."

**Strategic Positioning**: 
> "So why don't we meet in person? And I'll review the deck, and then you can have a copy of it afterwards. But it won't make any sense if I just send it. It's just background for discussion."

### Success Rates and Philosophy

**Effectiveness**: 
> "90% of the time it works. You will get the meeting. You'll go through it. It works beautifully 10% of the time, they may say, No, if you're not going to send a deck I won't meet. And you know what? They probably weren't serious."

**Investment Philosophy**: 
> "They should be investing in you as humans. This is early stage. It is 90% team. It's 10% market size and go to market. And all that stuff that stuff's gonna change. It's really about the humans."

**Wrong Investor Filter**: 
> "And so if they're going to look at a deck and what you say about market size and decide to invest or not. They don't care about the humans. That's not who you want as an investor in a early stage."

## Routific: A Demo Day Masterpiece

### The Opening Hook Excellence

**Unexpected Beginning**: 
> "Have you ever seen a ups truck make a left-hand turn? You might have heard that Ups is so obsessed with efficiency that their trucks are forbidden from making left-hand turns. Well, let me tell you that's Bullshit."

**Attention Strategy**: 
> "He used a different technique for a big opening... He swore on stage. He gave people something they didn't expect. and the audience was like they laughed, and they're like, Oh, crap! I better pay attention"

### Customer-Centric Storytelling

**Real Customer Focus**: 
> "My name is Mark, founder of Routific, and I'm not here to bullshit you. I'm here to tell you a true story of Alex, the CEO of local libations, one of the 42 customers currently paying for routific."

**Specific Problem Illustration**: 
> "They deliver 100,000 bottles of beer across the city of Austin every week. Alex's job is to make sure all his deliveries are on time, and to do this he used to spend 2 h every morning, manually planning his routes with excel spreadsheets."

**Tangible Business Impact**: 
> "We helped Alex reclaim 2 h of his workday, which he now spends growing his business. What's more, we cut his driving time and fuel consumption in half. This allowed Alex to serve more customers without buying more trucks or hiring more staff."

### Technical Complexity Made Accessible

**The Challenge Scale**: 
> "Oh, and, by the way, with 57 stops, you already have 40 quattrovigitillion possible permutations, each of which represents a delivery schedule for Alex. The routing problem is considered one of the hardest problems in computer science."

**Solution Simplicity**: 
> "Our proprietary algorithm can churn through these permutations and generate an optimized schedule in seconds... Next Alex dispatched those routes directly to his driver's smartphones. We made Route optimization, that simple."

### Market Analysis and Go-to-Market

**Competitive Landscape**: 
> "Even though ups Fedex and the Us. Postal service have invested billions of dollars to build route optimization in-house. They only account for 6.5% of the delivery market."

**Target Market Definition**: 
> "These are the 350,000 fleets with 4.5 million trucks on the road, and almost all of them are still routed manually. They desperately need route. Optimization and routeific is built to meet exactly this need."

**Business Model Clarity**: 
> "We have a simple revenue model. We charge $39 per vehicle per month. That's nearly $500 a year. Our average customer has 8 vehicles. They pay us almost $4,000 each year. We've learned that it cost us $952 to acquire a customer. The acquisition cost is paid back within 4 months."

### Presentation Excellence Elements

**Memory and Preparation**: 
> "He knew that thing. Cold. He he could. Probably he did that in 2,015. I am guessing that if I I'm gonna literally I have a zoom call. He's up in Vancouver. I have a zoom call with him next week. I'll bet he could. If I throw up the slides he could. He could re. He could probably come up with 98% of the words like he committed that thing to memory."

**Voice Variation Mastery**: 
> "At 1 point he talked really quietly said, let me tell you what I learned other times. He got really excited. Let me tell you about the great companies that use ratific every day. right? That variation in volume. The variation in pace makes it interesting to listen to a speaker."

**Circular Storytelling**: 
> "He also did a great trick which I love. He opened he had his get attention opening right? That's bullshit... But at the end, his very last line he tied back to the opening... he said. What we're gonna do is we're gonna make people more efficient. What we're not going to do is forbid them from making left-hand turns."

## Live Elevator Pitch Coaching

### Dominique (Agent Luna): Wealth Management Marketing

**Original Pitch Issues**: 
Confusion between wealth management solution and marketing platform for wealth managers.

**Troy's Reconstruction**: 
> "The greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world is happening now. 90 trillion dollars, or whatever it is the millennials are going to inherit, and this is an opportunity. There are wealth managers who know how to manage wealth, who have great software packages. Who can man do turn that 90 trillion into 180 trillion dollars? But they got a problem. They don't know how to reach the millennials."

**Key Learning - Customer Clarity**: 
> "Always being very clear upfront. What is the problem? And who is the buyer who gets value out out of this... you could say, you know, 90 trillion dollars. And we got people with great software and solutions. And they've got a problem. Each one of them has a marketing manager who doesn't know how to reach their audience."

### Dave Scott (Evil Genius Games): Personal Story vs. Hook

**The Backstory Problem**: 
> "I am particularly sensitive. I don't like introducing myself upfront, because, remember, I've got 15 seconds to get people's attention. They don't give a shit what my name is until they know what value I'm delivering."

**Solution Approach**: 
> "I would literally start out with saying. role playing games, board games with pieces and old style. yeah, today, there's still a hundred 50 million people in the Us who play that stuff. But the world has changed. The expectations of consumers have changed. They expect to be able to play it online."

**Content Allocation Strategy**: 
> "You want to decide. What are you putting in your pitch. What are you putting in the demo? And what are you exposing in the Q. And a. Because you get to work with your mentor about? What's in the Q&A."

### Çoruh (CogniScope): Gaming Community Analytics

**Original Approach Issues**: 
Accent challenges and complex narrative structure.

**Troy's Simplified Version**: 
> "Sony. One of the biggest gaming companies in the world had a bug in their login process. They lost over 300,000 paying users in just 4 days... We a cognoscope, use the same kind of AI engine to look at the discord, the comments, the whatever to identify for gaming companies how their audience is feeling."

**The Proactive Positioning**: 
> "We tell the gaming company what the problems are before their audience even knows it. We let them be proactive and stay ahead of the problems. We let them fix the problems before their audience knows it."

**Financial Impact**: 
> "What would Sony pay to not have that screw up again... it was over 180 million dollars in just one game."

### Fabio (ByteNight): AI Infrastructure Revolution

**The Hook Strategy**: 
> "In the last 24 months we have seen a shift in technology that is bigger than any we have ever seen before. The advent of artificial intelligence... This is bigger. It's gonna change the way every application interacts with the humans."

**The Race Narrative**: 
> "And there is a race to get there. Almost every startup here is doing some sort of AI, and they're all recreating the wheel. We don't want that to have to happen."

**Value Proposition**: 
> "We provide a serverless access through Api, so that each company that wants to access Api doesn't have to go through the pain and and anguish of trying to set all of this stuff up accessing us, accessing AI through us, using some simple Apis allows them to get from 0 to functional in less than 24 h."

**The Yes Sequence**: 
> "If you get your audience... once you've hooked them, if you get them to nod along with you... get, give them a bunch of things that they absolutely, positively agree with, and say, Yes, yes, yes. Will you invest? Yeah... you're just so used to saying yes."

## Universal Coaching Patterns

### The Name Introduction Philosophy

**Timing Strategy**: 
> "My style. People disagree with me on this. By the way, smart people say no, no, you have to give the name so they can relate to you. I don't. My style is to do problem solution and then say, my name is Troy, and I'm the CEO, because now they care if they care about the problem solution."

### Accent and Authenticity

**The Pictorine Example**: 
> "We had him play up his accent. and it was one of the most fun Demo day pitches ever because he was talking... and literally coming out of Demo Day you heard people imitating Guillaume. But remember, that made him memorable."

**Differentiation Strategy**: 
> "So that people can remember you and Re. Anyway, I think you can play up your accent, have fun with it... see if you can be creative about how you leverage your accent to be an asset rather than a liability."

### Memorization vs. Natural Delivery

**The ABC Analogy**: 
> "None of you have sung the Abcs. Most like, unless you have kids sung the Abcs in decades. But you could do it. Not only could you do it, you could do it while throwing a ball while playing Frisbee while doing like you don't have to stop and think about it, and that allows you to do it with emotion."

**Performance Progression**: 
> "And there's this trajectory you go through. Learning is really awkward. Then you get the words right. Once you have the words right, then you can actually start thinking about how I'm presenting the words."

## Implementation Framework

### The Three-Component Strategy Map

**Content Distribution**: 
> "You literally have, like a little map of here are the 10 things I want to communicate. These 2 are going to be in the pitch. These 3 will be in the live. These will be in the Q. And a. And you know that you've covered it all."

### Presentation Delivery Excellence

**Voice as Typography**: 
> "Imagine if I sent you an email and it was in all caps all the time. That's what it feels like when someone is talking loud and fast the whole time in their presentation... Now, if I have an email where I'm sending you, and I want to make a point, I may have one word in caps... You now know what I care about."

### Opening Hook Strategies

**Teaching Something New**: 
> "One of the best attention getting things is, if you have something people think they know. and you show them that they are wrong... if you tell them something. You they didn't know they're like Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait! I better pay attention. I didn't know that thing."

## Long-Term Success Indicators

### Routific's Continued Success

**Post-Demo Day Growth**: 
> "So they've done well. They're in, you know. They have many millions of dollars of revenue today, not tens of millions. I don't think yet, but many millions. They've been cash flow positive. They raised a tiny amount of money early on 500,000 or something... they haven't raised much money, which is good, because that means they've created value without getting diluted."

## Key Takeaways for Demo Day Excellence

1. **Master presentation type distinctions** - Different formats require fundamentally different approaches and content strategies
2. **Eliminate all noise** - Every word must advance your core message; ruthlessly cut filler content
3. **Focus on three takeaways** - Audiences can only retain three main points, so choose them strategically
4. **Hook within 15 seconds** - You have one brief window to capture attention before losing to phones
5. **Tell emotional stories** - People remember how you made them feel more than what you said
6. **Show don't tell** - Demonstrate your product impact through customer journeys and real outcomes
7. **Use the deck hostage strategy** - One-page teasers get meetings; full decks are for live presentations
8. **Practice until natural** - Memorization enables emotional delivery and authentic presence
9. **End with specific calls to action** - Help your audience help you with concrete next steps
10. **Leverage your unique attributes** - Turn potential liabilities (accent, background) into memorable differentiators

This foundational workshop establishes the strategic thinking and practical skills required for Demo Day success. Troy's methodology emphasizes that great presentations emerge from clear objectives, ruthless content prioritization, and authentic emotional connection with your audience. The session demonstrates that technical excellence in presentation craft, combined with compelling storytelling, creates the memorable experiences that drive meaningful business relationships.

The live coaching segments reveal common founder pitfalls: unclear customer definition, personal backstory overemphasis, and feature complexity without benefit clarity. Troy's real-time reconstructions show how to transform rambling narratives into focused value propositions that immediately communicate who you serve, what problem you solve, and why it matters. This hands-on methodology provides a template for continuous pitch refinement throughout the Demo Day preparation process.
