1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We got everybody here we're ready to go.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:22.050
Lilliana Robinson: I think we have everyone. So you guys, Troy is gonna go through. We do this every time together. He's gonna give you some tips and tricks from his time as an Md. He's helped hundreds and hundreds of companies prepare for Demo Day. He's gonna help, you guys, which is so generous. It's awesome. He doesn't do this for every program. So it's a privilege.

3
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Just you.

4
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.879
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. Oh, Jessa. Oh, wow!

5
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.669
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, yeah, this is a just, you know, the Chicago Og group kind of thing.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.080
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you. Well, we appreciate it. They know how big a deal it is. And they're excited for your your time and your expertise. So we'll let Troy give his presentation. You guys can ask questions. We'll see some examples, and then we'll go through live. So that's kind of our run of show, I'll hand it off to you.

7
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's great.

8
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:54.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright, real quickly. Alright, I'm set up here. What I want to do is I'm gonna talk to you about so years of creating demo day presentations. I think

9
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I really think there are some tricks to it.

10
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then and then we'll do the 1st step, which is, I want to make sure you guys have awesome elevator pitches. So

11
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:21.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him): alright, if I do this right, I'm going, and I, of course, as I always do, I'll share this deck with you. So you get to see the deck. What you won't get to see is you won't get a copy of the video that is played within the deck. Because when I Pdf, the deck, obviously, the video doesn't happen. So I would encourage you to

12
00:01:22.262 --> 00:01:30.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him): oh, they changed. There's the share, sound and optimize for video. They moved it in. Zoom. It's now on the right, not on the bottom anymore. Alright.

13
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I think I just shared my main screen. That says techstars right with the old logo.

14
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.820
Lilliana Robinson: Yep, we can see that.

15
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:48.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Awesome great. So you can tell. I've been doing this for a long time. This is a very outdated techstars. Logo. I apologize. But it's about creating great presentations.

16
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so when I think about great presentations, one of the most important things is to understand that there are different kinds of presentations that require

17
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): different kinds of content.

18
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So think about an elevator pitch.

19
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Obviously, that's short. We're going to talk more about elevator pitches in a minute, you know a venture. Capital pitch is very different from a Vc pitch

20
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): or a Demo day pitch. V. Sorry. Vc. Pitch is very different than a Demo day pitch

21
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and a pitch competition is something even different. It may seem like a pitch. Competition would be like a Demo day pitch.

22
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but

23
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, each of these has its own objective.

24
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I want to talk about it for a second. So an elevator pitch.

25
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him): When I do my 2 line elevator pitch, my goal is to get someone

26
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to either say, Wow, that's really cool. How do you do, X,

27
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and dive in? Or to kind of nod their head and say, Oh, it's cool. Well, did you see the World Series game last night?

28
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Which is okay, too.

29
00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:04.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you see in sales? Yes, is the best answer, but no is a very good answer. Maybe when you don't know if someone's interested or not, you gotta waste time on them. It's horrible. You want to get them out of maybe land. So the elevator pitch is to really get to that next step.

30
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a Vc pitch.

31
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:21.139
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The goal of that is typically to get the next meeting right. So we talked about it a little bit on the financial modeling. I would use my Vc. Pitch to get the next meeting, which was the in my case many times was the financial model meeting.

32
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.839
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because it takes multiple meetings to get an investment.

33
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a Demo day pitch.

34
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's really about entertaining the audience, and your goal is to get them to come up to you afterwards and set a 1st meeting.

35
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:45.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So when I ran Techstar, Chicago, which I did for 7 years. I would tell our teams before Demo Day that the company that wins Demo Day I'm using air quotes

36
00:03:45.040 --> 00:04:01.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): was the company that gets the most meetings scheduled in the next 24 h, and you only have 24 h because people forget about it after that. So really, what you're trying to do is not tell your entire story, but tell enough of the story that they want to hear the rest of the story.

37
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let's talk about pitch competitions for a minute. I'm sure a bunch of you have done pitch competitions.

38
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But here's the thing about pitch competitions. Most people who do them

39
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): have no idea how they're being judged.

40
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): have no idea what the criteria is for winning the pitch competition.

41
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:35.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And I know this because I judge these things, and many times when I judge these things, I show up, and they have a little meeting beforehand for the judges. And the 1st question I have I raised my hand really high? I'm like, what's the criteria? They're like, well, the best pitch wins.

42
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:52.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then I become kind of a hard ass about it, I'm like, well, do you mean the pitch that has the best presentation skills? Do you mean the company that has the most revenue? Do you mean the one that has the most traction? Do you mean the one that I think has the brightest future like? How are we judging this?

43
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And many people who run these pitch competitions don't know

44
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): they're like, well, whatever you think is best, and that's horrible.

45
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You can't win a game if you don't know what the rules of the game are.

46
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Literally.

47
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I have this really funny interaction with some techstars, founders, from Chicago years ago, who were from India.

48
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him): great guys, and they came over. And they. It was their 1st week in Chicago, and the 1st week of the program we took them to a Chicago Cubs game.

49
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:31.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and we took the whole cohort. We had a box. One of the investors lent us their box, and these guys had never seen American baseball before.

50
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but they knew cricket

51
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): for those of you who know both they're quite different.

52
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:51.589
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and they were so confused like. Tell me the rules of the game, and I'm like trying to go through the rules of baseball, and if you think about it at the high level, it's simple. But there are a lot of rules like, you know. What do you do on a fly ball and tagging up? And if it's dropped and a you know foul anyway, all the crazy stuff.

53
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They could not have stepped out on the field and played the game because they didn't know the rules.

54
00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What makes you think you can step out and win a pitch competition if you don't know the rules.

55
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:13.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So what I implore, implore you please, when you enter pitch competitions long before the competition starts, you should email the people who are running competition say, Hey, can you give me the rubric?

56
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What's the criteria for winning this competition? How are you judging it.

57
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:23.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Half of them won't know, and it will force them to ask a bunch of questions and make that decision and then communicate back to you.

58
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But it's so important to understand. So

59
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:42.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): now let's talk about demo day pitches. I just wanted to do this because what we're going to talk about for Demo day pitches is not the appropriate approach for Zvc pitch, and may not be the appropriate approach for pitch competition depending on what the rubric is.

60
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right. So let's go into a demo day pitch.

61
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think it's pretty simple.

62
00:06:49.270 --> 00:07:00.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 1st thing is, you have a very short time to get the judges attention or the audience's attention in a Demo day pitch. Because you're fighting against this thing.

63
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The phone is beeping and buzzing and saying, Give me attention. Give me attention. Give me attention. So

64
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you gotta have a big opening, and you have like 15 to 20 seconds to get their attention.

65
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you don't have their attention in 15 or 20 seconds. They're gonna be on their phone.

66
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And we're going to talk about what that looks like. The big opening.

67
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The second problem is, so my daughter.

68
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:42.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): who is now actually is about the same age as Chloe and has was an associate at techstars for a couple of years. She used to love when I would go to demo days, and she'd cut or pitch competitions whatever. And she comes, she said, what were the best companies, and I tell her a company like, she said, well, what did they talk about?

69
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And here's the thing.

70
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.989
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If they talked about like 8 or 10 different big bullet points.

71
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I my brain's not that good. I could only remember like 3 of them.

72
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.829
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so I

73
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): roll off the 3 that I remembered.

74
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him): which may not have been the most important 3 to the founders.

75
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him): There is a very simple way to solve for this.

76
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him): When you are crafting your pitch.

77
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him): think about. What are the 3 takeaways that you want the audience to remember?

78
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And those are the only ones you talk about.

79
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because if you talk about something else

80
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it's going to potentially take away

81
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:34.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him): from one of the primary ones. So if I'm being very generic and you should not be this generic, the more specific you are the better. But if I think about if I'm pitching a company, and I know

82
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him): there's a giant market.

83
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we have great margins and a great go-to-market strategy.

84
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:47.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you, as an investor, believe big market big margins, great go to market strategy, you're gonna write a check.

85
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him): or at least want the next meeting to find out if you're gonna write a check.

86
00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:05.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But don't give a laundry list about how great your team is and your experience. And and you know your marketing camp like, like, keep it focused on the 3. You could maybe go to 4. But don't do that.

87
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Don't do anymore.

88
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Stay focused on what's important

89
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him): close with a call to action.

90
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Everybody in the audience at Demo Day

91
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is there because they want to help.

92
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Some are there because they want to. You know, they want to see what's what's around. But they want to help. They care about you all.

93
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:38.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And if you give a great pitch. And like, Yeah, we're this great company. And we got great big market, and we got good go to market. And you know, good margins. And you know. Thanks a lot.

94
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It feels empty.

95
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But if you have a call to action which could be.

96
00:09:44.870 --> 00:10:05.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we're opening around. If you know anybody who wants to invest, please reach out. It could be we're looking for customers. So if you know any b 2 b companies that are in this space. And and, you know, look like this. That would be great. It could be more specific. We're talking to Hr. Managers at companies of 500 to 5,000 employees. I would love connections to any that you have.

97
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:11.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him): People want to help, and giving them a call to action makes them feel good

98
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and helps them help you.

99
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so please have a call to action.

100
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): This one I have to give credit to David Cohen show. Don't tell.

101
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:26.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's so much more compelling when you show them your product. This is why we call it Demo Day.

102
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and this is why.

103
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:39.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him): lilliana, I assume we're doing the same format. You've done the last couple of sessions with the okay, yep, great. So you're gonna have a minute video specifically to show them your product.

104
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And that's because

105
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:50.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): this team has realized how important that is that everybody has to like focus, show, and make sure you show.

106
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then 2 other things.

107
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): One is. Stories are what

108
00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): make people. Remember

109
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): what you said.

110
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:08.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Tell a story. There is a great book. If any of you have any time to speed, read, or to look at a book it's called Made to Stick.

111
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's by the Heath Brothers, Heath and Heath.

112
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's a fun entertaining book.

113
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it's all about how you use stories

114
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:23.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to get your ideas to stick, and of course they do it too. So they open with a story.

115
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:32.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And it's like this crazy story of some guy who's in a hotel, and he wakes up in a bathtub and he's bleed. There's blood in the water, and he doesn't know where he is and what happened.

116
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:38.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then they cut to something else like, Wait, what about the dude in the bathtub? And you're like, you want to know what's going on.

117
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and they use those stories to make their point.

118
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.059
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and they teach you how to use your stories to make a point.

119
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so stories are always helpful. But don't overdo it.

120
00:11:51.920 --> 00:12:02.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Everybody on Demos a day does something like meet Jane. Jane is our ideal customer. Jane wants to get food at the store and doesn't know what to order. So our app helps her do it.

121
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Hi.

122
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.139
Troy Henikoff (he/him): if you, when you hear 12 of those in a row, it's really boring.

123
00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you gotta use stories, but you gotta be creative about your stories.

124
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then

125
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the last one

126
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is extra credit.

127
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him): People don't remember what you say nearly as much as they remember how you made them feel.

128
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let me tell you a quick story

129
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:35.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the very 1st demo day that we did for Chicago before we were even techstars. We were called Accelerate Labs in 2,010.

130
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:49.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We had no idea what we were doing. This was a startup. We had never done a demo. Day before we had the House of Blues in Chicago. 3 stories of people it was amazing, packed with with investors.

131
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and the very 1st presenter was Desiree.

132
00:12:53.220 --> 00:13:00.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And literally none of us had any idea how this like are they just gonna keep making noise and not pay attention to the person on the stage. What's gonna happen

133
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and

134
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): desert. We did this format where there were people who would introduce before each

135
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): founder.

136
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:22.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And typically it was an investor who said, Hi! I'm Troy. I'm an investor. I'm investing in this company. They are great. I'm proud to share with you, you know. You should listen real carefully, and you should invest, too, like that was a great kind of introduction.

137
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But for Desiree she wanted to do something different.

138
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I I didn't know

139
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.701
Troy Henikoff (he/him): quite what she was gonna do. But

140
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What happened was.

141
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:49.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him): things were quiet. The lights went down, and this kind of mousy woman, who was very uncomfortable. She clearly didn't want to be out there, and she kind of scurried out on to the stage, and she said, Hi, my name's Jessica and I'm here because of give forward.

142
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and she runs off the stage.

143
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Everybody's kind of like. What was that?

144
00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then Desiree comes out, and if any of you have ever met Desiree. She's

145
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him): awesome. She has a great stage present.

146
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and she says, yes, that was Jessica. Let me tell you her story.

147
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.489
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I am not going to do this justice, but I'll do my best.

148
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Jessica was born with

149
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): some sort of birth. Defect

150
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): has had a

151
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:22.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): litany of health issues over over her lifetime, including a heart transplant.

152
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him): one lung transplanted blah blah blah blah!

153
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): She has exhausted

154
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:37.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): all of the medical insurance that blue cross blue shield will provide to her over 2 million dollars worth of benefits.

155
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and

156
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): she found out 2 years ago

157
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that she needed a kidney transplant to survive.

158
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Fortunately

159
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:57.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him): her family all went in for testing, and her sister tested positive to be a exact match for her kidney transplant, and her sister was willing

160
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to donate her kid one kidney

161
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to help Jessica survive.

162
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but

163
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the family didn't have the money.

164
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and Blue Cross wouldn't pay for it.

165
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They weren't going to be able to afford the surgery.

166
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:16.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but fortunately a good friend found. Give forward the 1st crowdfunding medical site.

167
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:24.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): put Jessica's story on. Get forward! Raise the $35,000 they needed for the surgery in less than 2 weeks.

168
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:31.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Jessica's sister donated her kidney. Jessica is healthy today, and she's here on stage because of give forward.

169
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:40.389
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know if it's just my memory, or if it, if if it, the story is that good? But I got goosebumps when I was telling you that story.

170
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:49.609
Dave Scott: So, Troy. I know you're paraphrasing, but that was about 40 seconds. We only have a minute. Do you propose that our personal story is 40 seconds of the.

171
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, so so I

172
00:15:51.260 --> 00:16:00.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I want to be clear. The format has changed of how we do things at techstars. I'm just trying to make the point that 15 years ago

173
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:07.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Desiree got out on stage and told a story that was about 40. She had 10 min for her total pitch.

174
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:18.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it literally gave people goosebumps, and you could hear a PIN drop in that audience, and everybody will remember it because of how it made them feel. Oh, my God! She is here because of give forward

175
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:30.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right now. You don't have that much time. You don't have the luxury of that much time, and I'll work with you, and the team will work with you on. How do you craft what you want to say? And how do you craft

176
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How do you craft what you're going to put in your video? And how do you craft? What questions you want to have asked in the

177
00:16:36.904 --> 00:16:38.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in the interview section.

178
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:47.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But my point wasn't to use 40 seconds for your story. My point was hopefully, that gave some of you the chills. And you were like, wow.

179
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): this comp, like I, I got the feels from that.

180
00:16:52.500 --> 00:17:03.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And whether it's your story or a story about someone using your product, or whatever. If you can evoke emotion in your audience, they will never forget you.

181
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And here's the reality. There are going to be 12 of you up there.

182
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and you know if people in the audience you want to stand out.

183
00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so

184
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:20.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): if if you're just yet another, you know, slide deck and video and boring

185
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him): interview, they're not going to remember you.

186
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:33.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but if they're like, but like with give forward, they're like, Oh, my God! I want to talk to that woman with the kidney transplant like. That's what people were like the woman who saved the life

187
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like, I want to talk to her.

188
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:41.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so you wanna if you can use stories and use emotion. Does that make sense?

189
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And I apologize? I don't see your faces right now, because I'm on

190
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.073
Troy Henikoff (he/him): full screen.

191
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.479
Lilliana Robinson: They're nodding. Try. Everyone's following along, and there's nothing in the chat.

192
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right, great, all right. So

193
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:02.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): signal to noise. Do we have any engineers in the crowd who can tell me what signal to noise means

194
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him): nobody. What do you think it means?

195
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.189
Lilliana Robinson: We have lots of engineers.

196
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:15.379
Çoruh | CogniScope: Okay, signal is actually the information transfer

197
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:19.789
Çoruh | CogniScope: noise is the inevitable

198
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:27.990
Çoruh | CogniScope: the inevitable transformation of non-intended information.

199
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.060
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yep.

200
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Very good description.

201
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, for those of you who are old enough to remember when cars had radios that had a dial where you had to turn it.

202
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What would happen is when you were zeroing in on an FM. Radio station would be all.

203
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:52.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and when you got it just perfect. The music was louder than the static, and if you were right on, you got a lot of music and very little static. But if you're off a little bit. You got a bunch of static. That's the signal to noise. Ratio

204
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): pitches. It is so important

205
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you should have 0 words

206
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that are not signals. So when we were doing 10 min pitches.

207
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): there were some people who felt like, Well, I gotta fill up the whole 10 min. No.

208
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:25.589
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And again, this is generics, and I want to be clear that both my story and introduction and talking about emotion, this is for you generically. This isn't just for this demo day. But when you're thinking because you are going to be in pitch competitions, you are going to be pitching to Vcs. And there is stuff

209
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:35.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that's going to apply like, Oh, I want to be able to evoke some emotion. I do. I have a personal story that I can tell in 30 seconds. That'll do. That right signal to noise applies to all of these as well.

210
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:52.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You should not have Filler. This is not like an 8th grade book. Report where they say it has to be 3 pages. And so you're gonna make up stuff and and fill in with garbage just to make it be 3 pages. If you have 10 min to give a pitch, and you only have 7 min of content, give them 7 min.

211
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and have no filler. Have incredible direct signal. No noise.

212
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:06.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you have 10 min of stuff. Fine in your case, you're gonna have 1 min for your video. You're gonna have 1 min for your individual pitch. There should not be an extra word.

213
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): There should not be an

214
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in your 1 min pitch, because that's noise.

215
00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Signal to noise very important.

216
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then let's get the story right.

217
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:26.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so I have a process that I use when developing pitches with slides. And I know that you're not doing that

218
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:32.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): slide. You don't have multiple slides for your pitch right now, but you could do the same thing with

219
00:20:33.296 --> 00:20:34.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): your text.

220
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:57.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So what I do when Slide and I'll go through the slide version and we'll just do text version next. So what I do. And I did this with my teams for 7 years at techstars is the very 1st version of their deck, because they did the old style where they just had 10 min. It was a deck and a presentation. That's it. There was no special video section, no interview. I like this, the format that

221
00:20:57.646 --> 00:21:04.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that the team does now better. I think it's much more interesting. But anyway, we would start out, and the 1st version is black text.

222
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him): white background.

223
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him): one slide for every slide. You think you're going to have

224
00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:15.066
Troy Henikoff (he/him): put the black text on it. White background. Spend no time. This is this is

225
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Gonna get thrown out. It's gonna get changed. You don't want to have any investment in it.

226
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:20.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right?

227
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Each slide should have an objective.

228
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you don't have an objective for a slide, you shouldn't have the slide

229
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): translating for you for this 1 min.

230
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you don't have an objective or something you want to see.

231
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you want to say you shouldn't say it

232
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:46.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): at this level in your low fidelity prototype. No pictures, no graphs. You do not invest any time in beauty.

233
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.249
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What we have to do is create a story.

234
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so the 1st few iterations were just about the story.

235
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:57.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now, since you're not using slides, you do the same thing with an outline.

236
00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:13.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and your outline could be. Here are the 3 big points I want to make under each point. Here are the sub points I want to make. You should be dealing with it at that level. Don't be writing text and dealing with word choices and all that. Let's focus on the points you want to make.

237
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because if you have the points right

238
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and you have the sub points right, the text will flow.

239
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So when I'm doing

240
00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him): actual decks.

241
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I literally start out. You can see here on the bottom. It says, objective.

242
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): huge, potential market.

243
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:37.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The objective of this slide is to show the audience that there is a big market here.

244
00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now I'm gonna have the words total addressable market on the top.

245
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:55.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and maybe I'll some sort of bar graph of how the market has changed over the 10. You look at my dates. You can tell how long I've been doing this. Anyway. 20. When I started doing this, 2020 was way in the future. It's funny I should update that

246
00:22:55.817 --> 00:23:02.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I have one of these for every single slide. And I do this today. By the way. You know.

247
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:21.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Math, we have 43 active companies. Still, a bunch of them are fundraising when they're fundraising creating Vc. Decks if they want my help. I say, all right. The 1st thing you got to do is put an objective on each slide. What is the purpose of this slide? If you don't have a purpose for the slide, you should not have the slide, and if you have 3 purposes for the slide, it should be 3 different slides.

248
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and if you're presenting at

249
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:38.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him): other events, things like pitch competitions having an objective for each slide makes it so much easier for you to present, because if you know what the objective is. You don't have to worry about memorizing the words.

250
00:23:38.632 --> 00:23:41.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The objective of this slide is huge potential market.

251
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.899
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So when the slide comes up. You're like, and look at the size of our potential market.

252
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You don't have to say it the right way. It doesn't matter. You need to get the point across.

253
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.250
Annie Brown: So what

254
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.603
Annie Brown: doing that for both the

255
00:23:55.190 --> 00:24:02.309
Annie Brown: decks that you're going to be presenting, and for decks that are for like sending that don't have any talking with them.

256
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:09.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So I feel really strongly that I do not send a deck unless I have presented it first.st

257
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:10.530
Annie Brown: Oh, okay.

258
00:24:10.852 --> 00:24:20.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And I'm even happy to share with you guys, I have a little video about that. But just like in the financial modeling you saw me say, hold the

259
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:33.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): model hostage to get the next meeting. I hold the deck hostage to get the 1st meeting. So what I have, and I feel really strongly about this, and most people agree, not everybody. But I have a 1 page

260
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): executive, summary.

261
00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:52.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him): or overview, that I send out all the time you interested in my company. Here it is, and it should have all the pieces it should have like a little graph going up into the right, it should have problem solution, maybe faces of the people who are there and some Logos about the great work they've done. It's a teaser.

262
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.920
Annie Brown: Yeah.

263
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then, if you want the meeting.

264
00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:03.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we'll go over a deck in the meeting, and I push back hard. If an investor says, hey? Send me the deck, and then I'll decide.

265
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:18.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'll say, you know my deck really isn't meant to be sent it it doesn't. It's just meant to be a background for a discussion. So why don't we meet in person? And I'll review the deck, and then you can have a copy of it afterwards. But it won't make any sense if I just send it. It's just background for discussion.

266
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:25.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and some investors will say, No, no, no, send the deck. I won't meet with you without sending the deck, and if they do, I say well.

267
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:31.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it it's not gonna make any sense. I you know, if you're not willing to meet then. We may as well go our own ways.

268
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And I even did this when we were raising money for math.

269
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I remember when we're raising money for the 1st round of math. My partner, Mark and I talked about this.

270
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:43.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then I don't know a couple of weeks into it. Mark's like, Well, where's the latest version of the deck?

271
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:55.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And I said, Well, it's on Dropbox. But why, I don't think, do you have a meeting today. It's like, Oh, no, but I got an investor who asked for it so well, did you meet with them? It's like, no, but they asked for the Dac.

272
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Like Mark, we don't send the deck.

273
00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:03.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's like, but but an investor asked for it like, Yeah, get a meeting, hold it, hostage. Get the meeting.

274
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Are you sure I don't want to say no to investor? I'm like, yes, I'm sure

275
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 90% of the time it works.

276
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:20.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You will get the meeting. You'll go through it. It works beautifully 10% of the time, they may say, No, if you're not going to send a deck I won't meet. And you know what? They probably weren't serious. Because here's the rub.

277
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:27.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They should be investing in you as humans. This is early stage. It is 90% team.

278
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:34.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's 10% market size and go to market. And all that stuff that stuff's gonna change. It's really about the humans.

279
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:40.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so if they're going to look at a deck and what you say about market size and decide to invest or not. They don't care about the humans.

280
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's not who you want as an investor in a early stage.

281
00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:50.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If this were a private equity company, you had 10 million dollars of revenue, 50 million dollars worth of revenue. The deck is really important.

282
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It goes out first.st

283
00:26:52.690 --> 00:27:02.170
Annie Brown: Yeah, I I love that approach, I think, sending the one pager and then just saying, Happy to go through the deck with you on on a call like in an email, and making that really clear.

284
00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:19.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Absolutely. If you can get in person to show the deck that's best. Second best would be a zoom call. I know we we've gotten used to zoom and zoom. I mean, we're doing it right now. If I could do this in person it would be easier, but that would have required me getting on a plane to San Francisco, and it's much easier for me to

285
00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): sit in my home office. So, anyway, yep.

286
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.850
Annie Brown: Thank you.

287
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Awesome, all right.

288
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:33.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to show you a demo day presentation from the old techstars format. So this is not an example of what you are building

289
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him): my goal in showing you. This is for you to see

290
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:42.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him): what a great presentation can look like if you follow this process.

291
00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:54.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's a guy named Mark. He's the CEO. He's a nerdy engineer, and when I say nerdy, I mean nerdy right. He was totally uncomfortable with speaking in public.

292
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He was very nervous.

293
00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:18.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I want you to watch this, and I want you to be critical of his presentation, and I want you to think about. Was there a story? Would I invest? Did I like the way he presented? I'm obviously biased. I think he did a great job. He's still running his company today. I just heard from him last week, and I have a meeting that catch up with him next week. So we're gonna watch this. If

294
00:28:20.053 --> 00:28:30.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him): if Chloe, if you could just verbally tell me that you hear the audio properly once I started. That would be great. I cannot see you guys because I'm on full screen. Okay.

295
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:31.870
Chloe Lannert: Sounds good.

296
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.220
Chloe Lannert: Have you ever seen a ups truck make.

297
00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Left-hand turn.

298
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:47.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You might have heard that Ups is so obsessed with efficiency that their trucks are forbidden from making left-hand turns.

299
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:53.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Well, let me tell you that's bullshit.

300
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him): My name is Mark, founder of Routific.

301
00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:13.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm not gonna oh, shoot! I didn't mean to do that. I thought I could pause it. I'll have to go back. I'm sorry I meant to, for I meant to tell you this beforehand. He used a different technique for a big opening. We'll talk about what some of them are. He swore on stage. He gave people something they didn't expect.

302
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:17.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and the audience was like they laughed, and they're like, Oh, crap! I better pay attention

303
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:24.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? So I apologize. We'll just do this again, and then I I will not interrupt at this time.

304
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Have you ever seen a ups truck make a left-hand turn?

305
00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:40.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You might have heard that Ups is so obsessed with efficiency that their trucks are forbidden from making left-hand turns.

306
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Well, let me tell you that's Bullshit.

307
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:59.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): My name is Mark, founder of Routific, and I'm not here to bullshit you. I'm here to tell you a true story of Alex, the CEO of local libations, one of the 42 customers currently paying for routific.

308
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:17.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They deliver 100,000 bottles of beer across the city of Austin every week. Alex's job is to make sure all his deliveries are on time, and to do this he used to spend 2 h every morning, manually planning his routes with excel spreadsheets.

309
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Then he and his team zigzagged across town, racing to get everything done

310
00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): while he covered every stop.

311
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alex knew there had to be a more efficient route for his trucks.

312
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but he couldn't figure it out.

313
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:40.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him): His logistics had become such a bottleneck that Alex was forced to turn down business.

314
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So how did he solve this?

315
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Did he buy more trucks?

316
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:59.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Nope. Did he avoid left-hand turns? No, Alex was smarter than that he googled Route optimization and found us. Let me show you how Rotific changed Alex's world

317
00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:05.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): this morning. Alex took his list of 57 stops and dropped it into ratific.

318
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:18.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, and, by the way, with 57 stops, you already have 40 quattrovigitillion possible permutations, each of which represents a delivery schedule for Alex.

319
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The routing problem is considered one of the hardest problems in computer science.

320
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:32.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Our proprietary algorithm can churn through these permutations and generate an optimized schedule in seconds.

321
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:42.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Next Alex dispatched those routes directly to his driver's smartphones. We made Route optimization, that simple.

322
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:49.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We helped Alex reclaim 2 h of his workday, which he now spends growing his business.

323
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What's more, we cut his driving time and fuel consumption in half.

324
00:31:54.670 --> 00:32:00.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): This allowed Alex to serve more customers without buying more trucks or hiring more staff.

325
00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:08.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him): In fact, Alex tells us that he has now doubled the number of deliveries he makes every single day.

326
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Isn't that amazing?

327
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:21.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I get really excited about this. You see, my story started 7 years ago when I wrote my thesis on Advanced Route optimization algorithms.

328
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:28.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But instead of publishing papers, I want to apply it to the real world and make real businesses run more efficiently.

329
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I assembled a team

330
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:42.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a team that is not only strong on product and design with Andre, Stefano and Jonathan. We also have 16 years of sales and marketing experience between Andrew Suzanne and me.

331
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:53.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): When I was a consultant I built routing systems for large corporations, and along the way I learned something interesting about the industry.

332
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let me share it with you.

333
00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:05.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him): even though ups Fedex and the Us. Postal service have invested billions of dollars to build route optimization in-house.

334
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They only account for 6.5% of the delivery market.

335
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:27.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Then you have large corporations that can afford to pay consultants to implement enterprise routing software. But even if you take all 300 of the largest fleets in America, they still only account for 18.5% of the market.

336
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So what about the rest?

337
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:47.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): These are the 350,000 fleets with 4.5 million trucks on the road, and almost all of them are still routed manually. They desperately need route. Optimization and routeific is built to meet exactly this need.

338
00:33:50.090 --> 00:34:01.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now. In the past there have been a handful of companies who tried to go after this market, but as soon as they gained any sort of traction. They were immediately acquired by larger enterprises.

339
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Their product and team were absorbed

340
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and their focus shifted. Upmarket, leaving behind a big hole.

341
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Rotific is the only solution dedicated for the masses.

342
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): These are some of our customers who already cannot live without us.

343
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:28.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We have a simple revenue model. We charge $39 per vehicle per month. That's nearly $500 a year.

344
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:35.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Our average customer has 8 vehicles. They pay us almost $4,000 each year.

345
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:40.589
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We've learned that it cost us $952 to acquire a customer.

346
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:44.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The acquisition cost is paid back within 4 months.

347
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now, the only thing we need to do is step on the gas and get the word out.

348
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Here's how we go to market.

349
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:58.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We have 3 different approaches for 3 different segments of the market

350
00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:09.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): for small fleets. We rely on SEO and ads for fleets between 10 and 50 vehicles, the meat of the market. This is where we focus our direct sales and marketing efforts

351
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): for larger fleets. We rely on channel partner integrations.

352
00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Channel partners are awesome.

353
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They give us access to large fleets, and they do the selling for us.

354
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Vonnego is a great example.

355
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:34.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They've integrated our Api into the Vonigal platform, and that's how we got national accounts like goodwill and habitat for humanity, using rotific every day

356
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:43.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in the last couple of months we've gained a lot of momentum with Channel partners, and we're very excited to be partnering up with these brands.

357
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:52.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And with these 3 approaches we've grown on average, more than 25% every month since the beginning of this year.

358
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): This

359
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is just the start of our journey.

360
00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We're on a mission

361
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:08.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to make route optimization accessible to every local delivery business.

362
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:15.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are empowering people like Alex to operate just as efficiently as ups.

363
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:20.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What we won't do is forbid them from making left-hand turns.

364
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:27.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): My name is Mark. We are artific. Come, talk to us if you'd like to geek out on logistics.

365
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:37.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright, I want to get out of screen share mode so that I can see all your faces alright, there you guys are. So what do you think?

366
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What did you like about the presentation.

367
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:47.960
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): There is a.

368
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.240
Dave Scott: Customer, Centric.

369
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.769
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Sorry go ahead.

370
00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:51.730
Dave Scott: Emotional.

371
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

372
00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I, like.

373
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.150
Dave Scott: We touched on like.

374
00:36:56.150 --> 00:37:03.650
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Every aspect like market size and Channel partners like it overturned a lot of rocks. You weren't left with a lot of questions.

375
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:15.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You were left with some, you he covered a bunch of bases, so what he did was he took a lot of the objections he was getting in mentor meetings and stuff and tried to put them in there for reasons people didn't want to talk to him

376
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:22.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right. He made it pretty easy to understand it, like you all understand his business right. Pretty simple.

377
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:32.270
Morgan Stanton: He described his problem very clearly, and, like the image he showed of like walking. The storytelling storytelling of walking through the problem was very easy to follow and understand.

378
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:39.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, and notice it was while it was a deck. It was. I think he used keynote, not Powerpoint. But whatever it was a deck.

379
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:42.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It didn't look like a traditional deck, did. It

380
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): wasn't like bullet points.

381
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:49.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? He used the graphic elements. Now, you guys don't have the. But I think you get one slide.

382
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.139
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think. Why is that right?

383
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.700
Annie Brown: Oh, yeah.

384
00:37:52.700 --> 00:38:00.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You get a separate video for the demo, and then you get one slide. But some other things I want to point out about what he did.

385
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So for one, there were no extra words

386
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:04.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right?

387
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He knew that thing. Cold.

388
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:21.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He he could. Probably he did that in 2,015. I am guessing that if I I'm gonna literally I have a zoom call. He's up in Vancouver. I have a zoom call with him next week. I'll bet he could. If I throw up the slides he could. He could re.

389
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He could probably come up with 98% of the words like he committed that thing to memory.

390
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:46.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): In it, you know, and it'll be there forever. It's sort of like when you're a kid, and you learn the Abcs like you. Don't forget it. None of you have sung the Abcs. Most like, unless you have kids sung the Abcs in decades. But you could do it. Not only could you do it, you could do it while throwing a ball while playing Frisbee while doing like you don't have to stop and think about it, and that allows you

391
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:54.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to do it with emotion. Right? Kids who are learning the Abcs when they're halfway there. They're like A, BCDE, F,

392
00:38:54.680 --> 00:39:03.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him): GAEF. And they keep rewinding and starting again to try to find their place. You don't want to be that person on demo day.

393
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:16.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So if you're gonna commit this thing to memory word for word, you better know that word for word where you can do it standing on your head. You can do it when people are throwing crap at you. Chloe will help you with that and like, you have to really know it.

394
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him): or

395
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:21.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you could just know the bullet points, and what you want to talk to

396
00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:35.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the best ones are when you really know it, because then you can give it emotion right? And there's this trajectory you go through. Learning is really awkward. Then you get the words right. Once you have the words right, then you can actually start thinking about how I'm presenting the words.

397
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He presented the words really well.

398
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:42.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): at 1 point he talked really quietly said, let me tell you what I learned

399
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:48.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): other times. He got really excited. Let me tell you about the great companies that use ratific every day.

400
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:52.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? That variation in volume.

401
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The variation in pace

402
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him): makes it interesting to listen to a speaker.

403
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Imagine if I sent you an email and it was in all caps all the time.

404
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:11.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's what it feels like when someone is talking loud and fast the whole time in their presentation. You only have a minute.

405
00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but if your whole minute is loud and fast. It's like all caps.

406
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:26.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now, if I have an email where I'm sending you, and I want to make a point, I may have one word in caps. I may have 2 words in all caps, and they really stand out as important. You now know what I care about

407
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:29.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? And he did that too.

408
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He used his voice to let you know what was important

409
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and what was it?

410
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He also did a great trick which I love.

411
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:44.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): He opened he had his get attention opening right? That's bullshit.

412
00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:52.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Most of the get attention. Openings are about giant Market, or huge opportunity, or what? Big problem.

413
00:40:52.440 --> 00:41:00.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him): something that will get their attention. But at the end, his very last line he tied back to the opening. So you remembered that opening.

414
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): he said. What we're gonna do is we're gonna make people

415
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): more efficient. What we're not going to do

416
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:10.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is forbid them from making left-hand turns.

417
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And it brought you back to the opening. It kind of wrapped it up in a bow.

418
00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.869
Annie Brown: I like that. That opening was also

419
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:29.019
Annie Brown: teaching people something. So it's like some fact that they didn't know, like, you know, did you know that Ups forbids their team from making left hand turns.

420
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:33.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, yeah. So one of the best attention getting things

421
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is, if you have something people think they know.

422
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and you show them that they are wrong.

423
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because if if you tell them things they already know.

424
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:54.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him): America has 335 million people. Yeah. You know, our political system is divided. 50, 50. Yeah, whatever it is, they're like nodding. And then they're going to sleep. And they're going to their phone.

425
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:55.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But

426
00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:01.829
Troy Henikoff (he/him): if you tell them something. You they didn't know they're like Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait! I better pay attention. I didn't know that thing

427
00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:07.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because you're trying to get their attention right. And so I really do like an opening

428
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:12.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that gets their attention, and it can be by telling them something they don't know.

429
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): or they don't expect.

430
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:28.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It can be by showing them that this is an unserved market that's huge. And you know how big your company is going to be that they're really excited about because they're investors. It can be surprising them in some other way. But that's yeah, exactly.

431
00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So. Who wants to invest in rotific?

432
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:58.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, so they've done well. They're in, you know. They have many millions of dollars of revenue today, not tens of millions. I don't think yet, but many millions. They've been cash flow positive. They raised a tiny amount of money early on 500,000 or something. I don't, and maybe they raised a tiny bit more, but they haven't raised much money, which is good, because that means they've created value without getting diluted.

433
00:42:59.263 --> 00:42:59.916
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And

434
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:06.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): anyway, they're doing well. But okay, any other questions about routific.

435
00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:13.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him): even though you're not doing a presentation in that style. Was it helpful to see that to give you ideas?

436
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, hopefully, it was.

437
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Dave doesn't think so. But that's okay.

438
00:43:20.748 --> 00:43:23.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright. So what we're gonna do next

439
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:24.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is each of you

440
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is gonna pitch me your elevator pitch.

441
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:32.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then I'm going to give you feedback one on one on it. And the reason we do this as a group

442
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:45.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): is that you're gonna very quickly see some patterns to how I do this. And hopefully, by the time we get halfway or 2 thirds of the way through, you guys are gonna be able to pitch, give each other feedback, and do the pitch as well as I could do it.

443
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:52.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I know it's awkward to go first, st but the people who go first, st tend to get a lot more attention and a lot more time.

444
00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:55.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Who wants to go? Actually, lilliana.

445
00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:03.800
Lilliana Robinson: I'll let people volunteer to go first.st There's also no expectations when you go first.st I was, gonna say, some of the best pitch coaches end up being your fellow classmate.

446
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:09.839
Lilliana Robinson: and those are the kinds of people that we invite back as alumni to help. So like when the alumni help you. Those are the people that help their class.

447
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:14.979
Lilliana Robinson: Alright. Dominique got it. And then, Troy, you can go next. Remember, everyone's gonna go.

448
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.539
Lilliana Robinson: And this is also

449
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:35.929
Lilliana Robinson: just your 1st draft. So we're recording. So you'll be able to look back on the feedback you get right now. But it's also just we're breaking like we're basically ripping off the Bandaid after today, you guys are gonna actually start iterating on your pitch on your own. And then Troy will be back in 2 weeks to see where where it's gotten to between now and then.

450
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.510
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, Dominique.

451
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.899
Lilliana Robinson: go ahead.

452
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:43.700
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Perfect. Thank you. And just to clarify 30 seconds or 60 seconds.

453
00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:51.450
Lilliana Robinson: 60 seconds. But for a lot of you you might not have 60 seconds yet to do as much as you have. I'm gonna stop you guys, when it's 60 seconds.

454
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.839
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Okay, got it, Okey Dokey.

455
00:44:56.450 --> 00:45:11.819
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: We're currently in the greatest wealth transfer of all time. Millennials are set to inherit 90 trillion dollars in the Us. Alone, with 8 out of 10 millennials seeking professional financial advice online. This presents a massive opportunity for wealth managers.

456
00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:24.980
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: but 50% of financial firms are archaic. They lack the time, tools and resources to reach this audience online. I know this because I was previously the global head of marketing at the world's largest wealth manager Ubs.

457
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:46.130
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: At Agent Luna. We're solving this. Our AI powered Saas platform enables wealth managers to intelligently engage millennial investors through automated compliant data, driven content, combining over 25 years of firsthand experience in marketing investments in Silicon Valley Tech. We help wealth. Managers become digital rock stars.

458
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:54.729
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I'm Dominique CEO and co-founder of Agent Luna intros to wealth managers ready to future proof. Their organizations are always welcome. Thank you.

459
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:56.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So that was.

460
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.290
Lilliana Robinson: Second.

461
00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:03.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That was very good. You've obviously worked on this before that wasn't off the cuff. That was very, very good.

462
00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I have a couple of questions, though.

463
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:11.669
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So it sounds like you're selling to wealth managers.

464
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that's your customer.

465
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What is the job to be done? Why do wealth managers want to hire you.

466
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:48.819
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: That's a great question. So, to give you some background, it it actually was the 1st time doing that pitch refreshing to a pivot. So I appreciate that feedback in terms of the job to be done. We're specifically. And the I think I'm already gonna get your feedback here. We're specifically selling to marketing managers within the organization. And the job to be done is is that they need a solution that enables them to quickly and efficiently get online,

467
00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.549
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: so that they can reach the modern day investor.

468
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So here's what I'm confused about.

469
00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:00.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm confused about the difference between my actual solution.

470
00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him): how I manage people's money and what I do and what results I get.

471
00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and the marketing of that solution.

472
00:47:09.688 --> 00:47:15.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And what I thought I heard was that you are a better marketing solution

473
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): for these wealth managers.

474
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:30.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But I heard you talking about this AI powered wealth manager thing. And so then I was confused about, are you a marketing solution, or are you a wealth management software platform.

475
00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:32.540
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Got it.

476
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:33.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Which are you?

477
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.699
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: That's what I thought.

478
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay. So if you're the 1st one.

479
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:42.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): then you should not be talking so much about

480
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:49.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the wealth management solution. So let me try to spit back at you something, and let's see if this is I'm gonna

481
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:53.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm not going to be accurate. But let me see if I could do something that's more in that direction.

482
00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I like the opening.

483
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:18.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world is happening now. 90 trillion dollars, or whatever it is the millennials are going to inherit, and this is an opportunity. There are wealth managers who know how to manage wealth, who have great software packages. Who can man do turn that 90 trillion into 180 trillion dollars?

484
00:48:19.293 --> 00:48:20.059
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: But they.

485
00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Got a problem.

486
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:24.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They don't know how to reach the millennials.

487
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We? What's the name of your company?

488
00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:30.309
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Agent, Luna.

489
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him): At Agent Lunar have the experience and the knowledge.

490
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:37.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We know where those millennials live and act and what they want.

491
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:47.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and specifically with our social media skills. AI driven content manager, whatever. Blah blah blah, we are going to help them get to the people

492
00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:51.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that they need to reach so that they can manage that 90 trillion dollars.

493
00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:54.300
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: yeah, right.

494
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That was rough.

495
00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:05.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but the idea because you have a lot of concepts in there. But I really think if you talk about and again. Think about this. If I were doing it in person I'd be on the whiteboard

496
00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him): giant problem.

497
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:07.990
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Did it?

498
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:09.139
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Good job of that

499
00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:16.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): wealth managers ready to solve this problem. But they can't reach their audience.

500
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:19.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What we do. We're the experts.

501
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:20.290
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: And then.

502
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:29.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Then you can throw in. And I know this because I ran the marketing whatever at ubs blah blah blah! Come, talk to us as we as we connect.

503
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:43.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And maybe you talk about the size of the wealth management market. We connect the, you know, whatever 1.2 million wealth managers who are currently managing, you know, have aum of trillions of dollars with

504
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): millennials. Who are, gonna you know.

505
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.130
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Inherit it.

506
00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:48.100
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: but.

507
00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:51.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But make it clear which side you're on.

508
00:49:51.760 --> 00:50:09.819
Lilliana Robinson: See how Troy's example focused or like centered around the customers problem a lot more. So like it was one of the 1st things he said, and he made it clear that that those are the customers. And this is their problem. And then this is your solution, and that way it's not muddled, and people can tell where you play a role in that process.

509
00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.260
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, yeah.

510
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:15.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, one of the tricks here is always being very clear upfront.

511
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:34.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What is the problem? And who is the buyer who gets value out out of this, and I would be specific like, you were specific. When I asked you the question. You weren't specific in your 1st pitch. When I asked you the question. I think you said something like the marketing managers of wealth like that title is really good.

512
00:50:34.572 --> 00:50:42.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So if you told my story again, and I don't think I said this, but you could say, you know, 90 trillion dollars. And we got people with great software and solutions.

513
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And they've got a problem.

514
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:49.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Each one of them has a marketing manager who doesn't know how to reach their audience.

515
00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:50.450
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah.

516
00:50:50.450 --> 00:51:00.179
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We're the solution for that marketing manager. We know social media blah blah is how we do it. Blah blah, we solve their problem so they can get to the 90 trillion.

517
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.790
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Nice.

518
00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right.

519
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:32.985
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, I know if I don't know if you have time to comments. I know we've got a lot of people to get through. If we can. Briefly, I'm looking at lilliana. This is super helpful, because that's the biggest which you which you rightly saw. That's the biggest challenge we've had of how do we connect and the solutions getting a little bit muddle, even though we're still figuring out that solution right as the no. So this is really helpful. We'll put it immediately into practice. And yeah, really appreciate it. Thank you so much.

520
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:39.699
Lilliana Robinson: We're going 1st guys. If it's okay, I'm gonna squeeze Dave in really quick, because he needs to drop.

521
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You're in charge. Whatever you want.

522
00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.370
Lilliana Robinson: Alright, Dave! Go ahead!

523
00:51:44.840 --> 00:52:05.480
Dave Scott: Yeah, I apologize, guys, I've got a I got a pitch call in a few minutes, so let me go. My name is Dave. Hey, Troy? My name is Dave Scott. So when I was 9 years old I went away to sleep away camp and learned this game called dungeons and dragons. So for those of you who don't know what dungeons and dragons is. It's not only a game.

524
00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:26.880
Dave Scott: but it's also a hobby. It's a lifestyle, and it's actually the way that I formed a lot of my friendships when I was a child. And, in fact, I'm not alone. There's about 150 million people across a 30 billion dollar industry that's growing at 11.8 2% that all share the same common experience with tabletop role, playing games like dungeons and dragons.

525
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:39.250
Dave Scott: 3 decades later. I still meet with and play with the same people that I became friends with when I was in high school and college. We meet every single week to play this game and to stay in touch.

526
00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:51.810
Dave Scott: But then Covid happened, and all of a sudden my friends moved away. They found new jobs. We we had to social distance, and there was no way for us to meet in person like we had in the past. I started feeling lonely.

527
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:57.270
Dave Scott: And so we did what a lot of other groups did which we tried to replicate this online

528
00:52:57.974 --> 00:53:19.689
Dave Scott: and believe it or not, it takes no less than 5 technologies in order to get a game up and running that even remotely resembles the game that we played physically. I remember at 1 point in time, my game master literally trying to glue his iphone on top of the chandelier so he could project the map below. It was a mess.

529
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:37.479
Dave Scott: But that's where evil genius games comes in. We create a 1 stop shop which allows you to bring your friends together to play these tabletop role playing games online with one single solution. And so far our customers have really loved our product. We have over 35,000 paying customers

530
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:42.460
Dave Scott: that have given us over 1,005 star reviews across review sites like Amazon.

531
00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:46.089
Dave Scott: And so far we've made 1.7 million dollars of revenue

532
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:47.420
Dave Scott: and.

533
00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:51.040
Lilliana Robinson: I'm gonna pause. You, Dave, cause that was 2. We've hit 2 min now.

534
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.880
Dave Scott: Already. Okay. So that was, yeah.

535
00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.009
Lilliana Robinson: Double the time.

536
00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:59.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright. So a few things one is. I should have said this before. I didn't.

537
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I am particularly sensitive.

538
00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:08.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't like introducing myself upfront, because, remember, I've got 15 seconds to get people's attention.

539
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:11.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They don't give a shit what my name is

540
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:38.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him): until they know what value I'm delivering. So my style. People disagree with me on this. By the way, smart people say no, no, you have to give the name so they can relate to you. I don't. My style is to do problem solution and then say, my name is Troy, and I'm the CEO, because now they care if they care about the problem solution. You spent way too much time going into your history. And it was boring, and we didn't really care like there was no catch in the beginning. Was there a catch in the beginning?

541
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All of you guys come on.

542
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.020
Lilliana Robinson: Did you start with a hook, Dave?

543
00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:44.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): No hook.

544
00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:48.339
Lilliana Robinson: It can be engaging, I think, because you threw it out. It wasn't.

545
00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:53.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So I know, I know you have to go, probably in 2, 2 and a half minutes. So I'm gonna go quickly. So

546
00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:56.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I would literally start out with saying.

547
00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:02.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him): role playing games, board games with pieces and old style.

548
00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:07.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): yeah, today, there's still a hundred 50 million people in the Us who play that stuff.

549
00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:15.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But the world has changed. The expectations of consumers have changed. They expect to be able to play it online.

550
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:28.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him): give a plug for jackbox games here, Chloe. But you didn't talk about that. But the expectation is to play online, just like we have meetings online. We don't have to be in person. Well, guess what

551
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:34.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you don't have to be in person to play dungeons and dragons, or any of the role playing games anymore.

552
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:41.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because evil genius games has taken those physical interactions and moved them online.

553
00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And

554
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): they're better than they were in person.

555
00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:55.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How can they be better? We do. And I don't know what the things you do. But I I'm guessing that you have things that you can do in an online world that you couldn't do in a physical world.

556
00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:02.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? Whether it's chat between 2 people without other people seeing I don't know what it is. I don't. I'm not a role play game, Guy.

557
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:13.040
Lilliana Robinson: That was. And, Dave, you should watch back what Troy just said. I know you have to drop. I was just gonna add your personal story can still be in the QAI don't know if Troy you agree, but like a question.

558
00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:13.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

559
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:15.230
Lilliana Robinson: Like, why did you start this company.

560
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:16.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Totally

561
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:20.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): totally. And so one of the things before you go, Dave, is that

562
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:22.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you want to decide.

563
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:25.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What are you putting in your pitch.

564
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What are you putting in the

565
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him): demo?

566
00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:45.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And what are you exposing in the Q. And a. Because you get to work with your mentor about? What's in the Q&A. And so you literally have, like a little map of here are the 10 things I want to communicate. These 2 are going to be in the pitch. These 3 will be in the live. These will be in the Q. And a. And you know that you've covered it all.

567
00:56:46.000 --> 00:57:00.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so I think it's it'll be much more natural to have your backstory in the QA. Like. It's really easy to be like Dave. How'd you do this. I basically role playing. I'm still in touch with a bunch of the people. I like lifelong relationships. It is incredible. We bonded over these

568
00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:09.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him): games about, you know, climbing through caves, and whatever you did so I never played dungeons and dragons. I'm sorry, but I know a lot.

569
00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:12.602
Dave Scott: There's a lot of cave climbing. So that's accurate.

570
00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:13.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

571
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright.

572
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:14.750
Lilliana Robinson: Well, let's.

573
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:15.990
Dave Scott: That's really helpful. All right.

574
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:18.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I hope that that was a little rushed, but I hope it's helpful.

575
00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:21.050
Dave Scott: Dang sorry about this, thank you. No good

576
00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.780
Dave Scott: you did. That was great.

577
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.910
Lilliana Robinson: We'll make sure he wants back the recording. That was really good feedback.

578
00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.359
Lilliana Robinson: Alright, Choro, go ahead.

579
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.040
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah.

580
00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:36.240
Çoruh | CogniScope: Sony's most successful community driven game. How diversity lost 65% of their community in just one.

581
00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, I'm gonna stop you for a second. I'm gonna ask that. You talk a little more slowly

582
00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:44.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and work on articulation. This is my fault.

583
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:52.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We're on zoom, it's hard. But I with your accent, it's hard to understand what words you're saying. If I don't know what they are ahead of time.

584
00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:52.750
Çoruh | CogniScope: Okay.

585
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:55.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So let's give you a little more time. I want you to slow down

586
00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:02.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and work on articulating each word so that the audience will know what you're saying. All right, let's start again.

587
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:03.110
Çoruh | CogniScope: Okay.

588
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:11.800
Çoruh | CogniScope: Sony's most most successful live service game Helldivers 2 lost 65% of its community in just one month.

589
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:21.020
Çoruh | CogniScope: What can cause this Sony just pushed a small update to the games login process which led to over 300,000 negative reviews.

590
00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:26.840
Çoruh | CogniScope: It took Sony 4 days to identify why players were leaving, but by then it was just too late.

591
00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:46.399
Çoruh | CogniScope: My co-founders and I were aware of this issue right away. We even tried to reaching out to community managers expressing our concerns about data, privacy, and the fear of losing our games progress. But Sony just mistook this for pure anger, and our words got lost in the sea of comments.

592
00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:50.520
Çoruh | CogniScope: Sony is just one example that proves the power of communities.

593
00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:55.439
Çoruh | CogniScope: We have seen multiple studios shut down over similar issues just this year alone.

594
00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:04.920
Çoruh | CogniScope: And that's exactly why we built cogniscope, a psychology-based AI engine to analyze community channels that you weren't able to be. Previously.

595
00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:26.810
Çoruh | CogniScope: We help studios, and publishers really understand their customers and detect issues before it's too late. Hi, I'm Churu, and we help studios build games that people truly love. We extract the why from the What and generate action items based purely on data without any human bias driving high retention and engagement.

596
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:47.679
Çoruh | CogniScope: Now that around 95% of studios are working on or aiming to release community-driven games. It's absolutely critical to get into minds of their communities. Cogniscope makes make gamers feel heard empowers developers to make smarter, more efficient decisions and helps publishers de-risk their investments.

597
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.740
Lilliana Robinson: 1 min, 45 seconds.

598
00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:55.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him): There's a little odd.

599
00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:04.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, let me. I think I understand what you're doing, and I might be using a little poetic license here, but let me try something.

600
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:13.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I'll my numbers are wrong. Don't worry. Well, I'm sony lost what? 250,000.

601
01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:17.340
Çoruh | CogniScope: 65% of their community.

602
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:19.489
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How big was it? How? What was the numbers?

603
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:21.759
Çoruh | CogniScope: 300,000 people!

604
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:23.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 300,000 people. Yeah.

605
01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:31.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him): give me one second. I gotta think.

606
01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:34.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right. I'm just gonna wing it all right.

607
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:43.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Sony. One of the biggest gaming companies in the world had a bug in their login process.

608
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:48.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They lost over 300,000 paying users in just 4 days.

609
01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:55.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and this isn't the only time these things have happened. There are many things that gaming companies do that the users

610
01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:57.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): find

611
01:00:57.789 --> 01:01:04.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I need the right word here that that the users don't like that cause them to leave there is. There is no friction for leaving.

612
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:14.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Do you remember when Facebook announced that it knew that if 2 people, it knew that 2 people were gonna break up before they even knew

613
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:23.669
Troy Henikoff (he/him): it could look at the inner, it could use AI to look at the interactions and sentiment analysis and understand when people were drifting apart before they even knew it.

614
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We.

615
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a cognoscope, use the same kind of AI engine

616
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:30.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to look at

617
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:39.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the discord, the comments, the whatever to identify for gaming companies how their audience is feeling.

618
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:46.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and we tell the gaming company what the problems are before their audience even knows it.

619
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:49.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We let them be proactive

620
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:51.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and stay ahead of the problems.

621
01:01:51.990 --> 01:02:02.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We let them fix the problems before their audience knows it. We're cogniscope. I'm Troy. We'd love to talk to you if you're interested in learning more about blah blah blah.

622
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:05.560
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah.

623
01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I didn't get the details right.

624
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But what I what I liked is

625
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:16.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to be able to put up this problem. Sony lost 300,000 paying customers in 4 days

626
01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:26.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to talk about. Most people. Remember that that was Earth shattering that 1st article when it came out with Facebook. Knowing you're going to break up with your significant other before you do

627
01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him): put those 2 together.

628
01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then, as someone put in the chat

629
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:35.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that allows us to be the proactive rather than reactive.

630
01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:40.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We're gonna save Sony, their next 300,000 paying users.

631
01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:42.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Well.

632
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:45.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that's powerful right.

633
01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:46.713
Çoruh | CogniScope: It is.

634
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:51.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you can do that, let's deliver it and go make a bunch of money doing it

635
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him): because we think about it. What would Sony pay to not have that screw up again.

636
01:02:58.650 --> 01:02:59.240
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah.

637
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:03.149
Çoruh | CogniScope: I mean, it was over 180 million dollars in just one game.

638
01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:04.900
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah.

639
01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:12.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. Now, one of the challenges you're gonna have, you do have an accent that makes it hard to understand.

640
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I'm sure that the people in your cohort have gotten used to your accent, know how to and can understand you better. Now.

641
01:03:18.197 --> 01:03:27.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I want to share with you a video, a video of a demo day that we had a guy from pictoring. Do you have the pictoring video, lilliana? Or do I need to go find it.

642
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.120
Lilliana Robinson: I don't have it.

643
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:35.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay. So pictorine was. This was a long time ago, and it was a guy from France who was great.

644
01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:36.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Guillaume

645
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:42.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and Guillaume had a very thick French accent, and so we did 2 things with him

646
01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:50.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to make his Demo day presentation better, and you'll all get a kick out of watching. This, I think the 1st thing we did was we had to select, or some

647
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:59.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him): parts of speech he had trouble. Th was very hard for him. So we had to find synonyms to words, so that he didn't have to say a word that had a th in it.

648
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then, second thing we did was we really played up

649
01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:11.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the hold on, here it is. We really played up. This should work. If I make a link copy dropbox link.

650
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright. I'm gonna put it in the chat here. We had him play up his accent.

651
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:38.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it was one of the most fun Demo day pitches ever because he was talking. And he was actually in a sort of similar face space. He was doing stuff with Facebook and pictures. And and he talked about Mark. You know he talked about Mark Zuckerberg. He said Mark would not do it this way, and Mark would, and it was, and literally coming out of Demo Day you heard people imitating Guillaume.

652
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:44.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But remember, that made him memorable. Right? That's 1 of the things you all want to be different.

653
01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:57.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so that people can remember you and Re. Anyway, I think you can play up your accent, have fun with it. Go ahead and watch the pictorine video and see if you can be creative about how you leverage your accent to be an asset

654
01:04:58.030 --> 01:04:59.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him): rather than a liability.

655
01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Cool? All right.

656
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:03.180
Çoruh | CogniScope: I see that. Thank you.

657
01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:03.990
Lilliana Robinson: That's fine!

658
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Who's next?

659
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:08.190
Lilliana Robinson: Fabio is next, and then, and then Morgan.

660
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:19.089
Fabio Caironi: Alright. Cool. Can't wait to get my picture upset. I I love how you reshaped the other one's pictures, so let's get it done?

661
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:31.179
Fabio Caironi: the top priority for nearly every startup running machine learning and data processing activities is shipping your products quickly to beat the competition.

662
01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:42.499
Fabio Caironi: But 80% of them are slowed down by poor cloud infrastructure implementations because they are merely chasing cloud credits or picking the cheapest serverless solution in the market.

663
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:47.730
Fabio Caironi: and when push comes to shove they will need to hire a devops team in a rush.

664
01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:54.140
Fabio Caironi: and by the time they reach a stable solution they will have spent more time, energy, and money in the process.

665
01:05:54.660 --> 01:06:00.940
Fabio Caironi: At bucknight we help startups, deploy computing workloads at height, speed with minimal configuration

666
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:09.200
Fabio Caironi: by offering a serverless, distributed computing platform powered by simple and intuitive sdks and Apis.

667
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:20.460
Fabio Caironi: We bring cold, start times to 0 and enable timeout configuration, so you can experience the agility of serverless and the power of containerization together.

668
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:30.740
Fabio Caironi: Our 5 year goal is to become the number one serverless cloud Provider by building a network of suppliers that allows us to dynamically tap into idle processing power globally.

669
01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:41.910
Fabio Caironi: My name is Fabio, and I'm the Funder of Byte night. We're currently running pilots and planning to fully launch by the end of the year and raise our seat in Q. 1, 2025. Come, talk to me later.

670
01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:44.329
Lilliana Robinson: 1 min, 18 seconds.

671
01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:45.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay.

672
01:06:46.104 --> 01:06:47.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): let me try something.

673
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know if this is gonna work. But I have an idea.

674
01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:51.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

675
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:56.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): something like

676
01:06:57.310 --> 01:07:05.489
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in the last 24 months we have seen a shift in technology that is bigger than any we have ever seen before.

677
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The advent of artificial intelligence.

678
01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, the Internet was big. And

679
01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:22.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the year 1990, you know, 97 to 2,000. This is bigger. It's gonna change the way every application interacts with the humans.

680
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:24.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And

681
01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): there is a race to get there.

682
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:32.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Almost every startup here is doing some sort of AI, and they're all recreating the wheel.

683
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:34.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We don't want that to have to happen.

684
01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:37.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So let me tell you about what we do

685
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:54.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we provide. And now I'm gonna screw up your technology because I didn't understand it all, but we provide a serverless access through Api, so that each company that wants to access Api doesn't have to go through the pain and and anguish of trying to set all of this stuff up

686
01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:01.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him): accessing us, accessing AI through us, using some simple Apis allows them to get from 0

687
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to functional in less than 24 h.

688
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:09.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are the tool that everybody should be using to spin up their AI.

689
01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:25.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We will make it faster, easier, and with our centralized R&D, as new features come up, and blah blah, we'll be able to deliver them to them without their having to recreate the wheel. We are taking it. We are allowing startups to take advantage of the Revolution.

690
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:30.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are selling the picks and axes to the gold miners. Whatever you could do something like that if you wanted to.

691
01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:32.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How does that feel.

692
01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:34.329
Fabio Caironi: That's powerful. Yeah.

693
01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:39.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I would start with talking.

694
01:08:39.179 --> 01:08:40.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I do believe

695
01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:44.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that the AI revolution is going to be bigger

696
01:08:44.959 --> 01:08:49.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): than the difference between pre Internet at and post Internet.

697
01:08:49.979 --> 01:08:56.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And it's gonna happen faster. Each generation of technology gets deployed faster and faster.

698
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:59.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And so there is this race to who can get there fastest.

699
01:09:01.219 --> 01:09:06.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We're gonna prevent them from having to all reinvent the wheel. We're building the infrastructure.

700
01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:07.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now

701
01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:14.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I want to be clear. My knowledge of the 3 tiered AI, and all that stuff is poor. And so I may be saying things that aren't true.

702
01:09:15.019 --> 01:09:19.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But conceptually, if if that rings true to you, and you can tell that story

703
01:09:19.869 --> 01:09:21.179
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that'd be awesome.

704
01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:38.489
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, it does ring true. And I'll tell you why. Because there's actually a revolution that there's actually like a skyrocketing demand for computing power. And well, whether it's like whether we we mentioned AI or even other applications, I think. Starting off with

705
01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:41.780
Fabio Caironi: the demand, is, skyrocketing. People are on a race.

706
01:09:42.306 --> 01:09:44.173
Fabio Caironi: That's the real hook.

707
01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:47.293
Fabio Caironi: yeah, that's that's very powerful.

708
01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.520
Fabio Caironi: yeah, thanks for bringing it up.

709
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And there's a technique here.

710
01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:52.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): If you get

711
01:09:53.029 --> 01:09:54.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): your audience

712
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:58.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): again. One technique is to get them to, you know, have a

713
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:03.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, big market, whatever. But then, once you've hooked them, if you get them to nod along with you.

714
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:26.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, it's sort of like, you know, I'm gonna say something that's really true. Oh, you believe that I'm gonna say something else. That's really true. I'm gonna believe that I'm say something else, really true. Believe that you should invest in my company. Oh, yeah, I'm nodding still, right? Like it's yes, yes, it's a it's a technique salespeople use all the time, you know, get, give them a bunch of things that they absolutely, positively agree with, and say, Yes, yes, yes. Will you invest? Yeah.

715
01:10:26.995 --> 01:10:28.120
Fabio Caironi: Like, it's just.

716
01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:42.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Then that you're just so used to saying yes, and so I think that you can tell a story like that. That is, they shouldn't reinvent the wheel. They shouldn't have to do all this technology shouldn't have. We are that provider we are gonna change the world. And they're like, Yeah, of course you are.

717
01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:46.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I love it.

718
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:48.469
Fabio Caironi: That's cool. Thank you so much.

719
01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:56.810
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. Fabio. Make sure you watch this back because you can write down the sample pitch for all of you. The sample pitch Troy gave you. You can just write it down.

720
01:10:56.810 --> 01:11:00.841
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then you can correct all the things I said that were wrong. But yeah.

721
01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:09.429
Lilliana Robinson: So we have about 15 min left, and we have, like 6 or 7 to go through. So we'll do like 1 min feedback per. We'll see if we can.

722
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:12.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I can go a little longer, if need be.

723
01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.429
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, that's awesome, Troy. Thank you. Okay, Morgan, go ahead.

724
01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:16.959
Morgan Stanton: Be quick.

725
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:46.039
Morgan Stanton: Women for a long time have known their health has not been a priority, and this has not been a secret secret. That's not a secret, but only recently. Biotech and pharma are rapidly noticing. They don't have the resources to quantify or analyze women's health. 180 billion dollars. Market opal therapeutics offers a new solution with a uterus and a dish platform, basically focusing on female R&D and therapeutic development for female reproductive health.

726
01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:59.209
Morgan Stanton: We have a biobank of reproductive cells, uterine organoids. These are miniature versions of our patient's uterus as well as AI diagnostics. I'm CEO of opal therapeutics. Morgan Stanton, and I'm here to close the gap in women's health.

727
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:07.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright, so I don't understand who your custom, so it sounds cool.

728
01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't understand who your customer is, and let me be specific.

729
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:16.282
Troy Henikoff (he/him): At 1 point I thought what you were doing was building a

730
01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:27.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): synthetic uterus so that we could test various drugs on it and various therapies and whatever, and learn a bunch from it, and that your customer was the big pharmaceutical companies.

731
01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:34.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And then at 1 point, when you said, Oh, we do something with cells. You said something about org cell bank. What did you say.

732
01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.030
Morgan Stanton: We have a Biobank.

733
01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:45.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Biobank of cells I'm like, Oh, no! Each individual woman scrapes themselves and puts it in there, and we test how they respond to various therapies.

734
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:51.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and so I don't know which one of those, or maybe it's a 3rd one, is true. But it was on the point, is, it was unclear to me.

735
01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:56.410
Morgan Stanton: Okay, yeah. So I'm going after biotech and pharma, or like B, 2 B, not direct to consumer.

736
01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.310
Morgan Stanton: But.

737
01:12:57.310 --> 01:13:01.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Is your product, something that is like generic uterus.

738
01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:11.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him): go, develop some stuff to help women be healthier, or is your product? Here's a tool that you guys can develop so that you can test individuals on how they will react to various things.

739
01:13:11.710 --> 01:13:16.870
Morgan Stanton: The second, the the tools. We have many patient donors in our sample in our Biobank.

740
01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So if you are successful

741
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:29.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and my wife had some issues, she might go into her obyn. They'd scrape something. They'd put it in there, and they'd test some chemicals, and they'd be like, oh, here's the best treatment for you.

742
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:34.622
Morgan Stanton: No, that's not exactly what I'm saying. I, technically you could do that.

743
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:36.080
Lilliana Robinson: Model, right.

744
01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:36.490
Morgan Stanton: Yeah.

745
01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:40.790
Lilliana Robinson: Building a model to help those women. So it's not actually their cells. Is that correct?

746
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:46.839
Morgan Stanton: Yeah, it's not that personalized. I'm just saying we have a large collection of resources. They could go out. They could use.

747
01:13:47.530 --> 01:13:57.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So would they like? Look at her cells and say, Oh, you're a 47 Qrz. And then they'd look up the model for 47 Qrz. And what worked on that.

748
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:02.430
Morgan Stanton: I think so. I think I have my understanding correctly.

749
01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:12.120
Morgan Stanton: It wouldn't be like a we wouldn't be taking individual. I'm collecting the Biobank now. But like, I'm basically selling it to them as like a platform to do their testing on.

750
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:16.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But how will you know what Kristen needs?

751
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:23.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I guess what I'm I'm thinking of this. So do you know how Tempest works?

752
01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:25.460
Morgan Stanton: No.

753
01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:31.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So Tempest is a Chicago company. It just went public, and what Tempest was doing was for people who had cancer.

754
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:37.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They would take a sample of the tumor and a sample of your own DNA,

755
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:39.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and they would put that into a

756
01:14:39.410 --> 01:15:06.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a big database, and they had such a big database of how various treatments had worked that they could say, machine learning would say, this combination the most effective solution is, and they'd give you a customized prescription. And so what they're trying to do is customize how you treat cancer based on what cancer it is and what DNA you have. And they literally just went public like last month or 2 months ago, and they have.

757
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:08.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, tens of millions of

758
01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:13.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him): samples on both sides in this big machine learning. Are you doing some sort of a

759
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:15.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him): not to that level, but some sort of.

760
01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:36.629
Morgan Stanton: I'm collecting patient samples, but it's just to keep improving our platform. It's not as personalized as what you're describing. I understand what you're saying, but that's not. We're just collecting the the bio bake to make general assessments like, I can test 20 patients with your drug. X kind of thing. Not. I can test a specific patient with drug X.

761
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:39.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So is it something like this

762
01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:43.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in the world of

763
01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:49.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): of drug testing? It's always hard to test on live humans.

764
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.940
Morgan Stanton: Yes.

765
01:15:49.940 --> 01:16:02.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We do animal tests we test on mice, we test on primates. But when it comes to live humans and knowing how things actually work. It's always been challenging. It's particularly challenging in ob-gyn.

766
01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:08.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Women don't like to have their. You know, their private parts used as testing.

767
01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:11.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We have developed a synthetic.

768
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:16.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know how you describe it. We even a a synthetic uterus

769
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:19.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): with real cells from real patients.

770
01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:23.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so that the big pharma companies can use our product

771
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:30.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to test across a variety of people with a variety of genetic backgrounds and bring their drugs to market faster.

772
01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:41.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The result is that they have less time in R&D. Less expense, and women have better access to healthcare. We're helping women be healthier.

773
01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.050
Morgan Stanton: Yes, yeah, that's great. That that sums it up. Very well.

774
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:47.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Is that directionally correct.

775
01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:57.860
Morgan Stanton: Yes, yeah, that I that's also I I haven't like, I'm longer pitch that like we have. We're we're not a rat model that we're, you know, we're more translatable to like the clinic. So yes, that makes complete sense.

776
01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:06.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I feel like this one's gonna be hard to to articulate. Well, but I think if you do, it'll be it'll you'll get that chart.

777
01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.310
Morgan Stanton: Okay.

778
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:13.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, I I will be very interested to see you in a couple of weeks after you've had time to iterate on this, and

779
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:26.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I want to give you again the feedback that it was unclear to me who your customer was, and so when I did it, I said, so we give Big Pharma the ability to like. It was pretty clear that Big Pharma was your customer.

780
01:17:27.605 --> 01:17:28.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So

781
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:31.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): work on it. We'll talk in 2 weeks.

782
01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:32.070
Morgan Stanton: Thanks.

783
01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.570
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. Morgan

784
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.650
Lilliana Robinson: alright, who was next

785
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:38.120
Lilliana Robinson: tutor. Me? All right, Nick.

786
01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:57.199
Nicholas Li: What if I told you that you can be accepted to your dream university and still not allowed to attend? Well, for international baccalaureate students worldwide who want to go to university anywhere other than North America. This is the case growing up in Hong Kong. I wanted to go to study in Uk. And all I could think about for 2 years in my high school was the Ib program.

787
01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:15.919
Nicholas Li: Like my classmates, I struggled to refine my essay writing skills to learn and relearn 6 unique subjects and study for a series of final exams of over 3 weeks which I had to pass for my Conditional Imperial College, London offer. We even spent countless hours with expensive tutors outside school, but we still felt anxious and unprepared.

788
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:29.720
Nicholas Li: My name's Nicholas Lee, and that's why, I found a tutor. Me. We're a Saas platform specifically designed for Ib students like me to provide immediate feedback for times. They're studying alone. At 11 Pm. Overwhelmed with their workload, yet unsure where to begin.

789
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:41.560
Nicholas Li: we're bridging a gap between in-person tutoring and generic online resources. Students no longer have to scour the Internet for pirated practice exams or peer review each other's papers. Instead, they use Tutorme.

790
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:49.580
Nicholas Li: We're hyper focused on helping students regain their confidence and direction, not just for Ib. Before any standardized curriculum in the future.

791
01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.040
Lilliana Robinson: That was 1 0, 6.

792
01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:55.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

793
01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So I think I get it.

794
01:18:57.930 --> 01:18:59.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And

795
01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:02.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I think there is an opportunity to make this tighter.

796
01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:05.390
Nicholas Li: Yeah.

797
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:07.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What if we go ahead.

798
01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:14.310
Nicholas Li: Yeah, that's what Kevin and us, we're working on like, how do we cut this down? Because I have to speak really quickly to keep keep this in 60 seconds.

799
01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:25.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, no, we have to cut out like a 3rd of your words. It's hard. It's really hard. There's a famous quote, Samuel Clemens said. You know I would have written you a shorter letter, only I didn't have the time

800
01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:28.750
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right. It's hard to cut words out.

801
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:31.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So

802
01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:34.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): what would I say here.

803
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:41.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): maybe something like this. It's shocking to people from the Us. To hear

804
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:47.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him): that there are students who get accepted to college yet are not allowed to attend.

805
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:53.059
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's not just college acceptance that gets you in. But you actually have to score.

806
01:19:53.410 --> 01:19:59.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I assume I'm doing this right. You actually have to score high enough on the International Baccalaureate Exam in order to get in.

807
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I was one of those students.

808
01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But I need it. So okay.

809
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:17.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him): so that's the opening is that it's and this will be shocking to people. It's shocking to me. I didn't know before this, so if I get accepted to a college, but then I have to take a series of exams to it to validate my.

810
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.249
Nicholas Li: Meet your conditional offer. Yeah.

811
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:20.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): To meet my conditional offer.

812
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And these students don't have the resources

813
01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:29.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): for private tutoring, which is very time consuming and expensive.

814
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:35.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Today they scour the Internet. They look for sample exams. But it's just not sufficient enough.

815
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:42.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We've developed a set of AI tools that guide people through the process

816
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:45.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him): of going from where they are today.

817
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him): To passing the Ib exams.

818
01:20:48.750 --> 01:21:00.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Our AI agent understands where their knowledge is is sufficient and where it's insufficient. We guide them through the process. We give them sample, quizzes, blah blah, and at a fraction of the cost

819
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:01.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him): of

820
01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:04.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): of an in-person tutor we get.

821
01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:14.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I don't know what claims you can make. But I'm assuming you actually are going to claim that you get better results. We have a higher percentage of our students get, accept.

822
01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:18.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him): meet the threshold than if they were dealing with a human tutor.

823
01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:22.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are tomorrow's solution for today's problem

824
01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:23.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him): acceptance into

825
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:27.115
Troy Henikoff (he/him): college universities. I I bumbled my words. But

826
01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:28.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him): yeah, I think.

827
01:21:28.690 --> 01:21:37.759
Lilliana Robinson: They need more emotion, Troy, that's something I've thought about for this this one for a long time, like really playing on the dream being crushed, and things like that.

828
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:49.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, so you could weave your personal story in there. So when you say when you give the thing that it's shocking for us people to under to realize that there there are students who get accepted to the college of their dreams

829
01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and may not be able to attend.

830
01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You see, there's a second hurdle. They need to meet the qualifying exam.

831
01:21:56.390 --> 01:22:06.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I know, because I was one of those students. I studied 48, you know, whatever. I studied 80 HA week for 4 weeks with it, just to ensure that I got in.

832
01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:09.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but not everybody was as disciplined as I am.

833
01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:11.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So

834
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I created

835
01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:15.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him): whatever you're calling it, toot or something.

836
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.220
Nicholas Li: Computer, mean, yeah.

837
01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:24.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I created. Tutor me an AI power tool that will guide you through the process. It is less expensive than the human tutors and more effective.

838
01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:39.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's able to analyze in real time where you're sufficient, where you're deficient. Give you practice exams, get you to boom, boom, boom, and push you to the point where it's always there answering and getting you to the point where you have the skills you need to pass that exam.

839
01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:46.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Our students pass the exam more at a higher rate than even ones with expensive

840
01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:47.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him): professional tutors.

841
01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:49.219
Lilliana Robinson: That's a good point.

842
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:52.080
Lilliana Robinson: So I think you guys need to think about that and try and like

843
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:54.350
Lilliana Robinson: revamp it with with Kevin.

844
01:22:54.450 --> 01:23:00.310
Lilliana Robinson: But that was really helpful. Troy. Okay, so we're gonna hit time with this next one. We have 4 left Troy.

845
01:23:00.564 --> 01:23:14.380
Lilliana Robinson: If you guys need to drop at 1230. That's okay. Choice is going to be generous and stay on as long as you can feel free to drop tutor. Me, you guys are up 1st for the financial model office hours with Verona. So make sure you leave right at 1230 and make your slot with her.

846
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:17.039
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, cool, Annie, go ahead.

847
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:18.300
Annie Brown: All right.

848
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:50.320
Annie Brown: all right. After rolling out new content discovery Algorithm Tumblr experienced a 40% drop in website visits and their valuation plunged from 1 billion to a 3 million dollars sale to wordpress all due to data annotation that missed the mark on community values reliable is making algorithms more accurate with user-driven data annotation software for socially complex tasks like content recommendation in consumer tech.

849
01:23:50.730 --> 01:24:12.770
Annie Brown: Our 1st customers, a skincare brand for melanin, rich skin and the Reddit, for women are just the beginning. Hi! I'm Annie, the CEO of Reliable and an AI researcher at Uc San Diego, and with my CTO. Duncan, a Stanford Postdoc. We're building infrastructure that makes AI accurate, reliable, and rooted in real user values.

850
01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:18.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right. So what happened there with your for opening story?

851
01:24:19.190 --> 01:24:36.269
Annie Brown: Yeah. So the opening story is basically that Tumblr launched a content discovery algorithm. They just put out a new algorithm on their platform. And then it was so bad and miscategorizing data so much that

852
01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:40.849
Annie Brown: 40% of the users left the website and the whole company plummeted because.

853
01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:46.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So it was trying to, so if I was on Tumblr, it would try to recommend the next article or the next post for me to see.

854
01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:56.230
Annie Brown: It would recommend post, and then it would also remove content. So users were getting their posts removed, banned. So it was content. Discovery and content. Moderation.

855
01:24:58.050 --> 01:24:58.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right.

856
01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:04.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So, and you think you do this better than most.

857
01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.510
Annie Brown: Yes.

858
01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:11.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright. So what if we did something like, I'm totally changing it. But what if we did something like

859
01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:21.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him): recommendation engines are key to many technology companies growth. We all have been recommended

860
01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the next movie to watch on Netflix.

861
01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:36.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You may not realize it, but Youtube does an amazing job of getting you down those rabbit holes of of information by recommending the next video, the next video, the next video. It's addictive.

862
01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:38.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But only when it's done right.

863
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:40.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Tumbler did it.

864
01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:53.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Their recommendation engine wasn't quite as good. As a matter of fact, 40% of their users quit within a matter of weeks because it was recommending the wrong content to them. They went from a 1 billion dollar valuation to a 3 million dollar sale

865
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him): to wordpress

866
01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.009
Troy Henikoff (he/him): in a matter of months.

867
01:25:58.410 --> 01:26:01.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are AI specialists

868
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:07.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him): recommend. I don't know a postdoc. Stanford blah blah! We understand this space better than anybody else.

869
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:11.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We're not going to replace Netflix or Youtube's engines.

870
01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:20.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But for everybody else who's trying to leverage social media posts, recommendation engines, we have the solution for them.

871
01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Boom, boom, boom, boom.

872
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:25.840
Annie Brown: I. I have a question about that, because so

873
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:26.490
Annie Brown: this is.

874
01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:27.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I made up a bunch of stuff.

875
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:28.700
Annie Brown: There you go

876
01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:49.289
Annie Brown: well. And and the the content recommendation stuff is like, basically our go to market strategy. So our AI and data annotation can help with all sorts of kinds of AI stuff. But we're just kind of keying in on this content recommendation to start. Would you suggest that we kind of still focus in on that, on our, on our demo.

877
01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So one of the most successful

878
01:26:52.840 --> 01:27:15.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him): one of the probably the second most successful company that went through my tech stars. Was a company called Logicgate, and they came. There's a big lesson in here for everybody. They came into our program with a cool tool. They basically said, we can take a flow chart. They were ex consultants. We could take a flow chart, you could draw it any way you want, and then you hit a button, and it creates a web app of of that where each

879
01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:24.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): each rectangle becomes a web page, each diamond becomes a decision. Blah blah like a flow chart right? And so if you can draw a flow chart in visio, you can create a web app.

880
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It can be used for anything.

881
01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:27.870
Annie Brown: Yeah.

882
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:33.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And the thing that we did with them is, we said, pick one market pick one problem that you can solve.

883
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:41.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and the market that they chose was risk and compliance for fortune. 500 companies, because that's what they had done some stuff with in their

884
01:27:42.810 --> 01:28:06.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): their consulting life. And I'm like risk and compliance, fortune. I don't even know what the hell that is. And they're like. Oh, you know, when there's a breach of a firewall. 10 people have to get notified, and if the breach is bigger than this, it's got to go to the Vice President, and if it's and and they have to sign off. And they're doing it with spreadsheets and email now. And we're going to make it a web app with a database. It's gonna be awesome like all right, if you know that. And by the time the program was over they had 3 proof of concepts signed

885
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:08.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him): today

886
01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:15.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): the company is doing amazingly well, I don't know what the revenue is. It's many, many tens of millions. It might be a hundred 1 million in revenue.

887
01:28:15.710 --> 01:28:31.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him): They they've raised significant money tens of millions. They're doing amazingly well. They've like 300 400 employees, and they still haven't branched out from risk and compliance because that market is so big. What sounds like a tiny little market is huge.

888
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:37.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And I think if they had gone to market saying, Hey, we've got this tool that can do anything for anyone.

889
01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:37.980
Annie Brown: Right.

890
01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:41.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Nobody would have known what to do with it, and they never would have sold a single one.

891
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:44.010
Annie Brown: Okay, well, that's that's exciting. And I think.

892
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:45.309
Annie Brown: Oh, go ahead.

893
01:28:45.310 --> 01:29:09.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. But taking your technology, applying it to a very well defined problem solution that people can get their head around makes it easier for you to sell to those customers. Once you start to sell to some of them, other ones will hear in that market, and they'll know makes it easier for investors to understand makes it easier for you to focus. I strongly, strongly, strongly believe you should pick one. I have no opinion about which one you should pick.

894
01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.919
Annie Brown: Yeah. Yeah. No.

895
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him): One, and go.

896
01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:22.419
Annie Brown: The jobs to be done helped us figure out like content. Moderation is the one so yeah, that's I think that focus in the in the pitch makes sense.

897
01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You're actually doing content, moderation.

898
01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:26.830
Annie Brown: Or sorry content, recommendation.

899
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:35.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay, that's different. Yeah. Cause when you said moderation, I'm now I'm thinking about something totally different. I'm thinking about Wikipedia. And I'm thinking about like right.

900
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:55.179
Annie Brown: Yep, yep, content recommendation as as the focus. And I think we're learning that maybe someday we can get into like the Netflix and the linkedins and stuff. But for now, just focusing on those smaller business like we you were said, we can now like this can be applied to everyone else. That's not the Youtube or the Netflix. So that's great.

901
01:29:55.710 --> 01:30:05.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And there have been, I mean, I've read a bunch of articles about how Youtube like literally has to. They were so good at it. They were getting people into these crazy rabbit holes that like they're

902
01:30:05.170 --> 01:30:08.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him): there. There are people wanting them to back off and not be so good, because

903
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:13.644
Troy Henikoff (he/him): if you like. Type, the word conspiracy theory, you end up, you know, getting

904
01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:15.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right.

905
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:22.600
Annie Brown: Oh, yeah, I've been in those rabbit holes myself. So I I get it. But yeah, no, it's it's a super fascinating topic. And I think.

906
01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:30.989
Annie Brown: bringing in things that people can learn about the topic into the pitch as well. So I'll let the next person go. But this was super interesting. Thank you.

907
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:34.140
Lilliana Robinson: Thanks, Jenny. Alright! I believe, Monica, you're next.

908
01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:35.940
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): They try.

909
01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:37.080
Lilliana Robinson: 3 more tribes.

910
01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All right.

911
01:30:38.770 --> 01:30:44.250
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, did you know, it takes 10 years and 1 billion dollars to bring a new drug to patients.

912
01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:49.529
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Clinical trials are the longest and most expensive part of this process. And they're just getting worse.

913
01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:53.049
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Research shows a rapid increase in trial. Complexity

914
01:30:53.150 --> 01:30:58.270
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): trials are increasingly targeting rare diseases and very specific patient populations.

915
01:30:58.310 --> 01:31:02.140
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): however, managing trials, remains as inefficient as ever.

916
01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:09.070
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I'm Monica Roy, the founder of seascape clinical. I also worked in Pharma for 20 years. So know the problem intimately.

917
01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:13.639
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Successful trial management requires both transparency and efficiency.

918
01:31:13.670 --> 01:31:20.759
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): However, tools like spreadsheets and legacy systems only provide the former leaving pharma teams mired in busy work.

919
01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:25.940
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Seascape's platform provides transparency while automating away this busy work.

920
01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:34.300
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): This results in immediate cost and time savings for pharma companies and the potential for faster trials and delivery of drugs to patients.

921
01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:43.660
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Global trial spend was 80 billion dollars last year and is increasing. If you'd like to help make this spend more impactful. We invite you to invest in us.

922
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:46.310
Lilliana Robinson: 59 seconds.

923
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:47.856
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right on.

924
01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:53.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So what's the real

925
01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:57.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him): job to be done here? So let me let before I

926
01:31:57.870 --> 01:31:59.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): before you answer, let me frame it.

927
01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Generally companies

928
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:07.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him): buy things for one of 3 reasons. It's going to increase their revenue.

929
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:09.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's gonna reduce their expense.

930
01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's going to save them time.

931
01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:16.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Those are the big 3 buckets. I don't think this increases revenue.

932
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:19.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): This may save some expense.

933
01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:25.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but in the if I'm running a drug trial, and it cost me a billion dollars. What's the biggest?

934
01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:28.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What portion of that 1 billion dollars are you going to save.

935
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:31.690
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Personnel.

936
01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.239
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But how much are you gonna save

937
01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:37.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 2 salaries, 200 salaries?

938
01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:42.669
Troy Henikoff (he/him): How much is that of the 1 billion dollars I'm going to spend? How much you gonna save me in hard dollars.

939
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:48.510
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, I mean, it depends on how many trials they have. Right? So the savings.

940
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:50.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him): One drug. We're doing one drug. We're.

941
01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.089
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I would say 2 salaries.

942
01:32:54.500 --> 01:33:02.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Okay. So you're gonna save. And let's say they're big salaries or quarter 1 million dollars. You're gonna save me half a million dollars out of a billion dollars or

943
01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:06.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 1 20th of 1% of the total cost.

944
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:11.699
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): It would be like 2 salaries per trial, right? So if they have, like

945
01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:13.310
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): a hundred trials, right.

946
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:15.669
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But isn't each trial a billion dollars.

947
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:30.749
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): No, no, no! A 1 billion dollars was the time it takes to bring one drug to market. But that goes beyond clinical trials. It starts with like preclinical discovery research, then preclinical research and then clinical research. Right?

948
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:36.420
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): So then, the clinical research component is the clinical trials. And that's where we come in.

949
01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:42.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So of the 1 billion dollars, how many dollars do you save them? Do you think.

950
01:33:43.313 --> 01:33:51.789
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I would say, like one clinical trial phase phase 2 would be 10 million dollars or phase. One would be $1010,000,000.

951
01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you're gonna save them 10 million dollars.

952
01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:58.570
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): No, that's the total cost of the trial.

953
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:02.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you're gonna save them 500,000 on 10 million.

954
01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:04.200
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah.

955
01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:05.850
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I mean, it's

956
01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:07.110
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): yeah.

957
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:13.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Where I'm going is like, okay, so even at that, that's about a 5% savings, which is 5% is meaningful.

958
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:16.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But to a drug company, so

959
01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:19.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): do you help them get the trial done more quickly.

960
01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:27.949
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yes, and make sure that they're getting. You know. They're getting to the right place right? As opposed to going off. Course.

961
01:34:28.210 --> 01:34:35.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So how much more quickly will they get it done? If a regular trial, whole trial process takes 10 years. If they use your software. How long will it take.

962
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:42.130
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): It's not about getting quickly. It's more about making sure there's no delays, so it can save like 6 months to maybe

963
01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:50.850
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): up to a year and delay for a 3 year trial, because if if something goes off the rails like they, you know, to bring it back takes many months.

964
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:55.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What I'm okay.

965
01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:00.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him): What I'm trying to get to is the real reason that people are gonna actually buy.

966
01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:02.340
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, do you have.

967
01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:04.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Do you have people using this today?

968
01:35:04.630 --> 01:35:05.280
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yep.

969
01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.899
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And why are they? Why do you think they're paying you money for this.

970
01:35:10.275 --> 01:35:10.990
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): It's

971
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:12.430
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): well

972
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:23.649
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): they're paying us money because they're able to manage their trial more efficiently, and they, like all of their stuff, is in one place, as opposed to having to go to various systems.

973
01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:44.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So if we were, if we had time, I would do the whole jobs to be done, interview and start asking, Well, why does that matter right? We gotta get to. And and then why does that matter? Why does that matter? We gotta get to the core and the core might be like, you know, they want to cover their ass. The core might be that they can get to a yes, no decision more quickly. The core like. I don't know what it is.

974
01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:48.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but I want to surface that, and I want to use that in the pitch.

975
01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:49.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So let's assume.

976
01:35:49.260 --> 01:36:15.939
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I'll tell you. I'll tell you this much, so our customer is a weird outlier, and I would not use them. But what we discovered in our jobs to be done in in my other experiences, that when people want to scale their trial portfolio like a small medium company, that's when they get a solution like ours, right? They're unable to like. Just go look across like 50 spreadsheets to understand where things stand. They need to get like a solution like ours to look across the entire portfolio.

977
01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:19.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And are there? There are other people who have solutions like yours.

978
01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:23.179
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, it's a very saturated market, but none of them do anything very well.

979
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:24.030
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): So.

980
01:36:24.690 --> 01:36:28.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So what? How are you different from the ones that are in the market? How are you better.

981
01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:36.429
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah. So instead of transparency, like, here's your dashboard. We're also automating away a lot of like the manual and repetitive tasks.

982
01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:39.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright. So let me try something. Then.

983
01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:46.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Everybody knows that clinical trials are expensive and time consuming the average

984
01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:52.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him): time it takes to take a drug to market is 10 years, and it costs over a billion dollars.

985
01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:55.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 1 billion dollars for a single drug.

986
01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:08.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Now, imagine you're a company that's pro. That's that's taking drugs to market. Sure, you can manage this with spreadsheets and emails and Google Docs. And if you're doing one or you're doing 2, that's sufficient.

987
01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:18.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But when you have a portfolio of drugs that you're trying to take to market and keep everybody on track, time is of the essence. You need a software solution.

988
01:37:18.690 --> 01:37:28.059
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And yes, there are some software solutions out there. They are woefully inadequate. They do. XYZ. Really poorly.

989
01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:42.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I know my name's Monica, and I used to run these clinical trials in my prior life when I worked at wherever Abbott. Whatever. I don't remember what your I don't know what your background was right. And so I've created seascape clinical. To solve this problem.

990
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:55.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him): our software is more accurate, faster, timely, whatever your benefits are. Boom, boom! Boom! So that we know that the right drugs get to market at the, you know, at the right time, without delays without there's

991
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him): does that flow feel right to you?

992
01:37:58.290 --> 01:37:59.990
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, yeah, that's accurate.

993
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:07.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I just think you need to be more explicit for the person who doesn't understand your industry.

994
01:38:08.710 --> 01:38:11.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): if you're gonna expect that you have a shot at getting

995
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:13.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him): capital from

996
01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:25.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him): generic venture. Capital. Now, maybe you're only going to get capital from people who are on the inside and already understand all that stuff, in which case you can use all the technical speak you want, because they'll understand it.

997
01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:31.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I tend to like to start with a pitch. That's so simple. My grandmother would understand it

998
01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:32.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right.

999
01:38:32.610 --> 01:38:35.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I try to spell things out. So it's a stylistic thing.

1000
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:37.619
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay. Alright. Thanks.

1001
01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:40.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I feel like, I don't have a great yeah.

1002
01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:41.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him): yeah.

1003
01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:46.919
Lilliana Robinson: So we'll we'll work with you to decide on a goal. Just like I said when I introduced Demo to you guys like

1004
01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:57.760
Lilliana Robinson: how you win, Demo Day is you make the most steps towards your personal goal. It's not the same for everyone, so whatever it is, will help you just start thinking about that, Monica. Okay, health blocks.

1005
01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:03.987
Nirat Attri: Firstly, thank you for staying on so long. I know it must be tiring for you.

1006
01:39:04.270 --> 01:39:06.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Oh, it's fun! I love this stuff! It is fun!

1007
01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:07.510
Lilliana Robinson: Too much.

1008
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:08.170
Nirat Attri: Got it.

1009
01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:22.049
Nirat Attri: I'll hop in so growing up in a family with 17 doctors, I was always perplexed by the fact that we entrust our lives to these noble, skilled professionals. But we've made everything around the delivery of care so complex

1010
01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:30.950
Nirat Attri: the sheer amount of paperwork that needs to exchange hands and makes it make its way across disconnected systems, is frustrating, not just for them, but for the patient, too.

1011
01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:34.600
Nirat Attri: is the 21st century. There has to be a better way.

1012
01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:39.879
Nirat Attri: When my last company got acquired by resmed in 2021 things suddenly fell into place.

1013
01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:50.010
Nirat Attri: The reason why the healthcare ecosystem is so slow and expensive is because it has grown accustomed to churning out new solutions without thinking how it'll fit into the ecosystem.

1014
01:39:50.110 --> 01:39:58.439
Nirat Attri: As a result, we have a combination of existing and new technologies held together by people doing the job of making these systems talk to each other.

1015
01:39:58.730 --> 01:40:06.660
Nirat Attri: Healthcare needs a new infrastructure. Backbone, one that fixes the way existing systems work instead of adding yet another layer of complexity.

1016
01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:20.760
Nirat Attri: My name is neerat Atri, and I'm the founder and CEO of healthblocks, a Saas platform specifically designed to enhance the capabilities of existing healthcare software by reliably embedding technology into existing ways of operating a practice

1017
01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:32.070
Nirat Attri: instead of reinventing the wheel. Our modules, sdks, Apis, and libraries are designed to build composable solutions that are either brand new or enhance existing solutions already in the market.

1018
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:41.820
Nirat Attri: In a 4 trillion dollar industry where technology feels like moving mountains, we aim to allow all our users to build advanced healthcare solutions with Lego like ease.

1019
01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:48.700
Nirat Attri: My parents worked hard enough to learn how to be doctors. Their journey into technology should not be as difficult. Thank you.

1020
01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:52.310
Lilliana Robinson: That was 1 36. So you need to cut about

1021
01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:54.739
Lilliana Robinson: like 30% of that.

1022
01:40:55.040 --> 01:41:03.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So question for you is this targeting things like individual physicians offices? Or are you working with?

1023
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:07.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You know, Cerner, Hbo, epic of the world.

1024
01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:09.040
Nirat Attri: To

1025
01:41:09.250 --> 01:41:15.009
Nirat Attri: practices that use Cerner epic and all these ehrs in the world.

1026
01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:23.240
Nirat Attri: So smaller scale than them epic tends to work with like large hospital systems. We're going after mid to small size practices.

1027
01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:24.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And

1028
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): are you familiar with Hl. 7.

1029
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.020
Nirat Attri: Yeah.

1030
01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Is this like a better version of Hl. 7.

1031
01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:38.379
Nirat Attri: Yes. So Hl. 7 already has a progressively better open standard. So we're built on top of it.

1032
01:41:38.996 --> 01:41:46.670
Nirat Attri: So that standard is prescriptive. But nobody follows it. We are standardizing that like making it more accessible.

1033
01:41:47.150 --> 01:41:47.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And.

1034
01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.500
Nirat Attri: Yeah.

1035
01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:51.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him): what makes so

1036
01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:56.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Hl, seven's been around forever. And when I say forever.

1037
01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:05.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him): I started running a a software company that was selling to hospitals in 1992, and they were talking about Hl. 7,

1038
01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:11.768
Troy Henikoff (he/him): right? So 32 years ago, they were talking about the standard. Hl. 7, which is still one whatever.

1039
01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:13.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So.

1040
01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:21.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and Hl. 7 was hard because you had to write to interfaces, and it was difficult. What makes yours different than that.

1041
01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:28.789
Nirat Attri: So what we have done is produced it to like a standard jsonized format. That's the 1st step.

1042
01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:37.750
Nirat Attri: The other is that we have simplified the Api to be more consumable to regular devs that don't understand the industry spec.

1043
01:42:38.858 --> 01:42:45.569
Nirat Attri: And then we have made it actionable within the platform. So instead of somebody having to work with the Apis. You could just use the

1044
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:47.459
Nirat Attri: modules within the platform itself.

1045
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:53.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright, I I'm not going to get all this right without asking a lot more questions. But directionally, what if we did something like this

1046
01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): healthcare is a

1047
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:09.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 8 trillion dollar market worldwide. And 30% of that cost is just software systems and exchanging data.

1048
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:30.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The reason it's so expensive is that there are point solutions that do things well, and they have to communicate with each other. The standard that they use. Hl. 7 was introduced in 1989. I'm making this up. But I'm directionally correct in 1989 and is still the standard today.

1049
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:34.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But

1050
01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): today everything is web-based.

1051
01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:41.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him): The Internet didn't exist when Hl. 7 was standardized.

1052
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We

1053
01:43:43.110 --> 01:43:57.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): have put a modern web like interface to connecting your your various software packages in healthcare, just like connecting Lego blocks. We then do the hard work of translating that into Hl. 7, and into the other systems

1054
01:43:57.930 --> 01:44:06.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we are the missing piece that will reduce healthcare cost will reduce it. Spend, and we'll let the various

1055
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:10.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him): healthcare it systems speak to each other

1056
01:44:10.930 --> 01:44:13.549
Troy Henikoff (he/him): simply and effortlessly.

1057
01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Is that what you're doing.

1058
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:20.943
Nirat Attri: Probably, yeah.

1059
01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:27.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Alright cause. I think that's a lot clearer. So giving that tiny bit of history

1060
01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:41.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him): about this antiquated solution that's literally been out there and go look it up. I don't know when it was. I know it was in place in 92, because that's when I 1st heard about it. So you know, this. This thing is probably 35 years old.

1061
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:49.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's older, you know. It didn't like Internet didn't exist. HTML didn't exist like, think about all the things that we use today and take for Grant they didn't exist.

1062
01:44:50.230 --> 01:44:51.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We are the bridge

1063
01:44:52.210 --> 01:44:59.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him): letting today's systems talk to yesterday's systems to make healthcare cheaper, more efficient and easier to build.

1064
01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:06.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him): All my numbers were wrong. Go look them up, but I bet they're they weren't that far off.

1065
01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:14.709
Nirat Attri: Yeah, I mean, I think that I mean just contextual. Don't want to take a lot of your time. But I think a new standard has been in the work. It's not mature.

1066
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:16.860
Nirat Attri: but the

1067
01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:24.580
Nirat Attri: the hospital systems are deliberately not adopting it correctly, because it's an open standard. So they're making it deliberately difficult

1068
01:45:24.792 --> 01:45:29.460
Nirat Attri: to talk. So what we are trying to do is make that easier. So the new standard came out like 10 years ago.

1069
01:45:29.530 --> 01:45:31.460
Nirat Attri: But it's still.

1070
01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:45.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him): You can say, if people know the industry like, isn't there a new standard? You say, Yeah, we write to that new standard. And you know, when the next new standard comes out in 4 more years, you don't have to change your interface. If you're using us, because we will just change how we talk to that standard.

1071
01:45:46.070 --> 01:46:05.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Right? That's part of the value of having an Api and a state like right? Because you can go you. You can direct your data and your standard to anything on the back end. So we make development easier for the for the people who are building new stuff. They write to us we can write to any of the standards, and as the standards change we'll change. You don't have to rewrite your stuff.

1072
01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.560
Nirat Attri: Thank you so much. This is so valuable.

1073
01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Sure.

1074
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:13.030
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. Okay?

1075
01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:27.150
Lilliana Robinson: And I was, I put something in the chat. The 1st question Troy asked. You should probably be something that you clarify in the Q. And a. This is, or make it clear in your pitch. But either way it should go in your FAQ. Like, who exactly are you selling to?

1076
01:46:27.190 --> 01:46:33.719
Lilliana Robinson: Because if that was his 1st question, that means it'll be other people's 1st question. Okay, George, you're the last one. Whenever you're ready.

1077
01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.879
George Reed - Noetic: Okay, thanks. Excellent thanks, Troy, for taking the time. Appreciate it.

1078
01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:53.969
George Reed - Noetic: Okay. So yeah, I'm George, the founder of Noetic. And for consumer insight managers who need fast and accurate research. Noetic is enabling an ongoing conversation with their market, turning insight into action and empowering more informed decision making.

1079
01:46:54.070 --> 01:47:00.650
George Reed - Noetic: So you can think of it as a connecting bridge, enabling collaboration between your company and market, or, in other words, a

1080
01:47:00.770 --> 01:47:18.390
George Reed - Noetic: water cooler chat with your consumers. And have you ever asked a colleague for feedback before betting on a new idea, or when starting a new project? Well, when a slow and expensive survey project won't do. Don't ask AI. Talk to your people with no headache.

1081
01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you used a lot of generic terms.

1082
01:47:24.112 --> 01:47:28.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and I don't know who your target market is.

1083
01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:30.510
George Reed - Noetic: Oh, consumer insight managers! It was the first.st

1084
01:47:31.150 --> 01:47:36.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Consume so consumer insight managers? At what kinds of companies.

1085
01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:46.740
George Reed - Noetic: Oh, yeah, so there are 5 to 8,000 of them in the Us. They all kind of know each other. They're all within, embedded within larger organizations, typically consumer facing so like

1086
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:49.790
George Reed - Noetic: fast moving consumer goods retail that kind of stuff.

1087
01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:59.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. So so this is where I think you have an opportunity for a story. And I again, I want to be clear. I don't really understand what you do. I understood some of those words.

1088
01:48:00.077 --> 01:48:03.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But I don't know. I'm gonna make stuff up, and then you'll correct me.

1089
01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:10.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let me think of an example.

1090
01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:18.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Gatorade is one of the biggest consumer brands in the world.

1091
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:21.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him): There's a person in there that

1092
01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:40.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him): consumer insight manager whose job it is to know what the consumers actually want. Is it gatorade 0? Is it gatorade clear? Is it ice? But, like, you know, go a whole bunch of things, you know. Some of those are are wild successes, and some of them are flops. You've never heard of them.

1093
01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It's a hard job.

1094
01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:45.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We make it easier.

1095
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.900
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let me tell you how we do this

1096
01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:49.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him): we take.

1097
01:48:49.630 --> 01:48:58.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and then talk about what you actually do like. If you make an example out of a brand like that. And I would use a household brand that people know

1098
01:48:59.030 --> 01:49:00.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him): like Gatorade, whatever.

1099
01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:11.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And you know it would be really fun if you named like Gatorade, 0 and Gatorade, whatever that people know. And then you named some that people had never heard of because they told did totally flop.

1100
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:13.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him): There's a reason you haven't heard those.

1101
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:16.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): That's because they were losers yet. Gatorade spent

1102
01:49:17.130 --> 01:49:20.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 30 million dollars launching gatorade flop.

1103
01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:23.059
George Reed - Noetic: You got it? Basically, yeah, yeah.

1104
01:49:23.170 --> 01:49:25.800
George Reed - Noetic: it's market research surveys quality. Yeah.

1105
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And not only did Gatorade lose 30 million dollars.

1106
01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:31.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him): but the consumer insight manager lost their job.

1107
01:49:32.170 --> 01:49:32.880
George Reed - Noetic: Hmm.

1108
01:49:33.850 --> 01:49:35.314
George Reed - Noetic: I like it. Yeah.

1109
01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:36.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We

1110
01:49:36.730 --> 01:49:48.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him): are a tool that helps them get actual insights from actual consumers before the product is made. Before the 30 million dollars is built. Let me tell you how we do it. Boom! Boom, boom! Boom! We are the tool.

1111
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.370
George Reed - Noetic: It straight off. Yeah.

1112
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:55.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah. But but you need some storytelling. You need some details, because.

1113
01:49:56.190 --> 01:50:03.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him): you know, and I I'm not a big company guy. And I had an idea of what you're doing, but it was really hard to follow, because you used a lot of

1114
01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:05.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him): a lot of

1115
01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:09.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him): language that was vague.

1116
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:12.260
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah. Pablum fuzzy words. Yeah.

1117
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:13.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

1118
01:50:14.465 --> 01:50:18.339
George Reed - Noetic: My thing with Kevin. So.

1119
01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:20.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Really specific and tell a story.

1120
01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:22.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him): With it

1121
01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:27.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and use something, and there's probably a famous one, you know. Probably the most famous one is New Coke.

1122
01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.769
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, I was just thinking that when you were saying like.

1123
01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:32.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, that's a way better example.

1124
01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:46.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him): So you know. And you can make a joke for those of you who are a little older in the audience. You remember when Coca-cola had a great consumer insight, and they dropped their historically successful product and they came out with New Coke.

1125
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:54.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him): It was a complete failure. It cost them billions of dollars so bad that they dropped new coke and reintroduced the old one.

1126
01:50:55.510 --> 01:51:00.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Imagine, if they knew enough about their consumers that they could have avoided that mistake.

1127
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:03.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Well, if they had no attic they would have.

1128
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him): We would have saved them

1129
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:06.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him): 20 billion dollars.

1130
01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Let me tell you how we work.

1131
01:51:09.710 --> 01:51:10.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah.

1132
01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:18.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And your investors are generally a little bit older audience, and they'll remember the new Coke story. I don't remember when that that was a long time ago.

1133
01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:19.270
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah.

1134
01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:23.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him): But it's a famous enough story like Lillian. Are you? Have you heard about the new coke story before.

1135
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.089
Lilliana Robinson: I had never heard that. So you just.

1136
01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:28.520
George Reed - Noetic: I used to use that example in my 1st ever like pitch.

1137
01:51:28.810 --> 01:51:30.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Chloe. Had you ever heard of it?

1138
01:51:31.230 --> 01:51:34.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him): Yeah, so literally, Coca-cola

1139
01:51:34.590 --> 01:51:52.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him): decided, because they're competing with Pepsi and Pepsi was, I think, a little sweeter. And so they decided, we're going to have new coke, which is going to be better. And they did this whole marketing campaign, and literally the can was changed, and it was called New Coke, and they put it out there. But they had this loyal following. People like that tastes like shit that doesn't taste like the coke, I know.

1140
01:51:52.420 --> 01:52:02.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and it was such a flop that they for a little while they had both. They brought old Coke back, and then they just dropped new coke, and they only had old Coke. They spent billions of dollars on that.

1141
01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:12.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him): and you know, maybe you might have to tell a little bit of the story. But for your potential investors, I think they'll all have heard that story.

1142
01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.120
George Reed - Noetic: Maybe.

1143
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:16.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him): And certainly anybody who's in that space knows that story.

1144
01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:19.880
George Reed - Noetic: Awesome. Thank you. Yeah, this is great feedback.

1145
