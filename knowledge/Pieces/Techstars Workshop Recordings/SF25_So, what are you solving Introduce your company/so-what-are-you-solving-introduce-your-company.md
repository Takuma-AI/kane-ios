> "Chloe Lannert: I'll drop in the chat the key things we want to go over. If you guys have decks that's awesome. If you don't. That's also totally okay. In the chat are the key things we want to sort of spend time on. So we can start really leaning in and helping each other out, especially when we get base camp access. Later today you'll be able to start pinging each other. Start connecting more directly."

> "Chloe Lannert: order you want to go. Just drop a message in the chat and I'll run through there. I'm going to give each company around 4 min, and then a couple minutes for Q, and a. And pretty casual just answering those key questions and learning more about each other."
