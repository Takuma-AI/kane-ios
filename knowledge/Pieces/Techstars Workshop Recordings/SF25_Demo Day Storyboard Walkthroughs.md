## Workshop Structure & Company Presentations

### Harvest (Ankur Toshniwal & Andrew Fernandes): AI-Powered Web Data Insights

**Objective**: Showcase unique insights for teams providing insights to customers rather than consuming insights

**Narrative Structure**:
- **Opening**: Illustrate unique pain points for software teams delivering unstructured web data insights
- **Product Demo**: Side-by-side comparison showing Harvest vs. Perplexity/ChatGPT crushing limitations
- **Value Demonstration**: Before/after workflows showing time savings and improved customer outcomes

**Key Feedback & Iterations**:

Alex Nativelle's Challenge on Competitive Positioning:
> "Your speech is, we are not competitors of chatgpt and publicity. Here's why. And if you come back to the product Demo showing, hey? We don't do the same as this like, are you competitors or not like? I don't understand."

**Strategic Repositioning**: Carlo Scaglia's Framework
> "I wouldn't go as neck to neck with the competitors. But it's just painting. The pictures like this is what's happening now, and these are the solutions that are being used now. which still means people have to suffer this problem. We're creating a different world like a different reality."

**Orthogonal Positioning Strategy**:
> "Definitely want to position ourselves orthogonally to them. Right? Not as like separate as like as like competitors. Really, it's like, actually, we just solve a different thing."

**Final Approach**: Focus on workflow compression and concrete problem-solving rather than direct competitive comparison.

### Exordy (Carlo Scaglia): Creator-Brand Connection Platform

**Objective**: Attract clients, creators, and rally people to the cause (not fundraising-focused)

**Three-Asset Strategy**:
1. **1-minute video** for website and marketing assets
2. **Pitch component** for business clarity
3. **Q&A content** for FAQ development

**Video Narrative Arc**:
> "It's resetting the scene, and I want to start it with the notion that it's the stories that we tell and the passions that we share that allow us to connect... true passion, has been drowned out by the flood of empty content that we see every day."

**Vision Framework**: Creating "a definitive space where creators that are obsessed about their craft can can thrive right, and the goal of this scene is to hint of this new world."

**Key Feedback**:

Meg Hall's Customer Focus Challenge:
> "When I listened to that it sounded more like a social media media network for creators. It didn't sound like it was an online place for me to find videographers and producers in every single region."

**Alex Nativelle's Credibility Integration**:
> "One of the things that are impressive about you is is, you know where you are right now with the business that goes really well, and I think you haven't talked about that... just a little sentence about like what you've done, or maybe just showcasing, like one of the production that you've seen."

**Chloe's Alternative Approach**:
> "I think you can get away with the video just being memorable and getting people's attention and just being really, really beautiful... As long as people understand like the vision. And then how the platform works."

### Velocity (Vivian): Automotive Technology Platform

**Objective Challenge**: Struggling between inspiration and actionable outcomes

**Presentation Strategy**:
- **Opening**: Why this transformation is necessary - demonstrating industry lag
- **Video Content**: Before/after dealership experience transformation
- **Value Proposition**: Platform vs. tool positioning

**NSG's Strategic Redirection**:
> "I wanna think about what would make it more worthwhile to you, because, like, I think, it's a great opportunity one for you to like, get a lot of people excited about your vision for the business... prioritize this these 6 min for the purposes of what you would use it for afterwards."

**Alex Nativelle's Actionability Challenge**:
> "I think this is inspirational, but not very actionable, like the goal that you have. I'm like getting people inspired is... yeah. I mean, I think you're gonna do a great job of that. I think you're really good at that. But I feel like, what's the next step?"

**Carlo's Narrative Structure Feedback**:
> "I didn't. It's it would be good to know how you wanna show those things like, show you what you said like. Show that we have great data like how you gonna show it like, what's your way to show that May isn't just a tool, but it's a platform like, what story are you trying to tell?"

### Brio (Antoine Carriere & Alex Nativelle): Interview Preparation Platform

**Strategic Focus**: Law student market entry for US expansion

**Objective**: Introduction to law schools, law firms, and legal professionals (not fundraising)

**Product Video Concept**: Law student OCI (On Campus Interviewing) preparation journey
> "It's going to be like, hey? It's a your law student your 15 days, or your 30 days from from Oci. and you go through you. You know the companies that you want to interview with. and you go through our product."

**Key Questions to Address**:
- Why focus specifically on law?
- How does this differ from existing Brio offerings?
- What's the US market strategy rationale?

**Anthony De Silva's Clarification**:
> "Why are we targeted specifically to law students... why brio is specifically focusing on law. So maybe that's I don't know if that's something you want to address like in the pitch or in a Q&A"

**Strategic Answer**: 
> "Law. It's super competitive, and it's very fast paced. And students are. It's the the law interview. The Oci interview is not technical, it's really behavioral. And that's where our product really shines."

**NSG's Evidence Requirement**:
> "I think one issue here that may not be an issue, but could be a just a challenge for you all to overcome is having a more visceral example or case study of success in this context... it would be great if you said, we have helped. You know, we are helping actively law students. And here's how."

### Checklist (Anthony De Silva): Home Inspection Technology

**Objective**: Connect with lenders and brokerages for partnership opportunities

**Video Workflow**: End-to-end customer journey
- Online booking process
- Inspector arrival and inspection
- AI transformation of lengthy PDFs into actionable reports
- Fannie Mae integration for expedited appraisals
- Time and cost savings quantification ($1.5B annual industry savings potential)

**NSG's Passion Challenge**:
> "I want you to get... not. That's the wrong word. I'm trying to think of the right word? I asked, excited. But it's almost like this is your company and me like like you're you're here like, get these lenders and get these people to get connected like this is a huge opportunity."

**Specificity Requirements**:
> "When we hear those types of asks is that in our head we might have a connection, but because the Rolodex is usually massive, it's gonna be hard for us to narrow down. So you're gonna need to do some word play to get us to be inspired to like, take a step."

**Antoine's Relatability Framework**:
> "Make it real for me. So you say, for every single one of the people in the room. So I want you to think about the the person you you got your mortgage from... versus if you say Oh, my mortgage broker. Now I get it."

**Carlo's Hero Concept**:
> "Understanding. Who's your hero in the story... who is this hero? Who is this kind of like person? But now it really is. It was just like super powered right, and I think it's like characterizing them as much as possible."

### Optifab (Esmaeil Sadeghi): Manufacturing Quality Assurance

**Objective**: Manufacturing partnerships through problem awareness and solution demonstration

**High-Stakes Opening**: Real engine failure case study
> "Breaking news tonight, kind of like breaking news, basically down on the Denver area... this could have happened like to them. For instance, at some point. Fortunately not so. And this would be something that we build upon and, like our product, would be supporting removing some uncertainty in manufacturing of such parts in the future."

**Value Proposition Evolution**:

**Quality vs. Waste Messaging Debate**:

Meg Hall's Positioning Challenge:
> "Before. At least. when I pictured your guys problem you guys were solving. I thought it was more about reducing waste. This sounds like it's more like, you know. like 6 Qa. Or, you know, like the 6 like the 6, whatever it is, belt... is it reducing waste? Or is it increasing? Pre increasing the quality of your parts and reducing errors."

**Economic Impact Connection**:
> "The cost of this engine is 20 million dollars. So this flight was safely like landed afterwards... but it was lost of like 20 million dollars for for this engine to to replace."

**NSG's Evidence Requirement**:
> "Making sure you have the evidence to kind of tie what optifab does to actually addressing this issue in a legitimate way would be really important."

**Carlo's Timing Advantage**:
> "This year. There was like the highest amount of plane crashes ever. So it's like, you're you're literally the right moment to do this, and people are getting more worried about it than last year. There was all the Boeing scandals... people, I think, haven't been this worried about plane crashes since flying on a Concorde."

### Sales Play (Meg Hall): Sales Performance Platform

**Team Branding Strategy**: Visual cohesion through matching tracksuits with "Sales Play" branding

**Clear Value Proposition**: Help companies increase average deal size and win bigger deals

**Dual Audience Strategy**:
- **For Professionals**: Envision Sales Play helping their company; refer to sales teams if not directly involved
- **For Investors**: Demonstrate credibility as legitimate company with real customers and revenue (not "spammy AI robo caller")

**Asset Utilization**: 60-second demo video for website integration and ongoing marketing

## Universal Coaching Insights

### Narrative Cohesion Strategy

**The Three-Component Integration**:
> "Oftentimes what I've seen is that the demo might be different from the pitch which might be different from the QA. And that creates like a little bit of like fragmentation between them and the best thing you can do is like, set yourself up for the demo when you're doing the pitch."

### Video Production Prioritization

**NSG's Warning to Founders**:
> "In our experience where founders tend to get really tripped up and they get really stressed out towards the final week of program because they realize like they haven't finished their video. And then they're they're scrambling to get someone to help them finish it, and it gets really messy."

### Evidence-Based Credibility

**The Proof Requirement**: Every aspirational claim or pivot needs supporting evidence of capability and results.

**Case Study Development**: Moving beyond concept to demonstration through real customer success stories.

### Audience Targeting Precision

**NSG's Specificity Framework**:
> "You're gonna need to do some word play to get us to be inspired to like, take a step. So think of a call to action. Right? What QR. Code do we scan? What do we see in our head. How do we already immediately sort and go? Oh, I know someone that could be helpful to connect really with."

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Early Video Planning**: Avoid last-minute production scrambles through early storyboard development
2. **Evidence Collection**: Gather supporting data and case studies for all positioning claims
3. **Audience Precision**: Define specific connection targets rather than broad categories
4. **Narrative Testing**: Ensure story flows naturally between all three Demo Day components
5. **Authenticity Balance**: Combine aspirational vision with proven capabilities and real results

## Time Allocation Strategy

**Chloe's Framework**: Using the three Demo Day components strategically:
> "Here's something cool. Here's a pitch to give a bit more substance. Here's a Q&A to add the cherry on top with the understanding... builds up the education piece, I think, in the audience. Rather than kind of like word vomiting everything at once."

This comprehensive storyboard walkthrough session provided foundational guidance for SF25 companies to develop compelling, evidence-based Demo Day presentations that balance inspirational storytelling with practical business outcomes. The workshop emphasized the critical importance of early preparation, narrative cohesion, and audience-specific targeting to maximize Demo Day impact both during the event and through ongoing asset utilization.
