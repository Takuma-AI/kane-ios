1
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.700
Chloe Lannert: Hang on

2
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:04.879
Chloe Lannert: a ribbon.

3
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.440
Chloe Lannert: So

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.860
Chloe Lannert: good, awesome

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.569
Chloe Lannert: one of the phone number.

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.759
Chloe Lannert: I can just move this closer.

7
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.190
Chloe Lannert: I can. I can just project.

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.700
Chloe Lannert: I didn't turn on the whole thing.

9
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.960
Chloe Lannert: Okay, fancy a recording. Okay, beautiful. How are you all feeling about Demo Day?

10
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.090
Chloe Lannert: So this workshop is normally given by Anthony Alibra, the program manager at Dexter, Chicago.

11
00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:08.594
Chloe Lannert: He's a d 1 pitcher at Northwestern University, and he would give this talk based on his like very, very cool, athletic career. Well, he's a very cool guy. He's also

12
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.594
Chloe Lannert: he's also a very busy guy.

13
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:23.678
Chloe Lannert: and with apps closing for the next cohort he unfortunately couldn't make it. But luckily you brought me my qualifications.

14
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:47.230
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. I came with her seats I was on ski in high school, each 15 in a full suit at 6 Am. On a Saturday. I hated it. The schedule was crazy. I procrastinated relentlessly, but learned some really great last minute memorization techniques which you should ask me about later. And then, I did rowing. Is that how you do that?

15
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.609
Chloe Lannert: Voiceovers for everybody's videos? Yeah, yeah, this machine, the Npr voice

16
00:01:51.972 --> 00:02:06.169
Chloe Lannert: and then I I did rowing. So in those big, long rowing votes I was the short person in the back who steered the vote and yelled at everyone, it was my thing to the point of being both the title of my college essay and my Lc. Are both a big mouth.

17
00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:11.839
Chloe Lannert: My articles, Incorporation, Big Mouth, Llc. Delaware.

18
00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:39.850
Chloe Lannert: in high school I was set to go to Nationals. Covid ruined it colleges were paying to fly me out and visit their teams, and I was being recruited. Turned down some offers and C double a. And Ira regulations, and Covid messed up some others but I really really loved it, and was pretty good at it. In college I traveled all over the Uk Coxing, from Inverness to London, and I hosted the largest collegiata in Europe, which was flux.

19
00:02:40.500 --> 00:03:09.750
Chloe Lannert: and a rowing spring race is weirdly similar to y'all's Demo day pitches. There's money on the line. For me. It was a full set of a boat and ores which landed around $80,000. For you guys, potential investment money the whole situation is a team effort. But in the moment only one person is in charge. So the rowers can't see. I don't know if you can see the boats moving forward. I'm the only person who could see the course. And for you guys, you've only got one person on stage representing all of your work.

20
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.959
Chloe Lannert: and you have to communicate an enormous amount of information. And in an incredibly short amount of time.

21
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.229
Chloe Lannert: yeah, that's me. And what is this word

22
00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:28.284
Chloe Lannert: that boat was 16. Each of the oars was $500 each, and then you've got the rigors. Other fun stuff

23
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:38.740
Chloe Lannert: word. Oh, Coxen, yeah, that was my role. That's what it's called.

24
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.680
Chloe Lannert: and a row base is also conveniently right around 6Â min, and just like your pitches represents weeks, once years of work.

25
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.010
Chloe Lannert: So this is a thought exercise that Anthony likes to do. I'm going to have you all take a look at this picture. Find it in your head

26
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.780
Chloe Lannert: and then close your eyes.

27
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.690
Chloe Lannert: Little visualization thing here that we gave.

28
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.529
Chloe Lannert: I want you to imagine that you are in the block. 15 auditorium.

29
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.239
Chloe Lannert: You're sitting in the front row, and there's an empty seat next to you.

30
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.229
Chloe Lannert: Watch as the founder before you is just finishing their closing statement

31
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.379
Chloe Lannert: start to walk off the stage, and the music you chose comes on.

32
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.889
Chloe Lannert: I want you to hear it

33
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.450
Chloe Lannert: as you get up and start to walk on stage. You can hear the buzz and muttering of the over 300 people there to watch.

34
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.200
Chloe Lannert: As you walk into the spotlight in the dimly lit room.

35
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.110
Chloe Lannert: You reach your position, the music fades and the room goes silent.

36
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.790
Chloe Lannert: All eyes are directly on you.

37
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.480
Chloe Lannert: Game time.

38
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.819
Chloe Lannert: Alright! Open your eyes.

39
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.569
Chloe Lannert: What do you feel

40
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.340
Chloe Lannert: at zoom is

41
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.291
Chloe Lannert: the next one so excited? Yeah, so

42
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.950
Chloe Lannert: fear has some physical symptoms. Let's

43
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.370
Chloe Lannert: yep.

44
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.425
Chloe Lannert: What what do you physically feel when you're experiencing that fear that nervousness? Have you breathing?

45
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.220
Chloe Lannert: Benching?

46
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.263
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. Heat, like sweating. Yeah.

47
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:28.069
Chloe Lannert: yeah. Summat rooms. Yeah. Go to the next one. So all of these can be some symptoms, some physical symptoms that you're feeling in that moment

48
00:05:30.326 --> 00:05:31.800
Chloe Lannert: next slide.

49
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:43.679
Chloe Lannert: If you felt those things good, you should. Or if you're about, you're human, it's your body's stress response. When you're in a stressful situation, your body releases epinephrine, adrenaline and cortisol

50
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.760
Chloe Lannert: they release into your bloodstream, and they affect how you feel and how you operate.

51
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.039
Chloe Lannert: It's not just herbs. These hormones materially alter your physiological state

52
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:06.499
Chloe Lannert: stomach turning. That's your digestion, slowing down to conserve energy. That's breathing that's upping your oxygen intake and your accelerated heart rate. That's providing your muscles and brain with this extra oxygen

53
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.550
Chloe Lannert: sweating, cooling you off while you exert more energy.

54
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.509
Chloe Lannert: Why, stress response is primal.

55
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.990
Chloe Lannert: We evolved

56
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:26.249
Chloe Lannert: and we evolved these physiological responses.

57
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:56.050
Chloe Lannert: Good. So that's that's your body. Responding to threats, they prepare your body to. Sorry I had to. That's that's your fight or flight. If you weren't well equipped to run when you saw Bear back in back in the day wouldn't make it very far, and you wouldn't be able to pass along your genes, and I'm sure fight or flight is very familiar the same hormones that prepared you to run from a bear, also prepare you to fight for your food.

58
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.590
Chloe Lannert: The state of hormonal elevation is super super important.

59
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.870
Chloe Lannert: So let's go back to those symptoms.

60
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:14.890
Chloe Lannert: The way that you feel when you're anxious from a perceived threat is actually the same state that your body goes into when you feel excitement, just like our ancestors were scared to see bears. They were excited to see food, and they had to fight for it.

61
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:30.479
Chloe Lannert: When people say they're nervous for a big performance, or they had an adrenaline rush from an exciting activity. They rarely describe them in the same way, but physiologically they're almost entirely the same with the little added difference of dopamine.

62
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:40.439
Chloe Lannert: Well, it's not the most comfortable feeling your body. Stress response is kind of like a superpower. It prepares your body and mind to operate at a high level when you need it the most.

63
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:57.310
Chloe Lannert: So when you're in this height state you have a whole bunch of options. I'm gonna share with you from both me and Anthony. But it's important to pay attention to what works for your body and use the mental language that makes sense for you. Everyone's gonna be different.

64
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:08.539
Chloe Lannert: So here's what Anthony thinks about it when he's throwing a season deciding game. That's how he kind of prepares himself to go into the moment. He leads with self-understanding.

65
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:22.690
Chloe Lannert: So he like your body, is trying to protect you. It's that fight or flight response. Your body and mind are in a heightened state. There's that adrenaline and that cortisol, and he ends with redirection, focused and grounding

66
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.539
Chloe Lannert: your physiological state does not change your tasks, and you are prepared.

67
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:47.092
Chloe Lannert: So my approach is a little less polished. But it's important to show different variations of how people go into stressful situations, how I do it is probably best described as framing. But I, the mental language that works for me is self gaslighting. It's dumb, but it's how it makes sense for me.

68
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:56.749
Chloe Lannert: In some way I treat it like I'm smarter than my monkey brain, and just choose to put the thoughts I want over the thoughts that I have. It works for me.

69
00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:12.170
Chloe Lannert: for you. This could look like reframing pressure as preparedness. So instead of thinking, I've spent months or years working on this business, there's so much riding on this, treating it as pressure, you could try to reframe it. As I've spent months or years working with this on this business, I'm so excited to share it with the world.

70
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:36.240
Chloe Lannert: So for me, that super works. Another thing that really really works for me is visualization within that whole self gaslighting framework. The night before every race and like, for there's like 5 years straight. Every single race. I would sit down with my race plan for you like a script and a map of my race course, for you could be a picture of the stage like we just did in that thought exercise.

71
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:49.910
Chloe Lannert: and I would close my eyes and visualize the entire race, start to finish, and a 6Â min race could take me like 20 or 30Â min to visualize. It was a bit ridiculous, but just like the exercise we did earlier I would put myself at the starting line.

72
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:59.320
Chloe Lannert: I would think about everything I would hear. Everything, I would say everything would feel like the tension in my back, I would put myself in that situation

73
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:05.299
Chloe Lannert: and visualize the entire race through even to the feeling of relief as I cross the finish lines.

74
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:11.990
Chloe Lannert: So by the time I had gotten to the starting line I felt like I had already done the race like I'd already experienced it.

75
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:26.129
Chloe Lannert: and all the nervous energy was easily rechanneled into excitement for something that in my head had already happened. Self gas lighting. I highly recommend visualization. If you don't already do it, it turns all that uncertainty and pressure in your brain into a plan.

76
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.280
Chloe Lannert: But it's not perfect.

77
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.739
Chloe Lannert: My way of thinking about it may super not work for you, and Anthony's might not either.

78
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:40.320
Chloe Lannert: The goal in sharing room is to inspire you to consider how we approach stressful situations and maybe give you something to work from.

79
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:52.610
Chloe Lannert: Human stress. Responses aren't perfect, either. Our bodies are in need of sort of a software Update 1,000 years overdue. We don't face the same threats today as we used to, and we don't get excited by all the same things, either.

80
00:10:52.860 --> 00:11:00.449
Chloe Lannert: It turns out that the ideal state for running and fighting is not the same ideal state for public speaking or pitching to investors.

81
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:09.900
Chloe Lannert: How many cavemen had to clearly and effectively explain their go-to-market strategy while running from a pack of wolves. How many people had to think about pushing costum on their mobile? They were throwing spears at a year.

82
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.289
Chloe Lannert: So how do we adjust?

83
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:20.160
Chloe Lannert: How do we make the most of the benefits of this elevated state while minimizing the negatives? The worst thing to do is, try to fight it. Can't.

84
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:28.059
Chloe Lannert: The hormones are in your blood just like general and anesthesia, if you've ever had it. Tried to bite it like you just can't. It's there. It's in your body.

85
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:32.140
Chloe Lannert: The hormones are there, and they will work the way they're supposed to.

86
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:40.049
Chloe Lannert: and you don't want to trick yourself into not having this response either. If you're focused on getting rid of the anxiety you're not focused on the task at hand.

87
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.280
Chloe Lannert: So

88
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:51.869
Chloe Lannert: generally 2 camps people fall into when responding to stress. And it's important to know sort of which one you are. So you can learn how to attack it.

89
00:11:52.222 --> 00:12:07.449
Chloe Lannert: When faced with stress and anxiety. Some people are more prone to getting sped up. That's me. These people try to do and think about everything at once, thinking 10 steps ahead to try to be in control of the situation. On the other hand, others respond by shutting down.

90
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:14.390
Chloe Lannert: People often experience their minds going blank, a sort of freeze response, and they try to push away the anxiety and get rid of it.

91
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:23.929
Chloe Lannert: If you recognize your response, it can help you understand, when it's happening to you. And both both types of people can use similar strategies to help sort of reel themselves back in.

92
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:42.099
Chloe Lannert: Like I mentioned earlier. The biggest problem people run into is that they focus so much on their stress response that they get sped up or they freeze. And that's okay. And it's normal. But the goal is to pull yourself back into the moment. Take advantage of your mind's increased focus and lock in on the task at hand.

93
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.119
Chloe Lannert: Pull yourself back onto the next step you need to take.

94
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.530
Chloe Lannert: Here's 1 option. I probably can do it

95
00:12:48.314 --> 00:12:59.580
Chloe Lannert: breathing is critical. We hear it all the time, but there's more to it. Taking a deep breath all the way in, and all the way out, longer exhale than inhale, is a way to bring yourself into a calmer state.

96
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:06.729
Chloe Lannert: similar to the way that the stress hormones physioth theologically affect you. This also materially alters your body's safe.

97
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.720
Chloe Lannert: If you do it. Your body has no choice now.

98
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:22.200
Chloe Lannert: relaxing your muscles also does the same thing. You might need active or tense muscles to run from a bear, but you don't need them to pitch. I usually carry the tension in my shoulders. It really helps to like actively release.

99
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.329
Chloe Lannert: And it signals to my body that it's okay to relax.

100
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:35.410
Chloe Lannert: Finally, pull your focus back in like we were talking about earlier. Don't try to boil the ocean. Don't try to do 10 things at once, or answer all your Eir questions at the same time

101
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.969
Chloe Lannert: focus only on the next white-size step.

102
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:45.019
Chloe Lannert: For me it could be the next turn in the river for, you guys, it could be the next sentence of your pitch. Trust that your preparation will take you from there

103
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:56.380
Chloe Lannert: finally. Always remember that you are in control. Time isn't going to speed up on you, and it won't stop for you, either. You are in full control to dictate the pace as you see fit.

104
00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:03.270
Chloe Lannert: make sure to slow down. If you feel things are going too fast, and don't be afraid to take a pause. If you need some more time to think

105
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.050
Chloe Lannert: alright round 2.

106
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.739
Chloe Lannert: Close your eyes.

107
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.920
Chloe Lannert: Same thing again.

108
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.369
Chloe Lannert: I want you to imagine that you were in the block. 15 auditorium.

109
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.989
Chloe Lannert: You're sitting on the side of the stage, and he watches the founder before you is just finishing that closing statement

110
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.969
Chloe Lannert: as they start to walk off the stage and the music he chose comes on.

111
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:31.489
Chloe Lannert: Get to get up and start to walk on stage, and you can hear the but buzz and muttering of the 300 plus people there to watch.

112
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.320
Chloe Lannert: As you walk into the spotlight in the dimly lit room

113
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.830
Chloe Lannert: and reach your position. The music face and the room goes silent.

114
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.070
Chloe Lannert: All eyes are directly on you.

115
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.870
Chloe Lannert: Now take note and acknowledge your state.

116
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.779
Chloe Lannert: Place that thought on a shelf.

117
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.459
Chloe Lannert: and accept that your body is reacting normally

118
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.839
Chloe Lannert: take a slow, deep breath on your time

119
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.459
Chloe Lannert: like a shoulder straps.

120
00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.180
Chloe Lannert: Pull your focus onto the 1st sentence of your pitch.

121
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.900
Chloe Lannert: Okay, now it's game time.

122
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:17.509
Chloe Lannert: These mental reps are vital to training your body to perform under pressure. If any used to lay in bed at night and practice working himself up so he could calm himself back down. He doesn't recommend that for anyone who values good sleep.

123
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:23.769
Chloe Lannert: but the principle still applies for me that was covered by my full-race visualizations.

124
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:33.379
Chloe Lannert: just like you practice your pitch practice breathing and focus and anxiety, inducing situations. Even if they only exist in your head. It'll help you build this muscle like it's second nature

125
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.159
Chloe Lannert: game tons.

126
00:15:43.560 --> 00:16:06.830
Chloe Lannert: This workshop is usually by our our teammate in Texas, Chicago, who, like always, says d 1 pitcher, and he kind of made this based on psychology. And then, when he wasn't able to come, oh, it was like, Well, I know psychology. Does anybody have any questions about

127
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.480
Chloe Lannert: use this call

128
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.790
Chloe Lannert: at 6Â min we'll start. Find the next person something.

129
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:30.390
Chloe Lannert: So it's like at a time. It's important. We don't want to go all the way. And then people aren't going to be able to get there full time. So Q&A, that's sitting right? Yeah. So I guess to the time from you finishing, pitching, to sitting in the eir coming up.

130
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.590
Chloe Lannert: There's like a 10 second wiggle room pitch. I'll show you tomorrow in the dress, right.

131
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:49.629
Chloe Lannert: either, whether you're video or pitch. You go on stage during your welcome music. When your video is fine, you stand to the side and you watch it with everybody to increase engagement, and when you're pitching, whether it's 1st or second, you stand center stage.

132
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:55.369
Chloe Lannert: nothing's behind you, and then you walk over your work on stage, and you'll shake your hand, and then you sit.

133
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.000
Chloe Lannert: talk, show style, and 2 on tears.

134
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:09.579
Chloe Lannert: Other questions. Yeah, at the start of the pitch, do. We all kind of go on stage at the beginning. So we kind of.

135
00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:13.720
Chloe Lannert: we have a visualization of how everyone looks when stage

136
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:27.181
Chloe Lannert: you get a full dress run where you can see the venue. But you don't like not everyone is brought up at once. If that if that's regress.

137
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:37.324
Chloe Lannert: yeah, we have a mic.

138
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:47.340
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, do you have any to simply get derailed like our minds? And we're trying to take

139
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.210
Chloe Lannert: my, okay.

140
00:17:50.910 --> 00:18:01.759
Chloe Lannert: my favorite way to sort of work to prevent. That is, when I'm memorizing things like it's really easy to chunk it into the sentences and think about it. Sentence at a time.

141
00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:30.280
Chloe Lannert: But for me I would always get caught up between sentences and the way I would work around, that is, I would like memorize the sentences, and then practice having someone else read me the last 3 words of the sentence, and I needed to like speed, run to get to the next one, so I would like, do reps of those transitions between sentences until those like weren't as weak of points. I highly recommend, like, and do it out of order like memorize the transitions between sentences as much as you're memorizing the sentences

142
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:40.170
Chloe Lannert: themselves for the pitch that has saved me. But as far as getting derailed, Neil will be in the front row. Liliana will be just off to the side.

143
00:18:40.448 --> 00:19:05.549
Chloe Lannert: Take a breather. It's like every pause you feel on stage is a fraction of a second to the audience like you. You will feel like you're up there like for 15Â min, just like if you if you pause and it will be 2 seconds for the audience. So just don't freak out I like to physically imagine my script in front of me again with the visualization like. I will imagine the piece of paper that my script is on, and I will like find my place.

144
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:29.230
Chloe Lannert: It might not work for you. But just don't panic. No one else perceives it as nearly as big of a pause as you will the same thing actors do. So you memorize your queue for the next segment or sentence, like the last 2 to 3 words of this section before, so that you know what you just said, and you can always sign your place for the next part.

145
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.540
Chloe Lannert: and then, when you lose your place, just take a breath.

146
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:55.559
Chloe Lannert: A lot of you in our pitch practices. When you lose your place you like freak out. You don't want the audience to know, none of us know. So just pause and take a breath, and honestly, it's more alluring because it looks like you're taking a dramatic pause. And everyone's really listening. I promise you we've seen people do it. It looks like you have full command of the stage. It's totally fine, but if you freak out when you lose your place, then everyone will know.

147
00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:03.989
Chloe Lannert: Just remain your like. Keep your composure practice losing your place like in practice. If you lose your place, don't just look at your steps. Pause and breathe

148
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:10.160
Chloe Lannert: like, Chloe said. It's only like a fraction of a second. You won't even see it on the recording, even though it'll feel like forever

149
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.480
Chloe Lannert: other questions for Chloe.

150
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:27.182
Chloe Lannert: You guys missed the the picture, and 1st sorry we recorded it for you. So the QA. Section is a little bit more relaxed because, like, you're biting like physically sitting. So you have more time to concentrate

151
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:49.788
Chloe Lannert: absolutely, and your eir has the ipad with your questions on it, and your eir will kind of clue you back in. If you get lost like they can give you more context clues. You can work with them to write your questions in a way so like, say, you have a question about your go to market strategy, and they're like 3 points. You wanna hit your eir can have like they can

152
00:20:50.328 --> 00:21:11.360
Chloe Lannert: the next one. So say you get through 2 of the points, and you haven't hit the 3rd one. If you practice with your eir, and like kind of let them know that this tends. This transition to the 3rd point tends to be a weak point. They can have, like a little phrase, where they can sort of add a little bonus question where they're like. Oh, so what about this? And like? Give you the chance to finish your thought? The the QA.

153
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:17.380
Chloe Lannert: You also have the questions to like signal. What's next? It's you'll you'll be good in the er a bit

154
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:18.859
Chloe Lannert: on your left.

155
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:38.750
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, where are the rest of us sitting?

156
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:49.760
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So Ceos in the front row, co-founders behind them. 1, st 2 rows will be just like our team and the presenters.

157
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:57.129
Chloe Lannert: So you'll be rotating through. You'll get to watch everyone. You'll understand where you are. You're not in a green room in the dark. You get to experience the event as well.

158
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:11.260
Chloe Lannert: It's always like that. It's not like we're not going to an auditorium with like a big state. There's no vaccine.

159
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:37.299
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, you might want to announce when addressers. Yeah, let's take a look. Yeah. Team 4, 9 to 1130 team, starboard, 11 to 1, 30 dress runs. Be there.

160
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.800
Chloe Lannert: you ready

161
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.570
Chloe Lannert: any other questions?

162
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.960
Chloe Lannert: That's awesome. Okay? Good job, really? Well.

163
00:22:54.616 --> 00:22:56.319
Chloe Lannert: so we are going.
