### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Chloe Lannert: So my approach is a little less polished. But it's important to show different variations of how people go into stressful situations, how I do it is probably best described as framing. But I, the mental language that works for me is self gaslighting. It's dumb, but it's how it makes sense for me.
- Chloe Lannert: So for me, that super works. Another thing that really really works for me is visualization within that whole self gaslighting framework. The night before every race and like, for there's like 5 years straight. Every single race. I would sit down with my race plan for you like a script and a map of my race course, for you could be a picture of the stage like we just did in that thought exercise.
- Chloe Lannert: The goal in sharing room is to inspire you to consider how we approach stressful situations and maybe give you something to work from.
