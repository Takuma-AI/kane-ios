## Speaker Background

Mike Rome brings 15+ years of trial-and-error experience scaling venture-backed companies. He runs two companies:
- **Moonwater**: Startup advisory and fractional CMO work
- **Lightbulb.run**: Technical growth and paid acquisition for companies in the "messy middle" ($5M-$75M revenue)

His partner at Lightbulb, Robbie, previously started, scaled, and sold a venture-backed Techstars company.

## Core Philosophy: Principles Over Tactics

"One of the hardest things about startups is, it's so easy to be busy. But busy doesn't mean anything at all. You really want to think through: how do you figure out the power law for your startup at this time? The small subset of things that are going to yield the most outputs."

## The Seven Growth Principles

### 1. Growth is Optional

Mike challenges conventional thinking: "Growing something new is really difficult... But if you can make peace with the challenge and communicate this to your team culturally - this is going to be hard, there's going to be lots of setbacks, we're gonna constantly get punched in the face."

**Key Insight:** "When I think about the startups that I've been part of that have failed... it's because you kind of lose your way around these guideposts."

### 2. Founders Make Startups Take Off

Quoting Paul Graham: "Startups don't take off. Founders make them take off."

Mike emphasizes the balance between hard and soft skills:
- **Hard skills**: Math, data, acquisition channels, frameworks
- **Soft skills**: Building culture, resilience, team dynamics

"The soft skills of growth are just as important... building a culture that's tough and expects hard things and isn't afraid to get really, a group of people who pick each other up when everyone's down."

### 3. Do Things That Don't Scale

**Classic Examples:**
- **Instacart**: Founder delivered orders via Uber to MVP the idea
- **Pinterest**: Ben Silbermann changed Apple Store browsers' homepages to Pinterest, then did user testing in-store
- **Airbnb**: Founders manually photographed NYC apartments, discovering that professional photography was crucial for trust

"If they were focused just on scaling instead of sheer grit and willing things into existence, they wouldn't have figured out these incredible insights."

### 4. Sustainable Growth = Scale + Unit Economics

"There's kind of 3 things that matter if you're trying to build a durable business:
1. Customer acquisition
2. Retention  
3. Margins

And customer acquisition is the easiest of the 3."

**Warning:** "Paid acquisition is kind of like a drug... It was really easy to get hooked on acquisition and keep saying 'we'll figure out retention, we'll figure out margins.'"

## The Growth Accounting Framework

Mike introduces a powerful diagnostic tool from Social Capital's diligence process.

### Three Types of Customers (Monthly View):
1. **New**: First-time users this month
2. **Reactivated**: Used this month, didn't use last month, but used before
3. **Retained**: Used both this month and last month

### The Tale of Two Companies

Both growing at 10% month-over-month, but with vastly different health:

**Company A (Unhealthy)**:
- For every 1.1 customers gained, losing 1 to churn
- Growth driven primarily by new acquisition
- "Leaky bucket" - not ready to scale

**Company B (Healthy)**:
- For every 1.7 customers gained, losing 1 to churn
- Growth driven by retained customers
- Ready to invest in scaling

**Critical Insight:** "You're not ready to scale. You should be talking to as many users as possible to figure out why they're coming in and why they're not sticking around."

## Hiring Philosophy

### Hire People Better Than You

"The startups that aren't afraid to hire the best people in the room... I would go into the room and be like, 'Oh, I'm the dumbest person in this room,' and that's kind of a tough pill to swallow in the early days. But... a team is everything."

### Diverse Team, Similar Worldview

"You want a diverse group of people with a similar worldview... various experiences, all of that stuff is great, different levels of experience and expertise. But there's some of these things where if you believe sustainable growth is about not just scaling but also being really mindful of profitability... you want to hire someone who believes that too."

## Stage-Appropriate Marketing

### Key Distinction:
- **Validation Stage**: Use marketing to get enough users to test retention
- **Scaling Stage**: Only after proven retention, invest in growth channels

"If you're still trying to figure out if you built something enough people want and it's retaining, you only want to spend money on customer acquisition to get enough people in the funnel to figure out: are people sticking around? You're not trying to scale yet."

## Information Diet Philosophy

"Find 5 to 10 people that you think are really thoughtful, and you believe in their worldview... Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, doesn't have to be startup people... and just really study what they're saying, instead of having this fire hose of Twitter information from whoever's screaming the loudest."

Mike's recommended thinkers include:
- Paul Graham
- Bill Gurley (especially his "Invest Like the Best" podcast)
- The Social Capital diligence framework authors

## Practical Takeaways

1. **Measure the right things**: Don't just track top-line growth - decompose it
2. **Sequence matters**: Product-market fit → Retention → Scale → Optimize margins
3. **Culture equals strategy**: Build a team that can handle the emotional journey
4. **Do the work yourself first**: "Bleed before you hire" to truly understand what you need
5. **Quality over quantity**: In hiring, information sources, and growth metrics

## Q&A Insights

When asked about showing growth accounting to investors, Mike emphasizes monthly cohort analysis: "I like doing this over a monthly basis... any new customers in that month are a separate line. If they stay, they become retained. If they're a lost customer and come back, they're reactivated."

## The Meta-Message

Growth isn't just about acquisition tactics or clever hacks. It's about building a sustainable system where founders, teams, and metrics align to create compounding value. The companies that win aren't necessarily the ones that grow fastest, but the ones that grow most thoughtfully.

As Mike puts it: "Growth is optional. It's a choice... if you run the right motion and you survive long enough, eventually you'll figure it out."
