WEBVTT

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Alright, hello everyone. We have several, I think 8 or so classes, joining this call.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm David Cohen. We haven't met already. Hi. Oh cool. I like Boston. I see that people are together.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's always nice. As we wait for people to join. You're probably used to this by now.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Go ahead and warm up. Your fingers or Whatever and use the chat and tell me where you are in the world right now.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm always curious to see where people physically are. Thanks for doing that. And then we're just gonna get people a minute or 2 to join and we'll get started.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Yeah, and I'm in, Boulder, Colorado. U.S.A, Earth, Milky Way.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
That's what I like to put. I don't know the rest. If you guys, somebody out there may now.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I just counted their 9 classes joining, so we're gonna, you know.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
100 plus people on the call. We have a few volunteers that have stuck their hand up in advance.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
To help with this workshop. And just to give you context, so if you don't know or don't remember, I'm 1 of the founders of Techstars itself.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So very meta. I always love seeing all the founders that we work with because As you probably know, there have been over 4,000 companies.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And I've talked to all of them about this topic that we're going to talk about today.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Over the last 17 years and I've tried to make this talk better. And more useful over the last 17 years.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Got a lot of feedback on it over the years and tweaked it to adapt to market conditions and it's something that only tech stars companies hear.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I don't really share the same way of thinking about the world of fundraising with others that I do.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
With you all. So.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
They're recording.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Let's see, I got a mute one person there. Okay. If you're not on mute, please, please do stand mute with so many people on the call.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's helpful. So I've been doing this this talk, in this workshop, which is interactive.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Everybody participates. For a long time and I have 2 very simple goals to try to accomplish with you all today.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000
One is I wanna teach you. A way of thinking about fundraising strategically that is maybe different.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Then what the conventional wisdom is or what you might hear from others. It's so that you can decide whether or not you want to use all of it pieces of it.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I wanna make sure you understand how I think about fundraising. Especially in the context of being a tech stars company, which is a unique, it's a different position.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
You're in a network, you've got lots of resources. That can help. It's also challenged sometimes as you're finding out.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So I want to make sure you learned that strategy that's thing one and I wanna make sure thing 2 that I.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
That I teach you a few communication skills that I think are super valuable in the context of fundraising.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Okay, so those are the 2 takeaways I want you to get. We can sit here and talk for an hour and a half about every question under the sun for fundraising and an open Q&A format.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We're not going to do that. We're going to accomplish those 2 goals. You have lots of mentors to help you with your specific questions.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I'm also happy to help with that offline but that's the focus of today cool Good.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We're gonna do it through role play. Some people are gonna come up on stage with me and do some role play.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We're gonna do it through polls. We're gonna do it through the chat. Everybody's gonna participate.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
People who have listened to this talk have raised 25 billion dollars.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Okay and venture capital so It's on average much more than a startup would raise if you multiply it by the people who've listened to this talk.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So I think there's some really useful stuff in here that can make you better fundraisers.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And I hope that. You can. Spend disbelief a little bit as you go through because some of what I'm going to say again is not conventional wisdom.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
It's a little counterintuitive and it all kind of comes together when you really think about it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So with that, let's get started. I like to talk about before we do the 1st role play.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I like to talk about the 2 big killers. In fundraising. These are the 2 things that I see kill more deals more fundraising efforts than anything else.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The number one mistake that I see. Most commonly the kills fundraising deals is the over ask.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Just ask for too much money. Expectations in exceeding them. Are really important in the context of fundraising.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So when you say, I'm raising 5 million dollars. You set an expectation. Up here. If you raise 4.5 million dollars, you're a failure.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That's what you're telling me. Okay? If you raise 4.7 million dollars, failed.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
You didn't do what you said you were going to do. Cause you told me you're gonna raise 5 million.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I wanna work with people who do what they tell me they're what they're gonna do. And in fact, I like to work with people who do more than they tell me they're going to do.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:50.000
That's human nature, right? So I've seen a lot of data points. I've seen 4,000 companies raise, I don't know, 20,000 rounds.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
They were all just like you. They all started just like this. Right? So that's the data that's really relevant.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000
What do i see in that data It's very clear that when Companies make an ask up here and they only get commitments below that.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The most common outcome.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Is that they don't raise any money.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The most common outcome is not that they raise Less. It's that they don't raise.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Anything. And I want to let that sink in for a minute. Think about the people you know that have raised money.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Some of you ever use money think about the people you know that have raised money and for their startups Are they out telling everyone?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
I had this awesome fundraising round. It was amazing. It was under-subscribed.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:53.000
We were, we were awesome. No, they're out telling everyone. About their oversubscribe.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And they manage that because they're good fundraisers. They managed it by asking for less.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
They managed it by getting oversubscribed. They managed it with intention. They let the market push them up.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
They didn't set an expectation that they didn't meet. And then have to explain to everyone why they didn't meet it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And if they did close any money when they were under subscribed. The terms were much worse than they were expecting.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Versus if they're oversubscribed, the terms probably better than they were expecting. So the overask is the biggest killer in fundraiser. How do you avoid it?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
You ask for an amount of money you're confident you can raise.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Don't ask for an amount of money you're not confident you can raise. Be confident about the amount you asked for.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Let the market push you up. Get oversubscribed, then decide to raise more. Positive dynamic, good for everyone.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Good for you. Good for your price. Good for the investors who've already committed because it's a hot deal.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Good for everyone. So that's the big 1st killer in fundraising is the over ask.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I don't have a formula for you. But if you're not confident, it's too high.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Alright, second big killer in fundraising. We're all marketers, but we should not be liars and we should not be extreme exaggerators especially in a network like this, that type of news travels really quickly.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I'll skip the story, I usually tell, cause I want to get into the role play, but stick to the truth stay away from the bright red line of being a liar none of you are liars we screen for that y'all are honest people your well-intentioned people but we're all marketers I'm a marketer too.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Right. I mean, you're all sitting in tech stars. You probably saw a video of me somewhere or my brand somewhere, tech stars.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I'm 1 of the founders, right? Is the reality exactly like the advertisement? Probably not.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But in no time will we ever intentionally get anywhere near that bright line and you should not either because that news travels really quickly and no one wants to work with people who are unethical or Position extremely.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I am going to tell you one quick story. The extreme positioning story so companies stood up on stage in demo day.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
They said, we got this great new hardware device. It was in the early days of Uber. And they said, we have a deal with Uber and, you know, it's gonna be in every Uber.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It's really cool. Well, the truth was it's gonna be in every Uber in Chicago.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Well, actually, it's only gonna be in 2 in Chicago, but they like to put it in every Uber and Chicago.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:40.000
This was extreme overpositioning Travis Colonic jumped on check crunch write an article said not true that company never raised any money even though they had a really cool product They weren't clear about, yeah, we're just piloting it with Uber, right?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
They were trying to make that the story and it backfired on them because news travels really quickly around the network like this.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So those are the 2 big killers. There are others, but those are the ones I've seen kill a lot of deals.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Too much marketing, too much extreme overpositioning and the over ask. Alright. I wanna see if Max is out there.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Max has volunteered to, hang out with me here on stage and in order to find you, I either need to raise your hand virtually or come off Mike and just say hello.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Hello. Yes, there we go.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Or both. There it is. Hey, how's it going? How are you?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Doing well, how are you?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
I'm good. I'm showing you to everyone around the world. Is that okay with you?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Little intimidating, but yeah, it's fun.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Yeah, well don't worry, I'm gonna join you, on stage, so here's me as well.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So you and I are gonna do a little role play together. Where are you physically located today, Max?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Just outside of Portland, Oregon.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Nice. Alright. Cool spot. So, what we're gonna do is learn by doing and there is no right answer and no wrong answer.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000
I got your name from our ops team. We haven't talked one on one or prepared for this in any way just so people know and that's part of the beauty of it because we just kind of see where it goes.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Everyone is going to participate. So while Mi and Max are here on stage. What everyone else is gonna do.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Is use the chat and if you're in a room Maybe someone could use the chat in that room to sort of represent things that people in the room are saying.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
But what I'm looking for is a stream of consciousness as you watch this role play. So I would love to see.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Comments like I love how Max did that, you know, or I love how Max tried to, you know, get David to pay attention when he was checking his email or whatever.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Positive. Negative, I think Max could do this better. David's being a jerk.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:49.000
That's totally fine. You know, this is a role play, right? So what I love to have is a stream of confidence, a stream of consciousness about what you observe between the 2 of us as we're doing this role play.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Okay, can everybody help me with that? Great, and we'll come back and have talk about those things.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Okay.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Max, you're gonna ignore that completely. Do not look at the chat. It's going to be gone a million miles an hour.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Okay, so you want to ignore that. And you want to be right here with me, in Boulder, Colorado to Portland, Oregon.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Okay. I'm gonna be an investor. And you're going to be an entrepreneur.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You're gonna be an entrepreneur with a company called epicurate that i know really well okay so you can assume I'm very up to speed.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Because what we want to make this role play about is getting me to commit to invest. Not teaching me what the company is all about, right?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So assume I already know all that. And what we wanna do is we want to have a conversation where your goal of the having the conversation is to get me to commit to invest.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Okay, but again, I'm familiar with the company like we can just sort of jump into that like we've talked a lot right we have familiar with each other so we're having our in conversation not our 1st one.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And you don't, you know, it's not gonna be pitching me, it's just gonna be talking about, hey, you know.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Let's get this done, right? And I'm gonna use. One little constraint.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:14.000
That will place on you. Just a little thing, which is that you have nobody committed yet.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Okay.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Okay, so why do I do that? It's not just to be annoying. It's, it's the thing I'm trying to teach.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And thank you, by the way, for jumping up because it's I know it's a little bit we're gonna have fun don't worry.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I promise we're gonna fun. I'm super helpful to sort of just be yourself and people will learn from the conversation in the context of what i wanna teach here So thank you, but you have nobody committed.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So anybody's raised money before knows that the 1st commitments are the hardest. And that once you're mostly committed or oversubscribed things get a lot easier, right?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So we're sort of purposely making it about getting your 1st commitment. Okay, makes sense.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Yes.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
That's it. That's the role play. I'm an investor. You're an entrepreneur.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:08.000
We know each other already. I'm pretty familiar with the company. You're interested in having me commit that's the goal of this conversation.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
No questions.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Right.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But you have nobody committed yet. Okay, good to go. Great, let's jump in and at some point I'm gonna go like this and we're just gonna stop talking and we're gonna look at the comments.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Kind of talk about what's going on, but try to stay in character with me until I do this awkward and annoying and rude thing, okay?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Okay.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I'll start. Ready? Max, great to see you again. How's it going?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
That's great. Great to see you as well. Going well.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Good, good. I've been reading the updates. I'm really psyched about, how it's gone. So, on all the progress.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I know it's early, but, feels like it's really interesting.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Thanks. Yeah, we're really excited as well.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Good. Well, how can I be helpful today?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Well, I wanted to know if you had any questions about, about the platform. You know, what, excited you about the pitch or sorry about the updates.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
No, I mean, I've been playing around with the demo and watching the videos you've been sending and I feel pretty up to speed.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It's an exciting opportunity. I've loved working with you. It's been a lot of fun.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Awesome. We're making some really, exciting progress on, on the country. Front.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:34.000
We've, really been, Seeing a lot of great feedback from guests as we're trying out that you know the ability to just talk to a concierge and book.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So that's been great. Our partners, you know, are, just kind of lined up.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:47.000
We, you know, as we've been struggling with our. Constraint is onboarding new partners and onboarding vendors. I mean, the demand there.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Sure.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So, you know, we're just trying to figure out how to do that as, as efficiently as possible.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Makes sense? Makes sense? Anything I can do to help with any of that? Let me know.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Absolutely. Yeah.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I'm hopefully those introductions I made a few potential customers were useful. Good.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Great.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
You seem to be thinking about something, Max.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So yeah, I'm trying to think about, you know, what

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:35.000
What we need at this point is, really to, you know, to bring on the resources to capture this opportunity that we have and we've got all these all these travel partners.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Sure.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:53.000
We've got all these chefs but we're just we're struggling with how to bring them on how to get them you know so that their clients can book through us you know so we're really working we've got an awesome team but it's just

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Yeah, it's just a matter of bringing on those people to make sure that we, that we can really, you know, position ourselves as the best in market to.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Cool. Yeah, I actually know a few people that would actually maybe be interested in opportunity to join your team.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I'm happy to make a couple introductions there as well.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Awesome. Okay. What we really need is, you know, we're doing our 1 million dollar raise.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Okay, the 1 million. Got it.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Okay.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And so Yeah, we're trying to raise a million dollars. And the idea is that we have, we have 5 partnerships, that are all waiting to come on board and, you know, the partnership that we already have with once day we're doing, about $5,000 a month in revenue with them.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Just launched a couple of months ago and we think that each of these partners that are coming. Are waiting to get on board can do at least that.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
So yeah, we're targeting that within, within 2 years we should be doing about a hundred $1,000 per partner.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:59.000
In revenue. So, You know, we've got about 4 partners a year that we wanna bring on.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
So in 2 years, there should be 8 partners. Clear in the 2 we already have would be 10 partners.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000
So, yeah, good. You know, nice opportunity for about a million dollars in a month in MRR.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
That's exciting. It's exciting for sure.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And that's just for the private shop. We launch our, before we launch the concierge service.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So. Yeah.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Cool, let's stop and talk for a second outside the role play. The overriding, comment that I see in the chat is Ask him for money.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Okay.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Basically. And I agree strongly with that. And I also want to point out that this is a human endeavor and it's it's hard to do that.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
You know, we haven't really spent a lot of time together. We in real life, but you know, in the role play we have.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And. You know, I'll just point out something. That I think a lot of people are basically saying in the chat is nobody's asked me to invest and so the strategy I want to teach you, while it feels obvious.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
The 1st step in the strategy and, and the thing to write down if you're taking notes is is make an ask.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And do that sooner than you think. Other people were saying like there's buying signs from David like he's sort of saying yeah we're really excited about what you're doing and it's been great working with you and You know, yeah, it's a big opportunity.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:38.000
They're hearing those things. And so there's sort of interest being expressed generally. But step one of the strategy is to make a clear and direct ask.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
For a specific amount of money to be committed. Today. Now. And here.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Those are great words today. Now. And here. Because what ends up happening in these conversations is, you know, I'm very familiar with this is it's a little awkward, it's a little hard, it's a little, it creates anxiety to just walk in and say, hey, David, can I count on your commitment for a hundred $1,000 today?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Which is what needs to happen. That's that 1st step. How do you get to the $100,000?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000
You have a conversation, right? Or you do some research. You figure out how much does this investor typically invest.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
If you're feeling a bit unsafe. You say things like. On a scale of one to 10, how excited are you about investing in my company?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
David?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And David will say 6. Which you will then, because you're having this workshop, you will then add 2 to it.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:43.000
And you'll hear, because everyone hedges right on the investor side they're not gonna share their excitement So you get a 6 or 7 there ready to invest.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000
They're pretty close to the finish line. You should be asking them because that's really an 8 or a 9 when you add 2.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:03.000
So a great question to you is to make yourself feel a little safer. And be able to make this ask and use step one in the strategy, which is to make a clear and specific ask for a specific amount of money using words like here now and today.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Right. Hey David, on a scale of one to 10, how excited about investing in the company? If you get a 6, which is really an 8 or higher, you need to ask.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
If you get a 5. You might wanna ask. That's really a 7, that's pretty good.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
And the reason for asking is not because you're sure they're going to say yes. The reason for asking is to change the tenor of the conversation.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Because this conversation is about a hypothetical future.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:42.000
You know what I saw someone say in the in the chat way back was you should say something like, you know, would you be what would you need to see to be able to invest?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Please don't do that. Instead use step one in the strategy. Sooner than you think, make a clear and specific ask.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:01.000
A specific amount of money. Here, now and today to be committed. Why don't you say, well, what can I do to move the ball down the field or how can I get you more comfortable?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Cause I'm really, really good at giving you homework. That's why.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Anybody out there ever experienced that an investor giving you homework? Come back to me when you have a lead investor.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
I'd like to see your roadmap. I gotta talk to my partners. Let's talk next week.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I mean. I got a million of them. They're all the old hits. Okay, so.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000
The 1st step in the strategy when you say, hey David, can I count on your commitment today for a hundred $1,000?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
You change the tenor of the conversation. If you don't do that, you're talking about a hypothetical future and you allow me to stall.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:46.000
You allow me to win. Why is it winning for me? I'm gonna tell you, Max, I'm gonna say thank you.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
You too.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
I got a bunch of people trying to volunteer. You did awesome. Thanks for coming up on stage and come back to the next person just a moment.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Appreciate it.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Max, you're great. Okay. Now, what's wrong with talking about hypothetical futures?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
I don't know, let's, jump over to a dating analogy, shall we?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Dating is also awkward. It's awkward to ask somebody on a date.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Anyone here ever been on a date? 1, 2, couple of you. Okay. I would think it was more.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
It's awkward. It's weird. It creates anxiety.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
So we say things like, we should hang out again sometime. Any other person says, yes, sounds great.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:35.000
But there's no date happening. Yeah, instead if the person says, will you go with me, on Tuesday night at 7 pm on a date to the olive garden.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Clear specific direct specific. It's about a thing. Not a hypothetical future where I can sort of take a free option and say, well, yeah, yeah, sounds great.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:53.000
And then keep learning more about you. But I face changing. Reaction-inducing question.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
You asked me another date. And now I have to answer the question.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Right? I mean, maybe the answer is. And Jack, you'll get this. Maybe the answer is I don't like the Olive Garden.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:16.000
In which case you know you're talking to a lunatic. Or, maybe the answer is I'm busy Tuesday night.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:24.000
We might figure out how to solve that problem. Or the answer might be no, I'm married and I don't go on dates with people, but thanks for asking.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Okay. I know what to do with that also. Right? And now is useful.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Okay, saves my time. Allows me to talk to other people and. I don't wanna take that analogy too far.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
But it's, there's a lot of analogies, a lot of similarities there.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
So step one, when you make that clear and specific ask, you will see their face change.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:57.000
If you do it right, you'll literally see that. Okay, and they're thinking to themselves I've got to answer this question And more than likely their answer is going to be now.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And they're going to give you a reason. Why the answer is no. No, because. Now, what I like to point out about this Reaction-inducing question.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:20.000
And asking it sooner than. You think you should. Is that? That's the 1st time the shit gets real.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Because when you're talking about hypothetical futures, we should hang out sometime. Yeah, that'd be great.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
You know, you give me the ability as an investor to take a free option. How do I take a free option?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000
What is a free option and why do investors want it? Let's get into the mind of the investor.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Some of you said things like this as we were talking here. In the mind of the investor is I want a free option.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I want to pay 0. For the option to invest later.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Pretty good economic deal, right? For that investor. If you were an investor, and some of you are, You would have the same mindset not because you're a jerk not because you're evil but because it makes sense Okay, so understand where the investor is coming from.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Time.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Is knowledge. Time is power.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Right? I have more information? More knowledge. I feel safer tomorrow than I do today.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Why should I commit today when I can commit tomorrow? Why should I commit tomorrow when I can commit next week?

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Why should I commit next week? When I can commit next month. Not evil, totally normal.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Someone asked you out on a date. Sure, sounds great. Let's talk more. Let me get to know you more.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Let's hang out here in this bar where I feel safe before we say yes to a date. Free option.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Totally normal, right? How do you break out of that? This is the stalling you feel from investors when you talk to them.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:10.000
How do you break out of that? You use step one in the strategy and you make them answer the question, probably with the word no, followed by the actual reason why they're not ready to commit.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000
If you talk about hypothetical futures, how interested are you? Oh, I'm really interested. Free option.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Oh, I think this is super exciting, but please come back to me when you have a lead investor.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000
3 option. They went. But when you say, well you commit a quarter 1 million dollars today? David?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:49.000
And you say today, now here. Their face changes and they say, I'm not ready to commit yet because I don't know what the terms are or because you know I I don't know who's gonna be on your board or because you know I'm worried you're not gonna raise the 1 million dollars that you're talking about.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000
It forces them to address the reason why they're not ready to commit. And to tell you, and that tends to be the real reason.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
But when you're talking about hypothetical futures, They tend to just give you homework. Send me the roadmap.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
I want to talk to fear your customers. We gotta have a partner meeting next month. Our investment committee doesn't meet for a while.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:18.000
You've heard all these things before, if you've ever tried to raise money. Exactly right But not because they're evil people, because time is money.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Time is power, time is knowledge. Free option is what investors are trying to take this question. Break breaks you out of that pattern.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
I'm going to bring up another volunteer. It's gonna be, let's see.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Gab or are you out there? In Boston, in Boston. Cool.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Hmm, yep, Boston.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Yeah, I just gotta find you. It takes me a second to find you. Keep keep your hand up or keep talking.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Are you in the room there?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Yeah, I'm the guy with the Red Sox.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
I gotcha. You and me, how are you doing? Are you in Boston?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Good. Yeah, literally. Yep. Well, in my house.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Awesome. Cool. Cool. Did you watch the 1st role play?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Yeah, I got work fine, yeah.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Is it Gab or? Is that how I say this? Cool, awesome. Nice to meet you.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Sure.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:19.000
So we're gonna do the same role play. But this time you know that it's important to use step one in the strategy.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
You know that rather than having a hypothetical future conversation, we need to turn it into a now and hear conversation.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:33.000
And you need to ask me to commit a specific. Of money today. And you know you want to do that sooner than you think.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Especially when an investor is showing buying signs and interest, right? And then we're gonna learn what happens from there like everybody watching is now going to see my face change when you do that because it just happens you don't even try to make it happen.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000
It's like oh crap I'm being asked to commit to something. You're gonna get my answer and we're gonna see what we do with it.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Got it.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Same situation, we know each other. I know your company really well. You have nobody committed.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Got it.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Cool, let's jump in. Gabr, good to see you again. Spent a few minutes.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Nice to see you again Dave.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
How can I, how can I be helpful today?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Well, you know, we're going through the tech stars program in Boston. We're about halfway through as you know.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Yeah. I've heard of it.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Cool.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Yeah, so, you know, we're getting ready for demo day. And we're starting to think about the resources that we need to actually execute on the list of 20 pilot sites that we have in the queue.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Right big opportunity

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:44.000
They are and so you know I just want to follow up with you and just check how How do you see the company at this point?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Super exciting. I think it's a huge opportunity. I talked to my partners about it on Monday.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
We spent probably half an hour talking about it. I think it's really cool. Love working with you.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
It's been really exciting.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
A half an hour.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Yeah, I know it's forever in, in, you know, VC time, right? Like half an hour.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Well, if you had to score the opportunity, I know if you have a scoring system as part of your diligence team, but How would you rental?

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:16.000
I mean, it's obviously really risky at early stage, but I mean, as startups go, I'd say we're pretty excited, like maybe a 6 or 7.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Okay. Well, you know, that sounds pretty good to me. You know, like I said, you know, our number one milestone right now is to take those lists of 20 pilots.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Yeah.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000
And select 5 of them. And so, ify our product features. And hit certain financial milestones and so What we're thinking is, We need resources today.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Worse. Yeah.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
And I'm looking for a hundred $1,000 commitment. From you today, Dave, to help us.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Grow these pilot sites. From Freemium, 6 day fragments to paid pilots. Between now and December.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Because we have another 15 opportunities to pull down in the pipeline, which we can't actually execute against because we don't have enough cash after like next stars.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Yeah, no, I like totally make sense that you would raise around

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
So can we count on you on a hundred $1,000? We're essentially thinking about doing a 250,000 safe right now.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Okay.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
That's so we can show some traction from the 5 pilots because we're their revenue right now.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:40.000
So we think we can deliver more value to the early investors on this safe. By bringing them early, showing tracks in for the next 6 months and then raising a larger seed round of a million in q 1 of next year.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Okay, quick time out. You're doing great. I wanna take quick time out and wanna make an observation.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Which is you've used the strategy that I gave you twice. You did a very good job of saying David can accounting a hundred $1,000 commitment today And then you talked a lot more.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Yeah.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
And then you did it again and then you talked a lot more. I'll modify my step one.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
You gotta make the ask and then stop.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Because what you're doing is you keep talking and I'm using that as a way to sort of just, you know.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
So yeah, it makes sense you would raise money. Like I'm trying not to answer the question.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Yeah, I noticed.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:25.000
But I need you, yeah, and I know you notice that, which is why I stopped it. So try it again, cause you did it really well twice, but put a period on it.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Or put a question mark on it. And make me answer. Right? Like that's the question you're posing to me.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Don't give me more ammo to sort of change the tone or the direction of the Conversation power the pause agree so let's jump back in one more time

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
So, so, so we're looking for, I'm looking for a commitment from you today.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:54.000
For a hundred $1,000. So we can execute again, save. How do you feel about that making that commitment today?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Well, thanks for asking. 1st of all, it's flattering to be asked. I suppose I'm not.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:13.000
In a position where I could make a commitment today, but I'm super interested. So, you know, What would help me, I guess, is understand more about the round.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
How much money are you raising and on what terms?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Well, I mean, we're gonna use the standard. Can I use a term YC safe?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Sure, a part of it.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.000
We're gonna use the standard, safe, to raise it. Probably, 3 million dollar cap.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:40.000
And we're looking to raise 2 50. And we're looking to do that by the end of June.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Got it. Stop. Great, okay. You see how this conversation changed a lot?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:53.000
From a hypothetical future to Oh, I asked David to commit. He said I can't commit because I don't understand the terms.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And you made a choice. Right. So I wanna talk about that choice.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
There's a few comments here that like, you know, people are noticing the word probably.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000
It doesn't create confidence like it should be really clear. Yep, what you said is we're raising 2 50 K on a 3 million dollar safe note.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:25.000
No, probably about it, right? Now, where are we in this strategy? One. You did a great job of making a clear ask for a specific amount of money and you used the word today.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
You made it about now. My face changed. I said, not really ready to make a commitment today because Step 2 in the strategy.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
I was gonna come back to that.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Yeah, step 2 in the strategy. I want to teach everybody right now. There's only 3 steps.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Step 2 in the strategy is.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Listen, not grey hair, listen. Not trying to show you the gray hair trying to say listen Pointing here, not here.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Okay. You gotta listen. Let it come out, right? Like that's that period, the pause, okay?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Ask the question, let it come out. I'm not quite ready to commit because if they don't answer the question, ask them again.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Yeah, I understand you're interested, but are you ready to commit the $100,000 here today, David?

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Push on that step one until they give you an answer. You gotta listen for that answer. People forget to listen.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Right? And they just start problem solving because you and I were entrepreneurs. What we do, we solve problems, okay?

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
So you heard, I don't. Know what the terms are and you told me these are the terms.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Cool, you made a choice. Are you conscious of the choice you made?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Well, I knew there was 2 answers there the terms and why you actually hesitated.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
What do you mean by that?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Yeah, I made a conscious choice to answer the specific question versus why you paused.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:55.000
That's right. Yeah, you answered the question, you solved the problem. You said this is the answer to the question.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Everyone is ever been in negotiation camp or done a negotiation knows that, maybe you're starting a little high and if I were doing that I would start a little a little low.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
That's just the roles we're in. That's all fine. But the choice you made.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000
And I'm gonna launch my 1st poll. Cause I want everybody to be involved in this. I don't have poll questions set up.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Okay. We'll do it without a poll. Sorry, I usually have this set up in advance.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:27.000
The poll question I wanna, I wanna ask and I wanna just get a show of hands. And I get that there's people in room, but I'm gonna look.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
How many people would make the same choice? In response to that question. Which is, well, I don't really know what the terms are.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Don't do virtual hand raised because that's just gonna confuse me just like physical hand raise if you don't mind.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:50.000
How many people make the same choice and and essentially anchor like that? Hmm. A lot of people.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Okay. How many people would make a different choice and say something like, well, David, what do you think?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000
In other words, give away the anchor. You know, I'm open to any offer, you're a great investor, you know, I'd love to see what you think.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000
I see some hands going up there too. And Jennifer, if it's a virtual hand raise, I think you have a question.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
So if you do have a question, keep your hand up. Otherwise, you can just put it down.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Those are the 2 choices most. People would make either anchor or give away the anchor.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Okay, so I'm going to solve the problem. I'm going to tell you what the price is or.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:34.000
David, you tell me what the price is and I'll tell you if that works or not. And these are 2 forms of entering into a negotiation.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Okay.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Like no one's gonna say, okay, great, that price sounds right. Done. Although maybe they would at a 3 million dollar cap that was quite that was quite a low start.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000
You don't distinguish between a safe conversation. Versus a priced round conversation in in voice.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Not at this point I wouldn't. I'm trying to get a commitment. I don't really care if it's on a safe note or equity or what, right?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.000
It's not really important to me. I want to get the money. Right? And so the 2 choices that people tend to make are those 2 choices.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And both of them lead to the same place. Both of them lead to a negotiation.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And they lead to a negotiation from the weakest possible position on your part.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Because you have nobody committed. And you really need me. And I have time. So I can wait.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:36.000
So if we're going to negotiate. I'm gonna win. And you can always say no, but you're not winning either if you say no.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Right? And so I wanna present a different. Idea as part of my 3 step strategy.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Step one, make the ask for specific amount of money here. Now today, step 2, listen.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Extract the problem, right, that you're hearing. Step 3, and this is the really different approach.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Step 3, take away that problem.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Doesn't that sound simple? Just take away that problem. Take that problem and make it not a problem.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
If you go for the median. Is solving the problem. And our instinct as entrepreneurs is to solve the problem.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
That's what we do all day long. We solve problems. I want you to fight that instinct.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Don't solve the problem. Instead, make it not a problem. Different mental model. I'm gonna tell you what I mean by that So, Gibbor, I'm gonna say thanks for the help.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Appreciate you. You're awesome. Did a great job making that clear and specific ask.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:54.000
When we hear that problem. And this is really the key piece of the strategy, cause then it's just a loop and you just repeat it forever until there aren't any more problems.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000
When we hear that problem, I don't know what the valuation is. Fight your instinct to solve that problem.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:09.000
And instead take away the problem. How do you take away the problem? Well, in this case, you would say, David, I hear you.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
It's hard for you to make a commitment without understanding the terms of the deal, but I'm pretty early.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:25.000
I'm just getting started here. So what I'd like to do is take your commitment for the $100,000 today and we'll figure out price as we go.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000
And if we don't figure out a price that we can agree on prior to closing, I would of course never hold you to the commitment you make here today.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Will that work for you?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:50.000
It takes away the problem. The problem is a fear. The problem is I'm afraid as an investor that I'm going to pay the wrong price.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:00.000
So give me an out. Just simply say We'll figure that out in partnership as we go. We'll see how much demand there is.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Right? We'll see what other people come in and we'll figure out a price. And if you don't like that price, I would of course, Magic Words never hold you to the commitment you're making here today.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Would that work for you? You given out. And then you write it down. And you say.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Got it. David doesn't. Have, you know, I'm not committing to a price with him.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
If he doesn't like the price before closing, he's out. I keep track of that.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:39.000
And then I say something like, this is the loop. I say something like, great! So you'll make the $100,000 commitment here today.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:47.000
If we don't figure out pricing this acceptable to you before we close, we would of course not hold you to the commitment you're making here today.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Are there any other conditions to the commitment of a hundred $1,000 that you're making here today? You start to use this language like a car salesman a little bit.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:03.000
It's your car. It's not my car. You already bought it, right? And what you're saying is Are there any other things you're fearful of or worried about?

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000
You're not saying it that way, but you're asking what are the other conditions to the commitment you're making here today?

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
And they might say something well, I'd be much more comfortable if you come back to me when you have a lead investor.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Well got it. I hear that. And it makes sense to me. Because I listened and then I used step 3 which is take away the problem.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
How about this if we don't have a lead investor you love? Prior to closing, I would of course never hold you to the commitment you're making here today.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Would that work for you?

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
And they're gonna say, yeah.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Cause you're addressing their concern. Are there any other conditions? To the commitment you're making here, besides we agree on price and we have a lead investor that you like prior to closing, it's a loop.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Yeah, I'm actually really concerned about who's gonna be on your board.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Take away the problem. Got it. You're worried about who's gonna be on the board.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:03.000
How about this? If we don't have a board that you love and sign off on prior to closing, I would of course never hold you to the commitment you're making here today.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:12.000
And so on. I see some of you smiling. Pretty counterintuitive, but I'm gonna tie it all together for you and I'll get to the raised hands in just a minute.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:22.000
This works on anything. I only invest in companies that are relocating here to my hometown of Boulder, Colorado.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
You can fight him, you can have a negotiation about border, Colorado, or you can say got it.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
If we don't move to Boulder, I would of course not hold you to the commitment you're making here today without work for you.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
By the way, I can't commit to moving to Boulder, but if we don't, I understand you're not committed.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Does that solve your problems that work for you?

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
And so on and so on and so on.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
So you take away the problem, you don't solve it, you give it out, not a problem.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Right? And what you're doing is you're building momentum. Now the people with their hands up, I'm gonna come to in just a second, but I'm gonna guess.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
That some of you are gonna say, but that's not a real commitment.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
If you have all these outs, how is that a commitment?

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:13.000
That's probably what's on a lot of your minds right now, but I'm gonna stop and take a question from Benson and see what Vincent has on his mind.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Hi.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Yeah, hi David. I'm so visiting, looking forward to, getting Olive Garden with you someday.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:29.000
So we're working on an inclusive and explainable AI underwriting solution, which to banks in credit unions has a really long sales cycle.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Yep, last question. What's the question?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:40.000
So we're pre revenue, right? Sorry. The question is, when your pre-revenue How do you properly value the company?

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Because there is an argument to be made that any price is too much because you have 0 revenue. And a lot of the methodology that we've seen coming through tech stars is around pricing based on fundamentals.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
In this environment how you would tell us to approach. Talking to investors.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna answer it quickly and we can come back to it at the end, but I wanna get through the strategy stuff.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Yeah.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
I would say there is no science for valuing startups. It's market norms. Most startups are completely worthless when they're invested in.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Yeah.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Most startups don't have revenues when they're 1st invested in. If this group of people it's on this call thinks about it, we invested in you and most of you don't have much early revenue if any at all.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Or much early traction, right? Some do, others don't. It's not a science.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
It's an art. So there are market norms, which we can talk about more at the end.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:45.000
The investors investing in the upside, they want you to have upside, you know. Of course, it's even if it is worth 0 technically today by some, you know, financial analyst calculations, you've got to figure out a deal that makes sense for everybody.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.000
So. I do want to try to stay on topic with kind of the strategy, but let's come back at the end if you still have that question and haven't answered it fully.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Jay. Hello.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Jailo, I got it now.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Hello. Yeah, Jennifer Lowe. Everyone calls me J. Lo.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Ceo at Travis. Okay, so I really love this strategy of taking away the problem.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Okay, so I really love this strategy of taking away the problem, but by making it not the problem.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:19.000
But does this work for specific scenarios like for the 1st commitment or are there certain criteria where this does apply?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Because obviously you have you know, a scale of investors, some are smaller, angels, some are bigger and institutional.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Yep.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
So just curious, what is the criteria for this type of condition.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I think if you get good at it, it works on anything and it works on anyone. People wanna feel safe.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Okay.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:42.000
It's a fundamental human need. They're telling you why they don't feel safe and you're making them feel safe by giving them an out around that thing.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Okay, so by the way, this works in sales, it works in all kinds of contexts. Now, the question that should be on everybody's mind, and I'm pretty sure it is, is but is this a real commitment?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Like, So what? I got a hundred $1,000 commitment and I had to give outs around pricing, you know, where I'm gonna live my board of directors and my lead investor.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Is that a real commitment? Yes, it is. What is a commitment? What is a soft commitment?

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:18.000
The soft commitment. Is when the investor says yes to a specific amount of money. And there are conditions to that yes, which are mutually understood.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.000
That is a soft commitment. And that's what I've just defined in this loop.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
By the way, when you're engaged to be married, you're in a soft commitment.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:37.000
You said yes to get married But there are some specific things that might happen that would cause you to back out and not actually get married.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:48.000
So I like that comment from no it is a change in state of mind. I am committed. But if any of these things go wrong, I'm not going to do it.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
If you cheat on me, I'm not gonna marry you. Okay, that's a soft commitment.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:59.000
It's only a hard commitment. When you sign the contract. Right, or do your thing in a church or whatever.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:06.000
It's only a hard commitment when you actually sign a contract and wire the money in the context of of an investment round.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Soft commitments are not contracted. They are not in paper. Just like an engagement is not contracted and not in paper.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.000
But it's pretty dang real. Anybody who's been through it knows that soft commitments are pretty dang real.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Okay. So, deep breath.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Why is this important? Why do I want to take away the problem instead of argue? With my 1st investors.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Well, if I start arguing about valuation, inevitably they're going to say, well, just come back to me when you have a lead investor.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Just come back to me later. I am happy to wait. I get a free option. This is the mindset you're fighting.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000
You need to get them to the point where they feel safe and comfortable saying, yeah, I'm in, but if any of these things go wrong, I'm out.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
And you understand that and they understand that.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Your job as a fundraiser is super simple. Hard, but super simple. Manufacture, momentum.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:14.000
You do not manufacture momentum when you have arguments with your 1st committers. No, no, how about 6 million valuation? How about 4?

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
How about 5? How about 2? No, how about one? I'm going to lowball you.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:24.000
I have the power, you know. Oh, come back to me later. I win. Come back to me later for an investor, big win.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000
A free option is where I express lots of interest, but I never commit. Anybody feel that before?

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Yeah. If you've ever raised money, you felt that before.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:42.000
How about when an investor flips the script and says we can pick the can we pick the commitment conversation back up when they're actual terms?

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
It's the same thing. I get it. I hear you're not ready to commit because you don't know what the terms are.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:53.000
That makes sense to me. I don't know what they're going to be either. Depends how much money we end up raising.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
And so much interest there is. Twins who the lead investor might be. How about this? Why don't you commit the 100,000?

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:05.000
And if you don't like the terms, if you don't approve of the terms before we close, I would of course never hold you to the commitment that you make here today.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Will that work for you? You see, I get a yes out of people that way. And I manufacture my momentum.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:22.000
And then when I have the next conversation, I say I have a soft commitment for a hundred 1,000. I'm raising 2 50 and it just gets easier.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Because I have that soft commitment already That's soft commitment I have as pending terms. Okay, that's how you could say it.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:38.000
We're gonna figure out terms That covers everything. But they're in for a hundred $1,000 pending those terms.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Now I'm talking to you with momentum. And now I'm gonna get another 100 and I'll do it one more time and I get another 100.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
I'm gonna be at 300 now I'm oversubscribed. Anybody who has a baby?

00:51:48.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Knows that sleep is a thing. But when they sleep a lot They sleep a lot more. Sleep begets sleep.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Over subscription, begets over subscription. When you start to become oversubscribed, you start to become really oversubscribed.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000
The market dynamic is really good. You exceeded your goal. You did more than you said you were going to do.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Everybody wants to be involved with you. You're a winner.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
But you don't become a winner unless you get your 1st commitment. You don't get over subscribed unless you get your 1st commitment.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:29.000
You don't get your second commitment unless you get your 1st commitment. I'm giving you as a tool to get commitments early.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:35.000
And build on them. Okay. Manage these. Reasons why they have outs.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Keep track of them per investor.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Soft commitments are a good thing not a bad thing they always come before hard commitment somebody always says yes before they sign a document It's a normal part of a commitment process.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Right? So the momentum that you're manufacturing is really important. Now, I wanna do one more role play.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Actually, I would talk for a couple of minutes more then I'm gonna do one more role place.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:11.000
I'm gonna put you on alert who am I gonna put on a work here? I'm gonna put Des be on alert.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Okay, you're up next, but not quite now, so. Just get ready, Desby.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:28.000
And the thing I want to talk about. Is an extreme version. Of this objection scenario.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Extreme version. So let's say you say to an investor, will you commit a hundred $1,000 today?

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
You know what? Let's do this with Desby. I'd rather do it with a person.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:42.000
It's way more fun. Desby, where are you?

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000
There I know. Hello.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
You raising, say hi to me. There you are. Where are you today?

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
I'm in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Pulsa. Alright. I've been in that office. Good to see you.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Good to see you as well.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Let's do this. You've been following along here?

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Most definitely.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Make the ask sooner than you think specific amount of money here now today Listen, take the problem away. I'm gonna give you a really hard problem.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Okay.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
That you have to take away. I'm sorry, this artist one you picked the hard. I know I picked you, but you picked the hardest one.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000
But it's actually really easy because it's the same thing.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Take the problem away. I hear you. What's the problem? How do I take it away?

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:39.000
That's what you need to think about, okay? Let's do it real quick really quickly jump in and ask me to make a commitment for a specific amount of money today and let's go from there.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Des be great to see you again. How can I be helpful with this round you're raising?

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Thank you.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Good to see you again David. The introductions that you made for customers were amazing. Actually it's going to take up our MRR by 25 to 30%.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:57.000
In this next quarter. With that said, I think our partnership together can really strengthen the company even more.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:07.000
And so I was wondering if you would like to invest a hundred 1,000 into our company today. I mean if that was a commitment that you thought that you can make.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Thank you for asking. I'm super psyched about what you're doing. It's been really fun to work with you.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:18.000
I appreciate the ask. I, You know, I might be in a place where I could do that, but I guess my issue is I don't really understand the terms, the deal.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
How much money are you raising?

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
A 1 million.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:35.000
So we're raising a million dollars. And I understand that you, you know, might not understand the terms, but I think, you know, that, we can really look at the terms, and come to understand together what that might look like.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
I think that from my perspective, I see strength in our relationship, regardless of the terms.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Yeah.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
And you know, I think we would be, open to discussing what that might look like together.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
What are your thoughts?

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Cool. Yeah, me too. I feel like it's been a great collaborative, you know, and I'll just be straight with you.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Like I would love to to invest. You know, you're raising a million. I'd love to do a quarter 1 million of that.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Also, awesome.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:04.000
But, valuation is important to me. So I just have to be direct on that. I would do it at a 2 million dollar post money valuation.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Okay, well, it wouldn't be okay with you if, we considered the quarter 1 million a soft commitment today and then we can look at the valuation and the terms maybe in about 30 to 45 days just to talk through what that might look like.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Is that a plan that might be okay with you?

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.000
So I'm happy to get together in 30 to 45 days and talk about it again, but what I'm saying is I can make a commitment today.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000
But only if we can agree on a 2 million dollars post money valuation cap.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Okay, so

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:49.000
I don't know that that might be something that we can agree to today. I think that's something I would have to have a further discussion with my co-founders and board and team about.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Okay. Yeah. Of course.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:57.000
So I think that you know I would like to consider. Our relationship together that we do want to move forward and that we can have that as a pending conversation.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:10.000
After I go to my board and team and make sure that's something that we might can align on, would that be okay with you?

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Yeah, let's talk again in a few days. Stop. So, okay, great. Great.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Thank you.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Good learning here. By the way, you very good communicator did good job all around. Lots of people saying, but look, what's going on?

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
I'm creating a problem. What am I doing? I'm low balling you.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Yep. Yeah.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:40.000
I'm asking the investors get half the company. You calculated at 12.5 in the chat. That's right for me, but the investors get half the company because there's 4 of us with that check size, right?

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Pretty rude offer. But, hey, maybe you're on Shark Tank or something.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:52.000
I don't know. I love Mark, I shouldn't say that. Listen, yeah, Shark Tank, exactly, Brandon.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:00.000
I think what you did is fine, you but I went because I bought time.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Hmm.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000
And you didn't manufacture any momentum, right? Because there's no commitment here and anybody who thinks there was a commitment here has happy years.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Cause I was very clear and saying I can't make a commitment today unless we can agree on this price.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:15.000
So there is no commitment here. There's interest. Free option taking by me. I just bought myself a week.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:24.000
I'm fine with it. Now, good question from the iPhone of, Which is should you propose another valuation?

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Sure. You can have an argument with me. But I wanna give you a really counter intuitive way to deal with this scenario.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
This is gonna blow your mind use my strategy You heard me. I want half the company for a million bucks.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:46.000
The investor group. You're uncomfortable. That's the problem. The problem is you're uncomfortable.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000
How you take that problem away?

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000
You make yourself comfortable.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:02.000
How do you make yourself comfortable? You say. Thank you.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:15.000
David, thank you for the commitment of a quarter 1 million dollars that you're making today. I hear you when you say that the maximum price you'll pay is 2 million dollars post money.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Now I gotta make myself comfortable. I can't commit to that pricing today, David. It feels low to me.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:34.000
But if pricing comes in that low. Sure. But if it comes in higher than that. If it comes in higher than that.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Of course, I won't hold you. David to the commitment you, David, are making here today.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:49.000
I, the entrepreneur, make no commitment about accepting that price. If it comes in higher, I understand that you're not committed.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Thank you for the commitment of the low price. In other words. I make myself comfortable, which is the problem that I'm taking away, by being very clear that I cannot commit to that price.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But that I really appreciate the commitment that they made to me today.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Hmm.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
It's the same strategy. Take the problem away. Okay, now I know what you're worried about.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.000
They might hear that as You accepting that price. But that's not what you're doing. And because you're in this workshop, you know the 3 really important things to do when you get a commitment.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:30.000
There's 3 of them. You don't know me up, but you're about to.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
By the way, for those furiously taking notes, I have a cheat sheet with all these notes.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I'm gonna share it at the end of the call. But you're welcome to make notes.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
3 things you do when you get a commitment. So you say David, thanks for the commitment.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
You know, I can't commit to that price. I need to be clear about that.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
But if it comes in higher, of course, will not hold you to the commitment you're making here today. Does that work for you?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Yeah, sounds great. I feel like I'm winning. Having out if the price is higher than 2 million in my mind I know I'm low balling you.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000
You know it and I know it. But you don't want to argue with me, you want to say thank you.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Thank you for the commitment that you made, David. I make no commitment.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.000
You want to be clear about that? Okay, they're going to feel comfortable and safe. Which is your goal as a fundraiser to make them feel comfortable and safe.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
You're gonna write down that you were very clear about it. You're gonna do these 3 things.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
1st you're gonna finish my loop, right? You, you have to make sure you're done.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So you can say David, are there any of the conditions to the commitment you're making here today?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Well, I'm really worried about lead investor and you can take that one away. Well, I'm really worried about, you know, I only like people who wear red shirts.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I don't invest in people who are green shirts, right? Okay. I'll change my shirt before we close.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Like you're keeping track of all this stuff. If I don't change my shirt to a red shirt, I would of course never hold you to the you made here today.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000
It's just the same thing over and over again, no matter how ridiculous the objection. Okay, you're keeping track of them.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.000
There are no other conditions to the commitment being made here today. You then recap using a communication skill called reflective listening.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I wanna teach you this communication skill.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Reflective listening as you play it back and you ask you to get it right. It's not a weapon, it's the truth.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So you would say. David, I think what you're saying here is you're committing a quarter 1 million dollars to my round.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000
With the condition that pricing be no higher than 2 million dollars post money. That we have a lead investor that you like.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
And that the Board of Directors is acceptable to you. Do I have that right? They're gonna say yes.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And you're gonna say, and there are no other conditions to the commitment you're making here today, right?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It's just those 3.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And they're gonna say, yeah, that's right. And then you're gonna say, I need to be clear with you.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:57.000
That I can't commit to that pricing as we discussed. If it comes in higher, of course, won't hold you to the commitment you made.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Are we on the same page? You're using reflective listening to check it. The 1st thing you do after the meeting.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Okay.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I just send that in an email. You send an email. You say, David, thanks for the meeting.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Really appreciate the quarter 1 million dollar commitment. You made today. Thank you. It's super helpful.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000
That commitment you made today have 3 conditions. One that pricing is no higher than 2 million dollars post-money valuation.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:30.000
As discussed I can't commit to this price. But if it comes in higher than that, I won't hold you to your commitment either.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Thing 2, we have a board of directors that you accept. Think 3 that you have a lead investor that you accept.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Those were the only 3 conditions that we talked about. Please let me know if I got any this wrong.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Thanks so much. Really excited to work with you. An email critically, critically important email. It doesn't matter if they answer or not.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
For those of you that are like me with email, you're gonna set up your reminder and superhuman and you're gonna make sure you got a response.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And if you didn't, you're gonna follow up a week later. Okay, cool. Do all that.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But sending the email and having that email represent the conversation you just had is really important. You cannot use it as a weapon.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
You can't say something that didn't happen. It's a confirmation of what just happened.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Reflective listening verbally and an email. Thing one, really important.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Thing too, now that they're a committed investor, soft committed. You're gonna ask them, are there any introductions you can make for me to other investors that like to co-invest with you?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Who are the most likely other people that are gonna best people to know this person?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Thing 3, may I use your name? May I tell people you're committed pending terms?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Social proof. Those are the 3 things you're going to do every time you get a commitment.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I've been making people stare at both of us for a while. Does this make sense to you, Desi?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Yeah, it is. I feel like, ultimately how I hear this is you're trying to get a soft commitment and take that as a leverage in your next conversation to keep.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Keep the ball rolling and keep the leverage on your side and negotiating power on your side. That's how I'm a type of in everything right now.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yep, and the ask all this conversations in person or on the phone or on a zoom, but the email comes afterwards to confirm the commitment.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Manufacturing momentum that is your job now you have a quarter 1 million dollar commitment and I know what you're worried about Desi, I'm gonna say thanks.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Thank you.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
You were awesome. Thank you so much. Now you have a quarter 1 million dollar investment. I know what you're worried about.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
That investor is going to go to a bar. I'm gonna sit down in a bar. With other investors.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And they're gonna say, oh my god. I just low ball the crap out of Doesby.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:49.000
He has an amazing company. But I just offer him get this a million bucks. On 2 million post money, so a million dollar pre money evaluation.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Half the company for a million bucks. You're worried about that. Collusion. In the bar.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.000
That's what I'm doing here. I'm an actor. You get it? Colluding in the bar.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:13.000
The other investor who looks just like the 1st one is gonna say You know what I think I'm gonna call Desi.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
What a great deal you negotiated. You're super smart, David. I'm gonna call it Desi and I'm gonna say Hey Desby, love what you're doing.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I'd also like to invest a quarter 1 million. Now you have people coming to you. Let him collude.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
It's all good.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I understand that you're doing a deal with David where I get, you know, I want the same deal.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I can invest a quarter 1 million on 2 million post money. And you just have the same conversation. Now you're 500.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Collusion is good for you. Not bad for you. You have not committed to this 2 million dollars price.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
This is the thing you got to understand. You've been very clear about that in email and verbally.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:59.000
If the price comes in higher, those people are not committed. Now, let me tie it all together for you.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And have you watch the magic. The Magic Moment. One last role play.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Let's see. Gosh, the volunteers list. It's shrinking. But it still has people on it.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Is, size 3, is that? Are you out there? Say if I'm saying it anywhere near correctly.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Did you come off mute and say hello?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:41.000
From D. Where are you?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Feel like maybe they're in the Boston, LAI think it's LA.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
You're not out there. Can't hear you.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Okay, sorry. I tried. How about Gleb? Love, are you out there?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Yeah, I can.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Hey, what's going on?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Well, thank you.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Glad you have a friend, who's your friend?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
It's my Bye.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Okay, okay, only one volunteer though. That's how this works. One at a time.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Yeah.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000
So thanks for staying off camera. Appreciate it. So we're gonna do one last role play.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
You've been following along all this? Yours is the easiest one.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Yes. Nice.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I was your 1st committer. I'm sorry if you hear a noise. I was your 1st committer.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:42.000
You used my 1st commitment you didn't argue with me you thanked me but I low balled you just like you just saw I gave you some really low ball price.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And I have an out, right, around that because if you don't, you know, if the price comes in higher, I don't, I don't wanna pay higher.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And you had told me, no, you can't commit to that price. You had sent me that email and all that stuff.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:02.000
But you leverage the fact that you're generating momentum to get over subscribed. And now you're oversubscribed.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Okay, now you have a successful round. You wanna try to close it. The reason you're talking to me is to keep me in.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Even though the price is reasonable and not this low ball price that I talked to you about does this make sense?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
But they price and negotiated with others. Is higher.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Right. It's it's market. It's higher. It's just not some crazy low price you can make up whatever details you want.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:34.000
But the point is you're trying to keep me investing as opposed to walking away now that you're oversubscribed Let's see how you do that.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Are you gonna come back and say, Dave, you were you were a jerk, you lowballed me, but I'm gonna let you in anyway.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Are you gonna say? Actually, you were super helpful and I know we talked about a limit on price.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
It's gonna come in a bit higher. I'd still love to have you. Let's see how you play it.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Okay, let's see.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000
But the point is you're now over subscribed and you're trying to keep me in as your 1st committer.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Even though I gave you a low ball price, let's just see how it goes.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Yes.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Glob great to see you again. What's the latest with the round that we talked about a month ago?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Hey, nice to see you as well. Well, actually great news. We've been oversubscribed.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Awesome.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
We initially, we initially intended to raise a million and now and a half. Yeah, just a month, right?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Right, I remember. Yeah. A 1 million and a half. This one.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Wow.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Thank you. And, I wanna just say huge thank you to you to be honest because you was the 1st person who believe in us.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Hmm.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And, I gotta have the world rolling. I'm really appreciate that. And all this deal that you provided me with, I think that was helped me to close and around even go to subscribed.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
But then we also add one more detail just to recap the conversation that we had, right?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:50.000
You said that you're a meeting, 4 million dollars, with their condition that you can invest only the valuation is 2 million dollars.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Right, yeah.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:06.000
So I made a clear note and I appreciate you telling me that time, but we've been following with the, with other investors and, they, proposed higher relations just because they decided that it is more fair from the

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Sure, yeah. What valuation did they agree to?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:20.000
The, the, of 10 million. Not to, get founders already loaded. And, And they also suggest a lot of ways how we can use additional capital.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:34.000
To grow even faster. So we really wanna, have more money in this round and we want to keep you as part of this round just because you know this moment where you when you was the 1st person who believed in us.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Yeah.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That tells us a lot and I see this partnership moving forward. How can I, for you, comfortable to get money, will be higher press.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Well, I mean, 1st of all, congratulations super exciting. I'm a little bit confused though because what I'm remembering is we had a conversation where we kind of agreed to the 2 million dollars pricing and so I've been expecting that paperwork.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And now that the pricing is higher, it doesn't feel great that the price is changing like that.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Oh wow, sorry, sorry if I'm using the studio in any ways. Maybe that's because of my English as you as you can see.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm an immigrant. I'm trying to do my best to express myself clearly. But, I remember that I sent you this email.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I'm just going to put it up and recap. I think that's on my side, it says that, you made a commitment.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Yeah.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I see. Oh yeah, I see the email. Yeah, now I remember. Yeah, you had pretty clearly said that you can't commit to that price, but that you wouldn't hold me to the commitment I was making if it came.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
So it's coming in higher, quite a bit higher, but you're raising a lot more money, which is pretty exciting.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Just nice momentum.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Yeah, well thanks for coming back to me on it and Thanks for reminding me of what we talked about.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I was a little angry for a second there, but now I remember that we talked about it that way.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
There's an

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I would still like to be in, look, I think that's a reasonable price for as much money as you're raising and You know, I wanna be able to tell my grandkids that I was the 1st one that said yes, right?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I mean, that's pretty cool. Yeah. But. But.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Awesome there. That says we're gonna include Intel, that much article. Okay.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Right.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I was the 1st committer, right? I was really helpful. And, I think I introduced you to a couple of other people that ended up investing.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:28.000
So I hope you could see your way clear to. Giving me 500,000 instead of 250.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Hmm, I think that's a very fair position there.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Good tough market and extra runway would be really good for you, I think.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I think you might be right about that. but, let me, let me make an account you on, quarter 1 million dollars on a, of 10 million today.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Yeah.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And then as with the addition of 250, let me just try to do my best to talk to my co-founders and just to see if we if we see a way to use this initial money to help us to grow even faster.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And then it would just come back.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Okay, okay, that would be great. And okay, so just to be clear, I can keep my quarter 1 million dollar allocation.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Awesome.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I'm in for that. Please do send me the paperwork and if you can get me another 2 50 or even another 100 I would really appreciate it because it would give me more ownership with the price being a little bit higher.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Sure, then I can come to you today for a million dollars on a village of 10 million.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And I'm going to discuss with my partners, about a hundred K and. And I'm going to just get back to you within a day or 2.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Okay.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Go off clap, right? I mean. Nailed it. I told you it was the easiest one, but you still did really really well Now what's the difference here?

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:57.000
The difference here is you have all the power. You have the thing I want. When you 1st talk to me, I had all the power and I used it to lowball you, but you handled it by making me feel safe and not caving to it.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000
But giving me an out around it, realizing that when you're oversubscribed No one's going to drop out for any reason.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000
They're gonna actually get you more oversubscribed and ask for more because the price that you ended up with is reasonable.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I knew I was low balling you. It's now a hot deal. I want to be able to tell my grandkids about it and all my friends.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I don't want to miss out on this and really I'd like to get more because I like to own more, which is why I lowered you in the 1st place and I'm running a hundred 50 million dollar fund and it's only 500 K.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Not a big deal. 250 K, 500 K same number. Whatever you see It's a dynamic of power.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And you win when you manufacture momentum and you get oversubscribed and you never get there if you argue with your 1st committers.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Instead you take their problems away, you make them feel safe.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Okay, so this is the strategy and I wanna I wanna say thank you. You did awesome. You understood that you should treat me really nicely, not be mean.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Keep me in. All these conditions that people have that you've been writing down about whether or not you're gonna live in Boulder.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:11.000
About whether or not your board of directors is great about exactly who the lead investor is. Nobody cares when you're ever subscribed.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Awesome.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Nobody cares. They follow A. But if you're not oversubscribed, they care a lot.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Make sense. I'm a, you can make just my, just one question quick.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Right. Yeah.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:30.000
What to do with these investors who kind of Do I engage into this game with you? They just tell you, you know, we just need more time.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Like, you know, nothing really calls me like nothing specific. In my mind now, I just need more time.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
So we just

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Yeah, they are taking a free option. Okay, they're taking a free option. You've got to get them excited.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:51.000
About what you're doing. Right? One way to do that is to start to manufacture momentum. Okay, so if they're not moving, they're going to be people who are terminal babies.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:58.000
It's gonna happen. Some people are just expert at it and they're never gonna say yes until 90% of the round is done.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Okay, there are other people, and in my experience, it's 90% of people who this will work on.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So you just treat it as a free option. It's it's fine. You say you try to say things like how about accounting your commitment today and if in a week or 2 you don't feel good about it?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I don't think we'll be done by then you can always call me and tell me now.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Hey, give him an out, right? But you started trying to get them in an emotional state where they're committed.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000
They may say, no, I really need X. The trick is to ask the question, will you commit?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000
If you ask about a hypothetical future, are you interested? What can I do? How can we move the needle?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
They give you the stall. If you ask them to commit, you get to the real thing. So my guess is there's a real reason.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.000
It's not just we need more time. It's, we don't feel comfortable with the market size.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Or whatever so great how about this You make a commitment today. Of a hundred $1,000. I'll get you market data if that doesn't look good to you, of course you can drop your commitment.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I won't hold you to it. It's part of their due diligence process to check the market size.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:09.000
You're trying to shift. This interminable list of reasons why someone stalls you down to just one or 2 things that they're really afraid of.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
That's what the strategy lets you do.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And what's the awesome message they say if if those were soft commitments or hard commitments, you can say soft because people abuse these these days.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Yeah, soft commitments, they're they're intending to invest. We just have to you know nail down all the terms and finish raising the money.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Thank you.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
That's Easy to answer. Thanks for your time. I see Nelson's hand up before I go to you, Nelson.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I'm coming in just a second. I wanna just kind of recap where we are.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:46.000
And I have one more rant I have to do. Just one more rant I have to do, but I've decided I'm gonna hang out for an extra 2030 min.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I know some of you won't be able to after our time, but we're recording this.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000
So if you want to hang out, I'm gonna take lots of questions in a few minutes. For about the next half hour.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And if you have to go, that's okay, it's recorded. But I want to recap the strategy.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Ask for a commitment for a specific amount of money here now and today. Listen, take away the problem.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Don't solve the problem. Take away the problem. Repeat until there are no more problems.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Okay.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Use reflective listening that communication scale I told you I want to teach you use it both verbally Do I have this right?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And an email to document both their commitments and yours. Or the lack of yours. Like I can't commit to that price.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:38.000
You make them feel safe, you build momentum. The next conversation gets easier and you get eventually to subscription and over subscription it just gets easier and easier.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Elite investor will emerge. That's my last rant. It's called the lead investor.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And then I'm gonna come to the questions. The lead investor will emerge. I wrote a blog post many years ago.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Called Never Ask Anybody to be your lead investor. And I'll say it until I die.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I'll say it until I'm not here. Never ask anybody to be your lead investor.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I get it. A lot of you have already made this mistake. But never do it. Lead investor.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Comes from the set of committed investors.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Ask investors to commit first.st

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:37.000
When you say to an angel or a seed fund, will you be my lead investor? Keep hearing a little noise so if you're not muted please mute when you say to of seed fund or an angel will you be my lead investor?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:49.000
What they hear is will you commit and Put your r on the line. And be in charge of the due diligence and take responsibility for introducing me to people.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Being the lead investor is harder.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Then being a committed investor. Why would you make that? The issue. Ask the investor to commit.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Build momentum with commitments and watch how lead investors come out of the woodwork Leave investors get nervous that they're not going to get their allocation.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Lead investors get nervous that the terms are going to get away from them. Lean investors come from the set of added investors.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.000
If you're talking to a seed or angel, angel fund or sorry, an angel or seed fund.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Ask them to commit asking them to be the lead is just more work to them It's sucks.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
If they want to be the lead, they'll tell you. That's not what you need.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:41.000
You need a commitment. If you're talking to a VC who writes 5 million dollar checks. And they commit, they are your lead investor.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:48.000
That's what they do. You never have to ask them that. A VC who says yes is your lead investor.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
They're going to give you a term sheet and they're going to drive the deal after they commit.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Always ask for commitments, never ask for lead investments. Why? Let me tie it all together for you.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Why do we all go around asking everyone, will you please be my lead investor? Why? Because we have so many conversations where the other person has said come back to me when you have a lead investor.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Come back to me when you have a lead investor. Classic free option taking classic stall tactic.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000
You now know how to handle that.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.000
How about you commit the $100,000 today and if we don't have a lead investor you love prior to closing I would of course never hold you to the commitment you're making here today.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Don't let that free option taking ploy cause you to go make it harder for everybody else to commit by asking them to be your lead investor.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Which is harder than asking them to commit. Don't fall for that trap. Deal with the problem up front, which is they want to see a lead industrial and they're not comfortable.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.000
They're not safe Take that problem away. You never have to ask anyone to be a lead investor.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Okay, I promise Nelson I would come to you like 5 min ago. Nelson, you're on.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And here we're going to just go to questions.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Yeah, hey, no worries. Thanks, Dave, for the talk. I'm curious about, conditions, right?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.000
So when you talk to these investors and they're like, conditions, right? So when you talk to these investors and they're like, I'll put in 200 K if you change Right.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Yeah.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And then you get an oversubscribed round. You get to that sort of milestone and you're going back and you're locking people down.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Is that the appropriate time and what's the right way to handle it when you're like, you know, really appreciate your commitment?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Hmm.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
You know, you said you commit 2 hundredk if I put on a blue shirt. I'm afraid that's not really gonna work for us.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Yeah.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000
At this point, like all my investors are cool with red. So, you know, does that mean one out?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Like, how do you?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Yeah, your analogy is exactly the same as the price is higher analogy. That we went through in the role play.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So whatever the thing that changed is it didn't really change. It just became clear, right? Like you made a decision.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
The blue shirt analogy is a bit much, but you made a decision the price is going to be higher.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:02.000
You made a decision you're not going to be based in Colorado or whatever. Right? And you're of course, you know, they're not committed because they were clear about that.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
You can either tell them you don't want them in the round anymore unless you've made a commitment they're in.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Or you can say, look, that's a condition of you being in. We're going to have this color shirt on, or we're going to have this high price.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:24.000
That was the last role play we did. I'd really like to keep you in and what I find my data is at least 90% of people will stay in.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Cause they knew the thing they were asking for was unreasonable. Sorry, they knew the thing they were asking for was sort of a low ball or sort of, you know, not really that important.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.000
It's especially not important when you're oversubscribed. If you're really oversubscribed.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And you don't want to take all this money, then yeah, you can pick from your set of oversubscribed investors.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Be careful. Cause you don't want the whole thing to fall apart. What more than likely happens when you're oversubscribed as a lead investor has come out and said I want to set the terms I want to guarantee my allocation and you've negotiated with them, it's probably one of the bigger checks.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It's probably going to be very influential to the others. But there are times when there is no lead investor.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Like a good number of rounds of tech stars companies coming out of the accelerator have no lead investor.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Right? Nobody emerges. It's just everybody wants to do the deal. And in that scenario, you use the order of influence.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000
You go to the most influential, biggest check most well known person and you have a negotiation one on one.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And you use their influence with everyone else. To say this is what we're gonna do. Right?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Mark Cuban and I agreed to a 4 million dollar price that work for you. Of course it does. Right?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:43.000
So influence really matters when you don't have a lead investor and being reasonable really matters when you don't have a lead investor.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:53.000
That's the rest of my lead investor rant, but your example is exactly the same as, as price is higher, right? You try to keep them in or you decide you want them out.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
It's your you have the power when you have but you never get there if you argue with your early committers.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Elena.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:08.000
David, thank you so much for all the awesome tips. My question is, it's clear what we're getting from investors commitments.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
What is the investor getting out of it? So like why would they even Why would they want to do it?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Ever not just like

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Well, because they want to buy a share in your company for a dollar and have a be worth a hundred dollars later.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:27.000
It's great. And the whole point is they think you're on to something. This doesn't work for investors who don't care about what you're doing.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Okay.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Yeah, what you're gonna find though is there are investors who care about what you're doing because you're doing something interesting, but they're afraid to commit.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
This is the problem that we're dealing with. You still have to have a pitch. You still have to have a business.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Okay.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:46.000
It's not. You know, Jedi Madness stuff, right? That's not Yoda.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
So they would they would commit out of like fear of missing out. That's like okay

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, but they have a fear they have a fear of missing out, but the stronger fear is that you know, that's something I don't know yet.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Or they're gonna pay too higher price. Those are the fears you're taking away so that that greed one comes to the front like oh I've got an out on price I've gotten out on where you live I've got now all these things I'm worried about but I you know Now my greed takes over and because I have all those outs I feel safe.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
To let my greed take over. That's exactly what's happening here.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Okay, thank you.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Alan, I'm gonna go to you in just a second, but I wanna say we're at our defined time within 2 min of it.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I'm gonna stay for another 20 min and take questions. Recorded if you have to go. I totally understand. You have other things.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Thank you for your time, but I'm gonna stay and keep taking questions. If you're leaving, you can watch the recording later.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Allen.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I can't.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Hello, can you hear me? All right, good. Thinking about step one. Would you ever execute that in the very 1st meeting?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Yes.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Okay, thank you.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:09.000
One things I love about startups. There's no rules. It's unlikely, but yes, would I ever do it possibly if I'm getting this massive, oh my god, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen. I love what you're doing.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I'm so excited. Yeah, they're investors. Ask them. They like.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.000
What what's the more typical case would you have a 1st meeting?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Yeah, the more typical cases you have 2 or 3 meetings at least. And you know, people wait too long.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000
This is why I love the one to 10 question. On a scale of one to 10 how excited are you about potentially investing in my company?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:39.000
6, I hear 8. Time to ask. Most people wait way too long. This is a professional investor or stated angel investor.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:46.000
They're not going to invest unless you ask them to. Right? And they're probably waiting for you to ask in some cases.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And I really want to point out the reason to use this strategy the reason to use step one is not because you think they're going to say yes.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
It's because you want to know what the real reason is they're not ready to commit.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And you want to take it away. Like it's an offensive strategy. And you want to use it sooner, not later.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Mac.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Right, thanks.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Hey.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Hey, Dave. On the note of the specific ask, you know, I'm thinking about like obviously the round size we have a really good idea but can you talk more about like making sure the number I give to them.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:33.000
As a specific as number is right so I'm not creating more things to negotiate like Maybe, maybe if I'm doing a 1.5 million dollar round, I really want them to ask, you know, do like a million, but maybe they can only do 500.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Am I creating too much? Tension by asking them for a specific amount.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:51.000
No, I don't think so because I 1st of all, I want you do your research So research comes by looking at our tools and systems and seeing who else have they invested in and how much did they invest.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Research also comes from saying things like, hey, which typical check size? And they're gonna say well anywhere from 100 to 500 K and you're gonna ask for 500 K because that's who you are.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Right. High end of the range and If you feel like that's too much, okay, that's for them to say.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:16.000
So their 1st objection be, well, I'm not really in a place where I'm interested in investing 500 K, but I'd consider a quarter 1 million.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.000
That's not a commitment, but that that gives you a sense. So great. Could you commit the quarter 1 million today?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Start the strategy right so I think you do your research, you ask some questions and you go high on the range and you see what they say and often they'll they'll right size the amount you're talking about.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Especially if they're really interested because they've already thought about it and then you get into the strategy with that ask.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
There's a question I'm going to answer live in the Q&A. It's very related.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:51.000
There's a soft commitment apply if a range is given. Like a hundred to you know I'm in for 100 200 K no That is not a soft commitment.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:01.000
A soft commitment and I'm going to share the document before everybody drops off here. My notes that I promised it's a commitment to invest a specific amount of money.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:09.000
That's made today here and now. With mutually understood conditions. So I'm going to share my cheat sheet.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.000
In just a moment and While I'm doing that, I'm gonna ask.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
J-Lo to come back on and ask the question.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Okay, this is for the women in the, in the founder startup cohort.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Thank you.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:31.000
So obviously last year there was less than 2% of BC backed companies that were female founded startups.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I'm just curious if you have any advice for women that are raising to help make that number bigger.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Obviously, like a lot of people will say like, oh, we'll just do your best or don't do anything differently.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Do what everyone else does, but obviously that's not working. So like What kind of advice do you have for us to?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Yeah, to just be more effective fundraisers.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Yep. 2% number is right and it's not new. It's been in that zone for a while. And there's a lot of people actively working on it, which is good.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:14.000
So 1st thing I would say is make sure in addition to targeting. The market the way you should that you also target those funds which are specifically trying to address this issue.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:23.000
There are funds that are targeting looking for you. And I certainly think that you wanna make sure you have a good list of those and target those, not exclusively, but also.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:30.000
2 is, there's pretty good research. I think Susan Cohen, somebody Cohen, last name Cohen.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I don't know, a bunch of Cohen's in the world. They were unrelated to me wrote a really good article about how women are asked questions by investors and studied the language of investors when they were speaking to women.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And and it's a really good article that I wish I had a link for. I'll put it in my cheat sheet in the future because I think get this question once in a while.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:04.000
That talks about how to deal with the nature of questions you tend to get as a woman because as there's a bias amongst the investors who tend to ask questions about the downside.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Of what you're doing, the risk of what you're doing, where when speaking to men those same investors have a bias towards asking questions about the upside.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
How big could this be? You know, what if it went right? What if we got this? You know, lucky break.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
We learned that in our you venture finance class. It's I find the article too.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Okay. Yeah, thanks. If, if someone has the article, please share it in the chat. A great article.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And, and so I've seen that work. And I've become conscious of that in my own language as I talk to people.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:43.000
What the advice is to turn the question. Thanks for sharing that. Turn the question. From, you know, the downside risk, you know, while answering it to the upside possibility.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Right and get them thinking about that again and that tends to help those conversations but it is a it is a reality it is a bias it does exist in the market a lot of people are well-intentioned and working on it those are the only quick thoughts that I have on it today.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Cool, thank you.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Here, got it. Yeah, for sure. Gleb.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I'm good question. Oftentimes I noticed that during the 1st meeting with investor you can share a lot about your startup and then they tell us something like we're gonna come back in a week or 2 and then you keep pinning them and providing some updates.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:30.000
They are they ignoring you or they answering you something like, you know, we, still need my time, how to get them on the second call when you actually can use the strategy just proposed.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Right. So they just aren't willing to get on a call with you. So they're not interested enough.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Right, because if they if you really were in their pipeline and they really were excited about you. They're not gonna ignore you.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
They might ignore you for a week, but they're not gonna ignore you for 2 or 3 weeks.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:52.000
So you need to do things that get them more excited. You need to do things that you know, and obviously it'd be good to get on the phone with them to do that.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.000
But you might send them an update about something great going on. You might let them know the round is progressing.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
What you're trying to do is get them more excited and that that that's a different talk, right?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:11.000
That's how to pitch and we're helping you a lot with that in other ways. That's demo day that's creating forcing functions of getting lots of investors to look all at once.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:24.000
But it's essentially just getting them more excited, right? Through updates, through communication. And and and asking for a call and if someone is just saying no no no to that for months they're just not interested enough.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I'm thinking.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Sometimes it's an associate, by the way. I'll give you my associate ramp.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:41.000
You can actually use a form of this same strategy with a associates. And I, when I say associate, I mean people who can't make an investment decision.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And you can ask that question. Are you able to make an investment decision? Usually if it's an associate, the answer is no.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Sometimes they can't. Principal, sometimes they can. So you can use the same strategy with the goal state being get a meeting with the partner.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Can you commit to get me a meeting with a partner? I'm not ready to do that. Okay.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Well, what's the problem? How can I take that problem away, right? Like you can you can adjust this strategy for any kind of sales process, by the way.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:16.000
It's just really helping you understand that investing is just a sales process that's a little more complicated because you have multiple parties usually.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:22.000
And it's about humans feeling safe. And feeling like, you know, afraid and how to deal with that.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000
So associates you wanna get through to a partner generally speak.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Thank you.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Alright, I don't see any other hands up. Which means we might be done here. But if you do have a question, I have a few more minutes.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Daniel, I'll take your question and we'll see if anyone else does.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000
And

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Yeah, hey David, thank you for, thank you for this. It was like, That's great.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I'm curious if any of this works with Sales leads, like how much of it is transferable.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Versus how much is exclusive to investors.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Well, you know, a lot of this talk came from me in the early days going through sales trainings.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000
And then trying to adapt it to the Thousands of rounds I was seeing. Actually a lot of ways think it is very applicable.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:21.000
It's not as much. Herding of cats typically. It's, it's, people always ask me like, does this work with a single VC check?

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:31.000
And the answer is yes. Right? And so it does work with a single party sales transaction. It's just removing those fears, right?

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And the problem is, is that when, when someone's buying software, say, and it's a software sale, okay, there's no real momentum to manufacture because they're a single buy right so momentum is is sort of less a part of the dynamic So I think there's a lot of communication skills here that work in sales.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:59.000
And a lot of understanding, you know, people's internal fears and mindsets, but there's less of the kind of free option taking dynamic and a typical sales process.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Yeah, makes sense. Thank you.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:08.000
He reads his iPhone.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Yes, hi.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Can you hear me, David? Hi, thank you so much for your call. And So my question for all the presentations and my question is regarding in Kind of like the how can we jump from talking to an associate to talking to a partner?

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And you mentioned something about this, but for example, normally when you had a conversation into an associate.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.000
And you asked to talk to a partner, they tell you I have a process and this is a process and you never get to the partner.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So. That's my question. Thank you.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:50.000
That's right. It's yeah, I think you when they have a process you should be grateful because at least you understand it and there are a lot of associates who won't even tell you what their process is.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
And a lot of them never have done a deal in their life. So I don't mean to be down on associates, but it's a problem, right?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:00.000
For a lot of people when they're trying to raise money. If you just make the ask, that's the goal state, right?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:07.000
You know, Joe, it's been fine. I'd really like to speak to Mary who's a partner.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Could you get me that meeting? Could we do that together? I'm not ready to do that because Sounds for.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Okay. How do I take that problem away? I'm not really do that because I don't understand, you know, the market size well enough yet.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Okay. I can help you understand the market size. So you just work on the things that they need you to work on.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
But you're clear that what your goal is is to get to a partner. You're not gonna do this forever.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Right, there's not an indefinite list of things. They should be able to tell you upfront.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I need to I need to get excited about the market size. I need to meet and understand the whole team.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I need to understand the amount of money you're raising. Those should be 3 things that they need to do.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Maybe they have 4, but you want to know what they are. Right, so why can't you take me to a partner because I haven't done those 4 things yet.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Not the 10,000 other things they're going to think of over the next 3 years. So it's similar in that way.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:06.000
You're just trying to get clarity on what things you need to do. They make a commitment to bring you to a partner.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
If you do those 4 things.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Yeah.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Right? It's not a hundred more they're gonna think of later. That's the trick, I think.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Please do, yeah.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Yeah, I have a follow up question, but. If you allow me. Yeah, so whenever you contact them in the beginning, well, normally for me, I always try to get to the partner and if I'm not successful and I don't have any corrections or any introductions, then I go.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:42.000
I'm a little bit down entering into the associate so you have any advice in order to how to do get an answer for the partner if I have no introductions to that.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000
To them.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Hard one.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Okay.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I guess my My instinctually answer is try to leverage the network better because You know, there are 4,400.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Portfolio companies. And it's rare for me to find a venture fund that hasn't invested in one of them.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Yeah.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Now, sometimes there's new venture funds. Sometimes there's new partners that they're relevant, so it does happen.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:18.000
But I would, you know, somebody in the network probably does know something the network, right? That's the real advantage you have and you're managing director should be able to help you navigate that.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I'm happy to try to help you navigate that. I haven't shared my email, but it's David at techstars.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Dot com. If anybody wants to say hello, please do. I have David at text.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Dot com, cause I got here first.st So. I set up the IT systems and I didn't have to have the David D.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Cohen, like other people in the company do. So you're welcome to email me.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And try to help with connections, but. Your local team should be very good at that as well.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Use the network.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Okay, so basically the bike will always do by introduction instead of going out cold.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Yeah.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I mean, that's the reality of the universe that you're dealing with and it's 1 of the built in biases in the industry that sucks, but yes.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Okay, thank you.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Part of.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Hey David, Pardo here, Trinity. Really grateful for all the insight. So one of my questions is going to be is that I've noticed it's going to be is that I've noticed that at least through my partner level meetings things they worry there's a lot of worry from the fact that I'm a solo founder.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Yes.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:31.000
So kind of don't progress beyond a certain point. Are there any dynamics that should be cognitive or best practices that you believe that we should follow.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Throughout our raising journey.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Yeah, 1st of all, I'd say it's really. Self-aware that, you, sort of, taking that feedback and even willing to ask that question.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I think it's shows a lot. I think I would use a lot of language about. You know the team that i have around me I would I would try to make sure I have a great team around me.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.000
You know, if there's a great team around you and you're the only co-founder that's different than you're the only co-founder and there's nobody around you.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Right, so I would type up the people on my team. I would think about even maybe giving someone that title, even if it's very small ownership that they have.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Okay.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:21.000
And I would also hit it very head on like you're doing here and I would say you know, this company is much more important to me than being the CEO or, you know, the most important figure in the context of the company.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:29.000
You know i would say that out loud so that they know you look if i'm ever not the right person okay i'm i'm happy to play another role Here I am, 17 years in.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.000
I'm chairman of the board. I do not have an executive role. I am not the CEO.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I was the 1st 5 years. Cool. Texas has more potential that way. Right.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:49.000
And I think using language like that early on with people will help them alleviate again their fear, which is a lot of what you're dealing with.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Welcome.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Got it. Got it. Very much appreciated. Thank you.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Yeah.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Hi, this is Martin here. Am I, am I on you or am I talking over someone?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I just said.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Oh, apologies.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I'll come back to you, Martin. No problem.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Yeah, yup, yup. Thank you very much, David. This was this was great information.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Could you share some best practices? On how startups can balance securing enough fund without risking over valuation in their early fundraising rounds.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Yeah.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Let me just be sure I got that using reflected listening. You want me to talk about like how much money is too much to raise?

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
At too high of a validation or something like that. Is that what you're thinking about? Got it.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Like I think you know you have to think about The the current round and the next round. So if I'm raising, you know, if I'm an early startup and someone's offering me 10 million dollars on a hundred 1 million pre money.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:57.000
And I have no revenue and no nothing like the next round is gonna be really hard to raise. Like I'm gonna have to live up to that.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:03.000
I'm using an extreme example on purpose. And I've seen this kill companies, right?

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Because the investors like, no, no, no, we won't authorize that round because we're being deluded.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Because we overpaid last time, right? That's not Your fault, that's their fault, but it's kind of your fault for taking that.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Money. So I think you wanna be in market norms is my answer to your question. I think you should you should think that you're you know most likely going to see 20 to 40% dilution.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.000
For the round you're doing. If you're only seeing 10. Sounds like a win.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:38.000
You know, but it's out of market. Right? And so that may cause some issues.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:46.000
It may feel good for a moment and it may not feel good next time. If it's 50%, like that's the low ball thing you saw earlier in the role play.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000
That's also way out of bounds. 20 to 40%. It's a wide range.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:58.000
That's what you should expect. And if you live in that range, I don't think you're gonna have the problem you're talking about.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Is, am I getting to your question correctly?

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Yup, yup, yup, yup, you'll be bastard. Thank you very much.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
That was good. Okay.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Awesome. We go to Antonia and then Martin. So.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Thanks, Dave. Yeah, thanks, David. So sounds like there is no really any rule, when to have these 3 start conversation, if I'm an understanding, like you just play by year, it might happen the 1st time, we might happen the second 3rd time, just depends on the excitement you get back from the investors, is that right?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Yeah, if you are like me and you're an engineer and you like rules, I'll give you one.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:38.000
You know like I have a rule like I can't eat a hamburger on a weekday.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
As I get fat, that's my role. And engineers need rules, but I can do it on the weekend.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
You know, so it just limits how many burgers I have, right? So you need a role.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.000
So the rule is you ask how interested are you at investing on a scale of one to 10?

01:46:51.000 --> 01:47:00.000
And if the answer is 6 or higher, you should ask. Because 6 or higher. It's really 8.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Or higher because they're hedging a bit. So use that question and if you want to rule.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000
If they say 6 and they mean 8 it's time to ask

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Gotcha. Perfect. And just talking about rules. I need another rule because I'm an engineer.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Follow up to the question before I was I was at this conference so it was on stage and somebody asked how can we reach out to you and he said this is my email just for reach out to me directly I love to work with entrepreneurs.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Should we trust the cold email intro or it's much better? Should I, should I email him or it's better to still have a warm intro?

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I think it's better to have a warm ensure that's meaningful. I think if the person entering you doesn't really know that person, it's not helpful, but if they're an investment of theirs or you know someone they work with or a friend I think it's always helpful.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I don't want it to stop you though because he's giving you an email address and So you try and the network in Texas is much bigger than people understand.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:11.000
So there are a lot of connections out there if you sort of navigate it. I think it's always better to go through it's it's the reality of the world again.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
It's a bias in the system and if you don't have it just go direct

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Thank you.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Martin, you're finally up. How you done?

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Wonderful. Thank you so much, dude. It was a lot of learning. Thank you.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I would like to ask. How are you think about? The angle of conversation with BC where I'm thinking not just about the next step but the step after speaking.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:52.000
I'm talking to somebody who I know technically should be doing seat, seat, around checks. But they also do other checks right they also do series and then suddenly the investor says yeah I love it but come to me for series I really love to talk to yadda yadda yadda it's a no obviously and and and on the surface it's an obvious answer but any advice inside here that you may share at

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
the such a topic.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I think in general, if you walk away from this conversation, understanding investors are human and and and humans have fears and they value relationships.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I think you're in a better place. So I think the answer to this one is just build a relationship.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Okay. Yeah.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:21.000
You're always fundraising at least 2 rounds ahead. Oh, I've raised for tech stars, you know, couple 1 billion in LP capital.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I'm I'm always working on the 10 million dollar check. I'm nowhere near it.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
But I'm working on it, right? I'm working on the relationship, I'm having the dinner.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Okay.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:36.000
So, the other comment I would make on that is a lot of people who do see checks but are saying come back to me for the A.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
They end up doing the C check. And the reason they're saying it is it's a free option.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Keep me posted, I might do the A. I don't think I'm gonna do the seed, but then, oh, you're oversubscribed and oh, this is getting more exciting and oh, you closed another customer.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I'll jump into the seed, right? So you want to keep a warm, even someone who says no.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:03.000
You're not gonna keep asking them to invest, but you're going to keep them updated and you're going to check in one more time at the end.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
The leap.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Thank you.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Hi David, thank you for that. I was just thinking on what you just mentioned is How many times do you follow with this 1st commitment?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:25.000
You know, like you are building the momentum. You are getting maybe second or 3rd invest investor with higher valuation do you go to these guys and say Hey, I built this.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:39.000
I have this new commitments or you just wait for oversubscribe and build all that momentum because it will tell you thoroughly like one to month or that's another good question is how long are you doing this you know like 6 months per month

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Yeah, well, 6 months is probably not a successful process, but a month or 2 is probably pretty normal and in this market 2 or 3 months is probably pretty normal.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:58.000
You know, I think the, the high level answer I would give you is if your mindset is to make price the last thing.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Instead of the 1st thing, you're gonna be better off. You know if you make price the 1st thing you say we're raising a million on 3 million pre-money.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000
And then you have a bunch of conversations and you get to a million. Awesome. You're doing a million on 3 million pre money.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:20.000
But then you have a bunch more conversations and you get to 2.5 million. That 3 million doesn't feel so good anymore.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:30.000
It would have been better to have made price the last thing, not the 1st thing. So be in a place where you have the power when you start committing to price that's sort of the take away.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:38.000
So, you know, if someone says that they're pushing you. They're trying to become the lead investor.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:45.000
They're emerging because they feel the momentum and they're saying, you know, look, let's settle on a 3 million dollar price in a million dollar round.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Decision to make. You know, it's pretty easy to say, well, let's let's see how much money we end up raising before we fix a price.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Cause you're, you're starting to have the power. Some people will push you earlier. To commit to a price and then you just have a decision to make.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Do I love this investor? Do I feel good about this price? I'm like okay stopping in a million dollars?

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:11.000
But, you know, making that decision later is always better for you because you'll have the momentum and you'll have the power.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:18.000
And you'll be in a better negotiating position than when you have no commitments. Just when people make the mistake of kind of negotiating too soon.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000
That's why I like this strategy.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Alright, I'm gonna do 2 more and then I'm gonna call it because I know people have other things and I do too.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Last 2, so you ritsa and then we'll go to Vincent and then we'll call it a day.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Yeah, me again. So David, I have a question regarding, it wasn't a lot on some other person that asked regarding how much money are you raising.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I feel that always. Question that puts me nervous if I'm I'm honest why because if I say a million and then they say why do you need our mail and I do have a plan about it and they I've gotten questions about why now I'm even in the house.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Yeah. Yeah.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Obviously with more money I can make more but you know how detail do I need to have that plan? On what I'm going to do with that money.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Good. Good question. Okay, so. There's 2 pieces to what you're asking about.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:23.000
How details the plan and how much do I say, right, when I get asked this question. So remember what I started with over Ask is a big killer.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Say the amount of money that you're confident you can raise. I'm raising a million when the other when the investor says you should raise a million and a half you win Awesome.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000
The market is pushing you up. The market is begging you to oversubscribe. This is good, right?

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Like they're trying to convince you to take more. That's a good thing. When you're saying I'm raising 5 million and they're saying you should just raise a million, that's a bad thing.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Right? You want this dynamic. So you say, look, I have a clear plan for what I'm going to do with a million dollars.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.000
You have a spreadsheet. You've probably named it correctly. Fancy. Dot xl s right?

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.000
That's that's what it is. It's a spreadsheet where you've taken a guess at everything.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Yes.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Maybe using Google Docs and you just call it fantasy. But that we know one thing it's wrong, right?

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:13.000
But, but you have a model. Which is, you know, How are you gonna use this money and what you're gonna do with it?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.000
And the issue is, okay, you're gonna give me a million dollars and I'm gonna produce this outcome.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I'm gonna get to this revenue. I'm gonna get this bar down the road and it's gonna be an exciting thing.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:29.000
So you should be able to talk about that. When somebody says, well, you should raise a million and a half.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Interesting, yeah, if we had more capital, we could certainly do more, but we know we have a plan at the 1 million.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Let me think about that. You go back and you create fantasy 2 dot xLS. What will we do with a million and a half dollars?

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And then you come back to say, if we had a million and a half, we could do these things.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Right? But if this is a condition of their commitment that you have to raise at least a million and a half.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Okay.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Thank you for the commitment. Right? You take it. You say, okay, I understand we need to raise a million and a half for you to do that.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:07.000
They'll remember that you were only raising a million. And if you get to a million in a quarter, you're still exceeding that and they're they're gonna do it anyway.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Okay.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Right? They're just encourage you to take more money probably because they want to give you more money.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
It's good.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Okay, and regarding that detail of that plan, would you suggest to have that? Like financial model with the potential of raising the whole round.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Well, you're not gonna have it when they throw a random number at you.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Yeah, but for example in this case that I have in mind like the 1 million should have that model developed with a million.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:39.000
You go away in your friend. Yeah. Yes, for sure. Whatever your ask is, I think you should have a financial model that sort of says what you're gonna do with that.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Okay.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000
I don't think it needs to be in your pitch, but when someone asks you about it, you should be able to have an intelligent discussion about it for sure.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Okay, thank you.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Great, last question with Venson.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Yes. So is there anything in Brad Feld, Venture D or Kub or, sequence of sample road books that you disagree with?

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000
And if so as a change because the current market dynamic coming down to tech stars

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Well, venture deals, by Brad and Jason is on his 4th edition. And so it's been refreshed quite a bit.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:17.000
And it's really, you know, yeah, the terms move around, but really for seed stage startups, they haven't moved around that much.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:25.000
The number of deals that are happening has gone down. So valuations have not adjusted by 50% or anything.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
There's plenty of crap I read in startup books that I don't agree with.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I'm sure there's something and do more faster that I wrote 15 years ago that is probably different.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:44.000
And those of you that read it, please give me that feedback. But you know, generally speaking, I think all these books that are in the series that we've created sell more faster.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Do more faster, venture deals, startup communities. I think that the themes are all still very valid.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Thank you.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Alright, thank you. I always like to say at the end, thanks. You spent 2 h with me.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Hopefully it was useful. I'm david@textars.com. Feel free to say hello.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:12.000
If this strategy works for you, I always love to get a note. If you think that, Something I said still doesn't make sense or I could deliver it better.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:18.000
That's how it's gotten better over the years. So please give me that feedback. I have to see all you guys on tech stars universe.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I'm on the discord. Feel free to DM me there anytime. We talk about a lot of this stuff in the fundraising channel.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:27.000
AndThank you
