### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Vincent Lucero: Yeah, that actually really helps. So like the one good example you mentioned, like the charging. And I have a Tesla so like range anxiety, the idea that, like, I don't know if there's gonna be charger and toggle, for instance, is like a big one, right.

### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: and quotes it's very important to support every proposed J-t. Statement with actual quotes from interviews."

> "Lilliana Robinson: That's why it's really important to put the competitors for what people are currently using in this specific segment."

> "Lilliana Robinson: And remember, these are just titles that we give to the forces. But it's important to keep the correct direction, or else you're analyzing the forces in the incorrect manner."

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's not the detail or specific or describing, like what they're actually like giving up. So you should ask a little bit more about like what wasn't good enough about what they were using? Or do they get stuck? What was the issue there? Whenever people use these blanket terms like easier to use. Most of you all have easy to use in one of your quadrants"
