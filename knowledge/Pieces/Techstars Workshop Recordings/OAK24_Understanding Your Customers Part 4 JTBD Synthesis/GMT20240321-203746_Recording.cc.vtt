00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So let me hit record.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Cool. So I'll go ahead and share my screen.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There we go. Okay, so. In Jobs Sweden synthesis we're just going to review a few things and then at the end we're going to go through a few exercises and then I'll show you what great looks like.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So that's our agenda here. Neil, if you wanna call out questions in the chat, that would be awesome.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Sure.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So what we're expecting in week 5 is one to 3 synthesized jobs to be done statements.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And the key here is that each supported by detailed evidence. You'll hear us reference your synthesis of God to be done as your why before the why or your why behind the why people use both words that is because Jason Freed coined that phrase when he had Bob Mesta, Neil and a few others do jobs to be done with him, which we hint to that in one of our first lectures.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And he wrote up a blog post. I'm going to show you later called the why behind the line.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The whole purpose of that was to synthesize everything that he noticed and then put it into clusters.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So people call Jabs to be done synthesis. They call it clustering. They call it the Y behind the Y.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They call it analysis and then the next phase after this that you'll hear people talk about is implications and prototyping.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So you're making your synthesis now and then it's like, what does that mean for your business?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And if you get through your why behind the line. And it's amazing and you're ready to move forward.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And you finish that to do list that's in base camp, you actually unlock an implications and prototyping session with Neil.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Which we've done with a few founders and it's 2Â h. We really get into the nitty gritty of what this means for your business, what changes you should make, what experiments you should run.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And that is where the real magic happens. That's how it can directly inform your roadmap.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
On both product and marketing like we talked about. So what is it mean, each supported by detailed evidence?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And honestly, what does it mean synthesized JTVD statements? So for the evidence piece for each of your jobs to be done statements that are synthesized, so clusters, you're going to identify clusters and write.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A statement, an aggregated statement based on the patterns that you've seen. And we're going to get into that today.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But each one will be supported by the following evidence. You're 4 forces summary. The motivations behind it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Competitors for this specific segment. So what is this current this group currently use to solve this struggle? And quotes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's very important to support. Every proposed JTV statement with actual quotes from interviews. I complemented a few of you in your checkpoint presentations because some of you actually used quotes already without being told, which was awesome.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The best data you can use as evidence are the words of your actual customers that you interviewed or whoever you interviewed even if they were not your customers.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Competitors. Let's think back to the milkshake video, something that Clay Christians says in the milkshake video.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You'd be surprised, but the things that the person hired other than the milkshake was not something else that we would classify as like a traditional dessert.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It was a banana. It was a bagel and cream cheese. It was things like that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's why it's really important to put the competitors for what people are currently using in this specific segment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And you see in this, this is the face.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Sorry, I'm meeting people. Okay. You're also going to include a 4 forces summary.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And the motivation summary. And we'll go over this today just to refresh.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So refresh number one, this is the formal jobs to done statement. When I, I want to so I can't.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A couple of call-outs here. The when I should be extremely specific. I think in the checkpoint, some feedback that I have for everyone here is everyone's when could be a lot more.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Could be a lot stronger, really set us in that specific circumstance that your customer is in. Of course, when you aggregate them, when you come up with a conglomeration and make a statement for that cluster where you've identified a pattern, it will inherently be a little bit more high level.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And that's okay. You'll see that today. But I want to. This is huge because there's really no excuse here even in the clustering that I want to should not magically have your product spotted in there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Your customers that you interview. Or your non customers whoever you're interviewing you really shouldn't have been discussing your product at all.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So if they're feeding words that are clearly from your mouth describing your product, we can tell that it's kind of like a biased interview.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The i 1 statement should be in their words what progress they want to make. And then that's their motivation.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And so I can. That's the expected outcome. What is the end state? That one is pretty self-explanatory.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A lot of you got that, right? Let's go over the forces. So a few mistakes I saw in the checkpoints were that not everybody.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Made the forces in the directions that they go. So push and pull are forces that are driving the interviewee toward the switch moment toward the new solution.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Anxieties and habits are pulling them away from that new solution and keeping them in the old way or the status quo.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I saw some people write some habits or anxieties that were like moving the person toward the new solution.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Those are actually just pushes and pulls. Habits and anxieties are things that keep them from the new solution.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So if you wrote something that they were like worried about in anxieties that they were worried about for the old solution, that's really just a push.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Because anxieties are things that they're worried about with a new solution. Does anyone have questions about the forces?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Cause those were the main issues I saw in the checkpoint.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Can you maybe rephrase that one? Cause I agree with you. That was kind of like one of my misunderstandings.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I know I still don't even have you explained it. Yeah, you're in a different way.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, absolutely. So and thanks for asking, because I'm sure other people have that question too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So let's give an example. We were talking about. Switching cars. So I'm gonna switch from just a regular Toyota Ultima Sedan to a Tesla.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What are the forces behind that? Let me make some up. One push could be that my car is broken.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
My car does not work and so I'm looking and actively looking for a new car. One poll might be that all my friends have Tesla's or like I really follow the test full brand on social media and I think it's super cool.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Another poll could be like Trevor's. I want to be better for the environment. That is a pull because I'm not feeling a pain that is in a lure of a better life, a better version of myself that I'm chasing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Those are pushes and poles. An example of what actually I'll tell you what to do and I'll tell you what not to do.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think that would help. So the correct way to do have it and anxiety. One habit maybe I'm used to using gasoline.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I feel extremely, this is actually me. I feel like I don't know where the charges would be.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm not really sure how to do that. I live in an apartment that's kind of old.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I don't really think they have charges in the garage. I don't even know where to start with that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I don't want a Tesla. Old way. Anxiety, price, right? Tesla's are expensive.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I don't know if I could shell that out. Maybe I could buy a used one, but like honestly, just looking at the sticker price of the Tesla, I feel extremely anxious.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm gonna just buy the used. Ultima of the next year or something like instead of getting a Tesla my car is still broken but I'll just get like a used car that's more similar to my card because I don't wanna pay all that money.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's correct. What would be incorrect in this situation would be saying I have it or anxiety that is actually pushing you away from the old solution and toward the new solution.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So if I had any anxiety about the planet dying if I had an anxiety about like wanting to be better for the climate, that is incorrect.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Because that would be pushing me toward the Tesla. But an anxiety inherently like as a force moves you away from the new solution.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So you should revisit that and like think twice because that would actually be a pull. Does that make more sense?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, that actually really helps. So like the one good example, you mentioned like the charging and I have a test like range anxiety the idea that like I don't know if there's gonna be torture in Tahoe for instance is like a big one right is that actually anxiety in this framework?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Is that pushing you forward or away from the switch moment?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think it moves you towards the old way because if you if you worry about there being a chart I'm pretty sure it's moving you back to It's like I'm just going to use a normal gasoline car so it is the correct direction I just wanted to like.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That they.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yep, I was asking you as a quiz. That's exactly right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's moving toward the old solution, so that is in fact an anxiety. And remember, these are just titles that we give to the forces, but it's important to keep the correct direction.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Or else you're analyzing the forces in the incorrect manner.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Make sense.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Lilian, can we go back one slide to the formula you shared? Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that the point you made about the motivation piece in the middle here is made abundantly clear.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Because I don't think we've ever had a time where we've said it. In this forum and we don't end up seeing the thing that you're cautioning people not to do still translate in their statements.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I guess. I just want to make it clear like it's that we saw the trap happen like half of the time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
When you all presented a week and a half ago. So the trap is you're putting in the features and functionality of your solution as the motivation of the customer statement.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So just repeating what Liana said. Make sure that it goes well beyond. You using your own words to describe what you think the customer is saying that they need and instead either using their word.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
For understanding as hard as you possibly can. Clearly, as you possibly can, and their underlying motivation.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Why they want to move forward. With making progress towards that outcome that may or may not include. References to the functionality in your solution.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But just be really clear that you don't go into that track.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There would be a coincidence if it did reference functionalities in your solution, not them specifically naming it because they know what your product does.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The whole point of that is just bias. Like we don't want to introduce bias and that's why we're telling you about this trap.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ali? Oh, both of you. Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay. Yes. So, in our case, we don't have a product, right?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So we were interviewing about competitors. And we heard it specifically from many of them. I want a solution that is cheap, that is easy to use, that is simple.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And so as I'm revisiting because you gave me that comment, right? Like you're talking about features.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're not telling me what they want. I'm trying to revisit it and and think of you know why they want that and it's because they want a profitable business and they are not sure about how many.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Users they're gonna have. Is that the right review to be to be doing?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I think for competitors.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It is a little bit different. So the switch moment is them hiring the competitors, is that correct?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So things that would be pushing them toward the new solution. The whole purpose of interviewing competitors when you don't have interviewees is you're treating that competitor almost as like it's a proxy for your company.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So it really doesn't change very much in the analysis.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Does that make sense? Can I clarify deeper?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yes, yes, yes it does. I'm just thinking that they when they speak of specific features that they wanted in the product and that's why and they claim, well, I chose this one over this one because it is easier to use and I knew that my customers would appreciate that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I see.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So. Is, is that good enough or? Why do you need something that's easy to use for your customer?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Usually not. That's usually not good enough. Yeah, that's usually not good enough.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If somebody says, oh, this is the easier to use. That's not the detail specific or describing like what they're actually like giving up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So you should ask a little bit more about like what wasn't good enough. About what they were using, where did they get stuck?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What was the issue there? Whenever people use these blanket terms like easier to use. Most of you all have easy to use in one of your quadrants.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
As one of your lawyers. Just recognize like how undifferentiated you are by using such high level language and accepting that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I would employ you to dig deeper as you talk them to understand what they were actually considering as a difference or trade off.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alex, something that might be helpful is like really digging into the timeline. So it's not just like what were the features that made it easier.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Where were you? What was going on? Like what exactly was the issue and how How did something help you make progress in that moment?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A great example, are you in Team Starboard aware? I think you are, right? Yeah, so if you solve Valeria's presentation, like she gave a great description of a mom carrying a baby going to the post office and having to click through a bunch of different stuff at the post office like she doesn't even have hands she doesn't know how Windows works instead she's on her phone and it's 4

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
clicks. In the same situation like the next week instead they're using and 4 clicks later she has the same label.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So like that differentiation even if their ship wasn't their company it was a competitor that would tell you so much about the customer.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And informed the way that you would build your product. Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Last point on this, one trick to help with that, especially the easy to use piece that you mentioned, is just ask them what makes something hard.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So to provide the contract those that you're saying it's easy to be used when is it hard?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Well, the thing you used before, what made that so hard? So just put them in the place where they're describing what the meaning of the words are to them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Rather than you taking their word for it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay, thank you. That helps a lot of things.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Awesome. Okay, so another thing that we're gonna review. Let me see if I have it right here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Social, functional and emotional. So we haven't talked about this in a bit, but every single motivation, this is like a second dimension.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So motivations can be pushes polls, habits or anxieties, but there's this other dimension you can plot on there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Of the customers motivations which are what energy was it was it emotional functional or social and to be clear all 4 of these forces could have functional, social or emotional.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And we named some during the mattress interview. Actually have some that I'll pull up in another slide.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So to be clear, all of them could be any of the 3. This is a separate dimension to think about the energy and the forces.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Social, how others see me. This has anything to do with other people. Social media, the way that they are perceived by a group of people or people in their lives.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Functional, as like another word for physical. That could be like their own body, that could be their space.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Those are usually the major 2. It could also be like something not working like my car literally breaking is functional, but also me being restless in my sleep and like feeling tired is also functional.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And we have emotional, which in my opinion is the strongest one. And emotional is self-explanatory.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's how I feel.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Let's take Allies. Yeah, David.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Have you seen like any relationship between? These energies and like parts of the, statement like.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like, is there like a relationship between one to one or is it kinda like emotional could be in any part of the one eye versus what I want to versus so I can I kind of think.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Is that make sense?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
These are the, these are all 3, the motivations. So most of these will lie in the when I, sorry, in this I want to.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The when I is the circumstance. And a little bit of this will be in there but just to color the circumstance that I want to part is where these will lie like all 3 of them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Really. Except for in the one eye when you're setting up the situation sometimes these are relevant details as well.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The So I can part at the end doesn't usually have these motivations. That's much more of like the progress they're trying to make.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No, did you wanna answer that too? That was a really interesting question, David.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I was gonna use a fancy word in that I see them as orthogonal. But I know a lot of people like use that word these days.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But I mean it in that. They're, they're independent between the 2, but at the same time relevance in each phase.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So even at the with the desired outcome or expected outcome. Think about that, you know, the how other steamy pieces, the really easy one to think about with the example that Liliana used for Tesla, right?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So some people want to. Demonstrate what they have as a form of either status or fitting in socially.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So you can think of, you know, the applicability here can definitely be It's arguable that it's applicable across all 3 buckets.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think all 3 this and the forces and the jobs to be done statement are all in that relationship that Neil was describing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Brian?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I'm just curious, I'm just, there's my malicious intent in my question.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm just curious, where does addiction, for example, for is it possible that it falls and the 2 functional and emotional energy?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like I'm addicted to playing a game for Yeah, addiction.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You said addiction. Yeah. I think it falls in between.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Addition to what?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Addiction to the product, you know, say for example, social media, gaming, etc.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's interesting.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think it's largely dependent on the specific situation. So again, here we are in this world of generalizing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hmm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hmm. Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conceptually at a high level. And the whole point of this is to show you how different things can be at the low level, depending on who the person is.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hmm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And what the thing is. So I would caution us not to drift too far in conceptualizing categories.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay. Hmm. Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Here and instead going for an individual. These forces are at play. To what extent are they play for one person versus enough?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, cause when you said the word addicted, then you gave examples of what they could be addicted to.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like all 3 of your examples, in my opinion, would have like laid in 3 different. Social functional or emotional pieces here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Also, addiction is really also just a switch moment where they're continuing to come back. To said advice or product.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So you can just treat each individual instance. As a higher.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, but the real trick here is that all 3 of these forces are a play. All the time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They're just at different levels. Of of importance and severity for any given person.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's just like the 4 forces, how they're always up, but in different levels. Ali.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, just to give an example. To see how, you will categorize this, a lot of the therapies we interviewed were talking about you know wanting to have trusted opinions around the product.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Before they actually test it or use it. So there's something in the back of that which is, you know, the scientific.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A robustness and recognition in the in the medical community. I was thinking that is both social and functional because they want the device to be reliable.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They don't wanna hurt their patients, but at the same time, it's like, I want to use something that is accepted by the community.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
How would you see that?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I see. So functional doesn't have to mean like the efficacy of something. Functional means a lot more like in the space.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The physical world, I would categorize that as mainly social, although there are, I can name things from all 3 from what I'm hearing from you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So that sounds like a situation of one person. We're all 3 apply because all 3 apply for every person with an emphasis on social for that person.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And of course, like there's emotional piece, right? They would don't want to fail their clients functional is like the physical nature of like does this thing work especially because you're dealing with hardware.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then social, of course, has already been set. So all 3 apply there and yeah, we can identify the emphasis on social.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, and I have a quick example for functional. It might help color this too. I actually shared this example with Liana during the retreat.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There were some companies at 1 point that were very much outpoken and anti-uber.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
For a variety of reasons. At the time they would say, okay, well we're going to support Lyft instead of Uber for expensing, you know, our ride for our employees.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And one of the issues that I saw and identified with that and I actually gave this feedback to one of these companies.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Is where I was living. For safety reasons. The number of Uber. Uber, drivers available.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
In the area where I was either getting dropped off for friends and family were. Were much more than left.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So there was a functional limitation towards. Using one tool versus another. Even though for other reasons there was a desire to support one business the functional reality was if you wanted to get a ride to get dropped off in a certain place you had to use Uber.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Bye.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So that's just one quick example.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Mercia, before I take your question, Lisa, in the chat, I would. I would disagree with how you're slotting the forces in certain places.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And I would caution you. There aren't certain places that. Specific forces are supposed to go in the job suite on statement.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I think if you take it the way that you just wrote it out, it may lead to incorrect JTPD statements.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I would caution what you wrote, there. Merchant.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thank you, Jalo, for the unmute. Alright, shout out. So yeah, I was just thinking about the how in our interviews I notice these forces, especially in the anxiety, I mean these energy, sorry, especially in the anxiety side of things.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like for example, some users were saying, you know, I was afraid of using Cicada because I was worried that my audience would perceive me as being transactional money oriented, not in it for the art.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And other people were saying I was worried that it wouldn't work that the you know the product wasn't going to synchronize March wasn't going to arrive, you know, on time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So those are, you know, clear representations in my mind of these energies at play in a different quadrant in the anxiety spot.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's exactly right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, that was an example of both social and functional, right?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And a emotional.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, the first one was social, the second one was functionality. Yeah. Those are 2 separate, 2 separate people.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yep.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That was such a great point, which I'm glad you understand. All 3 of these can be in the bottom 2 quadrants as well.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thanks. Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So these are not only motivations pushing you toward the new solution. Richard just gave us a great example of a social and a functional anxiety.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So the anxiety is pushing you toward the status quo. It's almost like you could graph like a 4 by 3 and you could have every single thing that happens to your interviewee could be either social functional or emotional and either have an anxiety push or call.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You could plot it because every single one could be one of these. That was a great call out. Let's have their hand up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Are you all good?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I'm good. It was Mercia. If you want to give that example, I would have had a follow-up question for Neil in regards to like what was the emotional energy from, for that, Uber example he gave us, but it's cool.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Awesome.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Mercia gave us a great example. I mean, he didn't give the emotional part. It was just a function of social energy piece.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right, but we can deduce, right? What an emotional would be that would move you toward a status quo.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right. I'm good. Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Great. Awesome. Kevin?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I just wanted to put another perspective just also on the Uber piece. You know, Neil had mentioned about, from the side of obviously the passengers and, you know, like I mentioned in my story at 1 point way back when in the beginning, I actually, when Uber first started work for them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And I think that one of the things that broke the business model later on was because people were giving aspects to the customer side but not looking it from the driver perspective.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So that created core experiences for the customer. So it was sort of a double-edged sword where it fell into their into their business because drivers then were not making enough earnings from Uber to actually upkeep their cars and maintain their vehicles.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So it gave customers a more poor experience. So I think sometimes, you know, My question is, that when we're doing these jobs to be done, we're focusing on one area, like we're focusing on the restaurants, but I think it's helpful to focus on both areas because you'll get a fuller scope of both areas because you'll get a fuller scope of the picture.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, and if you remember in W 3, which relates to jobs to be done, I said if you're a marketplace or like if you have 2 sides, either you have different customers versus users or you're just a marketplace straight up and you have 2 sides.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You need to do 2 sets of jobs. The reason we isolate it, Kevin, even though you're exactly correct that it's very important to analyze both sides.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We isolate it because the people on either side have unique motivations then can be studied in a vacuum for each side.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then for your own like journey and what implications that makes and what changes you make, you must take into account both sides.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But making it unbiased and only doing a set of jobs to be done with one side makes the pattern recognition we're going to talk about so much easier.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So like I would caution pretty much all of you who are 2 sided like you Kevin to not do any implications or changes to your business as a result of the insights that you gain from just one half.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You just have to hold onto those and do the other half.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Great point. Jaila?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Sorry, so just to clarify for marketplaces that are B to B to C, we need to do a second set of jobs to be done for the in the supply side.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yes, every time you have 2 stakeholders. So there are multiple ways you would have 2 stakeholders.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
B 2 b to C being a 2 sided marketplace like Uber, having, your customers and users being 2 different things, which is basically BWC. Like Canvas is a great example of that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If I were going to make a competitor to Canvas, I would need to be interviewing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Universities as well as students and users. But I would start with universities.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So for us, because we started going through the understanding your customers checklists on base count, should we just basically duplicate that for supply side and then when we get to both supply and customers completed then we can have a meeting with Neil.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, because like Kevin said, it's a warning to not make or deduce like what it implies or what implications you should draw from the insights if you're only extracting like analyses from one side.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're gonna leave out a giant set of stakeholders that could. Pressure business.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right. Okay, thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You have, do you have another question?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Nope, sorry, just forgot to lower my hand.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay, All good.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Nelson.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I I was just gonna make the point that that's, that's where I'm stuck right now as I need to go reach out to people on the other side of the transaction.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I'm hoping to. Squeeze in a couple more classes, just based on the complication of the payments framework.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, well to be clear, I'm glad I'm glad you said that to be clear this synthesis that you're gonna present in week 5.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm only expecting that to be from one side. So all of our companies that have to do 2 sets, they usually do the second set during growth month.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So in month 2. So you do not need to finish 2 sides in the next 2 weeks. You just have to analyze the one side that you're doing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Everyone's just doing one set altogether. And if you have a business model where you need to do a separate set, will assist you during month too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So you don't have to rush through the second one. Just focus on one side that we chose that you're focusing on as you're learning.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And the second step will go way faster because you're not going to be learning. They'll just know how to do it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay. Alright, I'm assuming you're all good because you lowered your hand. Cool.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Awesome. Okay. So let's go back to the mattress interview. This is a great way for us to talk about like the social functional emotional in terms of the forces.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So who can chat out a push that you remember from the mattress interview from Brian Struckle?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We're going to be talking about the master syndrome basically for the rest of this. So try to jog your memories.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You couldn't sleep.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
He couldn't sleep. He was not sleeping. So physical pain. What does that sound like in terms of social functional emotional melting?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Functional.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Let's jump to habit. Have it is pulling you toward status quo.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Can anyone shout out something that was keeping Brian toward status quo?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
His sunken cost for the mattress here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, sun can cost for the mattress. So is that functional, social or emotional?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Probably emotional, right? He feels like he's, he's wedded to that problem or ready to that choice, sorry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's exactly right. Cause there's not actually something in the physical world. Here you spent the money and it's not like it's, like a financial issue.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
He just feels held to that. That's why it's like a fallacy. So emotional.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A 100%.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You learn to live with it, that's also like pretty emotional. Anxiety. Who can shout out an anxiety that was keeping him from switching to a new actress?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Good to be because he bought it from a family member. And then want, you know, then to fill the certain type of way.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
First, like the social.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah. And what is social? Exactly. I would call that social.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So there was there were these social worries that he had because he did business with his uncle. He didn't want to betray him.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So he had an anxiety keeping him from going to that in solution. That's a hundred percent right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So in those 3, we're gonna do the last one. But in those 3, we just hit 3 different motivations.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Energies of motivation in the social functional emotional with 3 different forces so as everyone seeing how these like crisscross they're kind of like a 4 by 3 diagram if you're into STEM and you wanna visualize it in that way.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Otherwise you can just think of the fact that they all can be anything. Like it's basically a many to many match.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Lastly, poll.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What, what pulled him to the new solution?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It was just

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I'm in Muta and Mark. Who is that?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's me, yeah, it's Mark. He was, walking into Costco and he saw the mattress.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, and what happened?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And the

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then. Do you decided to buy it?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right. Well, what did he do when he saw it? Do you remember? Exactly in the story, like what was different?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Did he lay on it?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No, he touched it. So he was able to touch it. Remember, he does want to lay on it because he's a German phone, but he was able to touch it and just feel it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So exactly like Mark saying, he saw it in the store and he was able to feel it. And that was a poll.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like the fact that Basically all of his fears were mitigated through this pull. It gave him surety.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
He felt extremely secure because he was able to try it but it also was alluring that he didn't have to lay on a Germany mattress.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That is a lot of different motivations. If someone want to pick one of the ones we just said and tell me if it's social functional or emotional, maybe Mark, you can unmute again.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I think the pool is functional. It was just happened in the moment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like in this case, it's functional, you mean?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yes, in this case. This specific case.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, exactly. I would say that's functional. Like the mattress was literally there in the way that they had it displayed and like advertised.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
He didn't have to lay on it, but they had a little thing he could feel. And then like, of course, there's the whole factor that his wife was there, which is completely separate.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And I would say is social. Okay, cool. So that was a great exercise to see how all of these can be different.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And I want you guys to keep that in mind when you're doing your. Synthesis.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So remember these principles, no one through these during jobs speed on part 2, but I just wanna remind everyone I'm gonna fly through these because we have an exercise to get to.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But number one, people buy for their own reasons. So try to leave your assumptions at the door.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Remember that each person is gonna buy for different reasons and all we're trying to do is identify patterns in what they tell us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Nothing is random and everything is caused. So that's a really good point. Herkening back to what Ally asked, like if they just say it's ease of use or like I don't know it was just there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There's no such thing as an impulse buy or a random purchase. Everything is caused. So like Bob said in the chat, if not why, when.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's how you can get it out of people usually.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Principal 3, the struggle creates demand. So really focusing on the energy caused by that struggling circumstance or what Bob Mester calls the struggling moment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's where you're gonna find the like context for your job to be done statement. If you don't focus on that struggling moment, you're going to feel lost in the timeline of this person making the purchase.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay, and at the end of the day everyone's buying to make progress so we're just trying to identify what progress they're trying to make and how this certain switch helped them make it so that we can replicate that in our own business.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Let's see, this is just a plot of all of the. Okay, let me escape. Let me switch to the next slide.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I plotted everything we just talked about, but you guys got it. Spot on. So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna talk about the mattress interview as if we are doing the analysis.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I took the liberty of making a job sweet on statement that I feel represents Brian pretty well. It could be better, but this is what we're going to go with.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
When my wife calls me out for being cranky after not sleeping well for 5 years, I want to stop tolerating my inadequate mattress and poor sleep so I can give my kids more attention and ease my wife's frustration.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is what I would assume. Represents Brian. So if I were doing the job speed on checkpoint last week and I'm running a matches company and I interviewed Brian.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This would be something I would have put on the board as one of my statements for an interview I've done.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Bob, please.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I don't know if there's another statement coming or not, but this feels unfairly on selfish or to self lists, I think.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Is that how he came off? Tell me, what did you think of Brian?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Personally, that's my take. I think he has his own motivations. Yeah, I mean, that husband of the year, father of the year.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Well, he talks about that in the in the saving, but also I have my own bias that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like. He does but like He also like he knows he has good sleep when he travels on sleeps on other mattresses.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
He has his own frustrations. He goes through his own, like you said, he buys for his own reasons.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Maybe those reasons are his own social reasons. But he also has his own functional emotional ones too that I don't think are a hundred percent externally motivated Like he's got his own shoulder and back pain, etc.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, and at the end of the day, you'll have a full force diagram for every single one you do.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's just what like Neil says, where is the energy? So you can have a different opinion.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A 100% welcome it. When I looked at the force that I would plot for that mattress interview, like I said, had on the last slide, I actually wrote them all out.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The one that I felt was the biggest energy was when the wife called him out. He wasn't willing to do anything without that catalyst and the fact that it was the wife calling him out for being cranky where she's basically like you need to step up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We're not going to keep having a husband and a father who's like this. It's been like this for 5 years like you need to fix it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
He makes the change. So that's just what I felt was like the most energetic moment of the interview, cause it showed like what catalyzed the change, but he could be more selfish than I'm giving him credit for it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And I could be analyzing this in like a biased way.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Well, Liliana, I think what they're saying, I think what they're saying is that especially the so I can the expected outcome.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's very much a. It's it's it's There's there's a total opposite world of that of motivation. Yeah, exactly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's a story book version of the. Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Nice. It's too nice to Brian.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hey.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah Well, I mean, just Sometimes one could argue you want to give your kids less attention and like maybe The wife frustration isn't as high priority, but like it through your lens that That's being written, which is Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's very much me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's very Yeah, it's very selfless. Yeah, I think I think if I could be so I think it's what Lilian wants to see in this guy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There we go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
In Brian. This is 100% true. You are a hundred percent right. I believe in Brian.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And his good will, but I'm dead. This is the funniest reaction I've ever had to this slide.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is how Brian should behave.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But basically this is a good point that you bring up of is that we all have our own biases.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So maybe strive to be more in the middle and remove your own personal biases, which I clearly didn't in this slide.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think we want to move on but to me personally I feel like this JTVD is more aligned for someone for a therapist or family therapist or something like that because I It's a lot much more going on other than just a bad in sleep, you know, getting good sleep.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I appreciate that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So if this would be for a counselor.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's true. Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No, but art at the same time though, think about it. Like if you if you can get this deep even in the form of an ad.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like why do you think these all these ads exist like that are super, you know, emotional and motive, high level, they're not even speaking to the specifics of the product or service, it's more brand related.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You can use. Insights like this to craft those types of messages and set those kinds of stages. So I agree with you on like this could get deep as therapy, but at the same time, a lot of marketers can leverage these emotional forces and understanding to actually reach a, you know, an audience in a really compelling way.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Gotcha.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's like when you see a targeted ad that clearly they use your cookies to know more about you and you feel like they know you on an uncomfortable level and the thing they're saying, solves the problem that you exactly have.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If you've ever had that moment, that's exactly what we're trying for. Here, your jobs to be done.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Dan?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I have a question. Is it the old, aligned with the emotional forces? All these 3 statements.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think the not sleeping well piece is functional. And I think the wife calling him out is social. And him being cranky as emotional.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then him wanting to give the kids more attention and ease the wise frustration as both social and emotional.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
When he talks about inadequate mattress, that's also functional. But the purpose here isn't really to analyze like how great of a statement this is.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I can agree with all of you like we could workshop it and make it better. If anyone wants to give me one, I'll update the slide.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But the purpose is really to show you how to do synthesis. So. Does anyone have questions?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This words, yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like before I move on, regarding like how to draft this statement. Outside of the veracity of it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, Nelson.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What? I mean, I'm wondering, you know, when we when we're trying to encapsulate.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Something like the main takeaway, you know, it feels like we're trying to tap into the strongest energy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right, whether that is the functional lack of sleep or whether that's the disruption to the marriage or whatever.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And so, I mean, there is some level of. Subjectiveness, I guess, as we as we look at it, but I think, you know, there could be like 3 candidates, right?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Or 5 candidates like, you know, problems. And we're trying to say like, this is the biggest, right?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like all the other ones exist, but this is the one that we're gonna go build an ad campaign or like, you know, and so, you know, Just I was just thinking through like how am I gonna evaluate and stuff like well I'll go for the biggest one the most obvious S.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's, that's very well said. That's exactly what I want from you guys.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So when you're looking at each individual interview on the one person level. What did they express? Where was the energy?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
When were they the most passionately speaking? What did they repeat the most times? What was like the biggest move that they made in their lives like caused by?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Those are the things I look for to try and identify. The strongest piece of energy. And like I honestly didn't like analyze this very deeply in the way that you guys need to analyze it super deeply.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So that's why it seems super subjective and like we probably could come up with a more objective statement here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But for yours, wherever the most energy lives, that's what you want to extract. Because there are a lot of different motivations.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We call them big hires and little hires. And there are like a lot of little hires that you'll identify in your interviews.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But find that big hire to try and identify the patterns. We want the most energy. That's what's going to make people most likely to buy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I love the way you said that. So you're going to repeat this process for each interview.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You already have done that for however many you had done up to your checkpoint presentation. So each of you have extracted at least a couple jobs to be done statements for each interview.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I take the liberty of creating a company. So we're all going to be part of my new company called Matrix Stars.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So we're doing that. We did the mattress interview pretend we're Bob and we conducted that with Brian and we did it 6 more times.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So we have a total of 7 interviewees. Of course, it would be better to have 10 to 15, but for the purpose of this exercise, we have.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We repeated this process. We interviewed 6 more people and we came up with job speed on statements for those people.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But first, this was our screening criteria. So when we decided to start this jobs, we can set our screening criteria.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
For this round of interviews was. Working Fathers who travel more than 8 weeks out of the year and have bought a mattress in the last 90 days.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is what we screened. We found 7 people. Brian was one of them. And our learning objective here is really like what direction should we take our new products?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They are trying to come, mattress stars, we as a company were trying to come up with a new product line.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We want to know how to. Market it to people and what the product should be, what features it should have, like what direction does this specific subset of customers we've identified want.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So let's talk to them. What we came up with, interviewing number 2 and it's a little small so you might wanna zoom in on your screen if you can't see this.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Number 2. So Brian was number one. This is the next guy. He's what we came up with for him is what I'm renovating my house and have limited time between long work trips.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I don't want to be bothered with purchasing a new matches for my bedroom. I want to be able to quickly get a mattress that I know works without having to pick it up or try it out.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I can spend the most time with my family as possible in between those work trips. The next person.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
When my limited family time gets trumped by bad flights, I want my kids to get better sleep and be cranky so I can spend more quality time with my wife.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Number 4, when I am fumbling through important meetings at my job, due to headaches and I get home stressed every day.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I want to ensure I get enough sleep throughout the week so I can take my mind off work on the weekends and focus on spending time with my kids.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Number 5, when I get into a fight with my partner and she spends the night on the couch because I'm tossing into turning I want a mattress that helps me avoid waking up so we can both sleep through the night uninterrupted.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So he's waking her up by passing turning they get in a fight she sits on the couch then he buys a new mattress Number 6, when I have a child leave for college and have to adapt to a new empty nasty lifestyle, I want to utilize their old room as a guest room and update their old nineties mattress so I can host my friends and family as I transition into a new life

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
stage. Lastly, number 7, when my wife is bothered by my snoring and becomes irritable with me, I want something to help me stop snoring so I can strengthen my marriage by letting my wife sleep more peacefully in our shared bed.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So that was a lot. We have 7 total. There are 6 on the board here. What patterns can you guys immediately identify?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Maybe call out like what numbers and tell us how you see it. Dan.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I see a lot of, lot of family, almost all of them except for 4. Except for number 4 all of them are family yeah and social energy and that's a big part of their motivation.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, and I would go even more specifically, Merchat. Some, are like they're all family except one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Some are his wife, some are his children, right? So it can be even deeper too. Dan?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're on mute, Dan. Sorry, okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And you're muted.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They all have it. They all have a very specific struggling moment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh, okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. So.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh, hold on guys. Dan, go ahead.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I think it's summarized everything beside the interview. 6 I think it's pretty much like MATTERS is a, FEMALE SAVE, or like NARRATOR SAVER, right?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So, pretty much it's all related to like family member relationship and some point and it's all tied to life.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You know work rest balance right so

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, and it's really interesting that you guys are calling out 6 as like an oddball, cause I actually felt like 6 was extremely similar to another one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So there are you're gonna see there like a myriad of dimensions that you can analyze the patterns in and just depends what you're seeing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What you're gonna end up having each of you is one to 3 clusters. It might just be one cluster.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They're all perfectly aligned. All the patterns match 2 or even 3. I wouldn't go more than 3 since we're only doing 10 to 15 interviews.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But you'll see how I decided to make these patterns and you'll see how they differ from some of the stuff you guys are saying right now because we pick out different things.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So there's really no wrong answer. And you guys will be able to go back if you want to change the patterns that you create even in week 5 when you present.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Kelvin?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, number one to number 4 most of them appears to be very busy with limited time. So that limited time, limited family time keeps coming up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah. That's a, that's a great pattern here. David?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I was just say count what you're saying what number 6 with number 2. I saw like kinda like the renovation or kinda like it was almost like home projects that wanted to be started.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I noticed that too. Yeah, go ahead.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh no, that was it. That was it. That's what like stick up to me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's exactly what stuck out to me from 2 and 6, David. I'm glad you said that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But do you see how other people saw, to as being the same as a bunch of others and 6 being on a loan island.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So there are many different ways that we could draw patterns here. And there's really no right or wrong answer.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's just what we decide to go after. Yeah, Neil.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah. And, L, unfortunately I have to jump out. For a call, but I'll just want to say one last thing as you hear from everyone else, which is like literally what you all are doing right now by weighing in and looking at these statements.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Is effectively the process of synthesis that you would do. Both your and like interviews and clustering.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So you have these statements, you're in a room with your team, maybe with me too. We're looking at these statements on a whiteboard or on a visual somehow.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And we're having a discussion of where we're seeing the overlap. This is actually how it works right now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like's effectively guiding you all through what the process should be.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
See you all tomorrow.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Exactly. Antonio or Ally?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Actually, David, just a little bit confused by introduced 6 because I couldn't see the pattern there as if it was time or what it was.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They wanted a mattress that others talk about quality of sleep this one didn't but now I see the relationship with 2 more like I want this to happen.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
In a moment in time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, David, did you wanna respond?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh no, I had another question.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I wanted to respond.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, go ahead.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I literally did this with my guest room is my wife and I had an old crappy mattress.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then we finally bought a house and then we got a new matches for our guest room because we wanted our guests to kind of have like a nice sort of hotel experience when they came to visit like they got their own room they got their own bathroom right next to the kitchen and all that but like the mattress decision was deliberately high quality not just some it's just a guest room.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Cheap piece of junk.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I love that. Maybe you are at 2 36. You'll never know. David?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, how do you go about? Again, like not showing in your feature set when it comes to clustering like I think this is easy for us because none of us are building out mattresses and so it's like Almost so objective, but like.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Any ways that you maybe could like suggest like we put in practice and make sure we're not like Oh, this cluster is the feature I'm building and this cluster is another feature we're already building kind of thing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It shouldn't be features at all. We're thinking about the circumstances that they're in.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So we're not, do you see that most? Pretty much everyone, everyone who noticed a pattern.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Did not talk about what the person needed. They just talked about the circumstance they were in. So put out of your head all of your own features, what you're trying to build.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Honestly, just pretend like you're not even building anything right now and you're only analyzing the people you talked to.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're not trying to analyze it in terms of what should tucks do. That comes later.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is not part of your company. Honestly, you should think of this as a completely separate side project.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's nothing to do with Tux because we're just learning about the problem space. And when you're clustering, it's really helpful to not think what did the people need.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We're not thinking like, oh, these 3 need this this product or this feature and that's why they should be together.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's these 2 are in this situation. You even said it, David. You said 2 and 6 are renovating their house or like making changes in their house.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You didn't talk about what they need. So we're not talking about any features. So you already on a good track.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I would just try really hard to Separate, compartmentalize what you know you're building in your business and we're working on the business with this.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is like a research project. Totally separate. Alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So would you say that like it's kinda hard to like not.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Guide them towards. Responses that's like your business. When the tone is already set in the search criteria.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That kind of aligns with your business, you know? And then the questions that you Acts. May.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Be similar like a discovery. Question almost, you know, I kind of struggle with that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Since me being vulnerable here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, let's talk about it. So what was your screening criteria?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It was looking for small business owners or startups. That have recently, off.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Well, have recently, Hired a agency to conduct your first screen round screenings and stuff like that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So, Yeah, that was it. And it's essentially our business, you know?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yes, so when you started asking them, were you asking them specifically about their personal experience hiring the thing that they hired?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Did you keep it in a box? I know it's hard, but that's what I wanted to caution.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If you start asking questions that would apply to your business, I can. Imagine you're straying away from the timeline of the specific purchase that they made.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, so allow the questions. We're around like they're experience and like when they did it and why they did it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But a lot of the responses were a lot of, it was a very professional, right? Like what you may want to hear in a job interview almost and it's like kind of happen to like no I don't wanna hear about that like I wanna hear about like how did it make you feel like how did that impact you personally things like that just to kinda make them really think about like, okay, how did it impact your work life

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
balance? Where you working, you know, late, things of that nature and trying not to like. Have my biases creep in because I work in this space of recruiting, you know, so it was very challenging for us to kind of like.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Keep it non our product, you know, based questions.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
100%. I think, yeah, sorry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So, No, no, go ahead. I'm sorry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think everyone on this call can relate to that. So what you're describing is what people face every single time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But from what you're saying, it sounds like you guys are on a great track. And the more reps you get in, the more comfortable you'll get with the interviewee, the more you'll be able to get them to open up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And tell you even more and get past that like formalities stage because I'm sure you guys are nervous too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I used to be when I was trying to do these interviews and the more natural it becomes for you, the more the person will start opening up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then you'll be able to get even deeper. But what you're describing everyone faces. It's really hard to set like get out of our own skin and then like set aside the biases of knowing the business, knowing the space really well.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Setting aside all the assumptions we have, a lot of you have worked in this problem space for a year, if not multiple years.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And now we're going back as if we don't know anything and like playing dumb and trying to reset all of our knowledge.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So thank you for sharing that. Art because I'm pretty sure everyone feels that way. It's completely normal.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's just a learning curve. This is a brand new thing. I think as you continue doing interviews you'll see even more success.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Does that make sense?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No, yes, it did. It did. Like I literally have to reset my mind. Like I've never lived in the space before.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So it's hard. Yeah, but.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Exactly. Yeah, cause you have these assumptions. But the assumptions were based not on, it wasn't grounded in specific like customer discovery work that we did.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right, so that's why it's good to go back and address them. I mean, a lot of your assumptions will be correct, but some of them won't be correct.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And those key ones we find that we're incorrect preconceived notions are going to be the thing that makes it breaks your business.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So that's why we start with this.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Got it. Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I wanna say thanks, Art for being vulnerable. I also feel like in my past experience the Do you fall mode I'm in is a lot more analytical.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It seems like you're also the kind of guy who can quickly get to solution when a problem is presented to you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And I found like the kind of folks who can easily Read between the lines or ask the sorta questions.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
To kind of get to the emotional why it's behind the wise like they're giving you the first wise And then getting to the root of the wise, be otherwise, I think that's like a extremely rare skill set, which I think is part of why we're learning how to do it in this framework, but.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
One of the things I've taken away when I've gotten coached on this in the past is focusing less on what they say.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And trying to dive deeper on. Little bit of how they're saying it but also asking completely different questions that aren't even getting to the response I want.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There more I mean they're not giving me the sort of like transactional type questions like we know why we're here we know why we're meeting a screen do as like a potential interviewee for a reason but then like the things I really care about are the things behind why you did show up in my criteria how did you get to be qualified on those specific terms and then understanding what's behind those that's like I think

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
a It's not even like twice as hard as like 3 times harder and so I think it's fair to say We're all gonna struggle with it until we get to some level of proficiency.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But there are people out there and these are like the folks who are like tightens of industry or tightens of sales or stuff who eventually figured out, but I don't think anyone knows it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
By default.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's really well said, Bob. Thank you both, Art and Bob for sharing. Neil always calls this like a muscle.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So you guys are like working out like in the gym trying to figure out how to do this and like soon the muscle will grow and it'll be much easier.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
SPEAKER. One So just stick with it. If everyone could do this and gain like valuable customer insights, then everyone would win.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But startup game is really hard. And it's hard for a reason. And so if we can practice code, I guarantee all of you will be that much more successful.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So are we good to continue with how to cluster? Let me see how we are in time. You're doing well.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Perfect. Okay, so you guys identified some patterns. Here are the patterns I identified and it's not right or wrong.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is just what I did, but I'm giving you an example walking me through what you're going to do for your business in your set.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So we have our 7. I looked at them. Thought about them, looked at the forces that I had for them and then identified the following clusters.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I put 2 insects together like we discussed in depth. 3 and 4 I put together and I'll get into why and then 5 and 7.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I arguably could have done just 2 clusters and you'll see. The 2 that could be combined, but in my opinion things were different enough that I could put them in a different one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's all about how much you guys want to put together versus like have no common, no differences within your clusters.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's much easier when you only have a couple of clusters, so I would like air on the side of having like 2 but these are the 3 I came up with so you're going to decide you're going to link them together and then for each cluster you identify you're going to write a conglomerated or an aggregated job speed.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So here are the 3 I came up with. So interview 1 2 3 or 1 3 4. I made when I am having emotional struggles within my children due to lack of sleep.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I want to increase rest by purchasing a new, more comfortable mattress so I can improve the quality of my limited time at home with my family.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So as you can see, I broke up the problems with the children and the problems with the white. But you don't have to if you guys wanted to make that one you could put cluster one and 2 together and 3 could be separate.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So you see how that's kind of subjective and it's up to you. It's much more an art and not a science.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Plus or 2, 5 and 7. When my partner and I disrupt each other's sleep at night and it causes tension in our marriage, I want to update our arrangements specifically to stop this issue.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I can improve our sleep quality and in turn our relationship. So if we go back to 5 and 7.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
5 is when they fought because he tosses and turns at night. 7 is when she was bothered by him snoring.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So they're both kind of like a medical issue that is upsetting the spouse and has not a lot to do with the children.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So in my head I saw those as their own cluster. Why we're going to market to a working father who travels basically my screening criteria, I would think that the cluster to folks would want to see a completely different ad than the cluster one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But I can also see how they're similar enough where if we wanted to go one layer more vague, they could be together.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Recoster 3, these people fell into by screening criteria just like the others, but they had a completely different circumstance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So what I came up with for them is when my family is going through a transition or we could even call it like a house transition.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I want a quick and easy way to obtain a comfortable mattress that fits the new requirements of the space.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I can begin utilizing the new room in line with my family's new requirements as quickly as possible.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A great example here is in the I want if I were building a product if I already knew I wanted to build a product that like helped people decide on what mattress to get in a new space.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Maybe I made a feature where they have like 3 day imaging, you can project the bed in the room and see it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It would be really tempting to put that here. Like I want an app that will show me the bed in the space so that I don't have to, like guess.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But we didn't do that. There's a reason we didn't because we want to be a lot more unbiased.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We're not inserting what we want to build. We're just talking about what the person wants.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So in this situation, both of those people. One is to be quick, easy. They wanted to fit the space and they want to begin utilizing the new room as fast as possible.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Does anyone have questions about these clusters?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I kinda had one takeaway. Earlier when they were these were all listed top to bottom one of the potentially different ways of clustering that I saw is one is more rare yet important life event-based kids going to college just moving etcetera and others are more social pressure or things that were more likely to tolerate and then eventually run out of patience with.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hmm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oriented like, don't wanna sleep on the couch anymore. Don't wanna annoy my wife because her battery for tolerating snoring is giddy low.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
100%.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I thought like maybe there's like a theme there. Maybe I'm thinking too much about AI and machine learning.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Maybe there's something there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No, I, not at all. I, I think that's completely right. So what would be an example of a marketing implication you could make if we put the enough is enough people together like what would you run?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, that for that one it'd be more emotional triggering basis like I'd love to I mean I'm not a creative like that I got my immediate company but I'm not a creative in that sense of like coming up with scripts in like a storyboard or anything but like I would imagine someone might.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Put together a scene where You know, they're obviously run out of patients. There's yelling.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's very emotionally triggering and then it's the beds fault. Something simple like that, but like.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That sort of line up thinking. It's kinda, I don't know if I'm answering your question anymore, honestly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, no you are. That was it. So this is great, Bob. But thank you for kind of intellectually sparring with me because this is what you guys should be doing within your team.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
When someone presents like, oh, maybe it should be clustered this way. One way I think of it is, well, could I come up with a way to either build the product in a certain way or market to these people in a certain way.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Marketing is easier because it's more intuitive. That would cover everyone in that cluster.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And I think the answer for that, with Bob just give me an answer, is yes. So we could do like 1 3 4.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And 6. No, 1 3, 4, 5, and 7 all together and we could come up with something that would cover them all and be intriguing to them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I think that's a very valid cluster. And then you actually clustered. Yeah, go ahead.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Tell me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah. To your point like the first time I saw this I was doing what you were asking but you caught me off guard because you asked about everything but 2 and 6 and I was primarily thinking about oh you don't be a cool commercial for a mattress company is Kids are going off to college or you just moved in and now it's time to buy a mattress.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think that's relatable. I'm not saying the other stuff is it, but like it seemed like lower hanging fruit to me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, and see, so when you get to here, so you would put 2 and 6 together in cluster 3 anyways, like the same, but you would do it for a different reason.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So maybe your JTVD statement would be a lot more focused around what I'm going through a big life event.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like I said, through a transition, but maybe we would call it that. And then you would come up with something that would market to them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It sounds like if this was your company, if you were a mattress stars. You feel that there is a lot more energy in cluster 3 and that's the one you would choose to go after.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I'm sure a lot of you have the question like, okay, what happens after I have 1, 2, and 3?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So that was awesome, Bob. Thank you for being an example. What happens after I have 1, 2, and 3?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's up to you guys. What do you want to do? Sometimes there's low hanging fruit.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Sometimes it's, oh, I can easily capture that cluster by making XYZ change or just running this ad.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Sometimes it's, do we wanna just pivot the whole business because cluster one is clearly where the most energy is.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's morphine. People are like dying to have this solved and we're not currently catering to them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Cause that's what a lot of our companies have done in the past after John Sweet. They realize there's this cluster that is just screaming to be served so they'll pivot to help them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's up to you. Maybe cluster 2 is already who you're serving and you just have better insight.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So now you know how to target them even better. It's completely up to you, but this is the like dashboard of insights I want you guys to have.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And when you do the Y before the Y, each one should be supported by that set of. Evidence.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The 4 forces, the motivation, the current competitors or existing alternatives and the So that's really all I have for you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm gonna give you some examples, but I'll take some questions now. Kristy?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Luanna, when I look at the, I see like the different stages, right?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So There's a couple, no kids, and then they have kids and then then empty nesters.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
How do we? How do we factor that in like or does it matter like? Is, is that a factor?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, remember not to. Well, it's only about circumstance. So it only has it only has merit in as much as the circumstances the same.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So the empty nesters are actually going with a guy that has a whole family. But he just happens to be renovating his house because the situations actually line up perfectly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They both have this extra room that they want to furnish with the mattress. It has nothing to do with the demographic of being like an older couple younger couple.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Do I have kids? Do I not have kids? Those 2 like Bob. Said he can think of a commercial that perfectly markets to those 2 guys even though they're in completely different life stages.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They're in the same circumstance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ali?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, so, for those of us who are b 2 b to C, so we need to do different.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Stakeholders. I understand that, you know, we can start thinking of features or ads or kind of like redirectioning, but for any pivot my intuition tells me I need to study all the stakeholders rather than just rush into.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Making people we thought all of that what would be the advice there

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I mean, I did this without thinking of that. That was just a trick I was giving you guys.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's something we teach our undergrads to do. You guys should be able to recognize patterns based on the person circumstances like without thinking about implications or future things you would do.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like I identified the following patterns just like you guys did. We had a whole discussion about it. No one was talking about like what we might do with them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You guys were just talking about the similarities you're seeing. So I would just do it based on the job statements that you have and the interviews that you did.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You'll be able to. Antonio.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Liana. Yeah, I have a follow-up question also. If you go back to the clusters.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So, and maybe you said that I just didn't, didn't understand it correctly, but, to me, like these 3 cluster, they'll talk about the same product, which is a comfortable mattress.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And it's almost seems like the only difference is the marketing message that I'm gonna put on my landing page or the target customers I'm gonna address.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Huh.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But the product is the same. So why would you what would we call it people in this case? Because it's the same product.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Well, I wanna challenge that though, cause is the product the same? Because I see 3 different products here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
People People have different reasons to buy. I think And what was the Neil said that earlier? Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, and the different reasons to buy directly inform what the product should be. So I see, so you understand the difference in the marketing for these 3?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Antonio, right? So for the product. Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Do you understand the marketing? Yeah, and I don't understand the marketing, but, ultimately the products.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Is the same, isn't it? I mean, is it comfortable? No.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Well. Is it though because it sounds like cluster one is very important. It's very important to him for it to be comfortable.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Cluster 2, what were their problems? If you go back to 5 and 7, number 5, he's tossing and turning.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So it sounds like he has an issue. Number 7, he's snoring, which is also an issue.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I would probably call it a medical issue. I want to update our sleeping arrangements specifically to stop the issue.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Does that sound like just a comfortable mattress? Because to me that sounds like, oh, if we want to cater to this group, we're going to come up with.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Movement isolation. We're gonna come up with like the incline mattress to stop the snoring.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like I can think of a lot of product implications that could come from cluster 2 that would be different than cluster one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Then cluster 3 outside of it being a mattress cluster 3 is so much more about how you're buying the mattress.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So like Bob said, why they buy? So yeah, they want a comfortable mattress, but their main thing is that they wanted to fit the requirements of the space and for it to be quick and easy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If you remember number 2 said, I don't want to be bothered with going and trying it out or having to pick it up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So number 3 is a lot more about how to buy it. So I can imagine a product for number 3 could be the same literal matches as number one, but you would need to change your product.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Maybe you can see the mattress in the space. Maybe you do delivery to the house. Like maybe you're one of the only matches companies that like brings it straight there within a few days.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Doing direct to consumer online. Do you see how like the product could change in many different ways based on the clusters?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Cool. Dan?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So with the, statements, we almost like summarize, like, the series of interview in like, multiple clusters.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Should we try to summarize, the forces in one? D to see the bar.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Or

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah. And not even a diagram. I want like a write up. So I'm gonna show you some examples, but and I'll post some examples later because we're running out of time, but like basically each cluster should just be one page.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Do you mean the jobs to be done statement? Right the forces just give one liner like really quick.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is supposed to be an aggregation so you will have all the evidence on the back end but I want you to summarize it and synthesize it into one document.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So basically cluster summarized, with the, with the all the ingredients, right? Forces.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right here. So for each job suite on statements, take cluster one, I would have these 4 bullet points.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
To support cluster one and then I would do it again with clusters 2 and 3. Thank you for clarifying.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Got it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's a great question. Okay, Snow.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's a little bit, I mean, It's not about the cluster, but so some of our, interviewees taking the cluster as they can be clustered as a yeah consultancy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Cool for their own customers so they can use our product to fulfill their end customers. In that case, do we need to reach out to the end customers?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's a little bit tricky for me. How I can

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think we'll have to work with you on a 1 on one basis. If you've identified a second group of stakeholders, might I would lean toward yes but I want to know more about your situation so just for the sake of time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay, and we'll dive into it with you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay, thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Cool. Ali, I'm gonna hunt your question until the end just so I can show you guys examples before we run out of time, but I'll stay on to answer question.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So let's look at some why before the Wise. Just so you guys know, this is extremely confidential.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Jake has asked us not to share this outside of programs. So make sure that you keep this. Between us, but this is Jake's wide before the line.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So before why they buy, there's why they shop. And he gives a preamble up from Jason Fried's article, which I'll show you. But these are the clusters Jake came up with.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Remember, this is like Duolingo for cooking. He's talking about people who have signed up for cooking apps.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Or signed up for his specifically and these are what he came up with. So one is there's got to be a better way to spend my time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So this is people feeling incompetent. This is people scrolling on TikTok watching reality TV.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They are fearful. They're wandering their time when they're free, but they don't know what to do.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The more nights that pass, the more useless they feel. They're spending time with content instead of on themselves.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Number 2, I don't offer enough to the people I care about. This is someone who feels like they're a taker and not a giver.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They feel like a significant other cooks for them every night or their friends constantly host them over for dinner and they never give back.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So they worry that it might build to a breaking point. And they need to gain a skill to be able to care for their loved ones the way that they care about this person.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Number 3, I need to stop eating bad food. This is people who just keep ordering uber eats.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They, you know, have microwave food, fast food, people who just aren't able to get like healthy food on demand if they're not cooking it themselves and it's a lack of agency and they just it comes on variable because they feel so bad about themselves.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It feels so unhealthy. Maybe it's resulted in some health issues and they know I've eaten great food before when I cook it tastes terrible and so they need something that gets a great meal in front of them, but also taste good.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Number 4, how can I get my friends to hang out with me? So this one it's different than the not giving back.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Those people think that their friends are and together are gonna like break up with them. This person is I'm maybe I moved to a new city.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Maybe I have some friends but I don't hang up with them enough. I wanna learn to cook so that I can have a thriving social life.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
These are usually people who recently graduated from college and are now experiencing a loss of friendship where it was like bubbling and blooming all the time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They're in their social life before and now things are different. So maybe if I start cooking, loneliness will turn into independence.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Maybe my friends will make the trip across. Town to try new recipes. So these are the 4 that Jake.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Like sectioned off and identified and they ended up going after There's got to be a better way to spend my time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And the people that are eating bad food because that's where the biggest energy was. So this one was an extreme push.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
People are eating terrible food. They feel terrible about themselves. Number one had the most people and they had a really great CMO, they still do, and they know that if they marketed to these people that are like just scrolling on TikTok, they would be able to capture that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So those were the 2 reasons they chose one in 3. They didn't Get rid of 2 and 4.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They just went after one and 3 during tech stars. I'm sure they've looked back around to try and capture more if you guys remember the diffusion of innovation curve so you can always expand your niche but they started with one in 3.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And they were able to do really well. So they used a lot of marketing to to capture these people that are spending their night scrolling by using words that the interviewees in this cluster spoke.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So when you speak the customer's language, it resonates and it worked because a lot more people started converting onto their app.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then for number 3, they directly changed the product. As a result of the things that these people said.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So instead of having a bunch of like dessert SPs and things like that, they focus on the fundamentals.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
How do I cook good food that tastes good? Let's teach you. So they taught them about seasoning.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They taught them about searing things that make the food taste really good without adding a whole lot of extra calories.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The second thing I want to show you guys before we wrap is Jason Freed's article and I'm gonna follow up with all of this stuff.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But lastly, this is what sparked it all. And they already gave you guys. Foreshadowing of this, but if you remember these little icons, the clusters that base camp came up with and then directly change their product and the pricing model as a result, we can't keep working like this.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is people who have, have had something bad really happen, in their lives as a result of their work life being chaotic.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They don't know, they missed meetings, it feels overwhelming and they just feel like their hair is on fire.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The next one is we can't mess up like that again. This is the people that lost the client due to a miscommunication and not being organized.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
As a team, they look at each other and they just say, we're not gonna survive if we if we mess up like that again.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Number 3, this project isn't getting off the ground. These are people that are trying and trying to make progress and is just not working and it gets a breaking point.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So rather than losing a client or feeling like their hair is on fire, they're annoyed that they're trying to make progress and it feels like they're dragging something through the mud.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And number 4, how am I going to pull this off? This is someone who has a new promotion, a new giant project, as you can see from the.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Icon here. And they just feel intimidated and they don't know what they're gonna do so they know they need to seek a new solution if they're gonna succeed here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I know.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And as you can see, none of these speak to the. Features or aspects of the product itself. Base camp.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This is about the people in their situations and their struggling moments and their needs. The features and functionality of base camp are implied in those needs.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right? You can make the connection for why it's relevant.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think you're muted. Lilian.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Lilian, you've been muted the last 15Â s.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm sorry. I will follow up with the 2 things I just showed you as long as you keep, Jake's thing internal.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Just promise me that. And then I'll show you, Jason, for its article that I just shared along with some of my favorite examples of why Before the Wise from the past few cohorts, because we've had some really good ones.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So I'll show you guys those. The ones from the past few cohorts will include the evidence that I require to have that in the presentations.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then you guys are gonna do this in person in week 5 or virtual if you're not coming.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And in the meantime, just keep doing your interviews. Think about how you want to synthesize in the end, start recognizing patterns.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And then Kate is available even though she has moved to Europe as of today. Available to have a lot of mentor sessions with you guys.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
So still use here. She really wants to be involved as a resource as you guys are doing this. This is her favorite part.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So with that, thanks for all your participation. This was awesome. I'm gonna stay on for questions, but this is one of the most fruitful synthesis workshops I've ever had.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So I really appreciate it
