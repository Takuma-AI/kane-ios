### Key Insights

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: If someone else had to step in on my behalf to do this because something comes up in my life that's important to deal with, either for my business or for myself personally."

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: so it becomes a game of how can I do start doing less? I can free myself up more to do some of the important strategic work. I need to be doing."

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: depends on specific environments for that to be a value. Add keystrokes, maybe. But just a potential alternative. But you do have to have a lot of things set up to make it work. But I've seen it work pretty well. I have to. Yeah, I agree with you. So I don't know if that's contrarian, I think that's additive. Right? So this isn't what I'm demonstrating. Here is one way to think about it, not the only way. Right? So I'm with you on that, David."

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: I put in a lot of really detailed instructions on what to do. I could really use your help because I have another really important thing to take care of today. Any chance you could knock this out. Let me know if you have any clarifying questions. and then she could have one of her interns on board the rest of her interns"

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: and that instead of doing like a long description of the group, whereas the more details in the individual tasks within the group. Oh, my friend, yes, yes, of course it is so. The notion here really is that every to do list that I make just so, you know, like no, I would never name a to do list the name of my company."
