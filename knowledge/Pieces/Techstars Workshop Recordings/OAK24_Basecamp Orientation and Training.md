### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Lilliana Robinson: After that the next step is to post your finished screening criteria in base camp, and we'll get into today where that will go.
- Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's a way to have a conversation with everybody in the class asynchronously, about what you're getting from it, how it's applicable to you, what makes these concepts relevant. So one of those books is a lot of exposure you had this week. So it's making sure you understand jobs to be done. Demand side sales, one on one another one is a shape up by Ryan Singer. So it's all about product development ways to tool up and actually like, put a process around how you all build product on the tech side.
- Lilliana Robinson: It's pretty serious. But traditionally, the majority of the class participates. And it's super fun. So highly recommend that a lot of you during like the application process asked us for book recommendations, and we told you we would get to that. And here it is.

### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: very importantly. The program handbook was finalized and sent out this morning. It is attached to the email. It's super important that you all read that before day one. It has a lot of information that will help you with any questions. You probably have so check there first before asking any questions, because it's super dense"

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's like once once you've made it, and you can actually establish a lifestyle and a culture at your work with your company that most people dream up but never attain."

> "Lilliana Robinson: So next is by popular demand. We know, you guys want to read about each other? So we had our team craft, this company look book. It's super important that you keep this internal. It has a lot of information about each of your companies that we have from the application process, and then we put it together so you can get to know each other, connect with one another, read about each other's companies, and it'll also mitigate a lot of like, get to know you stuff. So we can just kind of kick it off and hang out next week."

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: for the Retreat. It's really important that you read this about timing. So you know how to book your flight on the nineteenth after the retreat. So that you have ample time to get back to Oakland from. I have another comment about that of the retreat. So one other thing I wanted to mention is, and some of you may know this. Some of you may not. Texas has been in the news lately, anybody paying attention in the past week. There's been a lot going on"

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: in confidence. So just know that, like you can always ask, and you can always ask me privately as well if there's something important or urgent on your mind. But at the same time, I think it's a really beneficial context at the Retreat to have a lot of those serious conversations, or or at least be more vulnerable about. You know our thoughts on, on, on what's going on and what really happens behind the scenes."
