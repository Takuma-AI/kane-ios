### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Nirat Attri: Yeah, I think it was of the same in the same way. So should we like already pitch what that story might look like when we reach out to them like, come up with an interesting narrative preemptively, and then go out to them rather than giving them a concept and letting them work with it like what would be the right way to approach that 1st connect them.
- Amalia Lytle: Yeah, you can approach it a couple different ways. I and I will do it in both formats where I propose a story, or where I just like, generally ask what they're working on, and how I can be a resource for them. So in the first, st in the 1st one, the resource piece. If you see a reporter that is super relevant to the type of company, tell me about your company. What kind of company are you.

> "Amalia Lytle: Oh, if a key message has come through. So we have a bunch of messages that we hope to have covered in the media. So if the media says we're a pre seat investor, or we work with or we help founders succeed. Then that's a check mark for how we measure."

> "Amalia Lytle: But any other time it's not really that important to put your press release over Pr. Newswire. If you're promoting it on social your blog, sending it out to your stakeholders all that jazz."
