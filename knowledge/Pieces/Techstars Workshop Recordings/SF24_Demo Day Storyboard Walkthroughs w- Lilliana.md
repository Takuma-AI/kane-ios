# Demo Day Storyboard Walkthroughs w Lilliana

**Workshop:** Demo Day Storyboard Walkthroughs w Lilliana  
**Cohort:** SF24  
**Date:** November 8, 2024  
**Facilitator:** Lilliana Robinson  
**Type:** Demo Day & Pitching  
**Tags:** #demo-day #storyboarding #video-production #customer-testimonials #product-demos #time-allocation #sf24 #comprehensive-feedback

## Overview

This workshop addresses the critical video component of Techstars' secret sauce Demo Day format. Lilliana guides SF24 founders through storyboard development for their 1-minute product videos, emphasizing strategic time allocation, customer journey storytelling, and avoiding common pitfalls like over-exposition. The session provides individual feedback on 9 company storyboards, revealing patterns in effective video structure and production strategies.

## Key Themes

1. **Video Component Neglect**: Most founders leave video development until the last week, creating unnecessary stress and poor outcomes
2. **Strategic Time Investment**: Each second of the 60-second video should be allocated like investing money - highest ROI content gets most time
3. **Customer-Centric Storytelling**: Best videos follow real customer journeys with tangible outcomes rather than abstract problem descriptions
4. **Production Reality Check**: Budget expectations ($0-1000), timeline management, and third-party dependency risks
5. **Exposition Trap**: Most founders waste 20+ seconds on setup when they should cut to solution benefits immediately

## Workshop Genesis and Strategic Importance

### The Missing Piece in Demo Day Preparation

Lilliana's explanation of workshop creation:

> "I referenced this, I think, on the Kpi call on Monday. But I added this workshop I think, like a couple programs. After we started doing this format of Demo Day, because I realized that we have intro to Q&A. We have lots of pitch practices with Troy and with myself and all of these different sessions. And I didn't have any sessions about the video."

**The scramble problem**: "So the video was kind of on the back burner. And then it would be like the last thing people think about the week before Demo Day, and people would try to like scramble. And the video is honestly one of the worst ones to scramble on, because it's not something that most of you could just like grind on in a night and like crank out."

### Third-Party Dependency Reality

> "Because you need other people's help to do it, be it animators, videographers like designers, whatever you need for your video voiceovers stuff like that. So this is definitely not one that you want to just like leave to the last minute. This is something you want to be thinking about at the same time as your Q&A, and your pitch."

## Individual Company Storyboard Analysis

### Morgan Stanton (Opal): Women's Health Historical Context

**Demo Day Goal**: Dual customer acquisition and early-stage investor relationships for January fundraising

**Storyboard Strategy**: Educational shock value approach using women's health research timeline

**Opening Hook**: "For the 1st 1520 seconds I want to give a very quick overview of like the history of women's health, and like, specify like kind of like poignant facts... Be like there is no women in clinical trials. We didn't use male mice into 2018 and really emphasize the date. These are recent dates."

**Visual Innovation**: "I think even the video I might try to make it seem old, and then kind of like, be like. No, this was like 5 years ago."

**Key Insights From Feedback**:
- **Uterus-in-a-dish visualization**: Lilliana suggested animation to make the technical concept accessible
- **Product demonstration balance**: Keep high-level in video, save technical details for Q&A
- **Headlines strategy**: Include newspaper headlines about drug recalls affecting women
- **Customer testimonials**: Consider adding client testimonials for credibility

### Florence Ettlin & Çoruh (CogniScope): Guest Experience Journey

**Demo Day Goal**: Customer introductions to property management companies and early investor relationships

**Original Approach**: Four scenes showcasing guest capabilities, then flip to host benefits, concluding with customer testimonial

**Critical Feedback - The 1/3 Rule**: 
> "1 3rd of the video should be scenes, one through 4. 1 3rd of the video should be seen 5 and 1 3rd should be seen. 6. That's how important those last 2 are."

**Strategic Pivot Recommendation**:
Annie's insight: "What you might want to do is show what a property manager is doing without Collab, because I think that might be interesting, like what kind of like what the hassle is, and then like how? How you are making that better."

**Dave Scott's perspective**: "I think that I think the real pain point, and the part that I love about your story is really how it helps the the property owner, and I hope that you find a way to get that through the process like the pulling their hair out, the trying to, you know, trying to monetize this thing."

**Quantification Strategy**: Near's suggestion to include time/cost savings data: "1 3rd of their time, is spent on just reading and trying to make sense of it."

### Dave Scott (Evil Genius Games): Real Customer Journey Narrative

**Demo Day Goal**: Investor-focused with potential second round positioning

**Innovative Approach**: Haley, a real customer, animated journey from zombie game discovery to platform adoption

**Detailed Customer Arc**:
1. **Introduction**: "This is Haley" - real customer establishment
2. **Hobby establishment**: Zombie gaming and D&D since age 9
3. **Social building**: "This is how she built friends stayed connected with friends over the years, and even found her husband"
4. **Financial investment**: "$500 a year in games, and play every weekend with their friends"
5. **Discovery moment**: Convention experience - "At a local gaming convention. She played a zombie game of everyday heroes by evil genius games"
6. **Conversion**: Website purchasing and subscription signup
7. **Viral component**: Recruiting 5 friends to platform
8. **Outcome**: Weekly game establishment and community building

**Key Success Elements**:
- **Real customer authenticity**: Transition from animation to actual photo/video of Haley
- **Community scale**: Brady Bunch style grid showing broader user base
- **Specific financial data**: $500 annual spend demonstrates market viability
- **Convention discovery insight**: Half of customers discover at conventions (Jobs to be Done research)

### George Reed (Noetic): Technical Product Demo with Customer Voice

**Demo Day Goal**: Dual client acquisition and investor pipeline building

**Approach**: Real client selfie video testimonial walking through survey creation and response analysis

**Technical vs. Accessible Balance**:
Florence's validation: "I think that actually helps in making it understandable for potential... I think that is really, really a good idea and showing the journey as well."

**Production Strategy**: Mix Canva templates with real customer testimonials for budget efficiency

### Çoruh (CogniScope): Gaming Community Psychology Analysis

**Demo Day Goal**: Customer acquisition and network expansion

**Narrative Structure**:
1. **Problem establishment**: Eddie, community manager, overwhelmed by diverse feedback
2. **Chaos visualization**: Contrasting comments like "more combat, less action" vs "make it harder" vs "games too hard"
3. **Emotional overwhelm**: "Eddie is frustrated and confused because he can't choose which things to like make a report of"
4. **Solution entry**: "Psychology-based AI engine that connects your community channels"
5. **Analysis outcome**: Categorized player types (combat seeker, socializer, explorer)
6. **Business value**: PM confidence in decision-making with de-risked choices

**Critical Missing Element**: Quantified impact data
Lilliana's feedback: "How like, how much are you helping them in that? Where you're saying, like with cognizant, we do risk decisions by X percent or something I don't know. I just think it's lacking a little bit of data."

**Data Integration**: "1 3rd of their time, is spent on just reading and trying to make sense of it" - massive efficiency gain opportunity

### Fabio Caironi (ByteNight): Technical Education Challenge

**Demo Day Goal**: Fundraising round announcement and customer demo signups

**Ambitious Structure**:
- 20 seconds: Service containers education
- 20 seconds: Performance vs. ease of implementation problem  
- 15 seconds: ByteNight solution and benefits
- 5 seconds: End-to-end success use cases

**Critical Feedback on Time Allocation**:
> "I think the most important thing out of all these bullet points is byte night solution and benefits, and the fact that it's only 15 seconds. I think it needs to be longer, and you should cut time from other sections."

**The Education vs. Benefit Trade-off**: 
Kevin's technical concern: "As someone that isn't technical, either. My 1st concern is like, if you can get through explaining it fully and having people understand in the 1520 seconds you allowed."

**Shareability Goal**: "I want to make this editable reusable... maximize the attention so that also will come with you know, a very good animation, and again, some some scenes that are relatable."

### Annie Brown (Reliable): Customer Success Story Excellence

**Demo Day Goal**: Customer-focused with potential website replacement

**Winning Approach**: Real customer (Ozaz) narration throughout entire video

**Structure Mastery**:
1. **Customer problem articulation**: Ozaz explaining why current solutions fail
2. **Implementation walkthrough**: Customer labeling skin tone using Monk scale
3. **Feature demonstration**: Simple 1-2-3 process explanation
4. **Success outcome**: Customer testimonial with tangible result
5. **Big wow moment**: "We've been approached by a fortune 50 company to purchase our skin tone model"

**Lilliana's Validation**: "My favorite part is the desired outcome you helped Ozaz get like I mean, you can't get much ta more tangible than that. That's awesome. I really don't have any notes."

**Universal Principles Extract**:
> "Keep it simple. Focus on the solution impact from the customer perspective how it impacts the bottom line of a customer's business and a wow moment like some results for the customer. I mean those are huge pointers for everybody here. This is kind of what I'm trying to get all of you to do."

### Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Technical B2B Automation

**Demo Day Goal**: Investor-focused with potential website replacement

**Strategic Structure**:
1. **Company introduction**: High-level platform overview
2. **Problem flash**: Clinical trial timeline reports
3. **Solution benefits**: Line of sight, automation, alignment between executive and frontline teams
4. **Automation showcase**: Screenshots across trial automation areas
5. **Differentiation**: Competitor comparison (optional)

**Technical Accessibility Challenge**:
Nirat's concern: "1 3rd of their time, is spent on just reading and trying to make sense of it because, like either, after time, like hearing these terminologies, you become used to it. But then you actually put it out. And then you realize nobody actually."

**Monica's Response Strategy**: "Keep it very high, level... everyone can relate to like... maybe get a little specific like, know what's happening across your trial portfolio? How many subjects have you enrolled? How many sites have you activated? So make that more concrete."

### Nicholas Li & Kevin Su (TutorMe): Student Journey Split-Screen

**Demo Day Goal**: Customer introduction building rather than fundraising

**Visual Concept**: Split-screen comparison of stressed vs. organized IB students

**Time Allocation Problem**:
Kevin's self-awareness: "I wonder if we're spending too much time like story like setting the stage. I wonder if we can get into that earlier? We spent, like you know, essentially a 3rd of the video setting up this like scene."

**Universal Time Investment Principle**:
> "You should really think of it as literally like you're investing money into different pieces of the of the segment. What is the most important... That means that it's only like 25% of your video like, that's how important it is. Probably not. That's probably like half half of your video. That's how important that is."

### Dominique Harrison-Bentzen (Looney8): Compliance-Driven Content

**Demo Day Goal**: Customer acquisition focused (not mentioning fundraising)

**Strategic Evolution**: From wealth transfer emphasis to compliance cost focus

**Effective Time Allocation**:
> "I really agree with your allocation of time. One of the best allocations of time I've seen because it's very targeted toward what you're trying to get across like you, you cut to the chase within 17 seconds with your solution."

**Structure Excellence**:
1. Quick millennial wealth transfer tie-in (differentiation factor)
2. Compliance cost reality (5 days for one piece, $50M in fees annually)
3. Solution demonstration (1 day automated compliance)
4. Process walkthrough showing seamless automation
5. Testimonial options (bank or millennial investor)

## Meta-Patterns and Universal Principles

### The Exposition Trap

**Most Common Mistake**: 
> "Pretty much. Everyone who has presented except a couple of you who aren't going through like a a narrative. You guys spent too much time on exposition. You're gonna either lose people because it's like you're not cutting to the point fast enough, or you're losing time."

**Solution Strategy**: "You want to cut to the chase as quickly as possible."

### Time as Investment Philosophy

**Strategic Framework**:
> "When I see people allocate the seconds of their video or the seconds of their pitch. You should really think of it as literally like you're investing money into different pieces of the of the segment."

**Fabio Example**: "He had only 15 seconds allocated for the most important part. What byte night does and what benefits it gives. That means that it's only like 25% of your video like, that's how important it is. Probably not. That's probably like half half of your video."

### Customer Testimonial Strategy

**Production Reality**: 
> "For both of those things. Have someone at a desk in like a collared shirt, and it'll just look like they're an advisor. So I'm saying like, Don't spend on, that... you know what they were, but switch that to a customer pro testimonial, if you can."

**Authenticity Over Production Value**: Use friends, classmates, or simple setups rather than expensive professional actors

## Production Strategy and Budget Framework

### Budget Expectations

**Lilliana's guidance**: "I always say I really don't think you guys should spend more than a thousand dollars on this. Most people end up spending a few couple of 100 like people only get closer to one K, if it's like, they know they're gonna use it for their website and for this thing. And for this thing like they have a bunch of reasons that they would need it."

**Typical Spending**: "A couple 100 bucks like at Max. Maybe maybe someone on. Fiverr is like helping you do a bit of the design or something."

### Animation Considerations

**Dave's Budget Range**: "So if if I don't follow Annie's advice, I do, it's it's between 2 to $600 to do this. If I have to get a unique animator. It's gonna cost more money."

**Annie's Style Warning**: "There's there's a very specific specific style that, like like comes up. But, like, you know, cartoon styles have. There's millions infinite ways to do cartoons. So I would say, try to find a unique style, so that even if it's a animated video. It looks unique."

### Resource Recommendations

**Stock Content Sources**:
- **Envato**: Stock video platform with free trial
- **Unsplash**: Photo resources
- **Canva**: DIY video creation platform

**Fiverr Strategy**: "$250-500 Fiverr: You make all the assets you want, but, like someone puts it together on fiber, I would be careful. Don't have any sort of like AI voice. It's super annoying. Have an actual voice over as much as you can."

## Timeline and Risk Management

### Holiday Challenge

**Unique SF24 Constraint**: 
> "You guys also have the challenge of the week before Demo Day being Thanksgiving. So like you really can't leave it till then, because I really don't know if you're going to be able to get 3rd parties to help you during the holidays."

### Common Failure Pattern

**The Annual Disaster**: 
> "Do not slack on this like waiting till the last minute is not gonna be great for you. A lot of people get really stressed the last week. They're like forcing videographers on Fiverr to like crank out multiple iterations in like the week before. And then I'm telling you things come up because these are... It literally happens every time. And then the videographer has a family emergency."

**Confidence Impact**: "And then you don't have a video in time. And then you're stressed. And then you have to use an old version, and you don't go into Demo Day confident all of those things have happened."

### Success Timeline

**Optimal Deadline**: "You pretty much want it all set far before Thanksgiving."

**Iteration Process**: "As soon as you have something to share, send it over, post it in cohort, support for feedback from the group, or you can send it in your individual project and just get our feedback. And I'll just keep giving you guys iterations and and feedback until we have a final draft."

## Strategic Content Allocation Insights

### Solution Benefits vs. Problem Description

**Universal Challenge**: Most founders over-invest in problem setup versus solution demonstration

**Dave's Feedback Example**: Keep community building story but maximize time on platform value demonstration

**Annie's Excellence**: Immediate customer voice establishing credibility while seamlessly introducing solution

### B2B vs. B2C Audience Considerations

**Technical Terminology Risk**: 
Monica and Nirat's discussion about clinical trial language accessibility

**Audience Targeting Strategy**: 
Annie's insight: "You don't need to like your video doesn't have to speak to everybody, you know. If you've got a goal of who you want to speak to. you can narrow it to them."

### Differentiation Through Video

**Dominique's Success**: Using video to show competitive advantages rather than saving for Q&A

**CogniScope's Opportunity**: Demonstrating psychological categorization capabilities visually rather than just describing them

## Implementation Success Framework

### Pre-Production Checklist

1. **Goal Clarity**: Specific Demo Day outcome (customers, investors, partnerships)
2. **Time Allocation**: Map seconds like investment dollars to highest-value content
3. **Customer Journey**: Real customer stories with measurable outcomes when possible
4. **Production Planning**: Budget, timeline, third-party dependencies identified
5. **Technical Balance**: Accessible to target audience while demonstrating capability

### Feedback Integration Process

**Basecamp Thread Strategy**: "If you're comfortable with it. Add what you've been sharing here to this thread, because I've been learning a lot from everybody, and it'd be nice to dive in a little bit deeper."

**Async Options**: "Shoot us a boxer, or even like a video loom. If you want to walk through like some sort of storyboard and we can give you Feedback Async."

### Quality Control Philosophy

**Iterative Improvement**: Multiple draft reviews rather than single final approval

**Peer Learning**: Cross-company feedback and collaborative problem-solving

**Professional Standards**: Lilliana's willingness to call out inadequate work: "I will tell you if it's bad... sometimes in the approval session, someone will show their video and maybe they didn't want to invest too much time in it, and I just tell them this isn't going to be acceptable for Demo Day."

## Key Takeaways for Video Excellence

1. **Start early** - Video requires third-party coordination and multiple iterations
2. **Invest time strategically** - Most important content gets most seconds allocated
3. **Customer journey focus** - Real customer stories with tangible outcomes outperform abstract problem descriptions
4. **Cut exposition ruthlessly** - Jump to solution benefits within 17 seconds maximum
5. **Balance technical depth** - Accessible to target audience while demonstrating sophistication
6. **Plan for production reality** - Budget $200-1000, avoid holiday dependencies, prepare for videographer emergencies
7. **Leverage peer feedback** - Cross-company insights often identify blind spots individual founders miss
8. **Quantify impact** - Include specific time savings, cost reductions, or revenue improvements when possible
9. **Authenticate testimonials** - Real customers trump professional actors for credibility
10. **Design for reuse** - Consider website, sales, and investor pitch applications beyond Demo Day

The storyboard workshop reveals that video success depends more on strategic content decisions than production quality. The most impactful videos tell authentic customer stories with measurable outcomes, allocate time proportional to message importance, and balance accessibility with technical credibility. Founders who start early, iterate frequently, and leverage peer feedback create videos that effectively support their Demo Day objectives while building lasting business assets.
