**Type:** Customer Discovery & JTBD  
**Tags:** #customer-research #jtbd #product-market-fit #customer-interviews #innovation

## Overview

This foundational workshop introduces the Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework to help founders deeply understand their customers' motivations, struggles, and decision-making processes. The session emphasizes moving beyond surface-level customer understanding to uncover the causal mechanisms that drive customer behavior and purchasing decisions.

## The Context: Why This Matters

### The Mentor Madness Challenge

Lilliana opens with stark feedback from Techstars mentor debriefs, revealing a critical pattern:

**Common Mentor Criticisms:**
- "Use storytelling of current customers' experiences to help sell the product"
- "Start giving me stories about the customers - specific stories with names, situations, backgrounds, and circumstances"
- "Don't chase your customers, understand your customers"
- "Focus less on sales until you know your customers"
- "Stop building out technology, focus on the business"
- "Stop thinking of company as a technology and start thinking about it as a problem you're solving"
- "Too obsessed with product"
- "Hit the brakes on the tech deck, work on the business and storytelling"
- "Sharpen the story. Didn't talk about the customer or product in his intro"

**The Stakes:** "You just heard from our alumni that the most valuable thing out of Techstars is the mentors and connections... that's the number one thing we have. When we pull out our best and brightest mentors for you all to meet, you show up, and you don't have your stuff together because you don't know how to talk about your business, and they go, 'They don't get it. Why are we even here? How did they get into Techstars without understanding this?'"

### David Cohen's Insight

When asked what separates the most successful Techstars companies from everyone else, David Cohen's answer was profound: **"A healthy obsession with customer success."**

Neil emphasizes: "The true differentiating factor for you all is going to be understanding and demonstrating how in tune you are with the long-term outlook of your business - making people's lives better in the long haul."

## Core Philosophy: You Are Not the Hero

### The Bridge Metaphor

Lilliana introduces a transformative mental model: "You are neither of these things. You're the customer, I mean, they're the customer. There's somewhere they want to be. There's progress they want to make, and there's where you fit in. And right now you're not even on this screen."

**Key Insight:** "You are the path that the customer needs to go to get to their destination where they wanna be. The mistake that we make so often as founders is we think we are the world, because your whole life is working on your business. But until you can zoom out and realize that the people we're here to help don't care about us. They care about themselves."

## What is Jobs to Be Done?

### The Fundamental Definition

**"A job to be done is a struggling moment in a given circumstance, and the notion that I can be a better version of myself at some point."**

### Core Principles

1. **People don't buy products, they hire solutions** - As Ted Levitt famously said, "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole."

2. **Nothing is random** - One of Bob Moesta's key principles. Every customer behavior has a cause, even if we don't understand it yet.

3. **Progress over product** - Customers care about making progress in their lives, not about your features or technology.

4. **Context matters** - Understanding the circumstances that bring the need to mind is crucial.

## The McDonald's Milkshake Story

Clay Christensen's famous example demonstrates JTBD in action:

**The Discovery:**
- McDonald's wanted to improve milkshake sales
- Traditional market research (demographics, taste tests) led nowhere
- Clay's team discovered people were "hiring" milkshakes for an unexpected job

**The Insight:**
- Morning commuters were buying milkshakes for their boring drive to work
- The milkshake was competing against bananas, bagels, and boredom
- It needed to last the entire commute and be easy to consume one-handed

**The Solutions:**
- Make straws thinner (to make it last longer)
- Make shakes thicker
- Add fruit chunks (for variety)
- Create breakfast-specific versions
- Move merchandising to morning locations
- Target radio advertising during commute times

**Lilliana's Commentary:** "Look at what you all just did. Once we knew the job, all of a sudden coming up with all the ways that we can experiment... becomes really clear and intuitive. But if you didn't know the job, you're like, 'Wait, 8 AM milkshakes? Are they coming back from the club?'"

## Real Techstars Examples

### Ferona's Pivot (Near)

Ferona shares her transformative JTBD experience:

**Initial Assumption:** "Tech support for seniors - 'You don't want to have phone calls to Mom to just navigate FaceTime'"

**JTBD Discovery:**
- Customers were people with GOOD relationships with their parents
- They wanted to remove tech support to have deeper conversations
- Messaging about "annoying parents" completely backfired
- They were competing with "nothing" and personal trainers, not Genius Bar

**Key Insight:** "They see us almost equivalent to a personal trainer as opposed to a technician... They want to see the same person over and over again. They want to build that relationship. It's like therapy as opposed to tech support."

**The Trigger:** "Now we're dialing down on scams, because that's the equivalent of the injury that you get when you get a personal trainer."

### Nutrisense Success Story

Neil's portfolio company that exemplifies the power of understanding customers:
- Started at $20K MRR during Techstars
- Now at $2.5-3M MRR
- Raised Series B, valued over $100M
- Initially skipped JTBD sessions because they were "too busy selling"
- Now paying six figures for JTBD consulting they could have gotten for free

### Havoc Shield (Cybersecurity)

Brian Friton's solo founder success:
- Did JTBD research while running and selling his business
- Discovered cybersecurity buyers were developers who got burned before
- They lived in "constant fear" and couldn't sleep
- Positioned product as giving them "their life back"
- Result: Rapid growth by targeting previously-burned developers

### Bloom Filter (Developer Tools)

Neil's investment that others rejected:
- Product: Diagnostic software for development teams
- Initial assumption: CTOs were the buyers
- JTBD Discovery: CIOs were losing sleep and having family problems
- The real job: Saving the CIO's job and family life
- Result: $7M funding round, talks with Sequoia

## The JTBD Framework Components

### 1. The Timeline (How People Buy)

Lilliana presents the purchase timeline that reveals how decisions really unfold:

1. **First Thought** - "Way earlier than any of you have ever thought"
   - Example: Slight back pain when waking up
   - Could be years before action
   - The "open market" opportunity

2. **Passive Looking** - Event triggers casual research
   - Asking friends about their mattresses
   - Noticing ads but not actively searching
   - Can last months or years

3. **Active Looking** - Something triggers urgent action
   - The fight with family due to irritability
   - Missing work due to poor sleep
   - Can't pick up your child due to back pain
   - "Now I'm scrolling Instagram, now I'm on websites"

4. **Deciding** - Evaluating specific options
   - Not just product comparisons
   - Includes "doing nothing" or other solutions
   - "How do I deal with this problem?"

5. **Buying** - Making the purchase

6. **Consuming/Experiencing** - Using the solution
   - Are they satisfied?
   - What's the actual outcome?
   - The foundation of "healthy obsession with customer success"

**Critical Insight:** "A lot of people try to catch the customer in active looking. They've pretty much already been sold on one thing once they're active looking. Your best bet is to come all the way up here and figure out where that first thought is."

### 2. The Four Forces Diagram

The forces that influence customer decisions:

**Push** - "The most potent push I can think of is physical pain"
- Problems that cannot be ignored
- Forces that say "I must solve this now"
- Examples: Back pain, car accident, financial crisis

**Pull** - "Much more alluring, usually very social"
- The temptation of a better version of yourself
- Status, identity, aspiration
- Example: Tesla purchases despite having working cars

**Habit** - The comfort of current solution
- "Better the devil you know"
- Switching costs (time, money, effort)

**Anxiety** - Fear of the new solution
- "What if it doesn't work?"
- "What if I make the wrong choice?"
- Risk aversion

### 3. System Mapping

How JTBD maps to organizational functions:
- **First Thought → Marketing**
- **Passive/Active Looking → Sales**
- **Consuming/Experiencing → Customer Success**

"You can take any of your companies and forecast the larger picture of down the road when you're worth a billion dollars, and how what we just talked about maps to that."

## Critical Distinctions

### B2B vs B2C Jobs

Max raises the challenge of B2B storytelling: "In a B2C space, you can have these extremely compelling stories... In B2B, it's not as exciting, not as human."

**Neil's Response:** "Your customers are still human beings. Even the robot bartender has a human behind it to make the deal... No matter what you're selling, you are at the end of the day trying to find a human being with a name who has emotions and feelings and needs."

**B2B Job Examples:**
- **Push:** "I'm losing sleep and having family problems because developers' mistakes get blamed on me"
- **Pull:** "If I bring this in, they'll 10x my contract and I'll get promoted to CIO"
- **Hidden dynamics:** Technology replacing people creates defensive reactions

### Quality Over Quantity in Research

**The 80/20 Rule Applied:** "I'm more impressed if you tell me you interviewed 12 people but learned what you needed to get 100 customers, than saying 'I talked to 3,500 people on my survey.'"

**Sample Size Reality:** "When you're doing a narrow segment where the maximum people that could buy your product for B2B is maybe 312 people, actually 12 is a good sample size to represent that small pool."

### The Survey Trap

**Bob Moesta's Warning:** "Someone said we could do a survey. Bob goes, 'I will kill you.'"

**Why Surveys Fail:** "Most of the time when someone's filling out a survey, you're lying, even if you're not intentionally lying. You're saying what you think you would do in a situation hypothetically rather than your actual behavior."

**Neil's Personal Example:** Interviewed 25 people who said they'd pay $4-8K for his coding school. When he launched, zero of those 25 signed up. "They were not the people I was trying to actually sell to."

## Implementation Guidance

### The Circle of Trust

"The details we're sharing with you all are somewhat private and confidential... Our companies that we've invested in, it's not just Chicago. They're part of your community too."

### Fight Club Rules

"Have you ever seen the movie Fight Club? What's the first rule of Fight Club? Alright, here we are guys, we're in Fight Club. You know our little secret sauce... Only in this context am I effusive about it, because everywhere else in my life I'm just living it."

### The Warning

"Just be careful, because with great power comes great responsibility. You can have very awkward relationships and times with family members and significant others when you ask too many questions... Once you start to see more and ask these types of questions, it's a superpower, but it's one you have to apply with mindfulness."

### Know Your Limits

Neil's Detroit interview story: "We realized what we were learning about the why and the problem was so disconnected from the product itself, and it had everything to do with a woman in a struggling marriage... Sometimes I've been on calls where it gets so personal... they'll start to cry. We're not therapists. We're journalists."

## Key Frameworks Introduced

### Progress Thinking

"My favorite words: progress, progress, progress, progress. What is progress for this meeting? What is progress for this talk? For your customer, I use this word all the time because it's like deep representation of where I'm at versus where I wanna be."

### The Give-First Framework

When approaching experts or customers:
- Lead with what you can offer (insights about future trends)
- Ask for advice, not money
- Build emotional investment before financial asks

### Competing Against Luck

"The notion of competing against luck is most of us, when we talk about our success, we kind of shrug our shoulders. 'I was lucky.' What do you mean by lucky? What went into this supposed luck that you experienced?"

## Action Items and Next Steps

### The To-Do List System

"We wrote this comprehensive to-do list during COVID... All of you will complete the entire to-do list, and at the end, like Ferona said, you're gonna have this document that basically says every single job that you are doing for your customer."

### Website Reality Check

"At some point when you do your jobs to be done insights, I'm gonna pull up your homepage... and I'm gonna read the words that you have on your homepage to go, 'Are you talking to the right person?' Because a lot of you probably aren't."

### Trust the Process

"Forget everything that you've learned about this and your customers, and what you know. Trust the process over the next week... We will get there, I promise."

## Critical Success Factors

### When You Know You've Found It

Madison asks when founders know they have the right customer. Lilliana's response:

"You're gonna feel it. It's gonna be so strong. You're gonna go like, 'Wait a second, I don't need to talk to anyone anymore. I've done it.'... It'll be creepy because you'll start to predict what they're gonna say... You can forecast what their pain points are, what's resisting them from saying yes, and what you would need to say to get them over the line."

### The Screening Process

References to finding the right people to interview:
- "Screening criteria" for recruits
- Finding people who have already made progress
- The homework assignment: someone buying a mattress
- Multiple events and triggers in the timeline

## Memorable Quotes

- "Build your network before you need it, so it's there when you do."
- "If your first connection with an investor is asking for money, you failed."
- "A healthy obsession with customer success."
- "People don't buy products, they hire solutions."
- "Nothing is random."
- "You are the bridge. They're gonna use you to get to that better version of themselves."
- "With great power comes great responsibility."
- "We're not therapists. We're journalists."
- "Progress, progress, progress, progress."
- "Competing against luck."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Customers don't care about your product** - They care about making progress in their lives
2. **You must understand the job before building the solution** - Otherwise you're guessing
3. **The real insights come from understanding causality** - Not demographics or preferences
4. **B2B buyers are still humans** - With careers, families, and personal motivations
5. **Quality beats quantity in customer research** - 12 good interviews > 3,500 surveys
6. **The framework scales** - From startup to billion-dollar company
7. **This is a superpower** - But use it responsibly

## Final Wisdom

Clay Christensen's humility: "He's really tall... but he does this thing where he gets down on one knee next to you as an act of humility. He literally did that with me when I was there at Harvard Business School."

The session ends with the promise of deeper dives into implementation, with multiple workshops planned to ensure founders can apply JTBD effectively to transform their understanding of customers and build successful businesses.
