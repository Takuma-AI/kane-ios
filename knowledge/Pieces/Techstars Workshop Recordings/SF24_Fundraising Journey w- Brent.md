### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Lilliana Robinson: what had kind of gone on during his fundraising process post program. So Brent finished program in spring of 2023. So
- Brent Hasse - Flat: I don't care. We have our pitch. Here's what we're doing. We're going through the process, and that could not, that could totally not happen. And it's not going to affect me at all. The highs and lows have been so much higher and lower than I really thought. Coming into this. And this is some advice a couple of mentors gave me is you just have to really lop off the highs. If you lop off the highs, the lows don't feel as low.

### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I'll let you go ahead, Brent, and maybe I'll slide Pepper in where it's more important and less important for these guys to hear."

> "Brent Hasse - Flat: is tough to do, but you have to do it. But guess what you could always circle back to it. So just because you put it on the bookshelf doesn't mean it's dead forever. And that's how we were able to kind of come back around with our new distribution channel, which is through all of these Hvac companies, plumbing companies, electric companies"

> "Brent Hasse - Flat: actually wants the product and we're getting pulled in that direction versus me, trying to hard sell people and really try to force it. It's it's a nice change. But we would have never gotten to this point if it wasn't for trying and failing all these times."

> "Brent Hasse - Flat: to learn about their home value, which is just a free Api we have, which we thought was kind of silly, but we're showing real engagement, and we would have never gotten that if we didn't talk to her and dive into that with her. So all those conversations, and then that opens the door for us, talking with Zillow in realtor.com who are in conversations with now."

> "Brent Hasse - Flat: one thing always leads to the next, so there's no linear path. It's just being able to be able to really go and just listen, hear what people have to say."
