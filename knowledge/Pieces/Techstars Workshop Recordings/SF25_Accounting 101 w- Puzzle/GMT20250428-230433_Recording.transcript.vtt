1
00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:03.160
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.400
Chloe Lannert: So just record the meeting for.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.050
Drew (Puzzle): Nice.

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.120
Chloe Lannert: For the sake of posterity, and the folks who can't make it.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.399
Drew (Puzzle): Cool, cool. Should we? Should we wait, or.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:29.209
Chloe Lannert: Alright! Let's just jump right in. I mean, met Sasha last week to dig into the journey. And now this is their chance to see where you're at now.

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.340
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah, I met some people last week, which was great. Was it God was that last week or 2 weeks ago.

8
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.090
Chloe Lannert: 2 weeks.

9
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.290
Drew (Puzzle): 2 weeks ago. Okay.

10
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.900
Chloe Lannert: Did. I was.

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.700
Drew (Puzzle): Like, I'm losing time.

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.320
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah, tweak it.

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.170
Chloe Lannert: We're moving.

14
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:57.800
Drew (Puzzle): It's crazy. Yeah. But for sake of recording and the few people here if you didn't meet me last week, my name is Drew Lincoln. I lead our some of our partnerships here. Puzzle puzzle is modern accounting for early stage startups and founders like yourself.

15
00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:07.009
Drew (Puzzle): So I'm gonna talk a little bit today about accounting one on one I have a little presentation. I'm gonna share. If I could share my screen

16
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.409
Drew (Puzzle): and then we'll go from there.

17
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.120
Drew (Puzzle): slideshow. There we go!

18
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.950
Drew (Puzzle): Everybody see my screen.

19
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.209
Chloe Lannert: All looks good.

20
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.500
Drew (Puzzle): Awesome cool guys.

21
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:43.730
Drew (Puzzle): for sake of legal formatting, and every all that. I am not an accountant. I am not a cpa. Let it be known that financial advice should be from somebody else. But this is specifically for founders. Typically Delaware, c corp startups.

22
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.619
Drew (Puzzle): And again, not accounting or tax advice. Always consult a professional

23
00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:09.650
Drew (Puzzle): need to need to throw that out there so real quick intro. I'm calling you guys from probably not too far away from most of you. I'm in San Francisco just downtown in our office here. But I've been in the bay about 11 plus years I've been through a founding team at Y Combinator, got acquired by a company called Cross Team. I'm through. Been through the plug and play tech

24
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:30.060
Drew (Puzzle): accelerated on Sunnyvale sadly, have not been through techstars. But maybe that's the next next one and then I started my career at yelp early on so high level, this is what really what we're gonna be talking about. About puzzle and kind of how accounting really works. So so I'm moving the zoom zoom windows all over the place. So

25
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:42.099
Drew (Puzzle): what do founders really need to know about accounting? So we're gonna go over what accounting is why and when specifically, it's important, we're gonna see some dates. This will be very kind of you know I did.

26
00:02:42.543 --> 00:03:03.539
Drew (Puzzle): I've done this report a a few different times, and it was a lot different, you know, couple of weeks ago, as opposed to today for obvious reasons, with tax season behind us now, and we'll go through kind of some top faqs from founders. We'll walk through a quick demo of puzzle. I know some of you are already using it. And then

27
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:13.119
Drew (Puzzle): I come from a go to market background. So I have that kind of as as a bonus round, or any kind of Q&A's. Maybe we'll get into that new puzzle signal, Chloe I was talking about as well.

28
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.819
Drew (Puzzle): So who has to do accounting

29
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:35.969
Drew (Puzzle): everybody you have to do it. It's not. It's not fun I get it, but it's 1 of those things that every company has to do it. So beginning of the year. If your startup is incorporated as a C. Corp, you will need to file corporate taxes. You might not need to pay taxes, especially at techstars kind of early stage. You might not.

30
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.529
Drew (Puzzle): you know, pre revenue even.

31
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:53.140
Drew (Puzzle): but you do need to file them right? So what is accounting again. I'm not an accountant. I did not take accounting classes in college. I maybe I'm curious from the group here who has taken any accounting classes before.

32
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.529
Drew (Puzzle): Chris, I knew it.

33
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.310
Drew (Puzzle): Andrew, awesome.

34
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.150
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah to

35
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.080
Drew (Puzzle): well, we don't have too many folks. But yeah, there's more than usual to be honest, actually, so of course, like

36
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:33.636
Drew (Puzzle): we didn't learn this in school. I didn't learn this in school unless you're actively going to be an accountant or maybe you're a Econ major, and you did like single class of accounting. It didn't come up in college that often. So it's really important to understand what encompasses accounting. And these are kind of the 3 areas when you're thinking about accounting and taxes. Irs, we just passed tax day

37
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:55.250
Drew (Puzzle): very topical for startups and early stage founders fundraising valuation, and then more on the financial planning and analysis which you'll, you know, if you're going further up market. Maybe at that seed to series a thinking about outsourcing to a Cfo or something like that. So all this is prepared by bookkeepers. But these are the 3 major kind of areas of what accounting really means.

38
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:25.159
Drew (Puzzle): So what goes into accounting? You've probably seen a lot of these different Logos here. A lot of these folks are our own partners. So whether you have a a bank, or maybe a payroll, or maybe you're a b 2 b saas startup and stripe is what you rely on with all things. Revenue payments, cash. Spend payroll. Probably not there yet. Customer payments, of course, but maybe you create all your bills through bill.com or ramp, and and maybe you're looking at a few of these tools right now.

39
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:34.270
Drew (Puzzle): we implement entirely into all those tools, really, where puzzle or anything like puzzle but accounting or general ledger.

40
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:47.560
Drew (Puzzle): That is where all of these really inputs live in one place. So it's really important to have. Okay. My cash is over there. My spend is over there. My payroll is over here. It's really vital to be able to.

41
00:05:47.580 --> 00:06:12.970
Drew (Puzzle): You know whether you're on spreadsheets or not. That's typically when I'm talking to folks early at this stage that hey? We're on spreadsheets. That's fine for now. I guess I'm I'm biased to say, that's not fine. But you know, eventually, you're gonna need some sort of accounting software or a general ledger. Something like quickbooks to be able to accommodate, not just knowing, and you know your financial clarity, but also being able to

42
00:06:13.275 --> 00:06:28.869
Drew (Puzzle): hire a cpa. Hire an accountant, get a bookkeeper further down the road, because this is what that accounting will allow you to do is to see that income statement. Understand what a balance sheet is P. And L. As well profit and loss and a cash flow statement.

43
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:39.100
Drew (Puzzle): Also, by the way, guys, if you guys do have any questions, please feel free to throw them in the chat. Happy to go one by one. We'll have a QA. At the end as well, but

44
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.350
Drew (Puzzle): keeping it kind of pretty high level

45
00:06:43.396 --> 00:07:11.123
Drew (Puzzle): in, in terms of what the 3 financial statements are right pretty self explanatory. But income. We all like income income sales, expenses anything that comes in monthly. The balance sheet, of course, is what you owe versus what you own. So understand that over own, and then cash flow statement. So any kind of summary of cash in and out is what encompasses those 3 financial statements. So

46
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:27.189
Drew (Puzzle): cash accrual. Does anyone know the difference in terms of who? Well, we can have the differences here right here. But in specific who this might be applicable to cash basis should be applicable to large or small businesses.

47
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.260
Drew (Puzzle): Not all at once.

48
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.110
Drew (Puzzle): Anyone know

49
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:49.120
Drew (Puzzle): small businesses. Correct, Chloe. I saw on mute. You were about to say it. Small businesses for cash, large businesses for accrual. So you're at this stage. Most of you are only going to really be thinking about

50
00:07:49.140 --> 00:08:10.409
Drew (Puzzle): cash. So what's the difference? Well, it it you can do both in in puzzle by the way. But cash income expenses are recorded when income is received or expenses are paid, so when cash changes hands. Pretty self explanatory approval is when it's being recorded when they're billed and earned regardless if the money is actually

51
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.480
Drew (Puzzle): received, approval.

52
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:12.980
Andrew Fernandes: Question.

53
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.380
Drew (Puzzle): Yes.

54
00:08:15.626 --> 00:08:23.953
Andrew Fernandes: I've been kind of marking since we do annual subscriptions more of accrual basis. And then marking it to months.

55
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:33.840
Andrew Fernandes: I kind of assume that would be typical for subscription type businesses. What do you startups typically do say, sas sas startups with annual subscriptions.

56
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.229
Drew (Puzzle): Excellent Daniel subscriptions. Then they typically will do cash.

57
00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:44.029
Drew (Puzzle): But it's there. It's kind of completely up to you.

58
00:08:44.573 --> 00:09:02.240
Drew (Puzzle): Where it also depends on what your I mean. Anything else is touching your your business. So like invoices and any kind of bills or vendor payments do you currently use accounting software right now, or where are you doing your? I guess your banking and and payments stripe? I'm guessing.

59
00:09:03.349 --> 00:09:12.289
Andrew Fernandes: You're you're cutting in and out. But I think you're saying, Yeah, we use stripe for billing. Currently, we are just kind of doing it like out of excel. For now.

60
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.230
Drew (Puzzle): Got it. Okay.

61
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:25.780
Drew (Puzzle): yeah. You can change it within within puzzle it it with. If it's for cool or cash, you can do both. Most early stage startups are are cash, are you?

62
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.210
Drew (Puzzle): Sounds like you're revenue, positive.

63
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.419
Andrew Fernandes: Yeah, excuse me.

64
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:37.770
Drew (Puzzle): Got it. So yeah, accrual is fine. If if you're at that point, if you're pre revenue, then cash is typically where most startups.

65
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.070
Drew (Puzzle): Sorry.

66
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.730
Andrew Fernandes: Okay.

67
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.150
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah, it's a good question there.

68
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.890
Drew (Puzzle): small, large.

69
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.510
Drew (Puzzle): So I know you do that. Yep, cash approval. Yep.

70
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.279
Drew (Puzzle): cool. So primary accounting roles. What are all these

71
00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:06.850
Drew (Puzzle): roles actually mean? So one thing to you know, the biggest takeaway here, and thinking about accounting is everything about accounting is in the past.

72
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:12.559
Drew (Puzzle): It has already happened. That is why we have a rear view mirror. It's always looking about kind of a

73
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.830
Drew (Puzzle): a history of

74
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:26.784
Drew (Puzzle): anything that has touched your finances and within your business. So within the different roles, we have bookkeepers, and they're the ones who are focusing on the accounts. Categorizing transactions they can run, payroll

75
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:38.640
Drew (Puzzle): puzzle. Does a lot of this automated especially for early stage startups? The actual accountant themselves which you will need eventually does a little bit more higher level focus. So

76
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:53.600
Drew (Puzzle): if you're at Andrew stage doing more of accrual accounting, or you know, gaap compliance and then controller, pretty self explanatory. But they were responsible for overseeing a lot of the accounting they control. Really, everything ensuring the reports are complete and accurate.

77
00:10:53.770 --> 00:11:22.820
Drew (Puzzle): Then we focus a little bit more on Cfos, and that's probably further on your, you know series A series B, I'd say. You see a lot of folks outsourcing kind of Cf Cfo services today. But they're the ones who are more in depth on the strategy for the company. Financial Ops, thinking about budget models where we're spending where companies are spending especially when it gets to. You know, a significant raise at the series A or B or C range.

78
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.449
Drew (Puzzle): So what does the bookkeeper actually do.

79
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:45.390
Drew (Puzzle): Well, they're the ones who are. Really. Again, focusing on the the categorizing transactions. So let's say you have a bank. A few different bank accounts, maybe a few credit cards categorization. They kind of need to be categorized in different places.

80
00:11:46.790 --> 00:12:13.357
Drew (Puzzle): public on a serves as your like bookkeeper light, but they also will serve as paying your bills, running your payroll during financial reports, understanding your balance sheet. P. And L. Reviewing and reviewing and file. You know any kind of tax credits which puzzle does not do. But we do create a tax package for you. So when the time does come, you can find an accountant or Cpa to to do those tax services for you.

81
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.980
Drew (Puzzle): bookkeepers do not file taxes. They don't build financial models. So any kind of budgeting or forecasts. They don't do that.

82
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:25.200
Drew (Puzzle): That's a little bit more on the again counted, or Cfo side of things.

83
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.170
Drew (Puzzle): Any questions so far.

84
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.380
Drew (Puzzle): All good thanks, guys.

85
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.630
Drew (Puzzle): You know why, it's counting.

86
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.670
Chloe Lannert: Amazing.

87
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.250
Drew (Puzzle): What's it?

88
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.650
Drew (Puzzle): Sorry?

89
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.060
Chloe Lannert: These these folks are already Cfos, and they know absolutely everything. And they're.

90
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.710
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah.

91
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:44.450
Chloe Lannert: Perfect.

92
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.330
Drew (Puzzle): You guys are taxing.

93
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.500
Chloe Lannert: Complete, thrilled.

94
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.780
Drew (Puzzle): Exactly.

95
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.180
Drew (Puzzle): It's all about having your clean.

96
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.599
Drew (Puzzle): clean books right having your numbers right there. So

97
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.809
Drew (Puzzle): so here we're gonna talk about well, why it.

98
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:24.860
Drew (Puzzle): you know why, it's important. Of course we're gonna talk about when things go well, and then when things just don't go so well and we'll talk about important dates and things to know, and we'll be already prepared for this anyway, because we've got about a year a little less than than the next tax day. But there are some other dates that are closer than you might actually believe. So top reasons why accounting goes well, well, if you can automate it.

99
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:43.289
Drew (Puzzle): It really helps you obviously improve more money improving your business. That's obvious. More time improves your business. You guys are all founders. You didn't have to focus on whether or not your books are clean and and think about your P. And L, or your balance sheet, or being an account quite frankly, you need to focus on building, talking to your customers.

100
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:52.953
Drew (Puzzle): ensuring that your product is is moving along on your roadmap. So what accounting also allows you to do is have credibility for investors.

101
00:13:53.470 --> 00:14:06.490
Drew (Puzzle): well, you mentioned, you know, trying to pull numbers from different startups, and how difficult it is. On both ends right within the database, but also within any text, our founders being, you know, hey, what are your what are your latest numbers.

102
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.770
Chloe Lannert: 100, and

103
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:26.110
Chloe Lannert: like this is a reporting requirement. Texters has a reporting requirement. You need to submit your financials quarterly for the duration of the life of this business. All your other investors will require it as well. The better you're able to get a handle on this early, the less awful it'll be because Texters won't

104
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.659
Chloe Lannert: chase you.

105
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.220
Chloe Lannert: Other investors will, like other investors.

106
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:37.429
Drew (Puzzle): So they or they, or if you're not even at that point of of being chased

107
00:14:37.899 --> 00:14:50.460
Drew (Puzzle): they won't take you seriously quite frankly. I mean you mean they won't. They'll stop chasing you at at the end of the day. You'll be wanting to chase them but if you can get your books in order.

108
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:59.550
Chloe Lannert: Totally. If you have a smaller Vc. Who like doesn't get their financial updates after they've given you a check, why would they introduce you to fall on investors. Also

109
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:17.920
Chloe Lannert: a huge sort of onus for us pushing this financials. Conversation so hard is like in the last 30 days I've had to sit down literally on the ground with a founder and calculate out the fact that they had 60 days of runway left, which they didn't

110
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.419
Chloe Lannert: literally on the ground in my living room, like.

111
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:21.910
Drew (Puzzle): Wow!

112
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.520
Chloe Lannert: Papers on the floor, and I don't want to do that again.

113
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.470
Chloe Lannert: You guys are gonna.

114
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.840
Drew (Puzzle): Okay.

115
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.750
Chloe Lannert: Well ahead. It's not going to be 60 days to save the company.

116
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:38.529
Chloe Lannert: That's the onus for for all of this I know we've been hounding you with financial stuff. It is really, really life or death.

117
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.688
Drew (Puzzle): And it's never been easier to automate a lot of these things. So

118
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.329
Drew (Puzzle): yeah, that sounds pretty brutal.

119
00:15:48.060 --> 00:16:00.221
Drew (Puzzle): I think I was. We my 1st startup. We were Brexit just come out, and it was like great to kind of have this like corporate credit card. But then we started using ramp. And then we realized that we were just implementing all into Excel. And

120
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:25.840
Drew (Puzzle): yeah, we had a runway. We had a runway issue but at the end of the day. It's about really impressing your investors, but also ensuring, you know, burn runway. You know those numbers off, you know easily, and you can. You can access those numbers not just 15 days after every month from your accountant, but you can log into puzzle and access them, or your general ledger at any time, right? Obviously, hitting company goals is really important. And then this is something we talk about. But, like

121
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:35.123
Drew (Puzzle): puzzle was built for the founder, but it allows you to kind of gain that credibility to. I'm not just a founder. I'm now a a CEO right

122
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:43.786
Drew (Puzzle): allows you to grow, gives you more credibility, and of course more money. So that's all well and good. But here's what things, when things don't go well,

123
00:16:44.880 --> 00:17:04.450
Drew (Puzzle): Chloe just gave us a an insight into what doesn't go. Well, we right can. It's all based on history. So you know, it could be weeks, months of makeup work. Terrible use of your time. If it's more on the tax front of and we'll look at different dates that are really important, but massive penalties or noncompliance

124
00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:14.290
Drew (Puzzle): back to investors and fundraising. This can lower shareholder value this. You could lose term sheets and deals, because this, if you're not, you don't have your numbers in order.

125
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:20.390
Drew (Puzzle): you know. I don't want to go the worst route, but fired or run out of payroll. This was

126
00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:39.230
Drew (Puzzle): payroll stops runway stops your company folds. Fired isn't necessarily, but the you know the way to go. But yeah, this is the dark. This is the dark side of of accounting. That's very real right? And even no matter how much almost, you've raised. So

127
00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:45.559
Drew (Puzzle): when is encountering important. So these are, you guys know the April 15th date. But

128
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:58.639
Drew (Puzzle): as a lot of our kind of customer success team here, there are all former Cpas. So I typically ask them, I'm like, so when is when does like they should start accounting, or, you know, start really thinking about accounting. Of course they're like

129
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:14.160
Drew (Puzzle): they're all Cpa. So they're like yesterday, like it's never too early it it day one. It's easier to remember. Find your receipts. Every dollar you don't want to be on the ground looking for different receipts and finding things. It's all automated today.

130
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:22.120
Drew (Puzzle): You know, any any modern general ledger accounting software today has all of these, you know automations within your banks.

131
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.940
Drew (Puzzle): your stripe revenue payments, whatever it is.

132
00:18:25.431 --> 00:18:40.299
Drew (Puzzle): The required dates here. So it depends on your business. But January 31, st if if you have 1099 as employees, that's when you're filing that January 31st March 1st is anywhere, any Delaware franchise tax.

133
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:58.330
Drew (Puzzle): Probably most folks already know that. And then April 15th is the general Federal and State corporate tax. It can be extended. Of course. Maybe there's a few people who have filed their extension, and they still have to do taxes. But that's typically October 15, th

134
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.950
Drew (Puzzle): Demo. Actually, before I get into that, any questions about

135
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:12.869
Drew (Puzzle): accounting, accounting one on one. Anything in here that you guys would like to go back into.

136
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:20.609
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, I was wondering, how do you sort of like balance platforms out like puzzle with like

137
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.380
Carlo Scaglia: accountants that do the filing and all of that stuff with end of year.

138
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.199
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah, that's a good question. So there's kind of 2,

139
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:50.489
Drew (Puzzle): you know, I was, gonna say, 2 pieces to the puzzle but essentially, puzzle serves as right here your your accounting and general ledger. It's kind of your base for implementing all of your financial data into one place. It will automate essentially like 98% of what you need to do as a business owner.

140
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:58.729
Drew (Puzzle): That extra 2% is when you would outsource to an accountant and a bookkeeper, so that would live then as a service on top

141
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:14.150
Drew (Puzzle): of puzzle or quickbooks, or something like that, right? So we we have a marketplace of 10,000 plus accountants and Cpas that we would recommend, based on your goals and the type of business you have.

142
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:18.739
Drew (Puzzle): but that's they're all puzzle, certified. They use puzzle, and

143
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.589
Drew (Puzzle): we kind of have a whole accounting channel.

144
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.089
Carlo Scaglia: Who's that?

145
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.630
Carlo Scaglia: Thanks.

146
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.440
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah, do you have? Does anyone have a Cpa or accountant already?

147
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.050
Drew (Puzzle): Carlo, yeah, are you a Cpa account? Or you have, or you have already have one.

148
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.969
Carlo Scaglia: No, I I have one.

149
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.199
Drew (Puzzle): Got it. Got it.

150
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.200
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, yeah.

151
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:48.049
Drew (Puzzle): So it it kind of depends on on them in what they use already. Right? They might already use quickbooks. Or you say, Hey, I'm using puzzle, and they can use puzzle, too. Right?

152
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.869
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah. The another quick question does puzzle like, is it just for us based companies.

153
00:20:53.620 --> 00:21:02.799
Drew (Puzzle): Us incorporated companies. You don't don't necessarily need to be based here. But Us. Incorporated. Yeah, we have a lot of companies from all over the world, but they're incorporated in the United States.

154
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.490
Drew (Puzzle): Antoine.

155
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:17.410
Antoine Carriere: It's a variation of that question. And it was about like, our company is incorporated in France, and so

156
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.929
Antoine Carriere: there's no way we can. We can use puzzle. Is that right?

157
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:28.159
Drew (Puzzle): Correct. Not right now. Unfortunately, but it needs to be a Us. Incorporate business.

158
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:44.949
Drew (Puzzle): Not necessarily, Delaware, but just us. Incorporated. Yeah, we have a lot of different partners that we partner with. That are incorporated partners so like folks like Stripe Alice or Clerkey, or Dooley are great options, but happy to if you, if you're interested in that.

159
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.630
Chloe Lannert: Is that limitation gonna change anytime soon.

160
00:21:51.160 --> 00:22:16.079
Drew (Puzzle): Good question. Not in the immediate. Probably. Within this year, I would say, we're we're focused on a lot of different things with automation and revenue recognition. The puzzle signal I I showed you or emailed you about earlier. But for Vcs and accelers. But multi entity, multi currency, these types of things we're a little more focused on 1st and foremost before

161
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:30.189
Drew (Puzzle): outside us. Corporate, because you can be, you know, based in Paris and incorporate in the United States. And you might, you know, work in Euros and Us. Usd, and maybe Canadian dollars as well. Right? So we ensure that those folks can.

162
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.450
Drew (Puzzle): and still operate.

163
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.680
Chloe Lannert: Pillar.

164
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:47.820
Antoine Carriere: And so just just to be sure, the reason why you have that Us incorporated is if we file in the Us. That's what you cover. If we don't file in the Us. You don't cover.

165
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.900
Drew (Puzzle): Correct.

166
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:52.380
Antoine Carriere: Thank you.

167
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.169
Drew (Puzzle): Yep, thank you.

168
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.229
Drew (Puzzle): Alright, guys, I am going to

169
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.140
Drew (Puzzle): do a quick demo. Can you guys still see my screen?

170
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.440
Chloe Lannert: Looks, good.

171
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.580
Drew (Puzzle): Cool.

172
00:23:09.074 --> 00:23:27.569
Drew (Puzzle): I'm happy to happy to set up a time with our sales team or myself. If you guys would like to do a demo. But this is super high level. This is our demo environment. I'm going to show you just typically how people would walk through this and get started. Again. The only prerequisite to use puzzle is a bank account.

173
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:42.430
Drew (Puzzle): So if you have a Brex account, you have a Mercury account, if you have a B of a account doesn't matter. We have integration with all of them. So here I'm going to put myself as a founder. Might change a little bit. And then I'm gonna actually focus on

174
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.850
Drew (Puzzle): yeah, here we go. So

175
00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:55.279
Drew (Puzzle): at this point I have. Maybe I have a Brex credit card. I have 2 Mercury accounts. I have gusto payroll, and I have stripe for all of my

176
00:23:55.350 --> 00:24:25.129
Drew (Puzzle): tracking of revenue payments. Within 5 min puzzle is going to automate all of your financial numbers in one clean dashboard. This is completely customizable. But typically this is what most of our users who are founders like to see where my cash is. My net. Earn my runway rate here, my 2 Mercury accounts to where my cash is focused on my net burn. I can see my 3 month average, my last month total, of course, my my run runway rate, which is 9 months, which is like.

177
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:32.709
Drew (Puzzle): okay, not great. Maybe. Maybe looking at a a you know a little bit of a raise pretty soon, or.

178
00:24:32.760 --> 00:25:01.019
Drew (Puzzle): you know, finding some cuts, or maybe I have to focus a little bit more on my my net burn, or my revenue, of course, up into the right. We like to see that which is great. And then high level cash activity, of course. Where I can get more of compact summary detailed can see where my books have been closed. I can see my P. And L. And then, of course, my my balance sheet. If I do want to export this Carlo for your example, you have,

179
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:09.490
Drew (Puzzle): you can do all your accounting in here. If you want to send any of this documentation, or you can give your accountant actually puzzle access.

180
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:17.370
Drew (Puzzle): But, like, let's say it's tax package time. You can download this as a Pdf or Csv, and you can send this directly to your account or Cpa

181
00:25:17.997 --> 00:25:32.262
Drew (Puzzle): again. Anything that touches your finances will live in in puzzle. So we've kind of broken it down into a few different areas. So if it's just high level accounting, and see your general ledger where you just manage

182
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:41.440
Drew (Puzzle): you know anything that is cash basis or a cool basis chart of accounts, any kind of revenue. This would be coming invoices through stripe

183
00:25:42.048 --> 00:25:45.750
Drew (Puzzle): and then, of course, expenses, maybe through ramp or bill.com.

184
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.810
Drew (Puzzle): Do you have payroll?

185
00:25:48.030 --> 00:26:06.439
Drew (Puzzle): Let me set up with gusto or something. It might live right here. You guys are probably not at that stage yet. But that's kind of a high, level overview of puzzle. Again, we have a customer success manager, that will walk you through this. It is a self service product. You don't need to be an accountant or Cpa to be able to use this. And that's

186
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:22.243
Drew (Puzzle): purpose built for founders. If you do get to that point of needing an account, our customer success team will help you find an accountant, but we do have a marketplace of of 10,000 plus Cpas and accountants to help on the bookkeeping and and tax services side.

187
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:30.769
Drew (Puzzle): Any questions or anything that caught your eye. Maybe while I was demoing here that you have a question about, or count.

188
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:40.890
Chloe Lannert: I have a comment. I was Googling, if I could use this for you made the blood rush out of my face with the franchise tax being due in March.

189
00:26:41.344 --> 00:26:46.859
Chloe Lannert: and I was like, Oh, fuck! I googled it. Mine isn't until June I had June.

190
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.290
Drew (Puzzle): Good.

191
00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.589
Chloe Lannert: Train, and I'm really glad I was right on that. But

192
00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:58.450
Chloe Lannert: Because of that fear I was Googling puzzles free. If you're burning out of 5 KA month. I'm going to do this for my like dumb little Llc.

193
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:19.450
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah, if you're under 5. K, good. Yeah. One. Chloe, I'm glad you're that's okay. June. I'm glad that's true. And then yeah. Good point. If you're under 5 K and expenses puzzle is free and that's actually it gets kind of gets me next next point. I think I've some people that I met at least last week.

194
00:27:19.896 --> 00:27:32.020
Drew (Puzzle): You know we do have a great partnership with techstar. So any, you know, if you guys do want to get started, it is 50% off for our 12 month insights plan.

195
00:27:32.573 --> 00:27:44.159
Drew (Puzzle): So that's $50. Typically, so that'd be $25 a month just to get started. So it allows you essentially to do everything that I showed you. And then let me put the

196
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.439
Drew (Puzzle): so this didn't see chat, so you guys can access it.

197
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.820
Drew (Puzzle): Oh, saw Antoine! Thanks, Antoine.

198
00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:04.760
Drew (Puzzle): and then, Buddy, this is actually what I was. I'd sent to you. In terms of the

199
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:23.066
Drew (Puzzle): puzzle signal actually, is what I'm at least what we're calling it right now. Essentially, this would be able to have a health score for your portfolio, and understanding all of your financial health scores. So how many integrations were connected but high level? How is my business doing.

200
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:30.450
Drew (Puzzle): One thing that we focused on is is giving you AI kind of AI Chatbot feedback.

201
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.540
Drew (Puzzle): Essentially.

202
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:41.499
Drew (Puzzle): how is my business doing? Where should I focus, you know, off the top of my head if I saw my runway rate? Is Jan. This coming January

203
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.140
Drew (Puzzle): comparative to my revenue? I might, you know, have a forecastable.

204
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:53.920
Drew (Puzzle): you know, mo moment, or kind of some sort of analysis where it would give me a recommendation on where I should focus more of my time.

205
00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.038
Drew (Puzzle): at least from the finances. But

206
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.925
Chloe Lannert: So quick clarification is signal. The

207
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.860
Chloe Lannert: the portfolio side view, or is that what founders.

208
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:14.770
Drew (Puzzle): That's the portfolio sides view. So I'm sorry. That would. That's what founders would send to their investors.

209
00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:17.470
Chloe Lannert: Perfect. Okay. Cool.

210
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.880
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah, it would give them kind of a high level view point. Because

211
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:37.730
Drew (Puzzle): I'm sure all these founders can can agree. Do they want their investors, seeing their entire balance sheet at any given time? Probably not. Most likely not do. They need to. No. Should they see that maybe their high level numbers. Yeah, that's probably fine.

212
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.960
Chloe Lannert: Just to see they're on the right. The right track.

213
00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:55.710
Drew (Puzzle): So you guys, yeah, links in there feel free to to check it out again. It's a techstars, 50 within using the code, 50% off on our insights plan for the entire year. And if you're, you know, we

214
00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:03.320
Drew (Puzzle): start with a 14 day free trial either way. So you guys can check it out and then if your expenses are under 5 k, like Chloe, you can just try it out for free.

215
00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:12.010
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah, that's all I had really had. If you guys had any other questions.

216
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:16.580
Drew (Puzzle): let me know, Chloe, I don't know if you want. If you had any more for me.

217
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.139
Chloe Lannert: Just high level? Is everyone good on their taxes?

218
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.350
Drew (Puzzle): Yeah?

219
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.389
Drew (Puzzle): Good? Question.

220
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:25.110
Chloe Lannert: Yes.

221
