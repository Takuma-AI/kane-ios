1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.130
Chloe Lannert: Just gonna start recording

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.200
Chloe Lannert: and

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.565
Chloe Lannert: get straight into it. So we're just gonna start

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.989
Chloe Lannert: with a tour, is the screen sharing, working for everyone.

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.740
Chloe Lannert: And has everyone been able to get into Techstar's universe?

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.057
Chloe Lannert: Good. Okay. So

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.660
Chloe Lannert: I'm going to start with the most important thing, and possibly the most powerful tool that techstars has

8
00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:36.250
Chloe Lannert: tulip. So there's a form where you let tech stars know that you're fundraising and you get access to a lead management tool

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:53.740
Chloe Lannert: and a bridge for warm intros through techstar central. So I don't have access to that. But if you're actively accepting checks, let me know, and we'll get you on that platform because it's 1 of the coolest things techstars does in terms of helping founders raise and and

10
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.499
Chloe Lannert: create powerful intros through through techstars.

11
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:05.580
Chloe Lannert: A little bit of background about universe. David Cohen named it. A universe full of stars.

12
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.449
Chloe Lannert: a place where all the tech stars. Folks get to be in touch with each other.

13
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:29.450
Chloe Lannert: It is a bit of a legacy system. So there are some weird quirks that I'm gonna try to walk you through and help make universe a little bit more manageable. I will say, in terms of data protection. There are some really saw, like kind of significant limitations to what it can do, due to the way it was set up at the start.

14
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:47.920
Chloe Lannert: And we have some brilliant engineers working on sort of creating backdoors and and making it more manageable, so it will continue to get better, as those folks figure out back doors. But at the moment I'm just going to give you sort of my best tips on how to make this usable and beneficial with its given limitations at the moment.

15
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.170
Chloe Lannert: So.

16
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.280
Chloe Lannert: starting off with the directories

17
00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:10.590
Chloe Lannert: with the Entrepreneur Directory, we have a ton of mentors and founders, and just like great operators across the board Desiree Varkas Wrigley is one of our Chicago mentors actually, who just raised a fund of her own. So she's she's great. I'm glad glad she's popping up

18
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:17.528
Chloe Lannert: but in terms of searching these people, I really would recommend going for the

19
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.810
Chloe Lannert: has email and has

20
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.889
Chloe Lannert: discord. So the has contact info right here

21
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.960
Chloe Lannert: is really important in terms of making sure you're able to reach these people easily.

22
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.390
Chloe Lannert: So if you search by has email, it will

23
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:46.671
Chloe Lannert: cut the people down pretty significantly, but you'll be able to reach them much more easily if you're looking to get in touch with people, and then you can search by any industry, any revenue model if you're looking for channel partners.

24
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.650
Chloe Lannert: But customers

25
00:02:48.660 --> 00:03:08.649
Chloe Lannert: mentors anything in here. These are. This is a really great way to get a warm sort of tech stars intro and people will will likely answer at a higher hit rate than than regular cold outreach. But it's important to filter by people having this contact info here, because not everyone does

26
00:03:09.118 --> 00:03:10.859
Chloe Lannert: sad reality of the setup

27
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:24.270
Chloe Lannert: in terms of the company directory. Here is where you'll find all the companies that tech stars has invested in over. I believe it goes back like a solid 17 years. 18 years.

28
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:48.280
Chloe Lannert: So this will be a great way if you want to learn from a company's previous experiences, talk to them about a channel partner they have. If you find anyone who is you like, run across someone on Linkedin who has tech stars involved, you can learn a little bit more info about when they went through techstars. Who their people are, get in touch with their founding team

29
00:03:48.480 --> 00:04:07.459
Chloe Lannert: through through this. So you can see when they went through, these people are active accelerator members, and you can control your how you show up through the CEO's page. So the CEO has outright control over how the company shows up. None of the other team members are going to be able to do that.

30
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.759
Chloe Lannert: So just giving you a heads up if if anything about how you show up in in universe. You aren't happy with CEO will be able to fix that

31
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.059
Chloe Lannert: for the Investor Investor Directory.

32
00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.289
Chloe Lannert: I I like to sort by has recent activity.

33
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.466
Chloe Lannert: And then

34
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.640
Chloe Lannert: people are really cagey with fund info here

35
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.599
Chloe Lannert: just outright. We see I've seen a few that are like one to $60 checks.

36
00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:57.880
Chloe Lannert: And it's it's people aren't super happy to to put their fund info out. But and and they also don't want to be responsible for incorrect info floating around, if they don't remember to, to keep this updated. But in terms of starting to prospect. If you have folks that you're looking at. It's helpful to see if there's they're on this list, because that shows that they're either they already

37
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:10.528
Chloe Lannert: have invested in techsource companies or interested in continuing to invest in techsource companies. So it's always nice to see if they show up here. And you can typically find a linkedin or

38
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.710
Chloe Lannert: just some, some

39
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.499
Chloe Lannert: sort of points of contact if they're on here. If you're looking at a fund.

40
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.299
Chloe Lannert: And then for the firm directory.

41
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.889
Chloe Lannert: same deal, you can typically typically find some people attached

42
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:36.869
Chloe Lannert: to each fund. So if if you are looking at a fund, but can't find an easy point of contact these people have signed up to be relatively accessible on here. So they're they're a good place to start

43
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:51.479
Chloe Lannert: in terms of the fundraising. So this is where that tool that I mentioned is going to show up. So it's a sort of Crm for investment. It lets you track your leads. All your warm intros show up here.

44
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:57.269
Chloe Lannert: Really powerful full tool which you get access to when you let texters know your fundraising.

45
00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:00.140
Chloe Lannert: Cool.

46
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.590
Chloe Lannert: And then, in terms of

47
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:18.869
Chloe Lannert: valuation. We we do have a little tool with lots of lots of disclaimers, but it's an interesting way to see how you sort of stack up compared to other companies in similar spaces, similar similar verticals, locations, all that good stuff in terms of valuation.

48
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:47.242
Chloe Lannert: And then on the resources side, lots of really great resources, including podcasts. Edu resources from our education team, portfolio services, access, valuation, tools and dilution. And then the big things that I really like to highlight. Here are. We have some legal document templates for little things like advisory agreements later down the line, or

49
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.143
Chloe Lannert: just different

50
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:57.500
Chloe Lannert: sort of features that you might you might need, but don't necessarily want to pay for we we do have some resources there, some patent resources.

51
00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.960
Chloe Lannert: and then

52
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:11.156
Chloe Lannert: the other big one is salary guidance that I see people using a lot. Because a lot of people have a really difficult time setting up those those 1st hire salaries

53
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.339
Chloe Lannert: and figuring out what to pay them how to treat them all that good stuff.

54
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.049
Chloe Lannert: We also have a few self-paced courses.

55
00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:27.730
Chloe Lannert: That you're welcome to take advantage of during our after program. I'm also going to take this moment to highlight that we have

56
00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:34.199
Chloe Lannert: an Angel Investment series that launches after every program. Give or take.

57
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:47.100
Chloe Lannert: And that's a great resource to look forward to. It's also sort of cohort based where you sign up with other recent graduates who are in a similar stage. It's a really nice way to share resources and get some guidance from

58
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.107
Chloe Lannert: our investment teams as you start angel rounds and then

59
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.420
Chloe Lannert: Vc rounds as well. We've also got some

60
00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:03.209
Chloe Lannert: investment lists. Compensation details. A bunch of a bunch of resources that that you should look through

61
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.690
Chloe Lannert: at your own pace.

62
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.160
Chloe Lannert: And then the big one

63
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.500
Chloe Lannert: perks.

64
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.770
Chloe Lannert: So has anyone taken advantage of any perks yet.

65
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.300
Chloe Lannert: yeah, relatively smooth. Anyone running into problems with any of those.

66
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.559
Annie Brown: We got a free year of Asana. So that's great.

67
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.180
Chloe Lannert: Nice. Nice. Okay, bricks are the best.

68
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:33.089
Chloe Lannert: The people running them are in general really, really solid and like delightful people who genuinely just want to help startups.

69
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.309
Chloe Lannert: So

70
00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.349
Chloe Lannert: pretty easy to search.

71
00:08:36.737 --> 00:08:48.410
Chloe Lannert: A lot of our perks. Providers are actually ex tech start companies. So if you would like to be included on the Perks page for the next round. That's something we can absolutely do. Post program.

72
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.099
Chloe Lannert: And you can sort by any sort of

73
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.380
Chloe Lannert: software.

74
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.950
Chloe Lannert: basically

75
00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:00.569
Chloe Lannert: anything you could be spending money on as an early stage company. We have a discount.

76
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.034
Chloe Lannert: cloud credits are are typically the biggest one. We also have

77
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.878
Chloe Lannert: real estate. Hr, lots of banks, lots and lots and lots of banks.

78
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:20.900
Chloe Lannert: payment processing whole whole deal. Lots of really really great great folks in there who are looking to be supportive.

79
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.180
Chloe Lannert: And then

80
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.379
Chloe Lannert: for the discord. This is a really weird one.

81
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.740
Chloe Lannert: You have to go to the entrepreneur directory here.

82
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.700
Chloe Lannert: and then open discord.

83
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.010
Chloe Lannert: So it'll you'll have to connect your own discord account.

84
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.390
Chloe Lannert: and then it lets you just open up

85
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.319
Chloe Lannert: a new community sort of tab within your personal discord.

86
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.320
Chloe Lannert: So

87
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.749
Chloe Lannert: it's pretty simple. Lots of

88
00:09:51.230 --> 00:10:02.088
Chloe Lannert: different channels. It. It puts you through a little questionnaire. When you 1st join about Geos. You're interested in verticals. You're interested in people you want to connect with. There are some women's groups,

89
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.659
Chloe Lannert: all across the board, a bunch of different little communities you can opt into.

90
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.780
Chloe Lannert: Oh, here you go! Hit Troro!

91
00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:16.542
Chloe Lannert: Nelson as well. This is one of our alums. Glad he finally made it in

92
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:31.039
Chloe Lannert: So it's a great place to connect with people pretty casually. If there's anyone you find in the Entrepreneur Directory, or any of the other directories who has discord. It's really easy to reach out to them directly through here.

93
00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:38.529
Chloe Lannert: Outside of that, the biggest sort of ad is that David Cohen is really active on discord.

94
00:10:38.590 --> 00:11:06.880
Chloe Lannert: So one of my favorite examples is one of our recent founders was building a little tool which was almost a promo for his wider business. It was just like something he was tinkering with, and he's like, Hey, any feedback on this would be super appreciated, and he had this whole back and forth with David about clarifying the audience for the tool and refining the ui so it's a really sort of casual low stakes way to connect with some really cool people. Yeah, true.

95
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.240
Çoruh | CogniScope: Who is the community manager of this discord channel.

96
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.970
Chloe Lannert: I believe it is Parker Parker Castleman. I will! I will check on that for you.

97
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:23.369
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, maybe we can add the cogniscope both inside of this discord channel. So

98
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.460
Çoruh | CogniScope: people can get track. What's going on here.

99
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.400
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

100
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.500
Çoruh | CogniScope: Just an idea.

101
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:37.299
Chloe Lannert: Honestly, I you should ask in the Discord channel who the community manager is? Because I I don't have a lot of clarity into that. But that's awesome.

102
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.570
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So overall. Pretty simple.

103
00:11:41.938 --> 00:11:45.521
Chloe Lannert: Good ways to connect with people on a wider scale.

104
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:57.590
Chloe Lannert: I think the best way to treat universe and discord, or universe in general is a source of data. And then, you do have to put in some work to create some of that warmth yourself.

105
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:24.439
Chloe Lannert: It is. It's a platform. It's not, totally magic. If you write solid, personalized intro emails with reference to tech stars and using the data you can find on universe. I think you're gonna get a fair few hits. But it is. It's not a magic bullet. It's not gonna send you 800 perfectly matched investors. Automatically, you do have to do some work. And hopefully, that was helpful in helping you sort through that a little bit

106
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:27.169
Chloe Lannert: any questions at the moment.

107
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.348
George Reed - Noetic: Sorry. Thanks, Chloe, this is this is great.

108
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.709
George Reed - Noetic: You mentioned that we might be meeting with the Aws and the Google Cloud people as well at some point was that

109
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.159
George Reed - Noetic: gonna happen in the.

110
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.350
Chloe Lannert: Yes.

111
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.000
George Reed - Noetic: Week, so.

112
00:12:43.000 --> 00:13:00.189
Chloe Lannert: So Becky Trollstra will be meeting with all of you. In mentor madness. She's our aws. Rep. So I would recommend keeping your mentoring sessions with her as mentoring sessions, because she is a founder and operator herself, and she's incredible.

113
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:30.249
Chloe Lannert: But you'll have her information if you have any questions about aws, she'll be a great person to talk to. She'll also be coming back in week, 7 or 8, maybe 9. With her tech team to sit down with all of you guys and work through your tech stacks and give you feedback and and give you support, regardless of which cloud Provider. You use super super valuable resource that they they do for us. And and we're very grateful for for those technical sit downs.

114
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.028
Chloe Lannert: And then for Google.

115
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:43.239
Chloe Lannert: not next week, but the week after we'll have an intro session with their team, where they'll walk through the new Perks offering I I got. I've been speaking to their team a lot. It's

116
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:52.380
Chloe Lannert: they're they're redesigning the perks package to be much more sustainable and usable for early stage startups. So

117
00:13:52.460 --> 00:14:03.740
Chloe Lannert: the reps are incredible. They're really they're exfounders. One of them is an ex techstars, founder and ex techstars employee who is very, very in tune with what you guys need at this stage.

118
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:09.379
Chloe Lannert: And she's working really hard to design a Perks package that makes sense for the stage that you're at.

119
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.249
George Reed - Noetic: Wow, that's so awesome. Thank you. That's great. Yeah.

120
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.929
Chloe Lannert: Andrea that makes sense.

121
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:14.940
