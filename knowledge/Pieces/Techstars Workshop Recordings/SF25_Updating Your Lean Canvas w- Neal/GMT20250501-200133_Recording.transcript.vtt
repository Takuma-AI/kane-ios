1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
Vivian: Way that they solve their problems.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Good? And and has it? Has it helped shape anything for you, Vivian, as far as anything helpful that you could do next.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or that you want to apply to what you're gonna do with your business.

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.490
Vivian: Yeah, absolutely. There's a bunch of things things that are like.

5
00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:25.489
Vivian: that Dan was doing early on that I tried doing and just like

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.030
Vivian: didn't refine it. And I think that was really motivational to like, see how he really like got obsessed over 2 months. And

7
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.919
Vivian: yeah, that's really cool.

8
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.379
Vivian: And thanks.

9
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, Dan has. If you can gather like a bit of an indomitable spirit.

10
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, I'll I gotta let Chris in one second. I'm coming. I'll let him in. I'll let him in. You're good.

11
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I accidentally locked the door.

12
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.067
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I just wants to hang out with me.

13
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Get in here, man, you're good.

14
00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:25.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But yeah, Dan has an indomitable spirit like, and I I can't just tell you all to be like him. But I will say like there's something to be said whenever I see anybody who's like either licking their wounds, or is feeling kind of down about some aspect of the business that isn't thriving or doing well like I would have a what would Dan do? And a what would Mert do? Wristband on my on my body? Because whenever I look down at them. I'm like.

15
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:37.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I guess I just need to suck it up and jam, because this is just the life of a startup founder, and like every single day is gonna have ridiculous ups and downs. But this is what I signed up for, and I'm gonna win, anyway.

16
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's kind of the energy, you know.

17
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.079
Vivian: That's what it takes. So yeah, really, awesome.

18
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:57.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, like, I mean, how do we get multi 1 million dollar outcomes and exits 5 to 10 years from now with any business? And why is the rest of your team and employees gonna look at you like, why do you guys get to get the biggest part of the pie? And it's like, well, you don't know what I went through to get here.

19
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.050
Vivian: Yeah.

20
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, so cool any other thoughts. Feedback. Ankur. I'm looking at you, man. I know you always have thoughts.

21
00:02:05.548 --> 00:02:25.340
Ankur Toshniwal: The well, okay. So oh, Bob's 1st I think, Bob, I think, actually, interestingly enough, listening to how he was breaking down. Everyone else's business was a little bit more particularly useful for us, I think, for us specifically, that my main takeaway was like focus on how

22
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.409
Ankur Toshniwal: our product is changing our relation, changing the relationship of

23
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:42.370
Ankur Toshniwal: our customers to their customers. Right? Because that's like we're kind of like the back end for it. So making, ensuring that because of harvest, people like sales play act, for example, is gonna be like

24
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:54.080
Ankur Toshniwal: we, our customers love us because we can get better insight for them in every, in every facet. Right? So that makes a lot of sense to us. I think it's really hard, though, I think, to get

25
00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.650
Ankur Toshniwal: for him to be able to dive super deep and really get the type of insight that is more nuanced. It's really fast and so

26
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:12.923
Ankur Toshniwal: I don't know what you guys can do. As far as structure goes. I know his time is so valuable, and I understand why you do it this way, because he's he's also, you know, quick and stuff, but

27
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:37.940
Ankur Toshniwal: In some ways, I think we almost gained more value by listening to him break down other companies where he has more experience than our specific one, unfortunately, but it was either way extremely valuable to learn how he thinks about it. And how he speaks really, clearly, and how he keeps things to. There's like 4 metrics, that matter. I do not give a shit about anything else. Right. He's like, What's your churn? What's your revenue?

28
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:48.180
Ankur Toshniwal: Are you increasing sales? What's your relationship with your customer? And like, That's it like? Don't worry about anything else. So that was nice to hear and hear it on a repeated basis. How he took that same

29
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:53.936
Ankur Toshniwal: philosophy and applied it to all these different businesses. I mean, that was demand side sales. But

30
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.359
Ankur Toshniwal: seeing someone kind of adapt in real time to all the different things, really.

31
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:12.530
Ankur Toshniwal: really emphasizing the fact that it truly does apply. It's not just something. It's not like theory, right? It can. It can really apply. So I think that's cool to see in real time, even if they're for us, at least specifically for harvest, was

32
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.060
Ankur Toshniwal: not exactly a totally actionable thing that came out of it. it is makes makes us want to like

33
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.070
Ankur Toshniwal: oh.

34
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.819
Ankur Toshniwal: go deeper and believe even more so in demand side sales. Not that we didn't, but just like see it. In practice. It's cool.

35
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Well, I I'm not able to say it out loud. But or normally so, Chloe, if you don't mind, can you pause the recording.

36
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.070
Andrew Fernandes: Maybe.

37
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, sorry go ahead!

38
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.900
Andrew Fernandes: Oh, yeah, I think it might be worth.

39
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Andrew, you go. And then, Chris.

40
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:52.119
Andrew Fernandes: Okay, yeah, I I think you might. I don't know if you said it, but it might be worth emphasizing at the beginning that I've tried all these other frameworks. This is the one that works the most. And this is why.

41
00:04:52.593 --> 00:05:00.720
Andrew Fernandes: with regard to jobs you definitely emphasize, this is the one thing I want you to take away, but emphasize the fact. I've looked at all these others. I've seen all these other ones many times. This is the one that works.

42
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I totally agree with your feedback, Andrew. Thank you. All right, Chris. I'm muting.

43
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:38.690
Chris Wong: Yeah, I I thought it was real. I I did really like the format where you went into different companies because you started to get like kernels of information through each one. So that was really helpful, and it gave like a live like practical, like dive dive, deep kind of experience. I thought one thing would be helpful is kind of getting a little bit more time with him, because I there was some like kernels I was trying to get at at least my experience from for ours. He was. I was surprised by how fast he was able to like, identify where the the hurdles are, and the pain and the problem that you're trying to fit like we're facing.

44
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.339
Chris Wong: I think one thing that could have been helpful was

45
00:05:42.590 --> 00:06:10.860
Chris Wong: part of part of my experience was kind of giving him a little bit information from the Jtpd's that we've done to kind of like. Give him a little more color on it, so I don't know if that's like giving it ahead of time more or like letting him kind of bake on like the the work that was done. For the Jtpd's, and it it mine could have been the fact that I like, submitted mine late. So I'll take. I'll take a fault on that one, but like kind of looking at the work that we've done, and kind of like giving us a little more tailored kind of feedback on that one expectation I had was like.

46
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:19.220
Chris Wong: if we were on the right track, or whether we need to do more Jtbds in this area, or like, where do we go? From? Where we're at to the next step? The next immediate step

47
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:32.740
Chris Wong: would be helpful. But otherwise, like I yeah. So on that front. Just maybe more understanding of like kind of the work that we've done and where we should go next. And a little more time.

48
00:06:32.740 --> 00:07:01.420
Chris Wong: But other than that, like, I was just yeah. I was pretty surprised by how he was able to map his depth of understanding with kind of the work that he's done before with our current like company. And then almost like he's almost like playing chess a little bit, because he was like, well, the end game is this is how you win. And it's like, Okay, like, got it like he's able to like, get to that. And I just would like to break down like how he like got to that step of like kind of the end game a little bit like, what? What are the things that he was thinking about to kind of get him there. But yeah, otherwise I thought it was overall super, you know.

49
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:23.900
Chris Wong: it's like, Oh, and one last one is like being able to do like a QA. At the end, because there was some quick. We we did the Jtpd like work, and like the framework. And so there was kind of general questions that I had in my mind that I wanted to kind of like pick his brain on, and I tried to look at his other like talks and stuff to like get that answer. But it was like wanted to like, ask some kind of general questions about the process. One, like the example that comes to my mind is like

50
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:38.420
Chris Wong: for b 2 b companies when you have like a decision maker, and then a buyer like, what's the Jtbd. Like to get the best kind of information like that? And then how you integrate those 2 Jtbs together to kind of cut like a full picture of that. But anyways, yeah, that's it.

51
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Chris, if you wanna mute, okay, cool, I'll respond to what you said, and then we can hear from encore next.

52
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a few things. One.

53
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:56.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I will try to give you access more access to Bob. But just so, you know, it's rare for him to even do this like like he says no to every other

54
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:16.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: techstars request, or Y combinator or individual companies like Dude's time, is super valuable to him, and he is very exclusive, and it's very expensive. So the fact that we even had 2 h with him yesterday where he's willing to do that is like more of a favor to me than it is like his willingness or obligation in any respect. That being said like I told you with Jake.

55
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: he will help you if there's a reason for him to interact, and if I,

56
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:49.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, like and and willing to bridge now, you can reach out to him directly, and every now and then he might respond. He may or may not. I don't know no guarantees there, but I recommend all of you to contact Bob and thank him for the workshop and like expand on what he talked to you about and like. Let him know if you have additional questions, and if you don't hear back from him. I can help escalate it and get a response, and reach out to him directly to do so. I talk to Bob every week, but that's not access that everybody's gonna be able to hatch.

57
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:59.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I just wanna make sure I manage that expectation. Because, like, yeah, his. Yeah, his. His time is insane, and the fact that I get him for our startups is an exclusive deal.

58
00:08:59.653 --> 00:09:04.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: For for this program and for you guys encore.

59
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:11.049
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, so sorry, Carlo. and one of the things that I I really

60
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:18.450
Ankur Toshniwal: maybe it's just like this like version, where I really want to know how his theory applies to like

61
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:40.919
Ankur Toshniwal: not 100 million dollar companies. I mean, like trillion dollar companies, 1 billion dollar companies. Right? I know that you guys talked about Facebook, Meta place, but I what I and and the marketplace. But I wanted to almost understand how his breakdown of how some of the biggest companies in the world like when, whether Netflix started, how did the CEO did Reed Hastings break down, break it down right? Well, what's his analysis of like.

62
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.310
Ankur Toshniwal: how was

63
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:53.249
Ankur Toshniwal: demand side sales? Maybe, even if the Ceos didn't apply it directly, as like, they didn't say that they did this. How were they actually doing it in in practice.

64
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, yeah, I'm here.

65
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And the reason so Steve Jobs is a good example for that.

66
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:09.339
Ankur Toshniwal: Right? Right? And and the reason I'm sorry. The reason I asked that is because there are certain there's levels to it, right? There's people who are operating here, and then, you see the people who are operating here now, there might not actually be a difference.

67
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.149
Ankur Toshniwal: But you we

68
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:28.239
Ankur Toshniwal: to be able to bridge that gap is like, I wanna learn. I wanna also learn. How is Steve Jobs thinking, how is whatever? You know, Sam Altman, or whatever these top people at the top thinking through and they have a lot of different frameworks that they're applying and I kinda wanna understand, how does the jobs framework.

69
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yep.

70
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:36.170
Ankur Toshniwal: Apply in that level because my my ambition isn't like to be a a million dollar business. And we're trying to build a billion dollar.

71
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, that's exactly right.

72
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.129
Ankur Toshniwal: And so I wanna I wanna just understand how it applies.

73
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I love that.

74
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:42.500
Ankur Toshniwal: Level.

75
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:52.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I love that ankur. Why don't we talk about this together like maybe you and I can have like a a like a mind. You know, Mastermind, like session, where we talk through what I think would make the most sense. But as a quick hint

76
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:58.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm gonna say 2, 3, 3 names. Steve Jobs.

77
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Jeff Bezos, Jason freed. So I think those 3 as a starting point.

78
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:10.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then we can expand beyond that. But I think those 3 people. If you study what they say, wherever they talk.

79
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you're gonna find the same language of what Bob is talking about, and teaches.

80
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.690
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah. And it's but it's even more nuanced right? Like. So like everyone.

81
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I agree.

82
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.229
Ankur Toshniwal: And that's the part is like, okay. So.

83
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Totally. That's why we're going to work.

84
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.810
Ankur Toshniwal: Right.

85
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:35.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You and I. Let's break it down and talk about the origin story of each of these individuals as they went about embarking on business, how they thought about what businesses they wanted to make, because it's not a mistake that each of those people that I just mentioned built 1 billion dollar companies.

86
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.440
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, yeah.

87
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But did so in a way where they intended to from the beginning, in some sense.

88
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.770
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, cool. Thank you.

89
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Carlo.

90
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.759
Carlo Scaglia: I've only like frustrating in a good way, in the sense that

91
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.020
Carlo Scaglia: I think the chat with Bob

92
00:11:51.160 --> 00:12:10.219
Carlo Scaglia: reassured me that my Jdbds were done. Well, then, that's also why I sent you a message, because I want to understand if that's like, if I perceive that correctly, but in the sense that nothing of what he just simply guided me to to think and process that made more sense. But it was nothing that surprised me, and the outcome, which was really reassuring.

93
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:28.429
Carlo Scaglia: But then it was the same as when, like with with the demand side sales and competing against lock, I find it frustrating when you know, you've got the right thing. But then it's like, how do I implement that on a scale process and actually like use that to grow my business. Same with the milkshake approaches. Okay, they identified that. People just wanted it for convenience.

94
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:36.140
Carlo Scaglia: How does that change? How they sell it? And I think Dan's chat was really cool, but then it was also like.

95
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.370
Carlo Scaglia: That's that little step just ahead. And I understand the process I really get. I really like it.

96
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:50.640
Carlo Scaglia: But then, as you said, also, toss is that you're still in that kind of like early phase and scrapping stuff together. So it's kind of like I know what we have. What we have

97
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.080
Carlo Scaglia: is really powerful, and it's really good.

98
00:12:53.540 --> 00:13:01.720
Carlo Scaglia: But it's not yet at the level, through that scale. Iterative process that Dan was talking about, so I found it still. Really.

99
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:12.779
Carlo Scaglia: I get frustrated with having so many different options, but still struggling to put them like, put my ducks in a row and be like doing this, hitting this, doing that, one doing that one or bringing to XI could.

100
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:13.770
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah.

101
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.590
Carlo Scaglia: Half guessing game around it, you know.

102
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:22.949
Ankur Toshniwal: Sorry I just wanted to do, Carlo. I picked. I have had the same exact feeling with when Dan said that to you specifically, because

103
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:34.610
Ankur Toshniwal: I think that is, it felt like it was applicable to you. And I was like, Wait. Why? Why is it too early to do those things? And I was a little confused by that I mean.

104
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.490
Carlo Scaglia: System.

105
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:58.080
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, yeah, but it it felt like it felt like, for some reason people are saying like, Oh, like, this is, like, not people, but it felt like for a moment right there in that moment was like, Oh, that's for me, not for you. And then you're like, okay, then what's for me like? How do I act on it then? Like what? What is, what? How do? What do I do with this? Then? Right, if it if you're saying we're too early. I don't know. It's a little tricky.

106
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.400
Carlo Scaglia: Job is to tell us what to do. But it's like understanding how we take

107
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:09.159
Carlo Scaglia: these kind of founding informations that are different stages, and we fit in between. It's like, how do you make sense

108
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:14.070
Carlo Scaglia: of everything to then turn into like a process that you're confident

109
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:29.370
Carlo Scaglia: in pursuing? Because at least I don't know about you guys, but one of my struggles is I pursue one thing heads down. It's like fuck like actually. Now something else come in, and I do that one, and it's like, Oh, you should do that one, and I'm like, My God, you're right, fuck. I need to do that one, too, right? And then I end up doing a bunch of half things.

110
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:38.079
Carlo Scaglia: and it's like they're all kind of right. But you're not sure which one is the most right, you know, to really pull that lever to get to the next step. And it's that

111
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:45.450
Carlo Scaglia: kind of guess, boiling, frustrating frustration, knowing that you've got the right thing, and it's got a great amount of potential because you've already tested it.

112
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.100
Carlo Scaglia: But now, how do we go from a tested potential to like.

113
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.109
Carlo Scaglia: Probably shit. Everyone's using it.

114
00:14:54.130 --> 00:15:09.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: None of us can be the CEO for you, Carlo, but I will sit down with you and iron out all of the specific experiments and goals that you have and get aggressive and like very intense about which things you might need to sacrifice in order to focus on a few key experiments that you think will get you there.

115
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:18.470
Ankur Toshniwal: Maybe the takeaway is that once you do know, then you're gonna know. And unfortunately.

116
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:39.369
Ankur Toshniwal: it's the process of you know, like, and until you put together those pieces, then you're going to be in dance seat, being like, hey? This is what I did now. It may not apply to your business, but like, and it may not be right for you, or whatever it's possible, and that's I. I feel it, man, that's frustrating. But it's probably also probably. Why, companies have IP in the sales motion itself

117
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:49.119
Ankur Toshniwal: right like there's IP there. And I thought it was actually really interesting point, putting together pieces from other talks that someone had talked about. Who was it? Let's talked about sales. IP.

118
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.610
Andrew Fernandes: Yes, it was like last week, or maybe the week before someone said that your sales process is part of your Id.

119
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.050
Ankur Toshniwal: And I was, yeah.

120
00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:11.909
Ankur Toshniwal: like, Carla, I'm excited to see how you're probably gonna walk away with this saying like, Oh, actually, we have sales IP, because you put together like 15 different like things. And like, this is the one that worked, and you know no one could tell it to you, you had to put it together. This is just hard.

121
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.200
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah.

122
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I love the notion of sales. IP. That's great.

123
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:23.310
Carlo Scaglia: It's a to recap. It's like a positive frustration, because, on one hand it proves on the right track.

124
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.379
Carlo Scaglia: On the other hand, it's like. Oh, fuck's sake, you know.

125
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, anyone else.

126
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright.

127
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:52.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this won't take long. We've got about 40 min definitely 40 min. I have to hard stop because I have a zest board meeting right at the top of the hour before with Jake. So we're at 2

128
00:16:53.301 --> 00:17:14.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so take a look at this. Take it in. I've got your lean canvases pulled up on the next tab, and we're gonna pick out a few people to talk through but would love for you all to digest this. You might have to zoom in a little bit. I know it's a little small of a of a font, so if you know how to zoom in on your computer. Do that? You need me to open it as a separate file and zoom in, let me know.

129
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:30.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And, by the way, this isn't a currently in canvas. This was back when he was doing tech Sars. So this is like fundamentally shifted and changed. I'll try to get an updated one from him.

130
00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:52.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm happy to share this with you all afterwards as a reference point. But at the time when I was running this program with Jake in it. Verona was also in the same program as Jake. This was probably more of a gold standard. It was close and directionally correct to what I was hoping some founders would come up with. There are some areas here that needed some work and improvement, and we're a little paltry, such as channels. That being said, I wanted to use this as a way to kind of simplify keeping your business on a single snapshot well documented.

131
00:18:52.270 --> 00:19:08.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is why I asked you all, when you applied to techsars to do this. There are plenty of versions of canvases that exist. So, for example, there's an even simpler one that is decent, but still misses out, I think, on some components that lean canvas that's better. But even like something as simple as this

132
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:22.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: might be helpful for you all to think about, always being able to consistently and cleanly summarize what it is that you are doing with your business, so to bring it back here for a second. There are 2 boxes here that matter more than anything else. First, st

133
00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm curious to know which ones you think they are.

134
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.040
Alex Nativelle: Problem.

135
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yep, and.

136
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.889
Alex Nativelle: Customer, segments.

137
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:45.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Exactly. Thank you. So the whole point of like my energy here, with wanting to talk to you all about this is that the problem in customer segments. Boxes have to be done 1st and done really well

138
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: once those are dialed in everything else, kind of falls into place to a certain extent.

139
00:19:51.004 --> 00:19:54.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but the next area that people tend to struggle with Uvp and unfair advantage.

140
00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:17.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So problem, customer segment is the most important Uvp and unfair advantage, and to be the toughest to actually get right. And to be confident about that. I've seen with founders who fill this out. The rest are things that you guys have had our support in developing, or you already had coming in. Or you know, you're actively working on your solution. A lot to talk about there, especially for folks like Carlo, that are envisioning new tech to build out

141
00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:28.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: channels. That's like a sales proxy. Obviously, so, jobs to be done through customer segments help you figure that out. Your metrics. You guys do every week, and we're refining that, giving you feedback

142
00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:42.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: revenue stream and cost structure. Lots of business math and maneuvering financial models and creative thinking about business model but I use this lean canvas as a proxy, for, like how well a founder can truly articulate what it is that you're here to do.

143
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and any company that, or sorry, any person that you bring into your team.

144
00:20:47.410 --> 00:21:09.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you should be able to share a document like this for them to wrap their head around. What it is that we're here to do as a as a team. And as a business. So, in addition to the why, before the why, which is like a deep dive, write up of who your customer is, and who we're here to help. This is like, Hey, early team member 1st 5, 1st 10. I want you to understand my entire company and our business and our strategy, and this is my way of talking you through it and explaining it to you clearly.

145
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:29.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I use this as an appendix whenever I recommend. You know a company in an investor conversation or call if I use it as a reference point. If I need to talk to someone at a high level about my business. And they're gonna drill into specific areas. This is kind of like my starting table of contents.

146
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:39.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: For how I would drill into aspects of the business and and speak about it cogently. So any questions about the boxes clarifying any of these components before we look at some of you all's and talk through them.

147
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It all makes sense.

148
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, Carlo.

149
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.599
Carlo Scaglia: I was saying. It's all good.

150
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So who wants to? Who wants to go on the chopping block?

151
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.900
Carlo Scaglia: Hold on the trouble block.

152
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There we go. I already knew it.

153
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:14.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let's talk through this. And then I guess we can. I mean, Carla, we can focus on problem and customer segment. If it's most helpful to you, there's other areas you want us to like, spend time talking through and giving feedback on. Let's do that.

154
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.100
Carlo Scaglia: Sure

155
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:25.489
Carlo Scaglia: as in. Do you want me to start going through it, or like, what's the approach with this? Do I need to like? Give them my feedback, based on what I've learned from the past almost 2 months.

156
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:35.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I want everyone here to read the problem in customer segments box for the next 30 seconds, and then I, Carlo, I want you to explain what's different. And then I want to talk through what's helpful for you.

157
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool. So take 30 seconds. Read those sections, and then we'll talk about it

158
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:27.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool? Okay, any clarifying updates, Carlo, before we ask you questions about it.

159
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:35.020
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah, one overarching one is the fact that mainly problem on customer segment are not fundamentally wrong. They're just not the best

160
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:39.640
Carlo Scaglia: one. So within the problem. Yes, there is a fast growing demand of content campaigns.

161
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:45.800
Carlo Scaglia: but it's when I write advertising advertisers are dying, shown by massive layoffs.

162
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:54.110
Carlo Scaglia: That's kind of correct. But what's more, credit is the fact that the huge old school ones are dying off because they're used to the old big productions

163
00:23:54.270 --> 00:24:01.290
Carlo Scaglia: instead. What's been rising is these medium sized, super agile agencies, like the one that I sent you nearby, like the founder of Akq.

164
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:02.940
Carlo Scaglia: A new one.

165
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:12.979
Carlo Scaglia: and that brands will still always go to an agency from a safety net. But instead, it's these medium sized agencies that require solutions like ours to power all of them

166
00:24:13.602 --> 00:24:21.240
Carlo Scaglia: campaigns, and they really struggled to find the right people to keep up with production. They need to source fast as they can do more jobs and actually

167
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:30.119
Carlo Scaglia: stay afloat. So in the customer, segment is no longer these medium to large brands, because either they work with agencies or their kpis are not

168
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:41.769
Carlo Scaglia: title revenue goal. They're just a number that they address because they think they have to do it. So the customer segment is now the producers within these medium sized agencies that work

169
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.790
Carlo Scaglia: 3 to 5 different briefs every single month.

170
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:52.570
Carlo Scaglia: So, yeah, that's been the fundamental change between the problem and customer segment where the original one was not

171
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.779
Carlo Scaglia: to say wrong is just, was too superficial.

172
00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:13.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Correct. Yeah. So I was gonna say, like reading this, there's a very obvious deficiency, I think, in both the problem and customer segment box. But I, before I make like, give that out. I'm curious to know if anyone else on the call once either ask or comment about what I'm referring to.

173
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.460
Ankur Toshniwal: The the problems are trends.

174
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Correct.

175
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.260
Ankur Toshniwal: They're not problems that your users face so like

176
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:29.220
Ankur Toshniwal: they that you said it, Carlo, at the end, which is perfect, which is they? Your customer can't.

177
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:35.530
Ankur Toshniwal: can't create content fast enough. That's the core. If that's 1 of the problems that's an actual problem.

178
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:42.600
Ankur Toshniwal: The rest of this stuff is trends as to why? It's a problem which are really important. But they're not the actual problem.

179
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.010
Ankur Toshniwal: The problem is, they can't create content fast enough.

180
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:59.360
Ankur Toshniwal: and they can't do it, because whatever whatever whatever but that's the if that's the core problem, I don't know all of your core problem. But that's the problem. And the second problem is, it costs too much to make content right? Or you know, if those are the 2 things, those are problems.

181
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:03.360
Ankur Toshniwal: And then the rest of them are friends.

182
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.249
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, as to why? Yeah.

183
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Anyone else want to add anything for specifically customer segments.

184
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:37.110
Alex Nativelle: I would say, I find it like what you said, like what is written here for me is way too broad, and then for you. I would love to get more. I think you have way more insights into like you said, you know, leaner medium size agency. But that's probably way more stuff that you uncover during the jobs into like very specific types of customers.

185
00:26:39.710 --> 00:27:03.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Exactly what I'm seeing. Here are demographics and personas, not situations and struggling moments, and like more detailed circumstances that are targeted directly towards the most ideal customers that you need to target early on Carlo. And you did like. On course, said allude to that with what you were saying. That's an update to this. So I'd love to see that update. And we're gonna give you all time, like in a few minutes to probably workshop this in smaller groups, but

186
00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:17.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I do want to. Probably maybe we'll pull up a few more examples to talk through it. This is a very common flaw that the vast majority of companies that document their business model either on lean canvas or in written form, or in decks when they pitch to investors anything.

187
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:23.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Most of the time they're offering up these like demographics rather than the circumstances. So let's go back really quickly

188
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and reread the customer segment possessed.

189
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:40.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Compare this to what you just read from Carlo and what he wrote up, and it'll start to illuminate that at this stage in the program. That's how seriously Jake was taking lean canvases. I mean our jobs to be done in the lean canvas.

190
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He updated this with those new insights.

191
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:52.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you're familiar with who his customers are and what they're struggling with, and who they tend to be, and what they're up to, and even more refined with early adoption.

192
00:27:54.110 --> 00:28:02.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I would love to see this level of of nuanced detail with respect to all of you having done jobs to be done so incessantly so far

193
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:09.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: within that customer segment section as well as in the problem box. Like anchor. I highlighted for Carlo.

194
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.529
Ankur Toshniwal: One thing, though, I will say I didn't really understand the 1st problem bullet.

195
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:15.470
Ankur Toshniwal: Now let's.

196
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: People want to learn how kitchen sink intuition about food in a way.

197
00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:24.769
Ankur Toshniwal: To learn how kitchen sink intuition about food in a way that fits into their. That sentence doesn't make sense.

198
00:28:25.643 --> 00:28:27.390
Ankur Toshniwal: Didn't get.

199
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:38.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's it's a typo. So my understanding of that at the time was there was what Jake was learning and struggling with was that people would go into the kitchen and like they just kind of had stuff.

200
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:46.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And they're like sorting out the stuff that they have. And that was one of the problems that he wanted to solve, and he actually just rolled out that exciting like AI product.

201
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:59.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That kind of becomes like your pantry. And it like sorts out your pantry, and figures out recipes and stuff from the Internet, and beyond which is great. But he's finally addressing this now, which is cool to see that as the 1st problem.

202
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.939
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, like I would, I would go. I would say, even number 2. That's still like, kind of

203
00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:12.830
Ankur Toshniwal: young people have been told this. But why is that a problem? Right? The problem is probably that they want to. Young people are trying to build adult skills and.

204
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

205
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:18.096
Ankur Toshniwal: Do it right. That's that's the conversion from trend to problem.

206
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.350
Carlo Scaglia: We don't currently.

207
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.680
Ankur Toshniwal: Yes.

208
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.130
Carlo Scaglia: Like. For me. The problems were a bit loose and all that like I found the customer segment super clear.

209
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:25.680
Carlo Scaglia: But the problems.

210
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:32.100
Carlo Scaglia: even like people want to impress their loved ones. I'm like, is that a problem? Or is that just kind of like something they like to do?

211
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:44.320
Ankur Toshniwal: Right? Exactly. That's the thing. And then the problem might be that they're feeling disconnected or like, the problem is like they, they're they're left out of conversations, and they feel disconnected, or some some something like that. I don't know what it is.

212
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:52.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So apply that same scrutiny over here for Xori. Right? So let's you gotta get to there we go.

213
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:59.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let's do the same thing. What are we thinking there? So Jake had his little thing that we just refined right. But now, when I look at this.

214
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I feel like we're even further out.

215
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:03.810
Carlo Scaglia: Yeah.

216
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:05.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool.

217
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:13.060
Andrew Fernandes: Yeah, in the case of Jake, I think if if he added on to those bullets and I feel this emotion or they they feel this emotion. They feel incompetent or helpless, or whatever.

218
00:30:13.523 --> 00:30:16.639
Andrew Fernandes: That's the bridge. In the case of Carlo I think it's

219
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:21.459
Andrew Fernandes: it could be an emotion, but I think it'd be more quantifiable if you just said dollar value or time value

220
00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.870
Andrew Fernandes: being lost.

221
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay. Who else wants? Some love.

222
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.190
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, let's go.

223
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.934
Alex Nativelle: Okay, that's gonna be fun.

224
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.319
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, let's do the 1st one.

225
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.350
Alex Nativelle: It's gonna be better.

226
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Take 30 seconds.

227
00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right.

228
00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:25.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Thoughts, comments, feedback clarifications. Alex. You can offer it up 1st before people comment. If you'd like.

229
00:31:26.177 --> 00:31:46.690
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, I think those are things that we have. Still like the problem of students, I think we went deeper into it. And that's yeah. Basically, they don't have resources. The stress factor is very important. And that helps us refine also the

230
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:54.650
Alex Nativelle: target for like the students. So it's very much so for very stressed students, for very.

231
00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:04.019
Alex Nativelle: they feel like the positions are hard to get. They're very competitive. And so that's where they tend to put most efforts into into those positions.

232
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:21.509
Alex Nativelle: And for the coaches, I would say the second bullet point is a big one, definitely, and then for the customer segments there's 1 that is really important, which is apprenticeship, which is something in France that we've discovered.

233
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:49.209
Alex Nativelle: which is basically the students go and work while they're studying with a company, and they get paid to do that. But if they don't get the contract with the company, then they can't pay for the school, and the school has spent money chasing them, and then gets nothing out of it. So the conversion, the fact that they get a job while studying is, you know their Ltv. Of the students.

234
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.519
Alex Nativelle: I don't know if that makes sense.

235
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, I guess that that tracks for me. But any thoughts or feedback from the group.

236
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:20.430
Chris Wong: Yeah, I thought this one for this I was. There's a disconnect between the customer segment. I think it's a little too high level. And then the problems that are faced here. So like, I'm looking at higher education institutions. And maybe it's like what type of higher institution it's like, what types of them like? Are they graduate school or undergrad? And then even deeper like, is it like a group within the institution so like the career services team.

237
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:45.210
Chris Wong: And then, when I go into like the problems, I'm seeing coaches and and students which are not necessarily the institution themselves, but like the people within the institution. So it's like being able to map the customer segment. And the problem, I think, would be like more like exactness and or like narrowness in terms of like the segment. And then also, like the problem that is tied towards that cut that segment.

238
00:33:45.793 --> 00:33:49.079
Chris Wong: So cause I'm seeing, like the disconnect between the 2 right now.

239
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:55.359
Andrew Fernandes: I have a question kind of process, wise, regardless, when your customer and your user are different.

240
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.710
Andrew Fernandes: What's the best way to document that here, because in this case it applies.

241
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, you can include your users under in the same box of your customer segments.

242
00:34:04.467 --> 00:34:06.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But just offer up the disclaimer.

243
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's 2 layers.

244
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:15.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That being said like, you could also just manipulate it. And just say, Hey, user segments and customer segments, you can create your own box

245
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:16.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if you want.

246
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:28.430
antoinecarriere: Yeah, it feels to me be reading it now that higher educational institutions kind of services are almost like a channel of

247
00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:36.270
antoinecarriere: through which we reach users and true customers to some extent

248
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.750
antoinecarriere: that are, that are, that are the

249
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:51.380
antoinecarriere: the, the students or the people who are facing facing the problem.

250
00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:14.029
antoinecarriere: But it's it's really it's kind of we we have that struggle between. Who is the buyer? Are we kind of? Are we talking? Are we kind of trying to solve the problem of the carrier services? Are we trying to solve the problem of the job seeker? And that is, that is clearly apparent here. It's unclear what we're what we're targeting.

251
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:16.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hello!

252
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:23.210
Carlo Scaglia: I think it's not so much observation. But more of a question is, I'm curious to know how

253
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:28.939
Carlo Scaglia: Bob's comments yesterday might affect your reasoning around the link. Canvas.

254
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:41.140
Alex Nativelle: Probably affects it. I think it. It resonates with a lot of the things we've been talking about. You know, about the long term vision for brio.

255
00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:49.429
Alex Nativelle: And just, I think right now, we're more likely to. Okay. Let's re-watch it, because the intensity of the moment makes it tough to just

256
00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:54.699
Alex Nativelle: get everything. And I need to. We need to take a bit of a step back to.

257
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.479
Alex Nativelle: you know. Understand what he was saying? Exactly. And

258
00:35:58.068 --> 00:36:06.610
Alex Nativelle: unpack everything. But yeah, there's probably something here to do, and just go from where we are right now to maybe what

259
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.350
Alex Nativelle: he was saying, or to another path that we're crafting.

260
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.529
Ankur Toshniwal: I I think.

261
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:21.219
Ankur Toshniwal: for I I mean the customer segments. I I think the key issues. I think in the problem.

262
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:27.970
Ankur Toshniwal: it feels like, there's this bigger substance thing that's that you could, you guys could point out

263
00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:35.220
Ankur Toshniwal: it's and it feels like it's. It could be simple, simpler, which is simply that students education

264
00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:49.060
Ankur Toshniwal: isn't prepping them properly for jobs, for for employment, or something something like that is the foundational issue. Rather than the interview prep itself. It's like students aren't prepared for

265
00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:55.670
Ankur Toshniwal: employment. And then the bullets. And here's why, right, I just feel like there's 1 bullet maybe missing, which is.

266
00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:00.980
Ankur Toshniwal: students are students. Academic education isn't preparing them.

267
00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:19.510
Ankur Toshniwal: for, you know, to to to go into job interviews. And then the second, the second thing. Okay. Now the the coaches that help them are have limited availability. And so I think there's that that one line, maybe, and then that that like big meaty, what's this big giant problem you're solving is

268
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:24.370
Ankur Toshniwal: is, you guys know it. But it's just not written here. I feel. That's that's how I feel.

269
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.879
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, that's very interesting. Yeah, I love how you summarized it.

270
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:43.430
Vivian: I don't know where this plays into it, because I feel like whenever I've heard about your problem, you talk about it ultimately, it's like the universities need to raise money, and it relies on the ability for their students to get jobs, too. So I don't know where that

271
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:48.947
Vivian: fits into it, but I've heard that come out of our conversations as well.

272
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.840
Alex Nativelle: I'm not sure I understood exactly.

273
00:37:52.840 --> 00:38:05.460
Vivian: So talking about the problem, I guess, the ability to help students be more prepared for their their interviews. But if the ultimate goal is, for you know, students are not getting jobs, and this is gonna help them, but also help the universities.

274
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:05.950
antoinecarriere: Yeah.

275
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.849
Vivian: So I think that's the higher up. Maybe the 2.

276
00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:09.540
antoinecarriere: Was the

277
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:33.488
antoinecarriere: that was the pitch at the at the at the text. Introductory that Alex the pitch that you that that that you and I prepared where we focus on hey? Schools are not kind of delivering on their their core problem, and they're going to die if they? If they don't, if they don't, don't deliver, they they really need to kind of

278
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:42.860
antoinecarriere: and that. And that's kind of it's it's just another spin. Another kind of

279
00:38:44.100 --> 00:39:06.159
antoinecarriere: we? We do, we do we? We have some skills of on. Who are we talking to? Who is the customer? Are we talking to the head of the school. Are we talking to the current services? Are we talking to the students and the the discussion, the the presentation of the problem and the solution, etc, to the these various stakeholders is going to be very different.

280
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:09.409
antoinecarriere: And I think we're we're still unclear.

281
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.720
antoinecarriere: I think this Lincanva was really focused on the on this, the the school

282
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:23.220
antoinecarriere: and the carrier services, and to Chris's point, not maybe focused enough on on what?

283
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:36.399
antoinecarriere: I think we have. We have that a little bit of a really type problem. Who is the who in that complicated value chain? Are we? Are we talking to.

284
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:50.629
Ankur Toshniwal: Agreed. But and and when you do decide, I think it will be like clear. Because then your thing isn't that students aren't getting interview. Prep. It's then it's like students or colleges aren't being ranked better or aren't getting the

285
00:39:51.132 --> 00:40:17.750
Ankur Toshniwal: recognition that they need, because their students aren't getting placed at top jobs, right? Because then it's completely from the college perspective or the university perspective. And then that makes a lot of sense. Or it's completely from the student perspective. It's like they're not getting the jobs they need or colleges are not getting ranked better. They're not getting the endowment that they want, because, you know, they're not being able to place students at top top firms. Either of those is one of those is like the big big

286
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:23.069
Ankur Toshniwal: so and I love that like that makes me so excited for for you guys to go like

287
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:35.079
Ankur Toshniwal: kick, kick. This problem's ass, right? And then then the the steps of it are like, yeah, okay, like, what is the the bullets of it? That's stuff that you know, you guys have a lot of research on. It's awesome. But yeah.

288
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:41.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright, Chris, last comment. Then I've got a final exercise for us for the final 15.

289
00:40:42.260 --> 00:41:04.680
Chris Wong: Yeah, I think one comment that resonated was from Bob yesterday was that universities are really like, they're really like tight with their money. And so it seems like there's a struggle there with having them to be the payer. But maybe there's some way to get the students to push push this push the universities to get back whatever tuition money that they paid in some kind of way to create, that

290
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:28.540
Chris Wong: when I think about this, I think of a company called Handshake. I used to be their lawyer for a brief moment of time, but they had this struggle, and what they and and that's something I would like, maybe go into their see what their early stage playbook was to get into like career services and really become tapped in and kind of like penetrate within that. But this kind of like reminds me of that kind of like narrative, like being able to difficultly get into like the students, and they started to go after like

291
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:52.329
Chris Wong: students that are like very low tiered universities where their pain point was there. But they didn't go after the great big institutions, because they already had like resources and a built out system. But they were chasing after the really small universities. So I'm just like my my thought was just like, think about! Look at handshake, look at their playbook, and see how they did it in the early days, and that could have been like a good example of how to help with this slightly different pain point. But same type of like customers.

292
00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:15.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Awesome. Alright so quick Easter egg for you all like, I said, you can manipulate the canvas into whatever form makes sense for your situation. So here's when I ran for Mayor. How I restructured the link canvas the better. Reflect my efforts for the campaign, and you can see a little bit more detail about how I decided to like break down.

293
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:31.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how I thought about everything that was important. So just thought you guys would appreciate that this can take different forms. If you choose to modify it. So I just came up with these categories, because once I learned how political campaigns work. I reverse engine that engineered that into a campus I could talk to everybody about

294
00:42:32.336 --> 00:42:38.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this helped me like talk to people like Jason freed, for example, to become a big donor and supporter of my efforts at the time.

295
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:39.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

296
00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:47.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there's a level of detail. You can go. That takes a little bit further. It shows you're really like being serious about how you're thinking about. What's gonna drive your business forward.

297
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:49.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool?

298
00:42:49.540 --> 00:43:14.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So 7 min each we're gonna pair up the companies in here. Brio. Since we spent the most time on you, I'm gonna we're gonna triple you up into a group, so you can kind of be the referee and help another company dig in but Chloe's already got them queued up. What I want you all to do is take 7 min each. I recommend you record audio of it so that you can just talk it out with each other. Explain your lean canvas

299
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:35.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and talk through the the boxes of it. You can visualize it, or you can just have a conversation with them about it. But then I want to see updates after this of of your refined and refactored updated lean canvases doesn't have to happen tonight. It can happen in the next week, but I would love to meet with each of you, and actually walk through all the boxes in detail, and give each of you individualized coaching and feedback on how you talk about your business at a high level.

300
00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:50.990
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, and in terms of next steps seeing this and jobs reflected on your website and like how you're externally presenting alongside your sales materials. That's kind of the immediate follow up before I drop you in. Does everyone have access to their original lean canvas?

301
00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:58.796
Chloe Lannert: Can everyone find them? I mean I have them in a folder. I'll just copy that over in basecamp

302
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.400
Chloe Lannert: for anyone who doesn't.

303
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool. Okay, you guys understand the assignment.

304
00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright, Chloe, whenever you're ready we'll drop them in.

305
00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.020
Chloe Lannert: Great.

306
00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:45.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool.

307
00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:47.820
Chloe Lannert: Query.
