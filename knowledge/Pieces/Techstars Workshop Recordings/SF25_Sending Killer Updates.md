### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Brent Hasse: We're here for a reason, so just keep going through it. So I'll go through kind of my thought process. And it's really great the way Neil and Chloe kind of put this together. You're going to be able to see a couple of different versions of what different people do to kind of achieve the same result here. So high level for flat. So we're in all in one solution for homeowners. But we're actually building. We're a middleware data pipeline. That is a completely white labeled in branded app
- Brent Hasse: It is a process. You can break it down. But the best way to do it is to just keep, you know, trying trying new things and seeing what works. So once we get into the actual email itself. Here.
- Brent Hasse: and what you're going to do about it. It's not just saying, Hey, here's the good news. Here's the bad, but it's the actual processing of it to understand you. So you can start seeing how you actually go through this process.

### Key Insights

> "Brent Hasse: where it's like, Hey Week 11 flat update, but also try to have something in there to try to push yourself and challenge yourself to make it a little more exciting than just a flat week. 5 update. So something super simple you could do from the very beginning. And I, as hand up, am not a creative person. I don't think of myself as a creative person. I never thought you could learn to be creative."

> "Brent Hasse: There's other people on this email. So now they in front of their peers get the recognition that that they want so such an easy thing to do, and I still do it to this day. And then from there we kind of go through the Kpis, the key performance indicators, which is a whole separate thing which you'll talk about. Mine have continuously changed over time."

> "Brent Hasse: I'll get into here in a second of kind of diving into the bad news aspect of it, but want to be able to get through. Here's kind of the highs, the lows. And then really, this, the what we learned part is showing you is showing these potential investors which are the people on your email list that you have the critical thinking as to why these things happened"

> "George Haikal: Everything is all good. It's all just like pretty, like, we know. That's not true. Right? So it's really important to almost like bear your soul a bit to acknowledge some of the. Now it is important to be mindful of not trying to cast too negative of a light."

> "George Haikal: it gives people an opportunity to plug in and be helpful. And I love the what we learned. I don't necessarily see that in every update. But the idea of showcasing that critical thinking and how you're processing over time, it lets you create sort of a narrative."
