### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Sam Hegge: couple of things that I see early stage founders and founder led sales. I think I've worked with a lot of founders on just sales process early on is understanding your pipeline and being able to qualify and disqualify opportunities quickly. I think time is your most valuable asset, no matter who you are, and being able to understand, like when a conversation is going
- Chloe Lannert: Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. So for the current class. We're gonna use the hand raise feature on zoom, for when you wanna jump in and ask a question. Great places to start are with these lovely interest that we got, or any current issues you're running into with your existing pipelines, conversion rate like your your current sales processes. I know we've got some conferences coming up for some people, and they have questions on how to leverage that
- Alex Nativelle: Yeah, Hi, guys, I guess my question is around, how much automation slash tracking we should be doing versus, like, you know, actually selling and stuff like that. I'm always in the middle of like. Oh, I should track way more. Everything I'm doing. I've kpis conversion rate for like every steps of the process, etc. I said that like, Oh, this is taking me so much time in like setting up Crm setting up stuff like that. And so my guess is like, how do you view that like as early stage startup

### Key Insights

> "Eric Klein: Sure nice to meet you or see you all again. My name is Eric. I have done all kinds of sales. Sales is kind of my my thing if you will. I I like to joke that if I were a video game character my sales bar would be maxed out, and then everything else would just be like, Okay, so for me, my style of sales is always looking at it from the lens of helping people."

> "Burhan Syed: Yeah, I mean, I I believe in founder led sales only when we raised our investors, asked us a question, which is how much you went out to hiring other sales employees, and I said, None for the very long, foreseeable future. I think, echoing what Eric said. It's really important to understand that you are the domain expert. Likely be one of the only people who understand exactly what it is you do. And and how you're solving your customers problems."

> "Eric Klein: And it's tough, because I think, having the right data and understanding who your right Icp is. Who's, you know, clicking your clicking into your emails and and responding is very important. What Sam said, which is something that I live by is in sales. You want to go with win fast, lose fast, right? And if you are spending so much time looking for"

> "Eric Klein: as opposed to lose quickly the hierarchy of sales goes, win fast, lose fast, win slow, lose slow, and if you spend all of your time exclusively focusing on how to do sales and never actually doing the sales. You can't get enough data. So what I would say is."
