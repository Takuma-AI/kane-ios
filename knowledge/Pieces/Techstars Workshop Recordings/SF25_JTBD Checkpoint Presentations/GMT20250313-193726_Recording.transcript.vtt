1
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.479
Chloe Lannert: If you, why don't you get up here and talk us through what you what you did?

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.810
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.479
Trina Das: Just one second. I'm just opening my calendar.

4
00:00:15.032 --> 00:00:16.930
Chloe Lannert: There is. But

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:29.649
Chloe Lannert: no, you you did a good job yesterday. Everyone told me afterwards I was like, well, you have a better pitch, and not, you know, a lot of you all came up, of course, but when this one came up it was, Oh, the French guy!

6
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.379
Chloe Lannert: I really like the French pan with the little grip.

7
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.979
Chloe Lannert: You're welcome, all right. So this deck is only like 60 slides, so bear with me.

8
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.790
Chloe Lannert: Oh, I'll do it.

9
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.099
Chloe Lannert: There are no rules.

10
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.640
Chloe Lannert: Think that's it. Yours who know this.

11
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.790
Chloe Lannert: we'll be both okay and take notes.

12
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:32.889
Chloe Lannert: so screen. Speaking criteria, we decided to speak with Director of Help Center or any other relevant person. We think that the same process might differ a bit based on the university and the timing of the acquisition. But to purchase ability, software or demo software less than 3 years ago.

13
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:55.610
Chloe Lannert: I know it's a timeline that it's a bit different from what we've said. Yes, we'll touch upon on the challenges, but it's like companies who have been around a long, a long time. So it's it makes sense for us to say, like less than 3 years ago.

14
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:12.820
Chloe Lannert: and it should be a real purchase like real customers. I'm telling this because we search. And then sometimes it's like results of a partnership. Or, you know, they go through something a bit different and offer it for free. So we don't want that because they're gonna have become like a real decision to hire the

15
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.430
Chloe Lannert: the software, all right.

16
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:40.943
Chloe Lannert: And what we've done so far. I actually. But basically one of the key thing that that we've done is deciding who we want to review. I don't know if all of you guys know that we have like different products. So we're gonna try with the university 1st about this and then identify people. So basically, we're talking about like any

17
00:02:41.520 --> 00:03:02.200
Chloe Lannert: software like that is identifying when they took the decision to hire it. Because it's often not displayed like, yeah, we have this, and we don't know when? So that was the thing and then identify the key decision makers at the time. So our assumption is that it's director of Care centers who took the

18
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:16.669
Chloe Lannert: the decision. Sometimes we found articles online about, like, Oh, we have this new tool available. And there's like people talking like a person talking about it. So we assume that he's not the decision maker. And all the time we're like, all right, let's just dive in

19
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:19.430
Chloe Lannert: the director of the Repair center.

20
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.759
Chloe Lannert: And so that's kind of like what we've done so far, so excited, who they hired when they hired and who they want to target.

21
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:42.519
Chloe Lannert: and so how to do that. Just search on that complexity. And like deep research online about like, yeah, we got this new tool blah blah. And if there's anyone like in the article we're talking about.

22
00:03:43.652 --> 00:03:45.880
Chloe Lannert: And the challenges.

23
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.452
Chloe Lannert: so being that has been around for a while, that's 1 of the things why, we say 3 years ago, instead of like

24
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:09.930
Chloe Lannert: 6 months. We haven't seen anyone, one or 2 people who have done it 6 months ago, probably the highest priority targets and no intro for now. But that's something that we are working on.

25
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.240
Chloe Lannert: This is great, so as far as ways that you think we can help

26
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:26.419
Chloe Lannert: like the like. What you guys did is basically what I was hoping to see. What can progress look like while you're trying to find these changes. Anything you can do in the interim

27
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.029
Chloe Lannert: for the just to be done. Process? Yes, no.

28
00:04:34.238 --> 00:04:46.669
Chloe Lannert: So as we are, you know, focusing oh, recording oops.

29
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.819
Chloe Lannert: The other thing is just kind of going through a better sense of

30
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:11.360
Chloe Lannert: okay, you mean, so like that, you can have other interview with different products. Okay, so what? How large is the competitive set of apps like they can

31
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:19.949
Chloe Lannert: like? How many of those are there like that? Tough to say, I think there are a lot of 2 that are really recent.

32
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:43.410
Chloe Lannert: that are similar to what we've been doing. But they've not. They're not really in the space of like. Maybe they have like one or 2 clients. Okay, not so much. So that's why we didn't want to take those people understood. I get it. So what do they hire instead? So instead of a big interview or any of the platforms, what is the like other interesting alternative?

33
00:05:43.810 --> 00:06:11.399
Chloe Lannert: I want to say, basic, it's not basic, but like coaches. Right? Okay? Like, we have carrot coaches or one other. I think they might hire like external consultants to come and do like practice interviews. Those are 2 other groups that might be interesting are going to have on big interviews, are going to have startups and then are going to have just the traditional methods

34
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:32.830
Chloe Lannert: rather than just the product itself. If you also think about what else they would hire instead of a product like a career coach or the consultants. You can work backwards from that, too.

35
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.330
Chloe Lannert: need or like

36
00:06:35.510 --> 00:07:03.309
Chloe Lannert: train their students right, like employment, is a key factor for for their success. So either they can do nothing which I'm saying is like, if they've recently hired a career coach recently hired consultant, there's a reason they're switching from whoever they had doing something to what they have someone doing now, upping the mistakes. Yes, there's energy between. I needed to switch, even if it's the same job.

37
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.810
Chloe Lannert: I swapped the person who doing the job.

38
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.334
Chloe Lannert: There's a story there for? Why they did.

39
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.189
Chloe Lannert: Okay, I see it. Yeah.

40
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:36.569
Chloe Lannert: So you that that again, I trust you guys to use your judgment like your 3 year. Timeline makes sense for like a big business enterprise. Hire right? So it's a big contract with the annual or longer. So it totally makes sense that you guys have a longer time.

41
00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:57.279
Chloe Lannert: What's the status of your

42
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:08.999
Chloe Lannert: well, so so be be be deliberate, though in that conversation, though, because I agree with you as far as how you frame it, set it up for them. But in the interview itself make sure you're

43
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:18.150
Chloe Lannert: slowly working backwards in that timeline. Right? Make sure you're actually doing the timeline

44
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.150
Chloe Lannert: because these are roots and set rules.

45
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:33.600
Chloe Lannert: I'm much more interested in having them focus on something they did in the past 3 months that was related to our to our

46
00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:47.200
Chloe Lannert: hear what you're saying, and guess not. Sure if I'm pushing back or not. But what I'm my point is that what's really important about the jobs to be done? Process is that there's a switch.

47
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.290
Chloe Lannert: There was a moment where I went from one thing to another thing.

48
00:08:51.520 --> 00:09:14.710
Chloe Lannert: and orienting your timeline as you're conducting the energy from that switch moment is the magic here. Okay, if you are doing that, and you're kind of like hunting around their story a little bit. It's going to be more endless. And I'm not going to be able to help you, based on what we're talking about. If they hired one more character

49
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:35.929
Chloe Lannert: it depends on. If there was a struggling moment, why did the person leave? Were they fired? Was there an issue? Was it performance related? Was it ebays like? That's more of the story. So there's more color there of a particular situation. They can't just fit the profile. It has to be the circumstance within the profile.

50
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:48.170
Chloe Lannert: So let's think like, if you have a team of like 10 coaches. You hire an 11 form, or you replace one push. That's still interesting for the job to be done. Process just so that I understand. Okay, cool. Got it cool. Cool. Okay.

51
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.349
Chloe Lannert: this is what makes it hard. But also what makes it more valuable.

52
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.589
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, no, I get it

53
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:24.660
Chloe Lannert: cool, but this is good. This is exactly what I was hoping to see. I think you guys are in a good place. We're clearly fitting in the right effort to make progress here. I hope you feel the same way. If you think there's any need for additional feedback or adjustments on the next steps. No, I think we're just trying to keep it trying to do like 2, 3, maybe 4 interviews 1st and get a feel and what we should do. Okay, we'll see you next.

54
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:27.210
Chloe Lannert: You're good. I got it.

55
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.179
Chloe Lannert: It's Trina is able to hear us right.

56
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.979
Chloe Lannert: All I see in here is legally.

57
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.883
Chloe Lannert: But now

58
00:10:47.598 --> 00:10:57.769
Chloe Lannert: I think you all called your document checkpoints, and then I don't think you put it in the folder, but I'm gonna move it around for you. I'm gonna rename it for you

59
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.600
Chloe Lannert: really check. Let's see.

60
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.090
Chloe Lannert: And then see in Belize.

61
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.410
Chloe Lannert: Hey, you make me download Powerpoint files.

62
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:45.049
Chloe Lannert: What is this? Okay? It's very lawyer for you to always have everything in my company. Every legal tech, every like Fintech

63
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:57.119
Chloe Lannert: always defaults to word. It's like vintage legacy legacy systems.

64
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.270
Chloe Lannert: No, we'll see right.

65
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.639
Chloe Lannert: Don't mind the formatting. It was in Powerpoint, but I guess there's all good.

66
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:23.109
Chloe Lannert: Alright, yeah. So here's our screen criteria.

67
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.280
Chloe Lannert: He wanted to escape and would.

68
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.320
Chloe Lannert: Oh, I see. Yeah.

69
00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.230
Chloe Lannert: And then you can then play again

70
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.859
Chloe Lannert: at the yeah, there you go.

71
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:44.510
Chloe Lannert: Thanks. Okay. Yeah. So what we've done so far. If

72
00:12:44.800 --> 00:13:13.312
Chloe Lannert: basically, the key ones are just, we prepare a Linkedin pipeline. We use linkedin sales navigator which is like in our key way of reaching out to lawyers, especially those that are more tech. Savvy? We ran a couple cohorts for response, and then we completed just one interview so far.

73
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:23.829
Chloe Lannert: So yeah, I'll go into a little more detail.

74
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:43.693
Chloe Lannert: Oh, yeah, so we've tried email marketing campaigns. Email, we try link sales navigator. We tried phone calls, like, literally just calling law firms walk into law firms. This is like before jobs to be done. So in terms of like what we've done. And so

75
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:51.970
Chloe Lannert: walking to law office, not very effective because everyone's remote now and all ever since Covid, all lawyers. They just come into the office. Where are they on? Most of them were at home.

76
00:13:51.970 --> 00:14:15.820
Chloe Lannert: Email marketing. It. It's more direct. It actually does get to the get to their offices. But what we found is that all law firms have what they call a like calling like it's almost like calling operator, or like, look at like, Who's who's who's calling, or who's emailing? And then they'll filter through and then give the right emails or the right calls to the lawyer. So there's this like filtering cost that happens difficult.

77
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:29.160
Chloe Lannert: Get through that especially at the small law firm phase. And so usually just like we don't get a lot of good responses. So is that you emailing the firms or individual lawyers? Yeah, so

78
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:41.380
Chloe Lannert: small law firms. And so often a lot of times, they have a general email that they give to you and then giving you their personal email. So you can't find them. It's really difficult.

79
00:14:41.700 --> 00:15:09.170
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So it's not a very common like the email domain. It finds the how they configure the 1st and last name of the people. It lets you scrape emails. If you know who you're trying to target, it helps you find an email. Also, I've got a couple of firms that I know the email format of that I can talk to.

80
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:18.450
Chloe Lannert: There's another one that I use my phone numbers and everything.

81
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.940
Chloe Lannert: Got it.

82
00:15:45.150 --> 00:16:01.360
Chloe Lannert: Got it? Couple couple of just a couple of tips here. Sorry to interrupt your presentation, but I figured, given that we're talking through all these resources. There's a couple of options you guys have to share things like this when they come up, because it's gonna come up a lot. Right? So one recommendation I have.

83
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.110
Chloe Lannert: So in basecamp.

84
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:19.300
Chloe Lannert: you can choose to do one of 2 things. One is, you can go to this event itself. And if you're talking about something relevant, drop in the link here, right? And computers, you go. Okay from that Gtp checking we had in week one. Let me go see what happened? Because we talked about the same. It's helpful contextually here.

85
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.350
Chloe Lannert: Alternatively, you can go to docs and files, go to peer resources.

86
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:33.964
Chloe Lannert: new external service, drop in the link, give it a title, Bing ball. So let's just do one real quick, is it, Hunter? Dot I/O?

87
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.410
Chloe Lannert: And then I'll just do that's in it. That's the address, too. Right

88
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:50.540
Chloe Lannert: there you go. So now it becomes a link in here that you can reference from Jtb or or pure resources.

89
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.870
Chloe Lannert: So cool slide share, though.

90
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:08.300
Chloe Lannert: before, can we talk through this real, quick?

91
00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:36.280
Chloe Lannert: Appreciate it. Yeah, I realize it could play. So the screen, what are we looking for? So we are looking to speak with lawyers to purchase a time tracking solution and provide some competitors here point one, and billables are the direct competitors that are doing full automation. The other ones that are doing digital manual kind of time keeping solutions. So it's not just they do a lot of stuff.

92
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.520
Chloe Lannert: And so we're looking to find lawyers that have done this in the past 9 months.

93
00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:53.649
Chloe Lannert: And then these alerts are typically lawyers that advise businesses. So startups is the focus that we're actually right now focused on is like smart lawyers, and make sure what kind of clear issues are useful at times, and

94
00:17:54.530 --> 00:18:04.310
Chloe Lannert: the important one is being a decision maker at the firm influencers users. But who has made that purchase?

95
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:25.859
Chloe Lannert: That's small, firm looking at one to 10. We're not doing union size or big ones, because we realize that the sales cycle they need to see a lot of traction and also like that. And then they also have a lot of pushes around scaling. So we're so small because they're more open to using technology adopting it.

96
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:31.159
Chloe Lannert: So guys, I have thoughts and clarifying questions on this. But I'm actually really curious to see what you all

97
00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:43.029
Chloe Lannert: like. You said. They are like 2 different things, like direct competitors like you and point one and all of them are like more global things.

98
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:52.819
Chloe Lannert: do you think? Okay? And then it's

99
00:18:52.980 --> 00:19:03.619
Chloe Lannert: like, How did you figure it out? Yeah, it's it's a tough one, that one so there are not very many solutions that out there that are doing full automation like we are.

100
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:19.250
Chloe Lannert: The other thing is like, we talked to a lot of lawyers, and none of them know these other competitors. So it's kind of a very new space. So then we had to kind of take a step back and like, well, what is the job that's being done here? And the job that is being done here is we need a place to actually like track. What we're doing

101
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:30.239
Chloe Lannert: our time and and being able to do that efficiently. And you know any point where we're not spending too much time on like paperwork, or like running manually and then

102
00:19:30.663 --> 00:19:51.840
Chloe Lannert: so that's why we started to go express expanded from the direct to the alternatives which are like practicing, which is the broader solution that was like our rationale. But I guess maybe they hired like an assistant to do the thing that the lawyers were doing before to travel.

103
00:19:52.070 --> 00:20:15.970
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, yeah, that's right. So other than using the Cleos and the practice pamphers. Historically, they've used at a paralegal or assistant like that used to do it if you're at the partner level. But if you're at the associate level, which are the users, it's like using. Excel some kind of software that's already available. It's cheap that they already using within their own legal work.

104
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:45.919
Chloe Lannert: Okay, like spreadsheets or docs are very common. That's what they also use. So yeah, I hope that answers for what? But yeah, exactly how this works.

105
00:20:46.490 --> 00:21:01.489
Chloe Lannert: I see the switch is the purchase. Right? They went from doing something else. They bought this thing.

106
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:17.300
Chloe Lannert: forward it to whatever system, so that you can find

107
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:29.129
Chloe Lannert: how many hours you spend. And I don't know how it works. Maybe just to see a change of system, and that might be also useful

108
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:55.819
Chloe Lannert: and like to dive into why and like? Why are they switching systems? And is it because of an amount of clients that they have like? Is it an X amount of clients? Is it an X amount of like client ball? Is it a volume thing. Is it a, you know, assets thing? Is it a lot of personnel thing? Is it? Like scope, you know, I mean, like, I guess, what the switching point is to say, if we're good doing it by ourselves.

109
00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:05.269
Chloe Lannert: And now we are over burdened, overwhelmed. XY, and Z. So let's like use a different solution.

110
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.515
Chloe Lannert: Got it. I'm taking notes, by the way, so yeah, got it. Okay.

111
00:22:13.405 --> 00:22:34.340
Chloe Lannert: know this because we talked about yesterday. But I think we gotta go a bit deeper with the type of lawyers want to go for, from which I know we talked about. Yesterday, when I mentioned a lawyer was interested to you? He asked me like

112
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:48.169
Chloe Lannert: smaller firms, and we're looking to like work with the lawyers that work specifically with at least it starters. But then, like vice President. Yeah, they can like go a lot deeper in that respect, because otherwise you'll be hunting like

113
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:55.809
Chloe Lannert: big lawyers that might work with a startup that just somehow steady one that's like

114
00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:06.640
Chloe Lannert: smaller size law firms, with maybe like one or 2 noise only, and I've got lots of other things to do like nailing down a little bit more like, who? Exactly you're talking to.

115
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.250
Chloe Lannert: you know, so narrowing that narrowing to?

116
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.290
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:37.519
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. I was just second Carlo on the firm size and the type of wire, because, like the one person firm, a 2 person firm is a lot different than like 7, 8, or 9 person firm. So it'd be cool to like kind of segment those out and get the insights from each one of those buckets more individually because

118
00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:47.690
Chloe Lannert: my conscious that they're going to be different reasons why they hired this product like on a more granular.

119
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:51.710
Chloe Lannert: So when you break it out like that, how many interviews would you do in each market

120
00:23:52.520 --> 00:24:02.209
Chloe Lannert: you can answer to? But I like. The golden spot is like 8 to 12 of each of each specific niche screening criteria that you're creating.

121
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:24.059
Chloe Lannert: You want to get involved to kind of normalize your insight. That's exactly right. So just to finalize that and make it super clear to everybody. You start off with the screening criteria. That's fine. What we're doing is teaching you all how to chisel it further, because it needs to be more detailed for the most part, from what I'm seeing from everyone which is great, we'll get there, but each one is its own subgroup.

122
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:39.249
Chloe Lannert: Whatever you don't just like try to catch it all and go. I'll do 12 jobs to be done, and then some fit into this group of criteria and another one fits into a different group or slightly different categories like you want to be as narrow and as consistent as you can possibly be at some point that breaks down

123
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:52.509
Chloe Lannert: right at some point. There's only gonna be 5 that fit a very, very narrow criteria. So there's an abstraction involved that you're gonna have to dance around, and I can help you like through that. But my comments on this.

124
00:24:53.470 --> 00:25:12.259
Chloe Lannert: I guess first, st the question, what happens when, whatever they're doing with one of these apps, tools, or whatever they're doing before goes wrong. What's the breaking point? Like? What's the like? What is the actual issue? What's the example of a circumstance where changes required.

125
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.240
Chloe Lannert: I'm asking like- like, in the legal context. Given your experience like

126
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:25.200
Chloe Lannert: it does someone over Bill, do they? Under Bill? Is there some other documentation issue like, somebody get fired.

127
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:26.903
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So

128
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:48.399
Chloe Lannert: for time tracking. It's a lot of it depends on the problem. Like, what's an example of a problem. Yeah. So let's say, for example, a lawyer with an associate is not. So I'm gonna take it. It's kind of like, you know, a lawyer who's like the decision maker of the partner, the one who owns the firm. And is there a real story in your mind right now? So this lawyer.

129
00:25:48.400 --> 00:26:02.329
Chloe Lannert: They they started hiring associates, and then the associates were not really being judicious about the timekeeping, and the lawyer was like, I need a solution now that I can manage and watch what my associates are doing. What do you mean by not judicious in your time as in they typically should be

130
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:14.429
Chloe Lannert: clocking their time every day like this is what I worked on. This is what I did. And instead, what happened instead, what happened was they just they just accepted their habits, and the partner

131
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:41.629
Chloe Lannert: kept trying to like, ask them to keep staying up to date. With that I want to make sure I understand what you're saying. Yeah, what happens when he's talking about? Like, what did they do on a day where there was a problem that needed to be addressed? Yeah. So the partner would talk to the associate and bring up that. He's not keeping track of his money. And how does he know that? And he knows. And he knows that because well, he started using Cleo, this is like, okay, yeah. So he used Cleo.

132
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.959
Chloe Lannert: And you can see the time that's being inputted into the system

133
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:58.789
Chloe Lannert: on that associated. Okay, got it. So they hired Cleo. And in Cleo already with the hours being logged in. And there's a problem. Yeah. Okay. So he sees in there that there's an over tracking or under track.

134
00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:18.319
Chloe Lannert: okay, so this one, sorry. Can I backtrack a little bit? Yeah. Yeah. So there's 3, Cleo, there's Cleo, and there's looking at point one. So this this particular situation was that yeah. 3. Cleo 3. Cleo, the associates. He didn't know the time that was being recorded.

135
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:34.229
Chloe Lannert: He he only can see what the time is being billed at a monthly basis. So at the end of the month. He's looking at times. And he's like, okay, like these times. I see what the times are going. They are either over another doesn't know he's just looking at the times. He's like, okay, like.

136
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.860
Chloe Lannert: my associates need to build.

137
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:54.229
Chloe Lannert: And so that's how much time was, okay, yeah. And so at that point, he realized that he's a system that's he has a he needs to have a system where you can actually observe, like his associates.

138
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.929
Chloe Lannert: and more scrutiny about what's going on on a day to day perspective.

139
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:04.499
Chloe Lannert: So e- even with what you've already shared, I can tell that there are details that we need to know that are just

140
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:12.160
Chloe Lannert: right. So already like need to know one, how many hours. But like, what's up like? How do you? How does he even know

141
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:40.359
Chloe Lannert: right? What are the details of his observation of circumstance and illuminate like, I can tell, these aren't the right hours that were lost. Right? Okay, keep going? Yeah. So he realized that he was scaling. So he started to bring on more and more associates. Okay. So hiring more people, more hours for me to build and track. Yeah. And then he started to realize that this was this is a situation that he needed some kind of system where he could like, look at it without having to spend too much time with each individual training.

142
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.630
Chloe Lannert: Okay?

143
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:48.929
Chloe Lannert: Why, the assistant? Why, the assistant isn't keeping track of

144
00:28:49.080 --> 00:29:08.160
Chloe Lannert: yeah, I I don't know. He what using like he's he's using his past experience to kind of reflect on what he's trying to explain why his associates doing without really knowing why. Is this someone who you can go back and talk to again?

145
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:24.719
Chloe Lannert: Probably I should. I should be able to, because it's already based on the story you're telling me like, like. So when when let's just say the founder is doing jobs, you know, interviews tells me about a conversation like this. Some of the questions I'm asking you you would know

146
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:42.940
Chloe Lannert: right? Based on the I mean you would. You would jumble around and be able to pop around and go. Okay, it's this one. Is this one. Is that because where I usually step in with founders is at the analysis phase. So you've done your jobs, you know you've done your version. I told you for an hour to our meeting, and then all of a sudden, we're talking about all the interviews that you did

147
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:56.969
Chloe Lannert: their names and their situations, or you give them fake names you don't have to identify if it's private, whatever. But like, I'm gonna grill you on what you know about that person and their situation. Right? So again, I'm not using our time on this illuminating.

148
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.220
Chloe Lannert: Got it? Okay.

149
00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:15.159
Chloe Lannert: think all of our questions and comments illuminate, maybe an opportunity for you to remind us more. But hopefully, it shows you like, you have more than these and more specificity and circumstance to add here, that might help you narrow this down even further.

150
00:30:16.171 --> 00:30:31.340
Chloe Lannert: They have to like manually type in the time, for, like all of us, like

151
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:41.982
Chloe Lannert: we could connect you with like those others. And

152
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:58.770
Chloe Lannert: that's a great point. That's 1 of my asks one more thing to ask. So it's not just the circumstance of the lawyer themselves, and which tool or situation they're hiring. It might even be somewhere. Here's an example like almost 2 narrows.

153
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.640
Chloe Lannert: what time it starts at the end of

154
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:24.550
Chloe Lannert: what stage, what situation, what problem are they helping them solve? There might even be an angle there where you back door your way into a particular customer segment given the stage and circumstance of the startup itself, because that's another reverse way to get into the customer through like a backwards channel, because all of a sudden, now, I'm trying to get connected to all the startups in these situations and go, hey, let me talk to your lawyer.

155
00:31:26.875 --> 00:31:31.380
Chloe Lannert: So there's a lot of ways to go about this that you might be able to like.

156
00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.349
Chloe Lannert: Refine this criteria in the 1st place.

157
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:45.829
Chloe Lannert: and I'm also wondering whether they're like incentives for. So there's clear incentives for like partners and stuff like proper time doing. But are there any for like associates.

158
00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.150
Chloe Lannert: I don't know. I mean you. Some firms experiment would be like

159
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.689
Chloe Lannert: putting incentives for the associates to track the time, or

160
00:31:54.950 --> 00:32:00.300
Chloe Lannert: probably that we also maybe a switch

161
00:32:00.976 --> 00:32:06.769
Chloe Lannert: your time consistently. Then you get a bonus or whatever you

162
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:25.809
Chloe Lannert: yeah, that's another so the associate level. And then the decision maker level. It's interesting because they're the users. So they're probably going to use it the most because they, their friction point is like having to do it manually. Yeah. So they experience it also. But partners experience from a checking perspective and managing perspective. So there is like different levels of

163
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:48.670
Chloe Lannert: pain points that are being experienced with this right now. So, yeah, so yeah, there are incentives. There are different types of incentives from the solution

164
00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:58.489
Chloe Lannert: and know that

165
00:32:59.011 --> 00:33:10.759
Chloe Lannert: extended our time talking through this with you, because thought it'd be helpful for everybody. So what I was what we were all just saying, I think, applies to all of you. So just keep that in mind

166
00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:12.410
Chloe Lannert: cool.

167
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.999
Chloe Lannert: Go back to the next one. Yeah. Okay.

168
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:35.548
Chloe Lannert: yeah. So just finishing up this slide is, yeah. Did did one Jp. Interview been cold outreaching it was pretty good. Actually, we we kind of brought the guy on. He was a really fast talker. He had a crypto startup

169
00:33:36.090 --> 00:34:01.749
Chloe Lannert: went really deep into like he's growing pretty fast like went from 0, like probably one attorney to like 8 in a matter of a year. What did he buy? He ended up using Cleo. And he actually looked at Point one he found on his own and so that was a really interesting, because that's the 1st time I've heard of anyone actually knowing about point one. Okay? And then, did you guys do like a timeline of the forces we did. Yeah. So one like posted

170
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:23.090
Chloe Lannert: right, either in the Jtv folder, like, if within Jtv inbox and files, put legal ease and then dropping your files there, I'm happy to like comments on that stuff conversation about it, and maybe other people want to weigh in, or if you want to look at it. Curious! That's great, too. You can all help each other. But at the very least you guys can watch. I react to their analysis.

171
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:39.439
Chloe Lannert: Oh, that's really. I'm glad that you got. How did it feel to do that? Oh, it was very enlightening, actually like, I actually thought that, compared to past interviews. I felt like I got a lot more tangible, like real inputs, or like like experiences rather than

172
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:58.429
Chloe Lannert: you know. What do you think? Would you buy something like that. Yeah. And I was actually really surprised by how open he was to do it. I had some hesitancy about saying, Hey, we're gonna be off. We're going to turn off our screens. You want to do this via voice. We're just like pretty open about it. And then when he went in. Yeah, he just

173
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:25.579
Chloe Lannert: anytime I ask a question just went with it, and it was very surprising, because as a lawyer, you're kind of like, they're very cautious with their words right? And they're also cautious about like on being on screen or recording stuff. So get over that layer. And so it was, yeah, this guy was pretty open. He's also what I also found was really interesting about this interview is that he's a very tech savvy lawyer. So now, it's like there are people out there that are like seeking and reaching out for information. I just got figure out what are the similarities of this person as opposed to other lawyers, having the same

174
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:39.940
Chloe Lannert: and everything so to be open to super specific niche.

175
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:57.939
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, it happens after a couple of interviews. If you do a couple of interviews, and there's a particular interview that you're like, Wow, actually, there's a whole domain subdomain I wasn't thinking about. And maybe I should go down this path, and you can rework and go backwards to your screening criteria and build a new audience.

176
00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:08.380
Chloe Lannert: not saying you shouldn't yet so just mentioned. Cool. Also, by the way, like for the calls. Sometimes it is helpful to just have a phone number.

177
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:15.469
Chloe Lannert: like, I think lawyers are used to dial numbers, right? So you can just do that so that they can hold them rather than sit in front of a computer.

178
00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:21.960
Chloe Lannert: So it's a choice, you know again, you don't have to do this, but it's actually simple. You just input number, or you call in

179
00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:51.509
Chloe Lannert: awesome. Alright. Yeah, this is just kind of going down like showing. We're using accounts and leads on this, how we've been actually doing a lot of our search navigate around this. There's no other like massive directory that you can actually tap into. That gives you this little information on like the size of the law firm. What what position they're at you know.

180
00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:06.394
Chloe Lannert: this is kind of like a little bit of the Jocely learning forces, full pushing tool kind of thing that we were. Yeah, okay, yeah. So I don't know if you want to go deep into this. But,

181
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:15.750
Chloe Lannert: we're good, or guess what I'm most interested. Now, given the short time you have. Tell me if there was anything in particular really stood out?

182
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.020
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, I thought,

183
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:46.199
Chloe Lannert: we start. I think the biggest pain point that he's experiencing. He's scaling like he's he's adding another associate, bringing on more people. So that was a big one. And then another cool. Is this opportunity? Right? So he's identifying this guy's hiring associates. Meaning, we're scaling. We're having this problem

184
00:37:46.760 --> 00:38:13.089
Chloe Lannert: find law firms that are hiring associates that were small and becoming big multiple positions available. So you can track and scan for that criteria. All of a sudden you narrow down a circumstance that might be prime for what you're trying to offer. Given the push right? Another one was kind of cool. I mean, a lot like these kind of solutions. It's

185
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:34.890
Chloe Lannert: the industry standard. It's like this idea where you know what is, what are people using? Lawyers are? My sense is from this. It's confirming that lawyers gravitate towards what others are using. So it's like social proof might be like a really important thing. Okay, another tip here. So did you write down any kind of quote of what? Exactly, he said, based on that.

186
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.180
Chloe Lannert: Did you want to say industry? Standard.

187
00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.589
Chloe Lannert: yeah, pretty much. Yeah, he said.

188
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:47.689
Chloe Lannert: Okay, so what I would do in this section is put quote the sentence that you said

189
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:59.969
Chloe Lannert: right? So that's another way to make it even more real, because one thing that we tend to do is we try to summarize with our words like we heard someone say, use their words as much as you can, makes it way more real.

190
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:21.659
Chloe Lannert: I think the only other big thing about Jamie is like, we realize that we have many big gaps and ask the questions around the topic like it pulls them back to their like original. They're also hard to to uncover, though, so just to be clear. Habits in particular, is probably the toughest project out of the 4 but

191
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:30.430
Chloe Lannert: with the right questions. You're you're you're correct about this, but I just want to give you some, you know praise, because in my experience that is the hardest category to

192
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.970
Chloe Lannert: gotcha. Sometimes it's not there.

193
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.689
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. Okay, got it.

194
00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:43.725
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. And for him, price is a big-, a big pain point. On the anxiety side.

195
00:39:44.790 --> 00:40:14.260
Chloe Lannert: there's no price being available. Yeah. So he's using where you can actually get a lot of different functionality doesn't break up their solution. 5. So they bucket everything all this like all in one solution. So I have a bunch of I'm paying for a bunch of stuff I don't need exactly. So it's not just price, it's waste. It's I. I'm I'm gonna pay this, I mean, so I can afford it. But it seems wasteful and necessary because I'm not even utilizing what I'm paying for.

196
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.119
Chloe Lannert: That's different than your same price is. Gonna be

197
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:31.604
Chloe Lannert: right. So what is bad design? That was so we didn't get enough time to talk about that. But he said the phrase, bad design. And then did you ask him what- what's bad design?

198
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:48.769
Chloe Lannert: we tried. We we try to get. We tried to figure out what is good design and what's bad design? That's exactly I was about to say so when they say bad design. And you go. What do you mean by that? Well, it just doesn't. You know. I really like how it feels or it looks. Okay. But what is what is good to you like? What's an example of good design?

199
00:40:48.890 --> 00:41:06.289
Chloe Lannert: Then you want to know what they think something good is right. I love that, because here the thing is legally. Now you have design, inspiration, right? If you hear enough examples of what good looks like from your lawyers about what they do

200
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:23.219
Chloe Lannert: right. Draft came to hear a few other examples of example. Like as you hear a pattern. Now, you can draw from some of those design principles and techniques to incorporate into your application. Right? That's really good.

201
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:46.340
Chloe Lannert: That's awesome. That's awesome. I like the last bullet, too, he said. I'm a tech guy. And this is like the 90 software. You say that that's awesome, like I love like, when you hear language like that. These modern lawyers want to show. I'm with the Times. I'm ahead of the game. I'm not only doing industry standards, but I'm also like tech

202
00:41:46.510 --> 00:42:14.859
Chloe Lannert: crypto. I'm ahead of the curve, like all that kind of stuff, emotional energy, right? And I suspect that this person has colleagues in the same industry, right? So they're talking to each other about what they're using. They're they're either bragging about what they're ahead on, or they're envious of someone else who's doing something differently. There's a lot more emotion and social like forcing.

203
00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:29.550
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, good. Yeah. Deal. Kind of hammer this home. But like too cluttered no dark mode. But you can keep digging into those comments to like, why is it, too? Cluttered? What's unnecessary? Like? There's things there they need to know we can go and better understand

204
00:42:36.548 --> 00:42:50.850
Chloe Lannert: asking questions. So yeah, so I'll say, like, yeah, this is probably 40 min.

205
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.100
Chloe Lannert: Hold on.

206
00:42:53.440 --> 00:43:05.619
Chloe Lannert: This is interesting because we started off just like getting like for this experience we started with, like, just like reports. You didn't know them for like 5 min and start personally meeting this person.

207
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:27.520
Chloe Lannert: So we went through that, and then I kind of I gave you kind of like a timeframe to ask you a lot more questions. And yeah. And then we'll get into it and kind of getting that. Imagine me trying to, you know. Document your experience, you know, draft like a whole documentary.

208
00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:31.170
Chloe Lannert: See?

209
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:37.836
Chloe Lannert: Cool. So the challenges. So for us.

210
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.424
Chloe Lannert: our current channels is that

211
00:43:41.170 --> 00:44:00.899
Chloe Lannert: getting scheduled user interviews from full outreach is like for based on our screen time has been a little bit of a struggle. And this is something we've known already. But just kind of get some percentages of the 50 that we've reached out to 13 express interest. But then it's a very delayed interaction before they actually book the call. And so, you know, it's probably like

212
00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:12.232
Chloe Lannert: a week, if not a little more to like, say, okay, like. Then they'll go back with their linkedin very small number and end up with default. Passing my processes on. Why, that is

213
00:44:13.256 --> 00:44:22.613
Chloe Lannert: so that's 1 but we are getting responses. There's a delay in terms of getting done quickly. The other one is.

214
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:44.910
Chloe Lannert: yeah, we realize that not very many of them like in our in our interaction with them. Not very, very few of them have actually looked at. So we're struggling to find those that have seen our direct competitors. So we're trying to look at the alternatives right now, that's where our jobs, because we don't have enough.

215
00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.260
Chloe Lannert: So

216
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:57.729
Chloe Lannert: yeah. So in in the spirit of this, this challenge. Yeah. One thing you get like help from, and thank you for those that like follow up

217
00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:08.439
Chloe Lannert: anything just like helping us get a more intro into any of your startup lawyers. I'm gonna I'm gonna 1st let me go through the screen criteria one more time just over

218
00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:31.999
Chloe Lannert: targeted a little more, and then I'll reach out and I'll let you know, but would love to get folks helping. I'll do a I'll do a thread. So people can share screening criterias. And

219
00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:44.859
Chloe Lannert: yeah, because then people can comment just on that particular issue. That's probably better. That's probably better. Otherwise it'll be all mixed up. Yeah.

220
00:45:46.770 --> 00:46:00.370
Chloe Lannert: little mini baby suggestion. Maybe change the language to center on phone calls versus calls, because I can see lawyers absolutely seeing time is money. If it's a phone call, it can be done in transit. It doesn't feel like sitting down for a call.

221
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:02.879
Chloe Lannert: Very. What did you guys hear what we said?

222
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:20.357
Chloe Lannert: Okay, so I suggest. So time is, time is money, especially for lawyers. Frame the outreach and the ask for a phone call versus a zoom call that way. People can take it in transit. It feels less like it's taking up real like work time.

223
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.979
Chloe Lannert: and it's it's easier to say yes to.

224
00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:38.009
Chloe Lannert: I completely agree. And that's not just lawyers. That's people. Right? When you have a phone call, you treat that differently than a zoom- zoom! You're like, I gotta be somewhere, and I have to set up my face and that kind of stuff

225
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:48.310
Chloe Lannert: call in the car like, sure, I'll talk to you. I'm walking. I'll talk to you like sure. I'll take a call like it's no big deal. Mistakes are lower, and they're gonna be more honest, they just don't know it.

226
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:54.449
Chloe Lannert: There's a call there's less to worry about and more focused on just having a conversation answering your question. It's great

227
00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:11.509
Chloe Lannert: works, really? Well, exactly, absolutely so. Think at least point. A couple weeks ago, when we were like all remote, we 1st met each other. And I did the first.st But like a phone call is absolutely the number one way to do this.

228
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:17.989
Chloe Lannert: like objectively, like, we know this after doing decades of data and instances

229
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:24.710
Chloe Lannert: there there might be right now by March. Be that first, st

230
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:28.500
Chloe Lannert: we learn differently than adapt. But that's usually the best case.

231
00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:46.597
Chloe Lannert: Mean 3% of people

232
00:47:49.838 --> 00:48:00.710
Chloe Lannert: is really good for everyone to hear, too, which is like, think about how many great conversations and insights you all have had already this week.

233
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:08.569
Chloe Lannert: right past 3, 4 days since you've met, you've exchanged valuable like feedback insights, perspectives, things that other people wish they heard.

234
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:33.620
Chloe Lannert: So the more we asynchronize our communication standards so that we write things up, we ask questions, we share cool things. We have a place to go back. Reference for that. I'm just saying that if something really really like, cool or valuable or interesting is said or shared.

235
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:37.400
Chloe Lannert: drop it into a place where more people can see it and learn from

236
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.299
Chloe Lannert: you guys already know I'm just reinforcing that that's helpful.

237
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:47.720
Chloe Lannert: cool, alright, awesome, Chris. This is great. It's good progress, anything else

238
00:48:48.452 --> 00:48:51.550
Chloe Lannert: all good for now. Awesome. Thank you.

239
00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.780
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Who's next?

240
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:58.640
Chloe Lannert: I'm gonna turn the video on here.

241
00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:01.005
Chloe Lannert: There we go.

242
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:29.740
Chloe Lannert: We?

243
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.776
Chloe Lannert: Good morning.

244
00:49:32.515 --> 00:49:35.150
Chloe Lannert: Okay, Hi, Trina.

245
00:49:36.875 --> 00:49:41.900
Chloe Lannert: So taking a little bit of a different approach, because

246
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:54.069
Chloe Lannert: we've been very confused. So I'm hoping to just present why, we're confused, and I, after talking with them, we have like a little bit of direction, but would love for you guys to challenge us on our approach before we start our 1st scenario.

247
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.170
Chloe Lannert: Okay.

248
00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:05.040
Chloe Lannert: so here's what the the stakeholders we have. We have 4. So we have the general manager at the top. This is the person who runs the dealership. They're the one who hire us and pay us

249
00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:35.160
Chloe Lannert: the sales. Managers are the ones that are on the floor working with the sales, people talking to the customers. They are the ones who enforce all of the the processes, and they're the ones who are giving you the price for what you're trying to negotiate with your vehicle. And then we have the salesperson who is the actual end user of our product. They're the ones who are directly in front of the customer. They have direct control over, like what's being said. Understanding this customer to be able to, you know, find a vehicle and relay this pitch to them.

250
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.440
Chloe Lannert: But again apply.

251
00:50:36.440 --> 00:51:00.189
Chloe Lannert: and lastly, I have a customer, but I know the general managers, the customer the car buyer, who is also part of that as well. So the reason why you get confused for a lot of you you're going for the person who's hiring for us to hire like from my perspective was like they get it. Their problem is that they want their salespeople to sell more cars. They want their managers to be responsible for their sales. People to sell more cars.

252
00:51:00.518 --> 00:51:18.379
Chloe Lannert: And that's kind of why, like I realized when I originally started, I would pitch to the general manager. It was really great sign on one spot, and then, as we launch it, it started to get confusing, because the actual end user was a salesperson. So that changed the way that we built our product.

253
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:42.020
Chloe Lannert: and just again, I'm trying to not think about our products. And then for the sales manager and I said, they're the ones who are on the floor with the sales people fully responsible for them. They track every single deal with the salesperson. Did you call them back. What did they say? Did you mention this? Give them this presence said.

254
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:52.380
Chloe Lannert: And then the salesperson, they obviously want to sell more cars. They're the ones who are struggling with customers when they're saying like, Oh, like, I don't know how to buy it. I'm gonna talk to my husband.

255
00:51:53.227 --> 00:52:04.440
Chloe Lannert: Just wanna sorry. Think that's something that we discussed together. How much of they want to send in the car is through.

256
00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:12.879
Chloe Lannert: because one thing that you mentioned was that they are not the people who are the most ambitious ones.

257
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:31.499
Chloe Lannert: So make sure that we have the yeah. It's 1 of the things that we're trying to understand, is like in the sales floor. There's gonna be people who are performing better and they get more commission. So as a salesperson, there's only one or 2 cards every single week, every single day. There's this pattern board on the wall that says you have one. They have 10,

258
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:45.140
Chloe Lannert: so we know that you're not making as much money. And that's like one of the things we just talked about frustrating. And we're gonna have to get to the root of like, is it money? Is it status of your family?

259
00:52:48.864 --> 00:52:53.199
Chloe Lannert: That's a great question.

260
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.990
Chloe Lannert: Absolutely.

261
00:52:55.160 --> 00:53:02.540
Chloe Lannert: The confusion was always because my, I have a Buddh brain. So I've always wanted to from my perspective is like

262
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:12.759
Chloe Lannert: we're the dealerships want to sell more cars, so it's our job to help them sell more cars. But I can't help them sell more cars if I don't actually get the customer to buy the car.

263
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:16.899
Chloe Lannert: So that's why I always thought I needed to interview a car buyer

264
00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:22.829
Chloe Lannert: 1st assignment. So we know that we're gonna have to do interviews for all the relevant challenges like, who do we start with?

265
00:53:23.885 --> 00:53:24.820
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

266
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:46.539
Chloe Lannert: So my thought process like, okay, we're gonna have to sit in the middle. It's gonna have to like balance 2 different things, because the salesperson, because the car buyer has to buy from the manager, from the salesperson as well. And I think that just covers my question of like, who do we interview first? st So right now we're thinking that we talk to the salesperson first.st

267
00:53:48.040 --> 00:54:14.689
Chloe Lannert: We talked to sales manager next, then the general manager. So stick with the deal 1st and then going back to car buyer to Chloe's Point that we just talked about. I have a really good understanding of the car buyer and the general manager. Yes, I have my own assumptions. Advisors do that. But because this is like the main problem of like, despite. The general manager loves us and wants to support us. It's this person who has to enforce this person needs it every single time.

268
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:19.250
Chloe Lannert: and maybe if I would sell it for this person to share.

269
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:29.200
Chloe Lannert: So right now, my thought process, if we're going to focus on the salesperson, we want to interview top and low performing sales, people at dealerships

270
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:38.390
Chloe Lannert: who have hired to use a digital presentation tool or their manual system, because that's the one they're reverting back to to save a deal in the last 30 days

271
00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:59.659
Chloe Lannert: and a top performing person that's either new or they've been around for longer. So different categories. So if you're new, it's because you've been hired in the last year. You're selling 5 cars a month. If you're a top performing older person. You've been there for 3 years, and you're selling 8 cars a month, or if you're bottom performing, you're selling less than 3 cars a month. In general.

272
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:18.379
Chloe Lannert: we're hoping that we can understand, like what they're doing differently. Maybe the characteristics, and like what drives them, or if perhaps like, if things have changed over time because we don't just like not everybody's a natural born salesperson. It is something that you can learn if there's something that they're being trained on, and maybe they have different schools that they've hired over time.

273
00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:23.230
Chloe Lannert: Okay, so to be clear, does the dealership

274
00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:30.299
Chloe Lannert: want, which is a general manager, want to hire both top and low performing sales people?

275
00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.579
Chloe Lannert: And what are you trying to help the general manager do

276
00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:40.439
Chloe Lannert: to be able to either identify, to be able to turn their poor performers into practice owners?

277
00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:41.959
Chloe Lannert: That's their struggle.

278
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:54.329
Chloe Lannert: Or is it the higher. Okay, that's so. My instinct here, based on what you're saying is to start with the top. But I don't want you to just accept that like. Obviously, you all think about it. But like

279
00:55:55.180 --> 00:56:03.519
Chloe Lannert: rather than top and low, because that seems like you're gonna have very different conversations. And those are 2 different sets of interviews. You just focus on top

280
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:27.819
Chloe Lannert: a different pattern. So that's my hunch. Okay? So what I'm I'm hearing different criteria. Because what you're saying is that people who are doing higher? Yeah.

281
00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:50.280
Chloe Lannert: that's different. Yeah. So that we don't know whether they're top low performing. We just know that they're new. That's even more interesting to me. Yeah. And that's what we kind of just except for us a little bit yesterday, because one of our paying dealerships they have like 12 salespeople. They just hired another set of 7 people. Right? So this is another jobs thing. But it's not what it's when

282
00:56:50.580 --> 00:57:02.500
Chloe Lannert: right. So both in the interview. You want to ask when, as opposed to what? Once again, this criteria, it's about like, who's supposed to what you can be, top or low. But are you new?

283
00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.160
Chloe Lannert: So you're saying, top performing older.

284
00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:18.020
Chloe Lannert: not as relevant. I don't know. I don't know, but you know better than me. But my hunch here is that this criteria needs to be refined a little bit. Okay.

285
00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:21.469
Chloe Lannert: just a little. But it's definitely directionally correct.

286
00:57:21.916 --> 00:57:24.940
Chloe Lannert: Alright. So what's up with these questions down here.

287
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:36.220
Chloe Lannert: just like the current thought process like, Okay, what are we trying to learn from them? Because, we don't have, like, necessarily a Cleo, you know, as a competitor.

288
00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:52.259
Chloe Lannert: generally like their process is just a pen and paper. But you're saying here, it's digital presentation tool or manual system. It's because the digital presentation tools are generally around the payments like they calculate the payments, and they present it on a piece of paper or on a screen. There's nothing

289
00:57:52.260 --> 00:58:19.859
Chloe Lannert: like there isn't this unless they're using the car manufacturers website to do. Okay? So my feedback here is what you're doing on the bottom map is separate from what we are teaching with jobs. This is like a traditional user interview thing for some of the search stuff like these are the questions that we want to ask and like with jobs, you don't even. I don't have any of these premeditated questions. I have a purchase or a switch, and based on the purchase switch. I have a timeline. I work backwards from that.

290
00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:37.220
Chloe Lannert: Sure. Maybe some of those things come up. But I'm not actively asking these questions or committing to asking any of these questions. No, we want to learn what's up with that thing you hired. That's the whole point, for all

291
00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:52.120
Chloe Lannert: it's like you don't want to do. The don't fall into the trap of doing what you've done before you learn this, which is asking those like premeditated questions that color user interface your ux design or something like that's for someone else. You all are like, you hired something.

292
00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:59.430
Chloe Lannert: I know something you don't about what I'm trying to learn here. But like, let's work backwards. To understand the psychology behind the scene

293
00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:14.450
Chloe Lannert: and struggling moment is to see to innovation. So the notion here is that it could be a long time ago or be recent. The idea is that it was painful.

294
00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:25.479
Chloe Lannert: like there was. There was some sort of struggle, and there's energy around the choice, meaning not everyone that you that's a customer for you has gone through this.

295
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:38.159
Chloe Lannert: There's only some people who struggle more. People fit that category, even if they don't know it. Because what you're gonna learn from the people actually struggle is the the same problem that other people are eventually gonna face. But they just have.

296
00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:54.000
Chloe Lannert: Does that make sense to make more money? Right?

297
00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:17.070
Chloe Lannert: It's a general manager, that's what I heard right? They're the ones deciding to work with you, saying yes. So at the end of the day, whatever info from this person you're starting with the interview that's gonna lead to someone you understanding the person who's ready to become your customer. So, selfishly speaking, I only want to talk to people that are going to teach me the most about how to get the general manager to hire man.

298
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:39.219
Chloe Lannert: and I can talk to you all through what that looks like. More specifically, yes, but, like you said, it is important and reasonable to make sure that the user is also well taken care of, because the GM. Can hire a product all day. But if

299
01:00:39.390 --> 01:01:03.320
Chloe Lannert: if the salesperson won't use it and doesn't like the experience, that's bad news. So we can strategize more specifically outside of this. But I'll tell you this. I don't know the protocol of car dealerships. Okay.

300
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:06.130
Chloe Lannert: I will say that if you're really good at product.

301
01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:16.230
Chloe Lannert: you could get the salesperson to use it even before the GM like decides that the group uses it, and because they like it, and it gives them an advantage it carries up.

302
01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:18.920
Chloe Lannert: That's product growth. Yeah, we need to.

303
01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:31.560
Chloe Lannert: So that's really good. If you think you can handle. So you could actually make salesperson a temporary customer. So I did this long time ago. So the whole idea was that you get you know, if you're selling it to like a school.

304
01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:41.909
Chloe Lannert: don't get the school to buy, get the teacher to buy or the students to buy into something, and the students or the teacher bring it up. Notion of this. Yeah, really. Well.

305
01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:45.320
Chloe Lannert: payments

306
01:01:45.873 --> 01:02:14.660
Chloe Lannert: never said this before, but it almost feels like B to C to B, you know, like the notion is like, you're doing the consumer, and you order the consumer up to the like larger enterprise they're connected to. That's that's almost the difference between your market versus your go to right. Go to market.

307
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:20.190
Chloe Lannert: How do you actually enter it? Smaller, smaller price tag, get them to use it.

308
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:29.609
Chloe Lannert: They may become a GM. Somewhere else. They're like everyone uses right because it's better, and they love it. They become a champion like version. Follow the champion.

309
01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:49.829
Chloe Lannert: All of a sudden. You see, like there's 1 salesperson on team, and, like. All of a sudden their sales are going up, and they're getting well, and they're behaving differently. And then what's going on like? Why, how's this person? All of a sudden they find out. Oh, they're using something like

310
01:02:49.830 --> 01:03:03.610
Chloe Lannert: there's a way that I don't want to get too married to that. But that's 1 path. That's an option. Yeah, that's like, that's the path that I go down. I'm trying not to, either as a temporary customer.

311
01:03:04.152 --> 01:03:13.250
Chloe Lannert: And I just wanna go back to one thing about the the competition. Okay.

312
01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:29.509
Chloe Lannert: I'm having a little bit of a hard time like really narrowing down one specific competitor like, what's my struggling moment. We don't have actual competition. Am I inspired?

313
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:32.139
Chloe Lannert: Why do they get fired?

314
01:03:33.334 --> 01:03:43.889
Chloe Lannert: It's like after a month, is it? After 6 months like, what's the criteria.

315
01:03:44.630 --> 01:04:05.550
Chloe Lannert: They're totally dependent on the person if they're not performing no show of like responsive. Yeah. Some people just need to never respond. You gotta hire someone. Yes.

316
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:18.229
Chloe Lannert: Sorry. What did you say? Like a salesperson? Yeah, we're talking. GM, here, right? If you put yourself in the shoes of the GM. Like, what's my job like right now, how many cars for the average dealership you're looking at by selling a month?

317
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:45.819
Chloe Lannert: 100 cars? Right? So if we're not selling 100 cars selling 50. We got a problem. My job. I might figure this out right. So all of a sudden, like, I've got energy to do something about this. I need to hire better people. I need to hire better tools. I need to do both. All that stuff's going. So you all are going to make a ton of money. If you can prove that by signing up for what you do, paying more.

318
01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.559
Chloe Lannert: they get one. And all of a sudden I'm covered

319
01:04:48.940 --> 01:05:07.520
Chloe Lannert: right on that note like I did add, like, when that happens, they usually start hiring people to train them again. That's a great thing. That's the impetus. All of a sudden I have a problem. I'm hiring a trainer to come into work with my sales team.

320
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.221
Chloe Lannert: What if, instead of a training, you're replacing that budget with May.

321
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:13.980
Chloe Lannert: Okay.

322
01:05:14.854 --> 01:05:25.275
Chloe Lannert: around a bunch of dealerships with a salesperson. If they have 3 sales car sales jobs in the last year, they're probably that salesperson.

323
01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:27.899
Chloe Lannert: So go after that

324
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:44.970
Chloe Lannert: to interview what happens is like if you hire 7 people, half of them worked in another dealership and like didn't cut an order trying to like sell it a brand where they can make more money. But to you all's point.

325
01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:59.789
Chloe Lannert: Somebody's making a bad hiring decision, or they're desperate because this is a hard carrier to hire people in, because it's already got stable, I don't know. But like, let's- let's- let's like this is

326
01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:26.339
Chloe Lannert: so frothy like. I hope you all make so much money is going to do this. So our 1st general manager, when we helped like that 1st new hire like we helped sell his 1st cars. He sold 10 cars in his 1st month like that when I presented that to him. He's like that's insane. This changes the way we hire people. Yes, exactly reshape how the industry even operates. Let's go. I can hear the pitch.

327
01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:44.029
Chloe Lannert: the actual sales, managers and sales reps like that. You wanna get a hold of, think they might be actually like going into their online training tool and downloading a lot of documents like self help right? Because the the job that they want to do is that they want to be or not

328
01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:55.989
Chloe Lannert: right? I wanna so like, I wonder if that's if that instead of them hiring somebody that they were gathering resources. You know the resources. Yeah, I see what you're saying.

329
01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.980
Chloe Lannert: Also, given how tough this industry is with dealing with salespeople. In the 1st place.

330
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:17.259
Chloe Lannert: I think the future is gonna be. There's gonna be far fewer sales people at all. So you should probably stay to where the fuck's gonna be. Illuminate that future to these gms, because how much? How many people in their life are passionate about becoming our sales.

331
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:35.199
Chloe Lannert: persons, or people. But it sounds like you're doing a service for the rest of the world by replacing. It's so funny, because whenever we present this like, wait. So you're replacing my job like, no, I mean, yeah, I mean again. So it's awkward to say. But like

332
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:47.470
Chloe Lannert: we thought, I mean, you think Uber is the future. But really, it's what we see in San Francisco. Right? It's the cars about people driving. Yeah. But what I'm saying is is like, you're not gonna meet the person

333
01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:48.610
Chloe Lannert: anymore.

334
01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.200
Chloe Lannert: There's better things for those people to do.

335
01:07:52.940 --> 01:08:17.209
Chloe Lannert: I think I hope maybe you'll be so rich you'll activate Ubi in your local community. I don't know. Figure it out. Guys be billionaires. That's all the problems. Okay, we'll talk about it over the retreat. Let's go. Let's figure it out. Yeah, let's go. Okay, this is good. But I'm really excited about this space. I think you will have a ton of attention. Very good. Thank you. Yeah.

336
01:08:17.907 --> 01:08:20.879
Chloe Lannert: alright. We're laughing now. I like that. I like that.

337
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:31.289
Chloe Lannert: Does anyone want to go next? Oh, leadership. Okay, let's go. You didn't figure out how to do the thing.

338
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:44.129
Chloe Lannert: Wait? Why not? Well, like that? URL, yeah, go to basecamp.

339
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:55.789
Chloe Lannert: yeah, and go to New and then it's a Google draft thing. Yes, do that drop in here

340
01:08:55.930 --> 01:09:00.860
Chloe Lannert: beautiful right where, and then give it a name?

341
01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:11.330
Chloe Lannert: Oh, so! And then I refresh, and then is it open? Is the link open. Can I open it?

342
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:15.358
Chloe Lannert: It's almost like anything that was gonna happen.

343
01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:19.840
Chloe Lannert: See?

344
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:22.250
Chloe Lannert: Back to Bill

345
01:09:31.703 --> 01:09:37.289
Chloe Lannert: cool. So I'm gonna need a bit of grilling on this one, because I'm also pretty confused on them.

346
01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:44.570
Chloe Lannert: Now, my focus. With this I think it might be a little bit different, but in essence we we got a bunch of clients, and

347
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:56.180
Chloe Lannert: they're quite cool and quite big, and I keep getting bigger. But I still don't really know why they come to us. I've met them. I've talked to them, and I was just kind of show them exactly, you know, like

348
01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:05.410
Chloe Lannert: awesome. We want it. Let's try it, and I'm like basics, and then everything great. And then they book this again, and I'm like cool.

349
01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:18.330
Chloe Lannert: but like what we do is obviously like very fantastic. But there's there's competitors, there's alternatives, there's lots of other solutions. What is it that we're helping with?

350
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:27.159
Chloe Lannert: And so right now, what I want to do is, I want to talk to one of my client current clients, especially the ones that are using it. So not so much the ones that are

351
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:37.280
Chloe Lannert: buying or sign the contract because they need to be convinced by the ones that are used. So the ones that are using us as a brand, the content managers, especially independent

352
01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:43.930
Chloe Lannert: consumer business. So I'm not talking about the ones that are part of holding groups. I'm talking about individual brands.

353
01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:47.620
Chloe Lannert: and I want to talk to them that have worked with us, at least in the past 2 months.

354
01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:54.929
Chloe Lannert: and I've purchased my job, and I can promise on at least another whether it's another like single project or longer.

355
01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.040
Chloe Lannert: Tom.

356
01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.010
Chloe Lannert: So these are the people. How many of them are there?

357
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.699
Chloe Lannert: So, on average, up to 13 of them, how many do you have? Total?

358
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:05.400
Chloe Lannert: We've got about

359
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:28.289
Chloe Lannert: from 6 clients 26. So half of them fit that criteria or half of them, are the ones who just want to talk. Okay, this is good. So the guy, by the way, his screen right here is different because these are existing customers. So you already know. Right? So this is this, this actually is appropriate for this, which is a very different exercise than we've done for the past year.

360
01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:37.619
Chloe Lannert: Okay, so like I've reached out to 13 of them scheduled 3 calls all next week the others are like January.

361
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:41.179
Chloe Lannert: I forgot my taking the question back.

362
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:48.410
Chloe Lannert: totally. Help me with. And she was like, look, it's not gonna follow the strict. Just be aware of them. I know you're pretty ping pong around them.

363
01:11:49.380 --> 01:12:02.860
Chloe Lannert: I know what alternatives like they could have used, whether it's agencies or the tech platforms. I know what they need to use could have told them for about. So I know, like, what are the other options.

364
01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:10.500
Chloe Lannert: But so what I need to find out is okay when you use us. What was it about? What we did. Is it the fact that we saved time?

365
01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:19.150
Chloe Lannert: So you have? You don't worry about the cost you just have to be fast with it wasn't said like a cost budget element was the fact that, like

366
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.540
Chloe Lannert: every time you use, does the content form better?

367
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:28.419
Chloe Lannert: But then it's like, all right, save and get this content within the timeframe within the cost budget like

368
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:56.589
Chloe Lannert: what happens to you? Are you not able to re-qualify your budget next year? So there's not a reason for you to exist? Is it because you want a bigger budget next year, or is it because otherwise you just don't sell until your consumer products to compete against hundreds of other alternatives in the consumer world? Is it because you have to constantly be like dishing out content and show yourself to the world. So what is the main consequence? If you don't, you know, have this confident?

369
01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.179
Chloe Lannert: This is what I want to find out. I don't know if this guy, for instance.

370
01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:16.739
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, I mean honestly like the fact that they're a repeat customer is already enough right? So they purchase. You want to say you kind of know a little bit about that, and you'll probably find out when you have the conversation more. But you have this like purchase point.

371
01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:26.409
Chloe Lannert: and you have another purchase point that you're wedged between that you can track timeline of. Naturally, this timeline is gonna go to the 1st one as well.

372
01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:39.180
Chloe Lannert: Right? So they like something about what you did the 1st time that led them to a second time. You've got more work cut out for you to have that conversation. But you have really rich data that you're gonna collect. That will signify

373
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:42.290
Chloe Lannert: the ideal 1st purchase.

374
01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:48.800
Chloe Lannert: because it's gonna lead to a second purchase. More likely, because you know the right person in the right situation. That's gonna become a repeat customer

375
01:13:49.390 --> 01:14:06.690
Chloe Lannert: makes sense. That makes sense. The reason why I want to find the status, because I've never put like a cent into like marketing or sales, because I still don't know what tracks the people to use like. How am I gonna hook them up? So I need to understand. Like.

376
01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:17.660
Chloe Lannert: what is it? Yeah, I mean, the richness of your insights are gonna feed both like repeat sales and additional sales. But it's also gonna help inform your product development

377
01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:24.160
Chloe Lannert: like you have a vision to like. I I mean, I know why we're here, right? So you're ready to go. Pro. So the whole idea is like.

378
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:28.480
Chloe Lannert: you're gonna incorporate these insights into the product experience as well.

379
01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:30.459
Chloe Lannert: I'm sold.

380
01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:33.040
Chloe Lannert: So what do you need to like? What are you struggling with?

381
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.350
Chloe Lannert: I just wasn't sure if this was the right approach. This is the right approach.

382
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:38.650
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

383
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:43.609
Chloe Lannert: And the other thing is that business too limited is that I just

384
01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:47.219
Chloe Lannert: don't focus on existing clients this, this mean that, then.

385
01:14:47.850 --> 01:15:08.800
Chloe Lannert: because if you nail this, we've got all the room and time and hopefully revenue to spend in the other categories to expand. But my advice, based on what I know so far, is to just knock this out of the park.

386
01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:17.160
Chloe Lannert: Understand the people who have paid you more than once? Why, we're so happy with you, and what would take it, you know. What would it take for them to stay and keep coming.

387
01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:33.069
Chloe Lannert: and so long as you lock them in, get more of them, so that you have a cushion or tab, and then we can talk about market expansion 1st time. They usually give us the yearly budget, which is about 5 times the initial test.

388
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:46.490
Chloe Lannert: One went from the 9 K test, 45 k. Task and 200 k, so I know it's like almost a consistent 5 times increase from an issue to a year.

389
01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:48.969
Chloe Lannert: and I just need to on the satellite

390
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:52.899
Chloe Lannert: what will allow them to mail that 1st time to then get that new.

391
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:55.799
Chloe Lannert: I'm looking forward to our long, hard ride.

392
01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:58.720
Chloe Lannert: Good! So well, thanks.

393
01:15:59.557 --> 01:16:09.490
Chloe Lannert: I guess my question here. So I guess we were thinking about the same thing. But on these like questions, like, we're not gonna ask these questions.

394
01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:17.870
Chloe Lannert: He's saying, this is what he wants these like again. None of you should have pre scripted, premeditated questions.

395
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:20.429
Chloe Lannert: You have a timeline, you have your training.

396
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:28.619
Chloe Lannert: you go in, and you have a curiosity. I want to know the story behind what you did. He has it because they all paid him twice.

397
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:36.179
Chloe Lannert: I wanna know what's up. You not only did you pay me, but you paid me twice. You hire me for this project, and then we did this other project for you.

398
01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:49.130
Chloe Lannert: I wanna understand. If you hired anyone else after you hired me, and then you came back, or if you just did me, and you came back to me again, like what's up with that like? There's so many interesting stories to eliminate with that context.

399
01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:50.790
Chloe Lannert: Right?

400
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:56.670
Chloe Lannert: So we'll talk to you guys in a second about your situation, probably. But like

401
01:16:57.030 --> 01:17:04.009
Chloe Lannert: I can't wait. This is fun, like when you have when you guys have customers like, that's what just gets like a hundred times more powerful

402
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:05.840
Chloe Lannert: all day.

403
01:17:10.357 --> 01:17:22.290
Chloe Lannert: Cool? Very good.

404
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:32.349
Chloe Lannert: Who wants to go next? Anyone else, you ready to go last.

405
01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.040
Chloe Lannert: But we have Trina, too.

406
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:43.650
Chloe Lannert: Let's see, here is this helpful guys, am I just like talking too much? Okay, all right.

407
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.719
Chloe Lannert: I got double trends. I got double Meg double.

408
01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.289
Trina Das: I think the 1st one is the right one.

409
01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:53.880
Chloe Lannert: That's it.

410
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:59.510
Chloe Lannert: Hmm!

411
01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:01.470
Chloe Lannert: Oh, it's yes.

412
01:18:05.339 --> 01:18:14.560
Chloe Lannert: let's go. Have you all ever heard of the company called Trump Club

413
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:29.860
Chloe Lannert: harvest, you know truck club facility. So that's Chicago. A little more people like I I know that company, you know, when they start everything. So anyway, Trump Club is like, what's the there's a there's a there's a women version of it.

414
01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:52.180
Chloe Lannert: It's like a rent. The runway like they should. Yeah, things like that. So trump clubs like an Og version of it. But it was for guys. So it was like they would send you a trunk of like really expensive clothes. You try them on, and you send back that you don't want to keep a bunch of expensive stuff. But in Chicago they had, like their own, like in person location, and you go there and like

415
01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.980
Chloe Lannert: no doubts.

416
01:18:54.100 --> 01:19:02.109
Chloe Lannert: all these like incredibly beautiful women, and they're all like, Oh, my God, you look so good! Here's an old fashioned. What else do you need?

417
01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:26.636
Chloe Lannert: You know it's $2,000 worth of, you know. Kind of thing. It looked great. It was like they got sold to North Stem. Great exit, all that stuff. But anyway, that was pretty fun. So yes, car dealerships. This car looks great on you, sir. You're gonna love this. You need to buy this. Ev hummer, you need this in your life. Yeah, let's go.

418
01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:28.970
Chloe Lannert: tell you.

419
01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:37.219
Chloe Lannert: We're kind of in the same problem as Carlo and our business model is similar to like many as well.

420
01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:43.280
Chloe Lannert: We do have repeat customers, but we don't know why they keep coming back to us.

421
01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:55.489
Chloe Lannert: Maybe I'm personable. Maybe they just like me when I go talk to them. So how many we have about 7 recurring realtors? Excellent. So

422
01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:05.780
Chloe Lannert: oh, Barb, I guess that time the mission with this is to begin those conversations and we're gonna separate.

423
01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:13.169
Chloe Lannert: We're gonna talk to both realtors. Who are our champion who recommend our product to the, to the customer.

424
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:18.790
Chloe Lannert: And then we're also going to talk to the customer who pays for it. The home buyer. Essentially

425
01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.140
Chloe Lannert: but we feel the key decision maker in this.

426
01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:30.429
Chloe Lannert: It's probably a realtor. So okay, so question, sorry. Jump in. You have 7 repeat customers.

427
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:35.169
Chloe Lannert: Would you be happy with a 0 or 2 added to that number

428
01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:44.479
Chloe Lannert: absolutely of the same profile of those 7? Or are there a specific subgroup of the 7 that you prefer more of them

429
01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:57.720
Chloe Lannert: like? Are they all the same? Or is there some sort of distinction between that so small, like high volume? How many high volume do you have? Just 1 1? Yeah. So one out of those 7 represent the high volume that you're looking for

430
01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:58.760
Chloe Lannert: right?

431
01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:02.589
Chloe Lannert: So now, like for the remaining 6.

432
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:05.850
Chloe Lannert: Is that a group that you'd be willing to abandon?

433
01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:12.760
Chloe Lannert: Not at this point. We- we did more of the other group. Yeah.

434
01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:21.670
Chloe Lannert: tell. Tell me more like- like, are you? Are we for real? For real? And that's who we care about serving? Or do we also want to serve a little guy. So

435
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:25.929
Chloe Lannert: I mean, we would like to serve everyone, obviously. But

436
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:34.829
Chloe Lannert: we get more business on from that one time one repeat realtor like every month we get. You know where I'm going with this. You know what I'm asking.

437
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:56.660
Chloe Lannert: It's gonna reshape their approach to product. So if the notion is, I want to design for this group, no matter how small or large you are. That's a very different circumstance. And the big players, if I interview more of you and I focus on you, I would inevitably design systems for you. Now, one thing that can be helpful about taking that approach is, if the other 6 want to become a part of the.

438
01:21:57.030 --> 01:22:09.600
Chloe Lannert: because then, if you design it for the one, they can level up into it. But if instead, you want to serve them as they are, because they're destined to be that way for the rest of their lives, and you care about helping them. That's a different philosophical approach.

439
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.550
Chloe Lannert: Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah.

440
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:30.719
Chloe Lannert: yeah. Want you to know that goes into thinking about this, too. Sure, it's like your company, DNA, your vision we want to serve.

441
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:54.429
Chloe Lannert: So not every brokerage has like a sometimes, but like typically at the broker level, that's where they decide who they're going to complain.

442
01:22:54.910 --> 01:23:01.530
Chloe Lannert: Did you wanna have a 5 phone call right? Now?

443
01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:24.830
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, yeah, I think you're right. So maybe it's like we we've spoken some brokerages where that they do have a transaction coordinators, and what but the ultimate decision of like choosing the inspector balls on either the home buyer or the realtor like essentially with names to the home buyer.

444
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.560
Chloe Lannert: or they just like, Call me and say, Oh.

445
01:23:28.077 --> 01:23:31.890
Chloe Lannert: that's the way it works. But I think for at least for

446
01:23:32.567 --> 01:23:38.250
Chloe Lannert: jobs to be done. I think we should focus on like the sales that we've done. So like going back to the repeat

447
01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.010
Chloe Lannert: Rookie filters.

448
01:23:41.245 --> 01:23:46.000
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So we want to speak with like home buyers and realtors who

449
01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.530
Chloe Lannert: hire us in the past 6 months.

450
01:23:49.187 --> 01:23:53.160
Chloe Lannert: Or being a key decision maker in selecting our service.

451
01:23:54.310 --> 01:24:04.120
Chloe Lannert: and the second part of that is like they should have faced a challenge. So a lot of a lot of the times when they come to us. It's either slight, slow, turnaround time, or

452
01:24:04.410 --> 01:24:07.990
Chloe Lannert: like unclear of like they're passing. It's not something like this.

453
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:11.940
Chloe Lannert: So the the builders don't get paid, though, right

454
01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:32.260
Chloe Lannert: for me. No, no, yes, it's illegal. It is illegal, for like them to receive compensations.

455
01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:39.539
Chloe Lannert: Yes, when when it's not good, only when it's not good, at least like

456
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:51.970
Chloe Lannert: from like couple of times that that has happened. That's that's what we've noticed. Like. If if things are going well like you don't hear anything like doesn't get inspection right so. But if they

457
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:58.293
Chloe Lannert: like, if the presentation was not great, some inspector or something like that, then then we would hear back

458
01:24:58.730 --> 01:25:02.839
Chloe Lannert: and then reach out. Do you get feedback from the end user.

459
01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:08.962
Chloe Lannert: the end user? Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to think,

460
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:19.375
Chloe Lannert: I think they typically communicate that to the realtor. And then the realtor would tell me only when it's back.

461
01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:26.740
Chloe Lannert: or maybe they're gonna get good feedback, too, which it doesn't. Just

462
01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:35.529
Chloe Lannert: we do send out a survey. So we try to collect feedback from from the home buyers. And in that, like.

463
01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:49.710
Chloe Lannert: maybe like half of half the people reply, they all give like 5 stars. And then we ask them, right? Right? Recommendation. So we get feedback that way. But it's like solicited feedback. So

464
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:57.200
Chloe Lannert: yeah, yeah, we're gonna target some of those home buyers as well.

465
01:25:57.450 --> 01:26:10.200
Chloe Lannert: These conversations. Yeah, as to why they recommend you right? They can say, I don't like your companies

466
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:18.910
Chloe Lannert: really cool. And then it's like, Oh, have you heard anything from anyone who's used it? Maybe. Say, Hey, no. Yeah. So we would find a

467
01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.132
Chloe Lannert: let me pull that

468
01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:35.208
Chloe Lannert: progress we have. We haven't done any interviews yet. We have 5 interviews scheduled for next week, 3 realtors, 2 home buyers.

469
01:26:35.710 --> 01:26:56.320
Chloe Lannert: and we were thinking of drafting a list of questions. I know it's not recommended. But we'll take that off. It's it's like it's a it's a mental switch, right? Because, like you, instinctually, we prepare questions when we have it that makes sense. But again, if you, if you understand the psychology behind this approach

470
01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:06.109
Chloe Lannert: hopefully, it makes sense that you don't actually need to do that. You recognize it, and actually might be a hindrance to do so, because you'll end up trying to accomplish

471
01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:10.550
Chloe Lannert: a certain criteria questions when you're supposed to have a conversation and uncover something.

472
01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:16.215
Chloe Lannert: It was just useful to have that fry my brain towards.

473
01:27:17.970 --> 01:27:27.700
Chloe Lannert: So my advice there is to activate your curiosity about the purchase. So if you're gonna have any kind of question, it's about your knowledge of their purchase already?

474
01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:30.579
Chloe Lannert: Right? So maybe it could be categorical

475
01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:54.110
Chloe Lannert: like. When did you buy this? Why did you buy this? Where were you when you bought it? Who did you talk to about buying it? Those are the questions that you could just remind yourself you need to default to if you aren't sure what to say, that's okay. But over time, I promise you, if you do that right a couple of times, you won't ever need to have that list to know to ask those questions. You will always be curious about that by default.

476
01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:56.659
Chloe Lannert: That's what gets the conversation started

477
01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:13.330
Chloe Lannert: makes sense. I guess. One thing. So as we're talking about home buyers, right? So some, maybe the product was just recommended by recommended by the realtor and the home buyer decided to go with it. So if we come across a home buyer who says, Oh, just like picked you guys because the realtor said so.

478
01:28:13.770 --> 01:28:18.190
Chloe Lannert: is there anything that I can say like, there's no energy there. Yeah. So

479
01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:23.489
Chloe Lannert: I am more interested in the people who struggle to choose

480
01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:32.600
Chloe Lannert: because other than that, then your job is to focus on the real people prefer you rather than the customer themselves.

481
01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:45.930
Chloe Lannert: So either you want to understand the customers who will resist and question that recommendation, or you focus on the person who's making that referral and how to make sure that they continue to refer you and other people.

482
01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:59.400
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So there have been instances where, like the realtor would recommend. But then the customer reaches out to me and was like, Hey, what do you guys expect like? Can you send me a list of things that you guys do. Which group is very interesting for you to start

483
01:28:59.970 --> 01:29:03.300
Chloe Lannert: the refer or the home buyer themselves.

484
01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:16.410
Chloe Lannert: I haven't any, but I will share it. We thought we were gonna do 5 interviews like of each in the next 2 weeks. So like have realtors and also like talk to home buyers as well.

485
01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:22.270
Chloe Lannert: Well, what's your answer to the question, hey?

486
01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.300
Chloe Lannert: I think realtors, because

487
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:34.990
Chloe Lannert: at least, for now they are the ones who generate that I think it's okay that you have 3 and 2 scheduled, because one of those will tell you which way to go.

488
01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:37.150
Chloe Lannert: I'm guessing it's gonna be Rosers.

489
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.809
Chloe Lannert: and whatever that is, my recommendation is, don't continue doing both. Choose one and go do.

490
01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:51.010
Chloe Lannert: Once you've done that, and if you come out of that process going. The there is a there we need to switch cool. I'm pretty sure there's a there.

491
01:29:53.050 --> 01:29:54.300
Chloe Lannert: Okay, yeah.

492
01:29:54.890 --> 01:30:01.530
Chloe Lannert: makes sense, because it's gonna be a completely different conversation. The home buyer is gonna you're gonna unpacking the very than the real.

493
01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:05.380
Chloe Lannert: Thank you.

494
01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:14.186
Chloe Lannert: And then we're gonna come up with the list of like the most impactful introductions again for you. Especially sorry. Go back,

495
01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.469
Chloe Lannert: if you're talking to the home buyer

496
01:30:18.970 --> 01:30:37.510
Chloe Lannert: the whole. I don't know if they'll know anyone else who's recently purchased a home. But probably we've had. We've had like 2 inspections from us. Well, my point is that get them to refer someone else to that don't like you on particular. You're gonna get a lot of people who very easily say, there's someone else I know who's been through this recently.

497
01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.650
Chloe Lannert: Right.

498
01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:49.680
Chloe Lannert: So just ask them to introduce you to someone else. We'd like to. We'd love to understand more people like you because we're building something really cool that we'd love to share with you and spread it. What's already, you know, like that?

499
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:56.220
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, that's that's pretty much it sweet.

500
01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.719
Chloe Lannert: So alright harves.

501
01:31:01.730 --> 01:31:05.510
Chloe Lannert: And then, after harvest, Trina, and after Trina Meg

502
01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:13.409
Chloe Lannert: probably no time we got 20 min.

503
01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:19.270
Chloe Lannert: It took us an hour to get through 2

504
01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.960
Chloe Lannert: afterwards. I'm missing.

505
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:32.250
Chloe Lannert: It's at the baseline cool.

506
01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:37.401
Chloe Lannert: Alright, so ours is,

507
01:31:38.230 --> 01:32:04.470
Chloe Lannert: honestly, it's more conversational at this point, because we kind of also are like, definitely figuring it out. But we also had recent stuff happen just like on Monday and Friday. So we're trying to. We're kind of going out or input to output and kind of going in reverse way because of recent events. So some of the stuff is a little bit more in a thing, and we have a lot in our heads. So talk to us more than size.

508
01:32:04.931 --> 01:32:16.090
Chloe Lannert: So the the 1st milestone we we did what we believe is our 1st Gtv. The interview and we started up some of that analysis. And we

509
01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:28.220
Chloe Lannert: we there start outreach to what we we consider group A, the reason I'll go challenges and maybe cycle back. As to why, that's a little different, because we change our pricing model. But who has hired us in a little

510
01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:46.510
Chloe Lannert: in a little bit of a flux state. But also we discovered a lot about our 1st paying. True, what we believe is a true 1st paying user. And we want to kind of convert what would have been group C into a group a, we can do that analysis on them because they're a lot more interesting than doing it on group C, which is like using other competitors.

511
01:32:47.917 --> 01:33:06.800
Chloe Lannert: yeah. So we, you know, we wanna basically, we are kind of focused on, like, you know, Andrew is doing leading the outreach strategy and outreach. I'm focusing on analysis post interviews always together as normally but probably, honestly, I'm probably gonna be helping with the outreach

512
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:25.586
Chloe Lannert: next. So we didn't follow the the normal one here, because we really focus on behavior rather than like a particular job title, which is what we've been struggling with the most. But I think we'll probably, even after this, just pick one of these as a job title and go forward.

513
01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:38.160
Chloe Lannert: so these. Yeah, the the job titles here is, essentially, a data strategy consultant is what we're finding. We're focusing on someone who's working in a small team, right? Not one. Someone who's working at a hedge fund

514
01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.310
Chloe Lannert: specific agencies.

515
01:33:40.530 --> 01:33:53.020
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, not a big, not a big headphone. They have too much compliance. They've their their sales. Cycles are too slow. We're just not going to learn quickly from that. So we are. What's the what's the break room? What's the struggling moment

516
01:33:53.020 --> 01:34:19.830
Chloe Lannert: I read ahead. Yeah. So okay, so I'll go. Okay. I'll explain the overview of the results of the 1st one. But their biggest pain point is literally gathering the data and getting into the structured format that they needed. Where is that? Where is that?

517
01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:48.140
Chloe Lannert: Well, because this okay, so I was, gonna we were doing it based on behavior. But maybe that should be part of the screen criteria.

518
01:34:50.260 --> 01:35:10.170
Chloe Lannert: The struggling moment is really line one. Hey? Manually viewing public

519
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:17.390
Chloe Lannert: what it is, what's the problem? It takes too long. And it is a lot of work. Why doesn't it say that?

520
01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:26.150
Chloe Lannert: Because I didn't do? Is that for all of them, or some people who don't like it? Some people who enjoy it do they all hate it.

521
01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.119
Chloe Lannert: They all hate doing this. Yeah, yeah.

522
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:39.069
Chloe Lannert: they hate. They hate the process. Yes, that's that's the that's the number one problem that they think universally, people hate doing this. Okay, the question is like

523
01:35:39.460 --> 01:36:00.412
Chloe Lannert: to distill the moment exactly. The process of doing it sucks. But the exact moments in that process of doing it. The sucks. I guess we can still a little bit more. So if it's universally hated what someone within this group does to do something about. So yeah. So the our user who bought this week?

524
01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:06.179
Chloe Lannert: he tried other solutions and traffic. He tried.

525
01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:16.120
Chloe Lannert: Remember, there's something else in what's the way to solve it.

526
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.750
Chloe Lannert: What's the actual? What's the answer you don't want them to know about?

527
01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:31.870
Chloe Lannert: Well, they can. They could set up if they, if they know how to code which they don't, which is part of the criteria. They don't. That's why it's manually not.

528
01:36:32.110 --> 01:36:34.589
Chloe Lannert: No, but manually is the the keywords.

529
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:50.859
Chloe Lannert: They're they're they're manually copying pasting those right? That's a part of well, it's so. That's that's where it's a little tricky, is even. I know I know how to code. I still don't like doing it, and it still sucks for me. So whether they know how to code or they don't. Yes.

530
01:36:52.040 --> 01:37:10.631
Chloe Lannert: so I'm trying to. You see what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to PIN down both the contradictions and the clarity. Yeah, so so the the non developer is right now. This is a part, even in that jc, interview that we have. This was like a big sticking point is that I know I could go learn how to do this. I know a bit of python. There are semi

531
01:37:10.890 --> 01:37:29.619
Chloe Lannert: competent programmer, but they're like, that's just so much work. You guys want to serve the developer. So say that shit. Okay, that's what I'm saying. Like, we need to be way more specific here with the actual situation that is ideal for you. Yeah.

532
01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:41.469
Chloe Lannert: like you guys are are smart. So like you are filling in the gaps with what you've written here, you need to spell it out. Because eventually you're gonna have a larger team. And other people need to understand.

533
01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:50.390
Chloe Lannert: Right? Yeah, agreed. This main thing is yeah up here.

534
01:37:51.446 --> 01:37:57.410
Chloe Lannert: You said it was too much of a hassle to do it like you

535
01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:13.250
Chloe Lannert: like interview customer. He just won't do it.

536
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:33.140
Chloe Lannert: Early stage associate investing in consumer.

537
01:38:33.170 --> 01:39:00.540
Chloe Lannert: Our our objective is, you know, we have some we have. We have early paying users. Early on. We change our pricing model, so that kind of reduces it to the like 5. We are also trying to understand. Why did they even try paying for harvest? In the 1st place, when there are things like perplexity or chat gpt. We want to understand what the functional needs are. After they have used harvest. Right? Are they trying to use it to create?

538
01:39:00.610 --> 01:39:18.830
Chloe Lannert: It's the functional needs afterwards? Are they just using it to look at the data like, what is the point of that with harvest? The whole point was that you could source. You know.

539
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:24.949
Chloe Lannert: all of the content in real time on how it laid out. It's almost like.

540
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:36.270
Chloe Lannert: why would you want to? It's almost like we're following the value of the heart in doing so, isn't it? Yeah, it is. But it's like, functionally, what are they doing after you?

541
01:39:36.270 --> 01:40:05.370
Chloe Lannert: Right? Are they using that to then train a model? Are they using that to visualize that data, to present to their manager or Gp, are they using that just to do competitive analysis. They can remember in their head what is the next functional steps that they're doing with the harvested dam? That's what we want to know very concretely, because then we can, we can build the right thing for that particular purpose, and only that particular purpose. To begin with. Right? We have some early signs of data. Visualization is actually

542
01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:13.490
Chloe Lannert: one of the one of the key needs key requirements for some of these users. But we wanna, we wanna confirm that through the

543
01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:21.689
Chloe Lannert: severity of the problem. How much of the loans pay? Not sure if that's gonna happen to the interview. So

544
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:32.590
Chloe Lannert: maybe we strike a line for that? The emotional and social context? Are these the users who are making the investments themselves? Or are they just doing the analysis and presenting it to a manager.

545
01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:40.100
Chloe Lannert: Right? We wanna make sure, like, we want to understand, what is the pressure that they're facing around using that data

546
01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.369
Chloe Lannert: outreach. We have our mixed Channel cohorts. Linkedin

547
01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:51.119
Chloe Lannert: have sign up for more, you know, superhuman stuff. Or for follow ups on this.

548
01:40:51.697 --> 01:41:03.580
Chloe Lannert: So yeah, our kind of an overview of the 1st one. This is where we obviously jump in. So this is a paid user paying 30 bucks a month. He's a data analyst at a consumer product. Vc.

549
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:22.149
Chloe Lannert: we, their best to define the job that we believe this specific user was trying to accomplish. When I'm doing a consumer brand competitor analysis. I want numerical and categorical data from product pages in a structured format so that I can build data visualizations to prevent

550
01:41:22.894 --> 01:41:32.019
Chloe Lannert: my trap. I love this. So this is what I always do. So this part right here.

551
01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:33.710
Chloe Lannert: this all that.

552
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:41.669
Chloe Lannert: This is somebody. Oh, I see. I see, this is what I want.

553
01:41:42.830 --> 01:42:01.469
Chloe Lannert: We're missing. So I want to unpack. Why, they have to do the competitive analysis for

554
01:42:02.130 --> 01:42:18.790
Chloe Lannert: so yeah. So they're doing a brand competitor analysis. This user wants to build a essentially data visualization or presentation. And why am I doing better analysis?

555
01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:46.590
Chloe Lannert: That is a little bit of what we're. That's why that's just oh, to present to our like, my manager, okay, got it. So you guys have to tell our context. Yeah. So so to, I think he's a Vc associate and consumer brand focus early stage Vc, he's doing this competitor analysis both on potential investments and existing portfolio companies

556
01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:51.589
Chloe Lannert: to see where their position is in the market about in order to make a decision about something. Yes.

557
01:42:51.740 --> 01:43:12.720
Chloe Lannert: what what decision am I trying to make? So in case of potential investments could be investments, we don't know. We don't know for sure. Guys, the context of who we want to talk to need to go. Okay, what are we trying to accomplish here?

558
01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:31.140
Chloe Lannert: Right? So I have a deal I need to be done. I'm trying to get better now. Or is this more generic? Was this the idea that I can do a better job with this? Because I know I do in the general, and I don't have a particular deal I'm trying to get done right now, or am I buying you? Because I actively struggling for something that I'm trying to accomplish? And it takes a freaking money.

559
01:43:31.410 --> 01:43:37.959
Chloe Lannert: So this is an opportunistic moment. Or was this an actual like circumstantial like driver?

560
01:43:39.834 --> 01:44:03.929
Chloe Lannert: Know this? I know this, so I guess I'm asking, not because I don't know. But I'm curious to know what you guys do.

561
01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:30.200
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So he you described it as by the numbers you use that were not real sure. He wants to be rigorous and data driven. He has a stat background, statistics undergrad. And so when he says, if you give me a desk, I can do a lot with it, but getting it is not really worth my time. If I if I can't get it as easy. What was he so so right before like this? And this is your customer, right? So they found you.

562
01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:31.560
Chloe Lannert: Wow!

563
01:44:32.110 --> 01:44:43.570
Chloe Lannert: Me, my outreach being where and someone I've been connect, like someone know, been connected with and reached out through Linkedin.

564
01:44:44.970 --> 01:45:08.050
Chloe Lannert: Okay? So somebody, you know. Only thing you said, Hey, I got this thing. Well, actually, he specifically saw a demo and then reach out to me based on the demo. And what did he say? This is really cool. Okay, got it? And at that time, when he signed up for you guys, was he actively doing due diligence?

565
01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:13.319
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, was it a particular deal? Was it a set of deals? Was it portfolio support?

566
01:45:13.450 --> 01:45:14.860
Chloe Lannert: Definitely? It was

567
01:45:15.622 --> 01:45:38.749
Chloe Lannert: right. That whole premise of I'm here. I'm currently on a deal that I'm trying to do things on. I'm currently so my asked me to help out Portfolio company analysis, or I'm actively seeking deals within a category. And I'm looking at all the competitors in the space.

568
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:45.659
Chloe Lannert: Those are 3 different potential criteria. Yeah. And they can overlap if you need more than one. But the more you know about the impetus

569
01:45:45.730 --> 01:46:02.489
Chloe Lannert: the better off you'll be with understanding. He was trying to do a specific deal. He was trying to make a decision for a specific deal, and he wanted to put together a data visualization that's like, so let's go back to the screening criteria.

570
01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:07.730
Chloe Lannert: Sorry not the statement, my bad.

571
01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:13.359
Chloe Lannert: the one the statement, the- the when the job state. Yes. So

572
01:46:14.730 --> 01:46:21.720
Chloe Lannert: when I'm doing consumer brand, better analysis for a deal. I'm trying to get over. There we go now. We have a situation. Yeah.

573
01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:27.729
Chloe Lannert: I want to build data visualizations to present.

574
01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:34.840
Chloe Lannert: Not so this is the mistake everyone makes that I want. You can in what you do for them.

575
01:46:35.267 --> 01:47:03.909
Chloe Lannert: You jam in your features what people do, which is a mistake. Here is you take your product and you go. That's what they want. They want what I have right? Forget you like. It's not about you. The job story isn't about you at all. We understand that there's what you might be able to help them with. What they want is the thing that they get from that, not what you do.

576
01:47:04.670 --> 01:47:08.759
Chloe Lannert: So that is the actual outcome, which is what they want, which is what.

577
01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:15.629
Chloe Lannert: So that's the part that that's why I had it in Orange, because that's what we wanted to. In this case it was to to make a good investment.

578
01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:39.819
Chloe Lannert: Exactly, make a good investment. Right? Well, it's not to make a good investment. It's to convince my GPS to make this investment on this deal. So, and if they have personal aspiration, yeah, right? They want to level up. They want to be like they want to start their own fund. They wanna there's some version of their betterment. That is just go. That's what we also want to know, like.

579
01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:56.270
Chloe Lannert: Hey, like, what is the emotional and social context of this. The reason I'm being so obsessive right now is because this is a really I love that you guys are over alignment process. I love you not got an interview. You follow the formula. This is exactly the conversation. I wish I would have more people.

580
01:47:56.490 --> 01:48:17.160
Chloe Lannert: Right? So yeah, you guys ready to move? Yeah, no, it's it's we're. We're super excited. And so like, we, I put quotes because I think they just illuminate more. Yeah, like, there's someone who again, he's like, if I give you the 5 companies, if you please, provide us on. This is a quote that he actually put in. He like wants that he wants sales, price, description, public sentiment.

581
01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:40.922
Chloe Lannert: He wants to. I think this was like illuminating. Why, other ones. He's not. They're not using other ones like, Hey, perplexity. Just gave me a Bs read from this particular website, basically gave him a range of numbers. And it's just like, completely useless for him. He wants an actual. He wants data from the actual website so that he can do. He can categorize it, run mediums any kind of statistical analysis. He wants to do

582
01:48:41.630 --> 01:49:05.980
Chloe Lannert: emotional driver. This is a stats major. He knows what to do with the data. Specifically, he says, I guess this is, yeah. I want to do some set of numbers. So I can be scientific. They're pursuing truth and precision. And specifically going back to this one. It's getting the data. That's always been the barrier in being more rigorous. That's why I was so excited about harness. That's why he felt compelled to even try.

583
01:49:07.511 --> 01:49:14.099
Chloe Lannert: I have a question for Neil. Can you go back to the color coded sentence?

584
01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:17.790
Chloe Lannert: The I want is the ultimate is the data visualization

585
01:49:18.827 --> 01:49:27.429
Chloe Lannert: mean? It sounds like, yeah, right? And it's not just that. It's- it's want to.

586
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:54.659
Chloe Lannert: What? What data visualization do they want to present. Like, it's a competitive analysis. There's anything particular within competitive analysis and data. Visualization is what we present versus competitive branch. So even more specific. Right? So I'm saying generic a little bit. So because there's a few more layers deep that you go within data visualization and competitive analysis that you specify and see? So my, my next question was, so for the

587
01:49:54.660 --> 01:50:00.079
Chloe Lannert: where the product fits in the house like, how do we think about don't fit the product in at all.

588
01:50:00.090 --> 01:50:07.270
Chloe Lannert: Okay? So it basically, your job is to remove the product from the conversation and focus on like, assume that

589
01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.409
Chloe Lannert: there are 5 products that can be.

590
01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:16.399
Chloe Lannert: You and 4 other people could be slotted in for the same job you got, it

591
01:50:17.298 --> 01:50:21.590
Chloe Lannert: can stand behind. I want.

592
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:41.460
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, this conviction conviction is a big part of it. They want to feel like he wants to feel like this. I believe this right? That's that's a big emotional driver like you guys are pursuing precision, pursuing truth. They want to be data driven, but they don't.

593
01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:51.840
Chloe Lannert: The hardest part is just to get it into the format, so they can do that, they know what to do with the data. Again, the hardest part is to gather information.

594
01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:56.080
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, really, quick. Yeah. So

595
01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:18.680
Chloe Lannert: yeah. So again. This is a user who's tried chat gpt pro 200 bucks a month chat plus 20 bucks a month to fire. That doesn't do it for me. I tried deep research. Perplexities, like, sometimes it works, but not always. And yeah. And then he's like, so what I usually do is I just copy and paste it all myself.

596
01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:40.260
Chloe Lannert: And again he keeps saying, I kind of vibe it. He's like, I hate kind of vibing it. I want to be rigorous. Okay, our challenges. We want. We want to be in group A, we want it to be our paid paid on our product right now, because we just changed our pricing model on Friday we essentially reduces our paid users to like less than 5 so it might be

597
01:51:40.300 --> 01:52:09.140
Chloe Lannert: tough to close at 10 to 15. But we're gonna move really fast to try. And but, you know, bring on users. Have a separate group that you're running a process on, and then maybe have a perpetual Jp. In place for for your users as they're on board, so you don't want to do them right away. You want to give them some time to use your product and learn their behaviors and things like that, and especially after they just pay you. It's usually not kosher like immediately try to interrogate them. Give them some time right to use up.

598
01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:14.770
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. But you could professionally interview all of your early customers if you have available capacity.

599
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:17.629
Chloe Lannert: That's okay, too.

600
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:19.020
Chloe Lannert: So

601
01:52:19.505 --> 01:52:38.149
Chloe Lannert: we're about to get time. I promise one on ones with sales play and trends, and anyone else who wants them, but sales play and trends. I'll I'll fast pass you so we can. Do. You know, we can talk tomorrow. We can talk Monday. We can talk on Saturday. We're just hanging out.

602
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:43.840
Chloe Lannert: but on on tomorrow or Monday, or anytime next week, we can go deeper.

603
01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:46.340
Chloe Lannert: So I'm sorry we ran over time.

604
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:56.700
Chloe Lannert: but this is good stuff. Final question here. Has anyone not yet brand new inside sales? Don't worry. I'm not joking. Okay

605
01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:18.489
Chloe Lannert: for those who have not. If you read it, I promise you will benefit, and a lot of what I'm talking about will play for those who have. If what I've said is new to you. You might want to revisit the book to make sure that you comprehend it, because I'm not saying anything different than what the book says. I am giving a little more color and nuance to it. But

606
01:53:18.610 --> 01:53:23.049
Chloe Lannert: it's in there, too.

607
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:54.019
Chloe Lannert: And then yes, yes, maybe 2 weeks or one week.

608
01:53:54.070 --> 01:54:10.689
Chloe Lannert: and then, because I feel like I've been a lot from asking questions. And even on the other side, it's way easier for me to like Judge what you guys have today than what I've been doing. And so now I was like, have you seen? Have you tried that or that? And like, shoot that as well myself?

609
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:16.610
Chloe Lannert: So anyway, that's yeah, man. It's almost like I've been doing this for the past 13 years. That's crazy.

610
01:54:16.730 --> 01:54:23.060
Chloe Lannert: Let's go. Yeah. Sounds good, cool. But I don't know if such a session is download.

611
01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:35.630
Chloe Lannert: usually it's with me. But like, I think, what we can do based on what you're saying is like, if you guys want to commit to having a regular time. You can check in on the activity progress that's music to my ears. I would love that.

612
01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.970
Chloe Lannert: Make a phone.

613
01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:48.030
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. Well, what I'm hearing, though, if you're hope it sounds like you're open to it, I'll just dial up the number of

614
01:54:50.826 --> 01:55:01.160
Chloe Lannert: let's try it out. Well.

615

618
01:55:45.110 --> 01:56:12.990
Chloe Lannert: I box her all the time. It's not a problem. That's why it's Boxer. It's voice. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm like, guys. I'm 3 min behind schedule. No, so any other kind of questions. It's been a good week.

620
01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:47.040
Chloe Lannert: All right, let's go. Okay. So what I'm thinking is is, I want to volunteer to help with this cooking so like, let's assume that I

621
01:56:47.210 --> 01:56:56.179
Chloe Lannert: are. You guys done with this? Oh, so after that I will.

Okay. So you know, everyone just get there. Have fun on Saturday, right? But then I think Sunday, and then just Monday morning.
