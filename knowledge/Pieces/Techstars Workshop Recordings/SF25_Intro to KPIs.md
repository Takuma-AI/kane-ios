### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Sambhav Mehta: that's just one reference point. It's not particularly formal. I just want to know how it's going. So if you've done interviews, how are they going? What have you learned? Talk us through your screening criteria? Any refinements or updates you need to make? And if you have any challenges, if you want to talk through any strategy to get feedback for your next steps. So 5Â min each we'll talk through it. It'll be pretty chill.

### Key Insights

> "Sambhav Mehta: I guess I can say a quick thing. So I posted in basecamp the slides from this morning in the talk. I know we ran over time, so I apologize, but if anyone missed anything important you can watch the final few minutes in the recording I also posted a Jtvd checkpoint example"
