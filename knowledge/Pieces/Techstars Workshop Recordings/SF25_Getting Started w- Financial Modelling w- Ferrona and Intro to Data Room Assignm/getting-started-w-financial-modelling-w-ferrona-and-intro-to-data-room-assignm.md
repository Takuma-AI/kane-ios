### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Techstars San Francisco: What? Yes, putting your head in the sand. This is like a very common thing. Same reasons why people don't like to step on scale to look their way, because it makes them feel bad
- Techstars San Francisco: and you can revisit this regularly. You should be revisiting regularly, but getting the 1st step is the hardest, so make sure you have the right fiber for it. And so what I simply do is have a pen and paper or whiteboard
- Techstars San Francisco: And so the next step that you need to do is to make sure that these are also implemented in your.

### Key Insights

> "Techstars San Francisco: rationally, you should always want to have a complete data of your health information so you can take actions. And people don't do that. They get scared going to the doctor. Same thing here in finances. And it isn't. It's not only for startup financing. This is also personal finances as well. If I spend a thousand dollars in shoes. I know I spent it, but I don't like to see it on my bank account. It's like it's a weird psychological thing. You might be experiencing it with your startup, especially because it's not like life or death. That's why I mentioned cash flow, because cash is at the end of the day"

> "Techstars San Francisco: That's why it's so important to build a model simple enough that you can really really manage it."

> "Techstars San Francisco: within, whenever I try to experiment with a more complex model"

> "Techstars San Francisco: That's why I had always done cold call for this for last month I did 30 cold calls. I got 15 and 15, which I'm interested that I close to."

> "Techstars San Francisco: and when January actually comes, you write down what? How many actually get? Let's say I get only 2. And so, February, when February comes, what? How many actually got? 3. So this is so that I can always see you know"
