## Core Concepts

Based on the workshop content, founders will learn:


### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Jake Gutstein: I I, Neil Neil, is actually my college professor. So I had a good understanding, a good understanding, not like a great understanding, but a good understanding of like the jobs process and understanding latent demand in market. So like, if your product isn't there, how are people buying? How are they behaving
- Antoine: And I'm kind of thinking, should we? Kind of, okay, let's carve out. Let's decrease. So, for example, we had a number of pitch. We want to to do meetings. We want to to take, etc. Should you just take a step back? What would you do if you were us? And I, you know, don't worry. You won't commit us to it.
- Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I have. I have customers, and I I kinda know I have my own process for how I'm gonna do it, and like they're asking me to do a lot of extra interviews, and I don't really have time or space to do it, so maybe I'll have an intern do it, or something like that. So that's the kind of thing that comes up right now. So I thought I would just flag that and tee it up for you.

### Key Insights

> "Jake Gutstein: I think it's really important to recognize that you guys are one of, is it 12?"

> "Jake Gutstein: best analogy that I heard, and Neil kind of reminded me of the he had never heard this story, I guess, until last night. Did Mert remember this or no?"

> "Jake Gutstein: And so making sure that you're doing the right work, you're you're showing up and focusing on the right. Things are critical."

> "Jake Gutstein: optimize like it's optimized it positions you for success moving forward. So they've done the heavy lifting there. And so it's just important. If you're showing up. And you haven't done that or you're not present, you're checking email during these times. All of that like, you are only going to ultimately do yourself a disservice."

> "Jake Gutstein: like, this is just the fundamental way that my team operates is we show up on time. We value each other's time like we respect it. I don't know how many people are in this room. What is it? 22. But like there are 22 people. So if you show up a minute late. That is 22 min of wasted time collectively, and like recognizing and operating that way the fact that, like I'm not doing this for my own time, but I'm doing it for other people's critical. So show up on time, and then the other is upholding verbal commitments."
