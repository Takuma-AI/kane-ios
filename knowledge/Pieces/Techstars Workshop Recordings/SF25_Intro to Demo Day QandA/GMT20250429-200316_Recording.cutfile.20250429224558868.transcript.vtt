1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Do you want me to drive the deck, or how do you feel about.


2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:21.820
Chloe Lannert: I can pull it up. So before we get into the QA. Stuff, there are a few things we do want to hit first.st 1st off, Neil. I know you wanted to talk a little bit about leadership and how we're approaching it. So.


3
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.


4
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:46.670
Chloe Lannert: We had Jake come in again and and talk through how we how he approaches his business as a product, but it feels like there's a good. There's a solid gap between where he is now and where you guys are, and we have some resources we want to share to to help bridge that gap a little bit, and how to start thinking about implementation in the shorter term some sort of little stepping stones.


5
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.839
Chloe Lannert: So 1st off, I'm gonna I'm gonna post this later. We've got our


6
00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:05.749
Chloe Lannert: this little Harvard business school situation leadership that gets results. It's a quick little 16 page read and its foundation is in.


7
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:14.819
Chloe Lannert: It's got some details on like emotional intelligence how to communicate with people. But the foundation here is the 6 styles of leadership.


8
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.569
Chloe Lannert: Which you can see right here is this


9
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.240
Chloe Lannert: big enough, or we need to zoom right.


10
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:37.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I can. I can. I have a visual that might be helpful here. And then you can post this as a reference. I'll take. I'll take over. Yeah, here we go. I just think this is helpful, like I just noticed from conversations I've been having with some of you. It's worth kind of just very briefly sharing this.


11
00:01:38.262 --> 00:01:39.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Each of you


12
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:52.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like probably are reading the top lines of these right? Look at these leadership styles. This is deeply research. You know. I've known about this for a long time. Lots of complex organizations. Some of you may already be familiar with this research from Daniel Goldman.


13
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But the leadership styles are, hey, Trina, can you go on mute?


14
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, so the leadership styles are coercive, authoritative, affiliative, democratic pace setting and coaching.


15
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now, naturally, when you see these, it's kind of like almost like a horoscope


16
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:13.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: seeing your lot. Your mind you're like, Oh, I'm I'm this.


17
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But to be honest, you're all of these, all of you are all of these.


18
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and the real thing is, gonna be which one do. I need to be right now in this moment.


19
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So in any given point in your company, or you're in a meeting, or you're having a strategy session, or you're interacting with one of us. You're in your investor calls. Whatever it is, you have to decide like alright.


20
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Which of these leadership styles am I going to activate in this moment. And for what reason?


21
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:52.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I just wanted you all to know that these exist, that if you didn't already understand, like these different, you know attributes of yourself that now's the time to dig in.


22
00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:06.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you ever need support or coaching on how to activate a version of this leadership style for a particular situation or circumstance. This is one of the things that I have a skill set in, and can support a lot of founders to kind of grow and nurture


23
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and there's 2 out of the 6 that you see here that are


24
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: potentially effective in the short term.


25
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But could be downsides if extended usage is applied.


26
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Can anyone tell me what you think? The 2 out of these 6 are the ones that are


27
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: potentially valuable? And then in the short term, but have immense downsizing trade offs if you activate them for too long.


28
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.870
Alex's iPhone: Coercive, the coercive, one.


29
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's 1 of them.


30
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.540
Anthony De Silva: A setting.


31
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Case settings actually cool. It's authoritative.


32
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.220
Anthony De Silva: Authority.


33
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.


34
00:03:49.420 --> 00:04:07.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so but yeah, pace setting actually, is an interesting call out because pace setting could actually demonstrate the same thing if it becomes problematic. So yeah, you're you're actually right. So between pace setting coercive. And I would argue authoritative. Those are the styles that can sometimes come off


35
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: overly aggressive or even negative, depending on how you apply them, and to whom.


36
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So


37
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: just keep this in mind. Guys talk to me about it. But like, it's some of the soft skills stuff here. But I think this is


38
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this is becoming more and more important, as I observe, kind of where everyone's at in the class and the program, and with your teams


39
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: any questions on this before I let it go.


40
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.030
Chloe Lannert: Quick double tap. I know a lot of you have hiring on the radar.


41
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.019
Chloe Lannert: This is another reason why we're


42
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.719
Chloe Lannert: we're pushing this now, or you've already brought on new team members


43
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.710
Chloe Lannert: just thinking a little bit more critically about this will save a lot of pain.


44
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.570
Meg Hall: So, Neil, how do you use that when you're thinking about leading your team? How does that come into play?


45
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:06.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, so it. It's all circumstantial, Nick. So I think at a high level. I learned


46
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:25.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: who I was, and there's like versions of me that I think I am right. I think I'm a leader, and this is how I talk. This is how I communicate. This is my style and people. You all probably have thoughts on my approach and conversation already, and how I've interacted with each of you. But just know that each of both styles. I hire to do a job for me, depending on what leadership situation I'm in.


47
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So sometimes, like.


48
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:37.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, if I'm talking to Chloe about things that I want her to be better about or work on together on the tech stars team. I tend to veer towards affiliative


49
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? So like she and I are kind of working together on a lot of stuff. We're talking through things together as a unit.


50
00:05:43.690 --> 00:06:07.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There are other Mds that have different styles in their programs. And there's a huge gap in their connection to their program team or their program manager, and their job is exclusively to run the operations. And Mds job is exclusively to help the companies. Those job isn't to talk to you all about your business problems. Our job is to, you know, focus on running the ships on time, and then my job is to answer every single business question you have find the right people to answer it.


51
00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:13.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's a different choice. It's not negative, or, you know, positive. It's just a matter of style.


52
00:06:13.997 --> 00:06:16.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So yeah, I guess in another example, Meg.


53
00:06:17.726 --> 00:06:21.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: from my previous company. I did have some


54
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:28.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: course of tendencies in the past, like when I was in my early twenties, and I had my 1st startup that I told you about after school


55
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I was.


56
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:49.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I was not the kind of person that I am proud that I am. Now. You know what I mean. Like. Back. Then I was very aggressive and like, if people didn't do their job, I would get pissed off. And I would basically say, like, Let me do it better than I'll do the job for you like you don't need to be here like that kind of stuff that doesn't work in the long term at all, and that's an easy way to run people out the link and not be on your team and not being


57
00:06:49.890 --> 00:07:07.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so, and you also have to make trade-offs and concessions, sometimes of work that if done, 100 would be really great. But if done 80%, it's probably good enough. And you need to be okay, giving that work to someone else to do, even if you know you're the best person in the world to do it. You got to be willing to trust somebody to do almost as good of a job as you to do


58
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:29.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so. There's a there's a demo, you know, democratic like kind of style there, too, in a coaching style. So, anyway, just choose which areas that you need to grow in and invest in. But just know that it's not. I am this, and that's all I am. If you're a CEO, or founder or co-founder, you are eclectic. You are multifaceted, and you have to activate different roles at different times.


59
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's thank you for asking like that.


60
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:44.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool. Okay, I think they got the message. The last thing and by the way, Meg, our conversation earlier inspired


61
00:07:44.920 --> 00:08:01.079
Neal Sáles-Griffin: me even talking about this. Yeah. Well, the last thing I wanted to share about it was actually the recommendation I made to you earlier today. So now, around this time and program is when I recommend another book to people who think they need it. And that book is called the Great CEO. With him.


62
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Has anyone read it by any chance? Has anyone heard of it?


63
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The great CEO of them? No.


64
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.129
Alex's iPhone: I have started reading it.


65
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay. Yeah. Cause. Alex.


66
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.559
Alex's iPhone: Upon your recommendation. Yeah.


67
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.


68
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.890
Alex's iPhone: Let me open!


69
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.100
Chloe Lannert: I'll drop the.


70
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So.


71
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:26.836
Chloe Lannert: Doc Link in docs and files. It's pretty foundational to a a lot of folks got really interested in like the org charts and documentation. Alex. I know you mentioned how


72
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:33.849
Chloe Lannert: Jake organizes his business and his team. A lot of that is inspired by and adapted from the great CEO within.


73
00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.440
Chloe Lannert: So it's a long read, very tactical and.


74
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.419
Alex's iPhone: But also like sorry, sorry.


75
00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.239
Chloe Lannert: No no go.


76
00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:55.059
Alex's iPhone: No, there are lots of great resources that he mentioned that I've already touched upon, but that, you know, reinforces like what some of the things that I've been doing like. They're getting things done framework


77
00:08:55.653 --> 00:09:05.369
Alex's iPhone: or stuff like that. It's it's very tactical. But I mean the I've read the 1st 5 50 pages, and it's already like very, very


78
00:09:05.549 --> 00:09:09.219
Alex's iPhone: like concrete, I would say, which is very awesome.


79
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.700
Chloe Lannert: See.


80
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I will give a couple of caveats to the book in the very 1st few pages.


81
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The author who's the Kellogg guy


82
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:26.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in the family. But he says, don't read this book. If you haven't already reached 1 million in revenue, or have 10 employees.


83
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so to be clear.


84
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:40.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's a fair point, because some of the things that are suggested in the book are more relevant. If you're at a later stage of progress and traction and like size.


85
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:52.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: However, I still recommend that all of you, as my tech star strangers view it because it's showing you what you're about to become. It's demonstrating hopefully what you're about to face coming out of my program.


86
00:09:52.640 --> 00:10:11.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So because of that I highly recommend you, take it seriously, and you start to put the foundations of some of the systems that are recommended into your business problems, how you run your meetings, how you hold people accountable, how you communicate, how you think of yourself as the leader of the business, and take responsibility and ownership of it, and the decisions that get made.


87
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All of those things are super important right now for many of you.


88
00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:21.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And you might be able to like hopefully. It's a conversation starter between me and each of you, with how you think about how you want to run your business?


89
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right, I said. My piece.


90
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:33.730
Chloe Lannert: Next thing down the line. Bob's coming tomorrow very.


91
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You guys ready to meet Bob's?


92
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, okay, I'm gonna talk about what it means to be ready to meet Doc.


93
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because I think some of you are absolutely ready to meet him, and I think some of you


94
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: may or may not be relevant, depending on what you do in the next 24 h.


95
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm gonna talk through my expectations for the yeah, there we go. Oh's got it!


96
00:10:55.886 --> 00:11:02.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So what I'm gonna have those of you who we deem ready to do? Not. Everyone's probably ready to do this.


97
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But if you are ready, you're gonna be able to speak to Bob. If you're not ready. You're gonna observe and be a part of the conversation. But


98
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you're


99
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you're not in a position to talk to them about the work yet, because we haven't finished the work.


100
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So


101
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:23.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if you have actually completed your jobs to be done interviews, I want you to share your one line of your business, and what traction you have with your business.


102
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:33.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Then I want you to share what you wanted to learn from doing jobs, what screening criteria you used, and how many interviews you completed with that specific screening criteria.


103
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:44.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now, I'm gonna repeat that. How many interviews you completed with that specific screen criteria. And the reason, I'm saying, because I know a lot of you have talked to people that you think might be helpful to learn


104
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:56.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if they don't fit your screening criteria. You're not doing the jobs process. And I want to stay in alignment with everything that we've talked about, everything that he's written in his book and everything that we've learned so far.


105
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The feedback I get from Bob


106
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is like some people just are not work or not ready


107
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for his help, because we're talking past each other because you don't have the information


108
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: required, then to actually weigh in and engaging meaningfully in the conversation about your business and the jobs to be done.


109
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:22.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it's okay if you're not there yet. I know some of you have other things going on, and other priorities that you focused on, but if you don't have these things, I'm not gonna call you up there.


110
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we're going to need you to see this from you


111
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and to make sure you have it, and then I will call you up


112
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to talk to Bob about your company.


113
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then, lastly, whatever 3 to 5 jobs you came out with either during why, before the why or since


114
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: since I was like 3 weeks ago or so.


115
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So any questions about this, and being ready for Bob.


116
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:51.479
Meg Hall: What format do you want? Do you want for us to reply to this message board with that that content? Or do you want? Yeah.


117
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, yeah, exactly.


118
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:53.230
Meg Hall: Okay.


119
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We'll have a thread.


120
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:55.260
Meg Hall: Okay.


121
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.740
Chloe Lannert: Any questions on a high level.


122
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.130
Chloe Lannert: Everyone's ready.


123
00:13:05.421 --> 00:13:09.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And and this should go without saying. But make sure you've read his book.


124
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know all of you have read the book.


125
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but if you haven't read the books.


126
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:20.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: please don't embarrass me by talking about or asking a question about something that he's gonna go. Well, that's in the book


127
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you can expand on things that he talks about. So


128
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:33.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: let's not do that. He basically like, just so, you know, like Bob actually told me to disinvite people who had read it. He's like, if they haven't read the book, they shouldn't even come.


129
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:46.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's the level of conversation he and I are at with respect to who gets invited to these time like conversations with him, because he literally declines these types of sessions for any and all other accelerator programs or text programs. He's doing this as a favorite.


130
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He's got much more important and better things to do with the sign for the most part.


131
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I want us all to show up properly, and and you know, treat him with the the graciousness and reverence that it come in


132
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright. I think they got it.


133
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.880
Chloe Lannert: Some.


134
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:12.740
Chloe Lannert: Alright. This session is gonna be super intense. Y'all we have 5 whole slides for you. So buckle in.


135
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So we talked about this a little bit.


136
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But oh, yeah, Anton, we're gonna put everything that we just shared with you in base camp. So no worries there.


137
00:14:26.355 --> 00:14:38.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So before we get into the exercise, because we have a little exercise plan for you, we want to demonstrate a few examples as well. I'm curious to get you. All's recollection of us introducing Demo Day last week.


138
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Why can you recall? Are we doing a Q. And a format.


139
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:44.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Open question.


140
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.040
Andrew Fernandes: They already have the shared foundation of the book.


141
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.370
Andrew Fernandes: and we put this in practice.


142
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What do you mean?


143
00:14:58.690 --> 00:14:59.949
Ankur Toshniwal: I think this is about demo day.


144
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:00.910
Meg Hall: Yeah.


145
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.670
Andrew Fernandes: Oh, sorry!


146
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's okay.


147
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:05.800
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.


148
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:27.230
Meg Hall: It was gonna be to kind of answer some of the questions that the people have in the audience have, and then also kind of prove that you're worth talking to rather than it just being self promotional. And a lot of people can like win a regular pitch. But it's not necessarily mean that they have a great business. So this way, it's more of like a conversational format. That proves that you actually know your stuff.


149
00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:34.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, and so there's a little more. I'm looking forward. But, Meg, you nailed like 80% of it right there.


150
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:49.899
Alex Nativelle: I think it's also you said it was more interactive for the crowd to be attracted right like to keep the audience engaged. It's way, easier to have a discussion between 2 people like a podcast type of thing. So I don't know rather than just someone monologuing for 6 min.


151
00:15:51.040 --> 00:16:00.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Exactly right. Yeah. It's basically, I think that the early state days of demo days were. It was very effective to have the sage on stage, and the very powerful pitch


152
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:07.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's gotten played out because it's been overused and done so often. So much having more variety is more effective. For sure


153
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there's 1 other thing I'm looking at, Esmile.


154
00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:18.179
Esmaeil Sadeghi: One quick question, does the audience know that this is kind of like artificial Q&A, or it just they don't know. Okay.


155
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:25.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They don't. They don't believe it. They don't even believe it. That's the thing. So like, just like we knew, I saw the videos of the founders for Demo Day.


156
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:35.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like I could probably tell them that it's scripted. But then, when they watch you up there, they're not going to believe it is because they're gonna feel like you were having just a conversation with your eir on stage.


157
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it feels real. Even if in your mind you'd know every single word. The script is.


158
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.700
Esmaeil Sadeghi: That's the.


159
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's 1 other thing


160
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:53.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm I'm I'm looking forward. I don't know if anybody feels like there's anything missing about the purpose of this format. But there is one glaring details


161
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: openly. Here.


162
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Go ahead, Anthony.


163
00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:29.199
Anthony De Silva: No, no, I think that's for the the I was thinking, just having this like for us to reuse. But that was, I think that was for the product video.


164
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sure, sure, close enough. Alright! I'll give it to you. So this is. This is getting rid of your 1st meeting


165
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:41.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with your stakeholder, with your investor with whoever. So the whole idea here is that a lot of you go into one meeting.


166
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and you don't get invited for the second one.


167
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because there are things that they are already


168
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: preconceiving about you, or they're projecting onto your business or your model, or you.


169
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That is mitigating your chances of having a conversation.


170
00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:21.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the whole purpose here is to embrace the hardest hitting stuff that could rule out a person having a desire to speak to you, for whatever reason. Oh, Brio, your ed tech, or Oh, you know, Vivian, you know the auto industry doesn't seem like it's going to be that, you know satiate, or you know, big enough of a market for us or you know, whatever issue they're gonna have with whatever they perceive on paper or on the surface of your business model.


171
00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're gonna take those head on. And we're gonna talk about those tough questions today.


172
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:31.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I really really want to emphasize that, because I think sometimes you can lose the plot


173
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:42.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and focus more on performance, and like wanting to look the best as opposed to embracing the most difficult and challenging aspects of your business that you can control the narrative around if you decide to seize this moment.


174
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that is the real purpose, and where the energy came from for this format for me, and why I came up with it.


175
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:56.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it for the ones who take that seriously, it does wonders for them cool.


176
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So again we talked about the importance of the Question Bank.


177
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm not gonna repeat it. I've already said it enough, but just know that


178
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:18.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you should have that the ready, because that's all we're here to talk about, or what key questions that you think are going to be important to call out. And we're gonna actually do a little bit of an exercise to have you guys.


179
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, answer some of them in real time.


180
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:26.190
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, the reason we keep hitting this is because it takes


181
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:31.209
Chloe Lannert: half, if not more, of the work, out of putting together this portion of the pitch.


182
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:41.642
Chloe Lannert: If you know what the real questions are, what questions you actually keep receiving first, st like as the 1st question after your pitch like it, it changes the game.


183
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:49.018
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if you go back one more, Chloe, because I think what we can do if you'd like is


184
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:54.621
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we can come back to this after we demo a few of the


185
00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:02.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Q. And A's for them to see, and I think that'll help prime the pump a bit for the exercise that we'll do when we have to write them down.


186
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:10.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So Chloe and I had a chat before this call, and we picked 3 founders


187
00:20:10.488 --> 00:20:28.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Q. A's that we thought would be the most welcome to share one. We're gonna show you the whole pitch, for the other 2 will probably jump just to the QA. But I'd like to talk to you all about them and get your feedback and thoughts on what you think was effective about it. What was ineffective and draw any inspiration that could help you all with how you want to design your QA.


188
00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:31.750
Chloe Lannert: Okay.


189
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We can start with Ally, I think, cause that'll be the full pitch.


190
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:41.860
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, this 1st one might be weird. You're gonna have to to tell me if it doesn't work


191
00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.889
Chloe Lannert: in this display.


192
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.530
Chloe Lannert: Does this.


193
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It works.


194
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.235
Chloe Lannert: Audio.


195
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think the audio is messed up.


196
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.190
Chloe Lannert: Audio's messed up.


197
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think you need to share the audio.


198
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.210
Chloe Lannert: Great.


199
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:30.479
Chloe Lannert: All right in the eighties. My dad sold half a million cans of baked beans.


200
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.580
Chloe Lannert: It was a gag gift called Jacuzzi in a can.


201
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:40.399
Chloe Lannert: That's a fart joke, yeah. And it even made it on to the Johnny Carson show.


202
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.449
Chloe Lannert: So when he died in a plane crash a year ago.


203
00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:53.679
Chloe Lannert: I wasn't surprised how many people told me they wanted to live with the level of joy and generosity as he had.


204
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.159
Chloe Lannert: Death is a rare moment when we step back and reflect


205
00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.049
Chloe Lannert: on how we want to live.


206
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:12.110
Chloe Lannert: I'm Ali Briggs, Carvalho, CEO of Lifeweb, 360, where we help communities honor a loved one that has passed away by sharing memories and make meaning in their own lives. In the process.


207
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.979
Chloe Lannert: We do that with a community engagement platform where people can share stories, photos and videos.


208
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:36.129
Chloe Lannert: When someone dies, the family's in shock and everyone else is feeling awkward, but wants to do something. So at lifeweb, we're connecting the real life communities that the person was a part of. So everyone can acknowledge how that person impacted their life and learn about them from different perspectives


209
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.160
Chloe Lannert: on my dad's life web. I learned just how many people he made laugh


210
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.850
Chloe Lannert: and how many more he inspired.


211
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.769
Chloe Lannert: So, however much time we get.


212
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.549
Chloe Lannert: let's live the hell out of it like my dad did.


213
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.990
Chloe Lannert: Whoa!


214
00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.429
Chloe Lannert: He seized the moment every moment he had.


215
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.429
Chloe Lannert: and I'll always remember the ways he taught me to let go


216
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:12.989
Chloe Lannert: with lifelove 360. Anyone could create a tribute page to honor someone that has passed away and spread the word to the communities they were a part of, like their high school.


217
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:20.830
Chloe Lannert: their church, or their fraternity, and gather memories from everyone who knew them and ways.


218
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.619
Chloe Lannert: That's why we start with organizations.


219
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:44.020
Chloe Lannert: we're creating an interconnected network through these real life communities, beginning with fraternities, sororities, universities, and private schools, where we're already reaching 775,000 fraternity members. And that's just 5%.


220
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.620
Chloe Lannert: So we can remember


221
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.650
Chloe Lannert: 1, 2.


222
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:09.809
Chloe Lannert: It might got you dead. Mike. Get it?


223
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:10.639
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.


224
00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:20.760
Chloe Lannert: all right, let's put up a tribute page for that microphone. All right.


225
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:30.409
Chloe Lannert: I get to talk to the most bubbly, colorful person about death. But I want to ask you first.st Obviously, this is a product more about life.


226
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:35.330
Chloe Lannert: Who's this for? Who's paying for it? Talk to me about who your initial customers are?


227
00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:51.310
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So membership-based organizations pay us an annual subscription for a branded website with lifeweb tribute pages for all their members that have passed away, and the reason that they do that is, for alumni or member engagement, and also for fundraising.


228
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.750
Chloe Lannert: Talk to me about that. Why, engagement and fundraising? And and


229
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.190
Chloe Lannert: how does that relate to the celebration of life.


230
00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:16.649
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. So if you think about most membership based organizations like a church or a fraternity, they're nonprofits. And so the whole goal of a nonprofit is to self-perpetuate. But if there's not a strong community, there's no donors, and the whole thing collapses, and a couple things happen when a member of that community


231
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:34.890
Chloe Lannert: dies. So first, st people are going to start reflecting on why they were a member of that organization in the 1st place, and they're also going to reflect on their own legacy and how they'll be remembered. So it becomes this really organic opportunity for the nonprofit to introduce planned giving, which is, when you write them into your will


232
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:58.420
Chloe Lannert: almost a reflection point of the impact the organization had on me. Because I'm having to remember all these memories absolutely so me as an individual end user. Is there a fee for me, or is it coming from the organization totally free for the end? Users for anybody that's coming to the page to share or view memories got it. And I don't want to alarm anyone in the room. But we're all going to die.


233
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.929
Chloe Lannert: So your market is basically 100% of the wow, that's


234
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:12.419
Chloe Lannert: that's really big. So since everyone's going to die, who are you focused on 1st


235
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:26.469
Chloe Lannert: great questions, too. So we're focused on sororities and fraternities first.st And, by the way, when I say we, I'm talking about my co-founder, Rochelle, somewhere in here


236
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:50.760
Chloe Lannert: my co-founder, Rochelle and I met in business school at Kellogg. And now we're up to a full-time team of 5, and we partnered with a bunch of different types of organizations trying to find our beachhead fraternities, had a few things going for them. First.st They already have formal systems in place to track. When one of their members has passed away and share that out with the community. So usually an In Memoriam section in their alumni magazine. And we're essentially digitizing that.


237
00:26:50.830 --> 00:27:16.429
Chloe Lannert: And then they're a really phenomenal aggregator. So one of our partners, Lambda Chi, they have over 300,000 members, and the affinity between those members is really strong. That's sort of the whole point of brotherhood. And the Kicker fraternities have a relatively short sales cycle. Yeah, that's always good, you know. Are there more communities you're trying to reach. Obviously, this is just the beginning. But where do you see the expansion?


238
00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:40.019
Chloe Lannert: Any community-based organization anywhere in the world we can help. So we're aiming to lock up the fraternity and sorority market, you know. Besides Lambda Chi, we're already working with Sigma Alpha Mu. So that's Sammy Deke and Alpha Phi omega. And we're actually on track to have 10% of men's fraternities as customers by the end of the month. Wow! Yeah, congratulations.


239
00:27:40.360 --> 00:28:08.310
Chloe Lannert: Thank you. Coming to an alumni magazine near you, and what we think is really neat about starting with fraternities. Is it positions us really well to go after colleges next, because if you were a member of a fraternity, it means that you went to college. And so we're already starting with a large number of life webs honoring college alumni, and then also going after private high schools. So we already have 3 partners there, including Stuyvesant High School in New York City. Got it.


240
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:33.199
Chloe Lannert: So as I just think of my own life. And if I were to die and hopefully, not anytime soon, you're looking at multiple organizations that I've been a part of? Is there an individual life web or tribute page for me in each of these orgs, or are they interconnected in some way? So there would just be one life web tribute page honoring you where everyone would share memories. But there would be multiple entry points to Stu's life web


241
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:50.839
Chloe Lannert: from the different communities that you are a part of. So that could be your faith group, your employer, union or professional association. All of these types of organizations are on our go-to-market roadmap as well. And what's pretty neat is if somebody from your high school passes away.


242
00:28:50.850 --> 00:29:09.949
Chloe Lannert: You're looking at their life web learning about what they were like later in life, you can really see what they were like in another context, like, Wow, that guy really really grew up and matured. That's what they'll say about me. Possibly, you know. Obviously, there's a lot of inherent virality when you start linking together these organizations.


243
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:31.939
Chloe Lannert: How are you guys thinking about that. And taking advantage of that, there's a ton of virality here. So each partner really strengthens this interconnected network that we're building makes it easier to acquire the next partner, and the partners are essentially paying us to market lifeweb services to their hundreds of thousands of members that inevitably will lose a loved one and hopefully use life web to honor them.


244
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:38.609
Chloe Lannert: as if the celebration of life of every person on the planet wasn't enough. What is the big vision for you.


245
00:29:38.740 --> 00:30:01.610
Chloe Lannert: so it's entirely about the living. Let's say that a friend of mine dies. If I didn't tell them that they were important to me, I'm going to wish that I had. And so I'm going to call up my other friends. I'm going to call my mom, and I'm going to tell them I love them. Death has this ripple effect of acknowledgement, and in that way I like to think about lifeweb as the inverse of social media. So social media is my life told by me?


246
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:24.859
Chloe Lannert: Lifeweb? Is my life told by others? It's all about acknowledgement and connection, and you know we're in the middle of a loneliness epidemic. One in 2 Americans has reported feeling lonely, and if I do my job correctly, lifeweb helps. People feel reconnected to the communities that are already a part of them helps them feel part of something bigger than themselves, and helps them realize that


247
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.170
Chloe Lannert: surprise.


248
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:38.570
Chloe Lannert: They're going to die one day, so they should stop scrolling and make the most of their time on earth with the people that they love. Lifeweb is all about life, and helping people live with more joy and intention and connection.


249
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.200
Chloe Lannert: and death is just the side door that gets us there.


250
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:47.680
Chloe Lannert: I love that I love especially what you said about the inverse of social media. I think telling each other stories is really powerful.


251
00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:54.889
Chloe Lannert: as we're all gathered today for a little bit of a celebration of life. How can we help?


252
00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:11.349
Chloe Lannert: So I would like to ask everybody here to just reflect on the organizations that are really important to you, the ones that you really identify with. And you know, if you want to help those organizations thrive, refer them to us so that we can help them strengthen their community of supporters.


253
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:29.169
Chloe Lannert: So if you have an organization in mind, especially if it's a private high school, please drop us your email at the QR. Code here, and I'll send you more information, and as an added bonus I will send you the clip of Jacuzzi in a can on the Johnny Carson, show cool beans.


254
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So she also, yeah.


255
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.000
Alex Nativelle: Was the mic thing planned.


256
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.680
Alex Nativelle: No, that's crazy.


257
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That was totally on the fly.


258
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's crazy.


259
00:31:47.350 --> 00:32:02.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you all know. Logistically speaking, it was me who handed them the extra mic, because I sit right in the front of Demo day, so I'm right there in front of you. If anything goes wrong, I've got a bottle of water. I've got a microphone, and I know some of your lines I'm ready to like kind of assist you, if need be.


260
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:11.829
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, you can also stare into a soul front and center if you need. If you don't want to look at anyone else, stare at Neil. He's there for you.


261
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Prefer that you didn't, but you certainly can.


262
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:24.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So any any feedback thoughts, reflections on what you saw just now. What did you like?


263
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What what was resonating did inspire you at all. Any questions about it.


264
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:38.209
Andrew Fernandes: I thought the narrative was very strong. Making it relatable and making people her intended audience feel what she's


265
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.390
Andrew Fernandes: selling


266
00:32:39.842 --> 00:32:46.400
Andrew Fernandes: in her case, which is theoretically everyone and I think any, almost anyone, could connect with what she was saying.


267
00:32:47.135 --> 00:32:49.930
Andrew Fernandes: And she was very clear in


268
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:55.520
Andrew Fernandes: describing their go to market strategy and rationale behind it. Why, they're going after fraternities.


269
00:32:56.251 --> 00:33:04.080
Andrew Fernandes: Question I have would be, are the will the questions be that easy? Because at least to me the questions seemed like layups. In this case.


270
00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:16.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, it was definitely more of an emotional fish. And that was actually the same feedback I had, Andrew, just like we weren't being tough enough business. In my opinion. So that's a good example of that. A little bit of a softball cream puffs we call them


271
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.811
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for any baseball fans out there. But


272
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What I will say is


273
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:27.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because she leaned in so deeply to the emotional part what she was doing strategically


274
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:53.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in the QA relative to the pitch itself, was making sure that there was a sturdiness to the business model itself. So she was talking about like it was a B, 2 B, right? It's not like it's it almost felt like A B to C company like this is about people's lives or whatever. But no, she's actually selling to institutions and universities, and well established and well funded like potential customers. So that was the big hurdle she wanted to overcome. So that was how we designed her. QA.


275
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Steve was actually one of the few founders in that for that pitch


276
00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:02.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that have somebody write her a check at demo there.


277
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:08.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So she actually got an investment on the spot after that. And I think it was because of the emotional


278
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:17.814
Neal Sáles-Griffin: component of the story. There were, you know, obviously, investors are emotional themselves. And this is a very relatable type of problem. And the only other Easter egg I'll share about this is


279
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:29.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I actually rejected Ali from techstars for my very 1st program 3 years prior to that demo that you saw. He applied to my very 1st program with that business, and I I said no.


280
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:35.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and one of the people who was a part of my screening committee at the time was Bob Mesto.


281
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:41.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So Bob was literally there with me, with Jason freed at 37 signals, where I had my 1st screening committee for techstars.


282
00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:50.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and he stuck around with them for those 3 years and helped them with their business, because right around that time it was 2019, or 2020.


283
00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's when Clay Christensen died.


284
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the very 1st life web ever made was actually the inventor of jobs to be done himself, plus.


285
00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:07.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's how Bob had this connection to Ali, and he coached her into getting into my program 3 years later. So it's a fun little lore story with the connection there.


286
00:35:09.045 --> 00:35:10.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But Antoine, sorry.


287
00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:24.699
antoinecarriere: There. There was no question about the the business model in the sense of the specifics of the business model. Are you revenue generating? What's your average


288
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:31.240
antoinecarriere: kind of like? Are you profitable? What's the?


289
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:36.109
antoinecarriere: And I I guess that's that was one of the the things that made it


290
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:42.029
antoinecarriere: sound global. I suspect it's kind of the idea is not to kind of


291
00:35:44.488 --> 00:35:57.339
antoinecarriere: kind of have us kind of fall into a trap. So I'm sure there's a good reason for that. But had I been had I been kind of interested in the business, that's something that I would have wanted to kind of


292
00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:03.099
antoinecarriere: dig further on. Was that come up to her afterwards and ask her those questions? Maybe.


293
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:03.890
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.


294
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:20.939
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the whole idea is you're teasing people to want to have the curiosity to get to know you better. The job or the Demo Day pitch isn't to cover the entirety of the business. It's to give you enough information to want to have a conversation with the right people afterwards. So it's a little bit of an art to figure out. What do I share versus? What do I tease out


295
00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:26.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: versus? What do I allude to to activate a deeper dive of a conversation afterwards.


296
00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:33.960
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. And within the like, squishy feel good. There were a few details that she hit on. Team of 5.


297
00:36:34.230 --> 00:37:00.489
Chloe Lannert: You don't get a team of 5. That's not people in a basement anymore. That's like you have employees. Now, once you hit that number, that's not just co-founders anymore. She had a bunch of like. She gave details about her largest customer of over 300,000 fraternity members like she. She didn't list her financials, but she gave enough that you could understand that there was something real, and then you can go talk to her about the exact metrics afterwards.


298
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:06.009
Chloe Lannert: But you almost didn't notice. You just got the vibe that it was working.


299
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:11.839
Chloe Lannert: Unless you're really paying attention for those specifics you just like understood that it was going in the right direction.


300
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:28.622
Alex Nativelle: Yeah. I thought that she did a very good job of the framing, of course, of like what she was saying related to a business, but I think related to a personality like the the


301
00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:56.929
Alex Nativelle: thing I got from her is that she's a very joyful person, and it feels that the pitch aligned very well with who she was right, how she dressed up, how she came up in the stage, how she appeared! I feel! That was. That's what I took from her thing like even the joke with the mic was really great, and she took it with a joke at the beginning joke at the end. Everything seems like the framing of her personality with her business seems very much aligned.


302
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.770
Alex Nativelle: which is one of the things that I really appreciated.


303
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:19.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Absolutely. The choice of her colored, colorful skirt was intentional, her humor the joke leading in, and also the the big gowner at the end of her initial pitch when she talks about how you know, when my dad died in a plane crash here, like all of that, was thought about, and like, actually very intentional. So I'm glad you noticed that, Alex.


304
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay.


305
00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:28.690
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, I thought the thought the cold open was really good choice.


306
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:46.811
Ankur Toshniwal: I was pretty surprised, like through the whole. In 1st part, I was really trying to figure out how this is a business, and I was pleasantly surprised by the way she structured it after that. But


307
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.970
Ankur Toshniwal: I guess it's just a personal take. I feel like I would I would. Almost


308
00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.340
Ankur Toshniwal: a a part of me was a little bit concerned that it was turning into like.


309
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:10.180
Ankur Toshniwal: you know, just like a pure emotional play. But then I was again surprised by that. But I was almost like a little bit scared like as she got towards the end of that part that I was like, oh, is this like


310
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:20.309
Ankur Toshniwal: what's about to happen? But she she did a really good job of kind of closing the gap almost to the point where I felt like the business was felt good enough to be able to talk about in the 1st part.


311
00:39:20.764 --> 00:39:26.859
Ankur Toshniwal: You know, and I almost wonder if there was like a transition there. But overall, I think the narrative made a lot of sense. The business


312
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.529
Ankur Toshniwal: I went to. I went to school as well. Yeah.


313
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:35.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, sorry to interrupt. I just want to be clear on the point you just made. Do you remember her? Ask at the end


314
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what was her? Ask her call to action?


315
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:42.410
Ankur Toshniwal: Don't!


316
00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:44.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Does anybody remember what the call to action was?


317
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.599
Meg Hall: To connect with people that have made an impact in your life.


318
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:49.080
Ankur Toshniwal: I see!


319
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.519
antoinecarriere: She? She actually asked, if you think about any organizations.


320
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.179
antoinecarriere: yeah, can you just get the mail.


321
00:39:55.180 --> 00:40:01.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That you care about. Exactly so. What she said was, Hey, by the way, think about what organizations you're a part of


322
00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:12.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right. So she got real referrals to customers in the room in that moment, because that was her goal. Her goal was not to get investment, and she ended up getting investment and customers.


323
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.640
Ankur Toshniwal: From that pitch.


324
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:31.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I I think that was so well done by her. As far as thinking about a call to action, she set up the emotional piece which you can connect to and relate to, because you think about your organizations that you're a part of. I know you're a part of a fraternity too long for right? So like you think about people in your fraternity who either has passed away or that are important to you.


325
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:40.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All of a sudden. You're thinking emotionally about these people. But then you hear the business evidence throughout the Q. And A, and then at the end, let me remind you, let's go back to you. The human.


326
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Please help me help other humans tell their stories


327
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:49.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and honor people's memories. I think that was pretty good. So okay, I didn't mean to interrupt you, though, so.


328
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.412
Ankur Toshniwal: No, it was. It was yeah, it was


329
00:40:53.090 --> 00:41:10.960
Ankur Toshniwal: yeah, it was. I thought it was. I thought it was really well done. Overall from like the the narrative pitch clarity and then again, surprising, really like cleverly constructed business around that entire thing which I was like, oh, wow, yeah, I just didn't expect it. That's that's really it. I was like.


330
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:20.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm grateful. Yeah, yeah, I'm glad you you identified that. And the other piece that I want all of you to think about is I'm gonna work with each of you individually on this, too, as I coach you for Demo Day


331
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:25.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is, you also need to be the kind of person that people can perceive to be a leader of this company.


332
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:46.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? Can you imagine, like, I can imagine Allie running this business like being the CEO of this company with her, her cadence, her humor, but her ability to very cogently speak about the business as well like. There's a combination of characteristics that are important to demonstrate in a moment like that that can get someone to believe that you're the right person to actually run this company.


333
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:51.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right, Antoine, last comment.


334
00:41:52.720 --> 00:42:01.060
antoinecarriere: Yeah. The the the thing that really struck me was to your point about the the ask that she made.


335
00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:09.190
antoinecarriere: and, more generally speaking the whole the whole the whole speech.


336
00:42:09.738 --> 00:42:27.430
antoinecarriere: It was very there's lots of places where I think it could have gone wrong. So, for example, the the last ask is very kind of it's it's very elaborate. Because it's like, Hey, think about the ones you prefer you. You like the most


337
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:37.630
antoinecarriere: kind of do them a favor. Send them to us. That's kind of the way she she she framed it like they. If you really care about them.


338
00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:56.649
antoinecarriere: Do kind of send them to us. That's it's it's also I mean the it it came across very well, but I could totally see how it would come across. Very, very salesy. And so the whole the I'm I'm very curious now to know how you guys


339
00:42:57.109 --> 00:43:25.750
antoinecarriere: kind of calibrated it. So it's really it kind of it goes smoothly to your point. The the QA. The beginning of the QA. Goes, gives her the opportunity to go into the details about the business that she hasn't really talked about before, etcetera. So it felt it felt like it was really really very well calibrated. And I I would say, you know, that worries me because I'm thinking like Whoa! How do we get that? Calibrated.


340
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It starts right now.


341
00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:31.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right. A smile. I'll give you the bone.


342
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:50.929
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Okay. So one question here, all this video we have watched so far, I think that was only Jake who had his like video. Basically in the beginning, and then it was the pitch afterwards. But the rest we see that there would be like 1 min pitch, and then the video comes next.


343
00:43:51.538 --> 00:44:03.199
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Just curious of what kind of like installation we need to. Of course, whatever comes first, st it would set the atmosphere and the context and everything. So how would you decide like which would be which one would be.


344
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:03.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cheers.


345
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.060
Esmaeil Sadeghi: To be.


346
00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:04.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.


347
00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:29.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah. Default default is pitch 1st and then video like in general. So if you're not sure, stick to that, and you'll be fine. There are a few rare cases where, when we see your pitch and we understand the sequence of what you're talking about, it might be appropriate for you to pull the video first, st to like, alleviate, or assuage any disconnections that people might have. What you're talking about.


348
00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:40.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? So optim, there's a real possibility. It might make sense for your video to go first.st I don't know yet. I want to see the whole picture and see what you think makes sense, and then we'll try it both ways and then decide together.


349
00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:44.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But you don't need to worry about it like you still need both. So.


350
00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:54.809
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Yeah, we are making scenarios now, like how it works. If you have like video first, st and then the patient comes to next. So there are, of course, different scenarios. I think we have to discuss the details later.


351
00:44:54.810 --> 00:45:05.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And Chloe. Chloe can pull some more pitches that are video first.st That can help you think about that like, I think, Halon, the battery boys. That's a good one Chloe. There's a couple of other ones that are more technical.


352
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:06.080
Chloe Lannert: Yep.


353
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:06.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hmm.


354
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:21.029
Chloe Lannert: So perform view as well. I think so. The companies that tend to go video 1st are either incredibly technical to the point that it's really hard to get an audience of non industry professionals up to speed on what you're doing without visuals


355
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:44.180
Chloe Lannert: and companies that are more creative. So one was like an artist like an a performance art sort of alternative educational streaming service. And they went with the visuals 1st to like create a really strong brand situation, but outside of that, the vast majority of you, it'll land better if you go pitch first, st


356
00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:48.320
Chloe Lannert: just so you can engage with the audience and then demonstrate


357
00:45:48.450 --> 00:46:00.929
Chloe Lannert: like, get people bought into you, then get them understanding the product. And then you get that breather in the middle before you go into the QA. It's helpful to have like that little minute to yourself to sort of context switch. So that's why the the pitch 1st tends to


358
00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:02.659
Chloe Lannert: be the more popular option.


359
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:14.519
Meg Hall: Can I ask really quickly about, like the timeline of like us making the videos and thinking through like the whole, like practicing our Q&A and stuff, just because I feel a little uneasy about like I just don't wanna drop a ball, you know.


360
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:19.836
Chloe Lannert: Totally. So next I believe it's next week. Let me check.


361
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:49.659
Chloe Lannert: Next week is when we're going to ask you to have a storyboard built out for your video, and we're going to go through that together and give feedback to each other. We're going to ask you for like a blow by blow if you're gonna have, like a voiceover, like a draft voiceover script, but like an understanding of what that video is going to be. So by the end of next week you're able to send it off to a contractor and get that moving and have that sort of out of your hands, because that tends to be. The thing that stresses people out gets closest to the deadline is hardest to edit.


362
00:46:49.790 --> 00:47:00.229
Chloe Lannert: so we'll be starting with that, and then pitch practices will start in earnest in week 10. But if you want to get


363
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:28.180
Chloe Lannert: iterations of the pitch going highly, encourage you guys to link up together in smaller groups to practice highly, encourage you to take videos of yourselves, to practice, drop it in a pitch, practice chain and basecamp, send it to the team. You should be from our last session. Be thinking about the general narrative across the 3 sections, and starting to to think about what that pitch is going to look like.


364
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And to be clear. I'm sorry, Matt. Go ahead. Sorry.


365
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:47.560
Meg Hall: Okay, from all the videos we've seen so far, none of them are like investor really facing videos, like, the videos, are almost more consumer facing right? Like we're not putting our revenue traction inside of it. We're not putting our market size. We're not putting anything like that.


366
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:52.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This was oriented to investors, because that's 1, for sure.


367
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:53.020
Meg Hall: Is it?


368
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.820
Meg Hall: Okay?


369
00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't know if you remember that one.


370
00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.780
Meg Hall: Seemed like it was.


371
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.750
Meg Hall: I remember it. But I don't like remember the details. Yeah.


372
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:04.819
Anthony De Silva: Burhan's 1 us to investors. I think, too.


373
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.089
Chloe Lannert: Burhan's was literally a demo of his product.


374
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:16.309
Chloe Lannert: It was literally just a conversation with his voice, AI recording with nothing on the screen. That's what he put up for his video. So


375
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.309
Chloe Lannert: there's a lot of ways you can do it. The main thing is, people do tend to spend a little bit of money on this.


376
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:26.710
Chloe Lannert: and we want it to have longevity beyond the metrics you have right now.


377
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:42.750
Chloe Lannert: and with the audience like, unless you're only trying to talk to investors, and you have a really good argument for why you need to fundraise now. It doesn't make a ton of sense, and also with the pitch and the Q. And A. You have a lot of chances to talk about your traction.


378
00:48:43.026 --> 00:48:57.139
Chloe Lannert: You don't have a lot of visual time to show people the product and get them to understand what interacting with it looks like. So we, it is a video, you can change the format. But we do call it a product video, because that tends to be what lands best.


379
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.099
Meg Hall: It's 1 min video.


380
00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:00.189
Chloe Lannert: 1 min. Video.


381
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:05.930
Meg Hall: That's so short. Okay, I mean, you did. You did it for the initial applications?


382
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:12.270
Meg Hall: Barely. I don't. I don't think I might. Only minute and a half, and I think I cut a lot out.


383
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:17.026
Meg Hall: Okay, sorry, Neil. I didn't mean to cut you off earlier. You can go ahead.


384
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, it's all good. I actually lost the thought. It's all good.


385
00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:23.519
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, I was.


386
00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:31.569
Ankur Toshniwal: Are there any examples of more than just one person, more than one founder being on the? Is there like a.


387
00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:32.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No.


388
00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:35.680
Ankur Toshniwal: Is there? So is that something that's like, you guys don't really don't advise.


389
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No times.


390
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.930
Ankur Toshniwal: Okay.


391
00:49:42.020 --> 00:50:07.010
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, you will see. A lot of people will sort of like point out, and the co-founder in the audience will stand up and sort of wave. If you want to spotlight them. We also will talk about this later down the line. But sometimes sometimes people like to do matching T-shirts to make it really visually obvious. Who's together when you're having conversations after the fact, like they're cute things you can do to make it clear who your team is, but just one on stage.


392
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And let's do, Alex.


393
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This might be the last one close, and then we can jump into the exercise.


394
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.730
Chloe Lannert: Sounds good.


395
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.880
Chloe Lannert: Well done, thanks, sir!


396
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:42.520
Chloe Lannert: Oh, pretty pumped for context. Alex. Was in our ebay class, and he was doing AI


397
00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:49.970
Chloe Lannert: performance for ads. So, understanding, like what ads worked, and giving suggestions on how to like, improve ad spend


398
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:56.180
Chloe Lannert: Dante set the standard, and you you met it so well done.


399
00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:19.569
Chloe Lannert: so really high level. I helped introduce you to a customer or 2, and it's because I felt the pain, and I saw that this was something that a lot of the companies that I was talking to were dealing with and tell us a little bit about your product roadmap and how that's evolving. Yeah. So as you just saw, our current product is AI insights to tell you exactly which text and visual elements perform best.


400
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:37.979
Chloe Lannert: 2024 roadmap is all about streamlining, creative and production processes. So basically helping marketers design their ads to do that, we're going to leverage fine-tuned generative AI models. Specifically, a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback. Basically, our users are helping to train our model and build our moat.


401
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:51.170
Chloe Lannert: You know, there's really a lot. There's there's a handful of big AI marketing companies out there. Jasper AI is one of them. They're a billion dollar company. So what Jasper did to automate blog posts is what we're going to do for ads


402
00:51:51.280 --> 00:52:13.870
Chloe Lannert: makes sense. Look, I've seen a ton of marketing tech companies out there, and it feels like these days, especially with AI. There's just more and more marketing tech companies popping out. Can you talk a little bit about how you differentiate from that crowd? For sure. Yeah, it's a crowded space. But we're unique for 3 reasons. So first, st our go to market strategy selling to agencies is unique.


403
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:22.859
Chloe Lannert: A lot of Sas has trouble selling to agencies. But I worked there for much of my career. So I really understand that target persona and how to sell to them.


404
00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.000
Chloe Lannert: Second.


405
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:36.360
Chloe Lannert: we have team market fit. So our go-to-market lead. Jj. Is here with us tonight. She worked in analytics at Warby Parker at segment during hyper growth. We also have an AI Ml. Engineer from Amazon.


406
00:52:36.420 --> 00:53:04.509
Chloe Lannert: And finally, the granularity of our insights is unique. So we go down to the text and visual component level. And so, for example, we'll say for a given advertiser, ads with green grass performed 30% better text with the words benefits and thoughtfully crafted perform 70% better, so that granularity is not only in high demand, but it's also hard to come by. Yeah, it makes sense, I mean, look you and I have been working now for a couple of weeks, and I've seen


407
00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:28.720
Chloe Lannert: the product evolve. I've seen your sales evolve. The thing that I've been most impressed by is actually your go to market right? In a very short period of time, you've been able to add customers and show that there is product market fit. Can you expand a little bit about your go to market strategy because I think it's pretty unique, absolutely. So we're deliberately selling to ad agencies to get data 10 x. Faster.


408
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:36.399
Chloe Lannert: So agencies have at least 10 to 30 clients of their own. And for each of those clients we're getting their data to train our model


409
00:53:36.400 --> 00:54:05.539
Chloe Lannert: for incremental revenue and to get more reps. So one of the other cool things about agencies is they're using our product and our insights for their own sales efforts. And so when they win a new client, they onboard them to purposely. We're getting incremental revenue because of our per brand pricing model. We've really been able to prove out this land and expand model. So, for example, we had an early customer at $300 a month. We've since expanded their contract value 8 x


410
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:17.769
Chloe Lannert: not bad. That's good. Nrr, for sure. So yeah, you've got a bunch of people here all supportive, I'm assuming. Tell us how we can help


411
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:41.769
Chloe Lannert: so surprise surprise. We're looking to talk to investors and customers on the investor front. We'd love to speak with pre-seed funds interested in b 2 b. AI, but specifically with ties to marketing and media. So we had a couple sales calls recently with business insider. We'd love to get intros to a few more kind of media publishers to really explore that segment. That'd be a great intro from an investor


412
00:54:41.880 --> 00:55:01.479
Chloe Lannert: on the customer prospect side. It's all about agencies. So agencies that work with Dtc brands, nonprofits. Really, any consumer brand that runs a lot of Facebook ads is relevant. And finally, just a quick, exciting update. Last month we signed our 1st annual contract. So nice.


413
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:24.620
Chloe Lannert: $30,000 contract. Not a bad size. That's that's great, especially in the market. You're targeting. So I feel like that's just proof point for exciting growth ahead. Absolutely. We're gaining momentum, would love to chat with anyone relevant. So investors, introductions and agency contacts. Well, Alex, thanks a lot man. Pretty tough.


414
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So, guys, I don't know if you notice. But Alex was nervous.


415
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:32.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It wasn't a perfect Q. And A. It wasn't a perfect pitch, either.


416
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:36.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but he stuck the landing, and he got an assist from the Eir.


417
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:45.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I showed you all that one, because I don't always need to show you all the ones that go perfectly. You should also see ones that are kind of like. Hmm, like, maybe this wasn't as solid, but


418
00:55:45.550 --> 00:56:08.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: also significant funding round in the past year. You all met him, I think, at the beginning of this program. His business is doing well. He's doing well. I thought it was a really cool example just to know that isn't the end all be all. And even still, what was important with his pitch to me was the fact that he had significant, substantial traction, and even though he bungled the final ask for a moment there, by not acknowledging the contract value of that annual deal.


419
00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:12.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The Eir was aware enough to remind him of that important detail, because they had practiced so much together.


420
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:14.700
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.


421
00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:15.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Which happens sometimes.


422
00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:24.859
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. I think Snow got an assist from Liliana, too, on some numbers. So your your people are up there to support you. Help you with.


423
00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:30.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the more you practice with your eir, the more well versed you're gonna be. So if there's ever a moment where you need help


424
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:35.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so like, keep something going. Or you know that kind of thing, because we've had moments where founders like


425
00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: literally in their head, they get so nervous on stage that their answer a different question.


426
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:53.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you hear them responding that like. And they're saying something that doesn't make sense. Given the question that was asked, and then the the ir like picks up on it, and like figures out how to dream maneuver things like that. So the more you practice the better off you'll be with like anything that could happen or go wrong.


427
00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:57.750
Chloe Lannert: Also in terms of the presentation. Where was he looking.


428
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.900
Ankur Toshniwal: At the Eir. Yeah.


429
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:12.520
Chloe Lannert: The entire time he did not look up, and did y'all notice like where Allie was looking.


430
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.700
Ankur Toshniwal: Audience, yeah.


431
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:25.519
Chloe Lannert: I, personally didn't, because she was like switching back and forth, and it felt organic like I wasn't paying attention to where she was looking because it felt natural. But I noticed that Alex was like


432
00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:51.240
Chloe Lannert: wired in on Imran the entire time. So just flagging like on the presentation aspect, we're going to work with you throughout this throughout the next couple of weeks. It's not just the memorization, but it's the body language during the pitch. It's making sure you are standing. Normally, we talk a lot about switching your attention between the Eir and the audience. It's going to be weird at first, st figuring out like which points you kind of want to redirect your attention, but


433
00:57:51.600 --> 00:58:00.900
Chloe Lannert: once it's practiced out, you'll understand like which points you want to emphasize to the audience. Make it feel like you're talking to them, and how to how to balance that out.


434
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:07.609
Andrew Fernandes: I have strong priors on this. But, what are some negative effects of body language can have that you see.


435
00:58:10.804 --> 00:58:24.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: People who end up moving around too much can be really distracting. You seem like you're not in control. You're nervous. It can take away from what you're saying, because then people stop listening to your words, and they're more focused on your movements and kind of


436
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:28.211
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the disconnect there that can happen


437
00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:34.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with. If someone seems like they're only focused on who they're talking to and not acknowledging the room or engaging the room


438
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:39.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that can also like Trigger, a little bit of like a signal that the founders like


439
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:44.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: too nervous to even include you in the conversation, even though you're supposed to be a part of it.


440
00:58:44.713 --> 00:58:55.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Not acknowledging the eir at all, and just speaking to the room as well, is another like trigger of that. That doesn't look right and doesn't feel right either. So those would be the main ones. Andrew.


441
00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:03.260
Chloe Lannert: The the other thing is like when the body language, aspect of it goes really well, you don't notice it.


442
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:19.289
Chloe Lannert: It feels really natural, and it feels organic, and it feels like it's a person talking to you versus someone who's on stage and giving a presentation and has been preparing and whatever. So it almost like breaks the 4th wall. In a way when someone's like overly nervous or like clearly.


443
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:27.110
Chloe Lannert: the little twitchy, whatever it reminds you that it reminds the audience that they're giving a presentation versus


444
00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:40.380
Chloe Lannert: almost like chatting with the audience. And it just it feels more organic. It's easier to approach someone afterwards, if they feel really natural on stage, I almost Neil, are you good if I show, like the 1st 15 seconds of Andrew's pitch, just because he.


445
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:45.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's let's hear Anthony's question, too. But yeah, I don't mind if if everyone's cool with it.


446
00:59:47.480 --> 01:00:01.439
Anthony De Silva: Yeah. So I think he had 2 asks from the audience, 1, 1 was for the investors, and then one for the customer. Any any thoughts on whether it should be just a like a single ask or.


447
01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:07.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think a single ass is more likely to get like resonance. However.


448
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:35.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think he handled it well, right, because we did go back and forth on that choice, and he said, Hey, I want to talk with precede investors. B, 2 B. AI specifically wanted to have media marketing connections so like the layers of specificity he layered, he put in. There, I think, are very important to do. If you just say I don't want precede investors like that's not very helpful. But if you show that there's a particular type that you want to talk to, it's really good. But then he also wanted to demonstrate that he's hungry for customers, and he's open for business and actively serving customers right now.


449
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:43.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So he he like kind of weaved it properly. It's it's gonna be a style choice on your part. If you want to do both.


450
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:46.000
Anthony De Silva: Gotcha.


451
01:00:48.600 --> 01:01:07.099
Ankur Toshniwal: before you jump into the next one. Chloe. One thing to one thing I noted. There's more just about the narrative, because, like the subs, a lot of stuff that you get like it makes sense. I think he was. He's ran. He rambled a bit, but he was still pretty clear, like I didn't feel like I didn't, was like missing the point. It was just like


452
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:27.620
Ankur Toshniwal: the sentences were longer, so I had to like work to put it all together, but it was still like there's a lot of meat in everything he was saying, and you could tell that he knew his stuff. One thing that was, I thought was different. I wanted to ask a question about was, I felt in the 1st one the Eir had much more of a personality.


453
01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.010
Ankur Toshniwal: and was actually.


454
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:45.780
Ankur Toshniwal: it's kind of a interesting dynamic you have one version where like, that's a little distracting. If it's taking away from the person who's needs to have the most attention. And there's another version where it actually makes it feel comfortable. I don't think the fur I don't think


455
01:01:45.870 --> 01:02:03.279
Ankur Toshniwal: the 1st one necessarily crossed that line, but I felt that I understood the second founder a little bit more, even though, like the pitch itself was substance wise was like maybe slightly harder to follow. I felt like I heard him speak a lot more, and I didn't. I wasn't.


456
01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:19.679
Ankur Toshniwal: I didn't even realize this. The Eir was there in the second one, which I thought was kind of interesting, even though the ir, like even the 30 K. When I think about it. I thought about it was oh, it was a CEO who said that? Not the Eir, just because, like that was like the mapping to that. So I wonder? I'm curious like, how you guys


457
01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:25.299
Ankur Toshniwal: think about the like when you're choosing the eir and choosing how


458
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:29.629
Ankur Toshniwal: to map them in the narrative like how that matters.


459
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:54.240
Chloe Lannert: So the ers have personalities, and on some level that's going to show up. But they're going to turn it up or down, depending on the narrative that makes the most sense. So Ali's pitch depended on people liking her and wanting to connect like the orgs that they really care about with her, and like it, her personality, like mattered a lot more, and, like the feel good audience, Vibe mattered a lot more


460
01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:19.129
Chloe Lannert: versus Alex, who was his pitch was tailored a lot more to investors. And it's like, let's get the numbers out. Let's get the details out. What's the go to market. It was much more quant and like the likability mattered less in sort of the b 2 b investor context. So the Eirs are, gonna they'll dress up the questions a little bit to make it sound natural to themselves, like they're not going to robotically deliver whatever you give them word for word.


461
01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:25.670
Chloe Lannert: but the amount that they're talking will depend on how you want to structure it.


462
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:35.140
Ankur Toshniwal: Gotcha. Okay, thank you. I was curious, like, I was curious. How like you guys even thought about it. I should have assumed you obviously think about it. But yeah.


463
01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:37.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You think about all those things, man? Come on, now.


464
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: let's checks out of San Francisco.


465
01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:41.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is not a drill.


466
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:42.269
Ankur Toshniwal: Let's go.


467
01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:58.540
Chloe Lannert: It's also depending on people's confidence with remembering details. You can give your ears more chances to like, interject in versus setting more context like you can arrange the questions to help you deliver the best pitch possible.


468
01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:06.990
Chloe Lannert: So cool. Okay, 15 seconds of Andrew. Just to show what body language looks.


469
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:10.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We don't need welcome music, anyway, it's all good.


470
01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:19.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hey? Listen. We got 2 of these left. You guys have been amazing staying through this. Thank you so much. Thank you.


471
01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:31.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Look. Mortgage lenders and realtors spend thousands to acquire a new customer, and yet 4 out of every 5 of those customers that they paid so much to get.


472
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They they wanna watch it. Chloe, do y'all want to watch it? Is that what I'm hearing


473
01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:43.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or no? Oh, Meg didn't react. Meg's like, maybe not.


474
01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.729
Meg Hall: I want like 30 seconds more. I don't wanna watch this whole thing.


475
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.880
Chloe Lannert: It's it's in the Chicago Fall.


476
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We'll send the link. We'll send the link to watch the rest. Yeah, that's not a problem.


477
01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.170
Chloe Lannert: Link is in there.


478
01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:05.569
Chloe Lannert: but I'll just finish like the actual pitch the next like 30 seconds. We'll leave them on the next transaction, where that acquisition cost would have finally been 0.


479
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:14.059
Ankur Toshniwal: Could you restart, CEO of Otto? We don't need walk-up music, anyway, it's all good.


480
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:15.450
Ankur Toshniwal: And Whoa.


481
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:22.900
Ankur Toshniwal: hey, listen! We got 2 of these left. You guys have been amazing staying through this. Thank you so much. Thank you.


482
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:35.299
Ankur Toshniwal: Look. Mortgage lenders and realtors spend thousands to acquire a new customer, and yet 4 out of every 5 of those customers that they paid so much to get.


483
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:40.850
Ankur Toshniwal: We'll leave them on the next transaction when that acquisition cost would have finally been 0.


484
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:50.089
Ankur Toshniwal: My name's Andrew Penner. I'm the CEO of Otto, and I dealt with this problem firsthand as the Cmo. Of one of the fastest growing mortgage lenders in the country.


485
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:59.439
Ankur Toshniwal: We had a 4.9 3 star rating from tens of thousands of customers, and yet even we only retained less than half of them


486
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:07.150
Ankur Toshniwal: think about that. 4.9 3 stars, and still less than half came back for their next transaction.


487
01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:19.540
Ankur Toshniwal: And it's no surprise, right who remembers their loan officer. What are they going to say to you? Between transactions? They just end up sending you spam, and they have no idea if you're back in the market unless you tell them.


488
01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:22.160
Ankur Toshniwal: Well, auto fixes that


489
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:33.179
Ankur Toshniwal: Otto sends every client in a lender and realtor's database an update on their home's value every single month that gets opened at an 80% rate.


490
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:43.800
Ankur Toshniwal: That report takes people into our marketplace where we can generate additional revenue and get behavioral insights that we send back to that lender or realtor


491
01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:50.589
Ankur Toshniwal: to help them understand the exact moment that they should reach out to maximize their chance of closing that deal


492
01:06:51.530 --> 01:07:01.120
Ankur Toshniwal: with Otto professionals can create better relationships, stop wasting time on blind follow-up, and flip the script to retain 4 in every 5 clients.


493
01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:03.820
Ankur Toshniwal: because nobody likes leaving money on the table.


494
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:07.939
Ankur Toshniwal: But don't just take it from me. Let's see what some of our customers are saying.


495
01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:12.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool.


496
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:17.279
Meg Hall: Was that I thought that the intro is only supposed to be 1 min long. That seemed like it was longer right.


497
01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hold on 1 min!


498
01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:21.270
Meg Hall: Okay.


499
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.840
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.


500
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like like I wouldn't obsess over a link, Meg, like 1 min is more than enough time to get this done.


501
01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:36.830
Meg Hall: Okay, he started off with like a lot of stats versus other people do more storytelling, and.


502
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:44.509
Meg Hall: like the stats, come out more naturally in the conversational part rather than him, starting it off with it like at the hook. At the beginning.


503
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:46.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They do, they do.


504
01:07:46.510 --> 01:08:03.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's usually like the. The. The general effectiveness of the opening pitch is to hook people in to entice you to listen for the next 5 min. So say whatever you need to say, so that people go. Okay. You have my full, undivided attention for the next 5, because you prove to me that you're worth listening to in the 1st 60 seconds.


505
01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's my advice. Typically.


506
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:12.580
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, I think we could tell he was really, really stressed from the non-verbal


507
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:22.750
Alex Nativelle: language he had, like he was balancing all time. He. So at some point, tried to put his hand in pocket, and then removed it like, oh, no, I shouldn't do that.


508
01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:38.820
Alex Nativelle: and I think there was a few like gasp for for hair at some points. So you know, he's like I loved the beginning of his speech like he tried to be like really nice about it, but we could really tell he was stressed. I think.


509
01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:41.350
Ankur Toshniwal: I.


510
01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:41.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right.


511
01:08:41.859 --> 01:08:52.019
Ankur Toshniwal: I also did not realize that I I was like super interested. So Alex, what what part do you think that distracted like? What part do you think you missed because you noticed that


512
01:08:53.059 --> 01:08:55.579
Ankur Toshniwal: cause? I didn't? I didn't notice these things, so I'm curious.


513
01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:03.810
Alex Nativelle: Okay, yeah, yeah. For me. It was very. I think the balancing thing was like I was watching him go left and right all the time.


514
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:20.169
Alex Nativelle: and just maybe because I pay more attention to this. But I was seeing his hand reach for his pocket and then out, and I think that was that was funny, because very relatable. But, as Meg said, because of the stats I kind of like didn't follow his story along. And so


515
01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:25.990
Alex Nativelle: I it kind of lost me around like both those things together. Kind of lost me around the pitch.


516
01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:31.870
Ankur Toshniwal: Agreed. I think the the stats I definitely agree. I was very hard to follow in the beginning, but after that, although it's very used to follow.


517
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:36.100
Ankur Toshniwal: I thought it was actually pretty interesting. But yeah, stats were a little tough.


518
01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:46.249
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. But in terms of I know that the like audio recording picked up like more weirdness vocally, than what I think was actually


519
01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:55.059
Chloe Lannert: happening on the day like, I don't remember hearing those awkward breaths, and I still have not noticed the the missed pocket moment.


520
01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.549
Alex Nativelle: I don't wanna be too harsh. I just.


521
01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:06.450
Chloe Lannert: I mean, you're you're the public speech person. You better have the best damn pitch I've ever seen, so I can use you as the example for future classes setting the standard for yourself.


522
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:27.391
Chloe Lannert: but he he put a lot of effort into like making it organic, giving energy to the audience to like, bring people back in. He was pitch number 11 out of 12, I think. And he was like, Okay, I'm acknowledging my place. We're gonna like, bring the vibes back up before this happy hour.


523
01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:31.040
Chloe Lannert: And like was pretty dynamic with his movements. I


524
01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:46.101
Chloe Lannert: personal taste I didn't notice, like the sway leaning back and forth, is something distracting. I almost felt that he was like using his space. He had some hand motions going on. At least that's how I saw it. He was like using the space available to him. But


525
01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:52.660
Chloe Lannert: yeah, he tried to keep it pretty like conversational and not overly overly pitchy.


526
01:10:53.360 --> 01:11:01.478
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I think the most important thing, though, to recognize is that he's driving. His business is going well, and a great pitch super high quality pitch is a great signal.


527
01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:23.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but it's not the end. I'll be all, and it's not gonna save your company, and it's not gonna kill your company. So that's the whole point. It's like this, too, shall pass. This day goes by, and then life goes on. You can use this to open up conversations, and have investors and stakeholders and whatever. But I really want to de-emphasize like the impact of demo day, because it is at all like at the end of the day it could help you. It won't hurt you.


528
01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.100
Chloe Lannert: Cool.


529
01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:35.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So let's do the last activity here. We've got 3 questions that we want to ask you, and we'll do one after the other. Unless, Chloe, you want to say something else.


530
01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:36.360
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.


531
01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:46.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright activity. Number one. I want you all to write down right now what questions you're excited to answer on stage.


532
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:47.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Just take a minute.


533
01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:04.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you're not the presenter, write down questions. You're excited to see your CEO answer on stage.


534
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:12.169
Chloe Lannert: Some like jeopardy, music.


535
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:57.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, who's we could share? I'm just curious for a few. I want to have you all speak up, but anybody have one they want to share. Encore. I'm curious.


536
01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.849
Ankur Toshniwal: How are you different from perplexity in Chat Gpt.


537
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:06.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Obvious right day. Giveaways. That's that's 1 of the ones you get the most, I'm sure, right.


538
01:13:06.377 --> 01:13:09.209
Ankur Toshniwal: And I, I feel like, we've gotten it a lot. And.


539
01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:09.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Ready to.


540
01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:11.620
Ankur Toshniwal: I feel like we have. We have a good answer for it.


541
01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, yeah, good. I like that.


542
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:15.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Who else?


543
01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:22.390
Alex Nativelle: For us, I think. What are what are feedbacks from students and clients.


544
01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:29.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What are feedback from students and clients? Can you help me understand what you mean?


545
01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.059
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, like.


546
01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:38.140
Alex Nativelle: so this is your product. What do people think about it? Right? You've done your pitch. Do you have actual thing from the people who use it, who buy it and use it.


547
01:13:43.622 --> 01:13:52.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay? So I think that could use some refinement. But we'll we'll get into it right? Because I think there's a version of that question. It's probably really powerful and punchy.


548
01:13:53.467 --> 01:14:00.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But I'm not sure like I'm when I'm imagining a conversation. Let's just, for example, say an investor is a stakeholder.


549
01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:07.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Is that the question? Is that the way they would ask you that question? Is that the way you've been asked in the past, or is it worded differently?


550
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:16.049
Alex Nativelle: it's it's pretty much forwarded like this, like, what do people think, maybe, or like, what have been the comments from people using it?


551
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.260
Alex Nativelle: Yeah.


552
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:26.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hmm, okay, yeah, I definitely wanna dig in on that more because, like, I guess in by contrast, like on 1st question, that sounds like the kind of thing that I've heard lots of people say


553
01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:27.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to end


554
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:39.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: about harvest right? Whereas I think the one you're sharing is kind of like I'm noodling a little bit about what sounds right and what feels right? Because I think if you got a fun stage and someone goes, hey? So, Alex, what feedback have you gotten from your customers about Brio.


555
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:41.960
Alex Nativelle: We are okay.


556
01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like, yeah, you know what I mean.


557
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:46.540
Alex Nativelle: More of a client question, but, like all the clients, ask me that.


558
01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:53.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And if your goal is to resonate with clients that might be good to answer, but maybe worded in a way that actually activates their perspective more right.


559
01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:54.610
Alex Nativelle: Okay.


560
01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:56.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And.


561
01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:11.820
Andrew Fernandes: Oh, yeah, what's your go to market? Strategy, I think, gives an opportunity to demonstrate our deep knowledge. Having spoken to a lot of people, our specific inroads. Why, we're going in those routes. We are, I think that applies for everyone.


562
01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:16.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm gonna challenge you a bit on that. What's your go to market? Strategy is one of the most like


563
01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:25.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: hand wavy questions you can ask right easy, easy. That's what you know, you heard purposely deal with. What's a more nuanced version of that


564
01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:32.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? Because usually an investor is trying to demonstrate their prowess with how nuanced they can be with their question. So they're not just gonna say, What's your go to market?


565
01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:39.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They're gonna contextualize their perception of the issues. You go to market about your business and then ask you to explain what it is right.


566
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:54.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: just a quick reaction there, but make sure that you don't just take the simple, high, level version of the question, and like shove it at it. But instead add a lot of color and context and conversation to it, because.


567
01:15:54.580 --> 01:16:05.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: usually depending on who you want to resonate within the audience offering up more of their thought process alongside. The question itself is, gonna activate their curiosity and engage them further.


568
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:23.320
Chloe Lannert: And you can also use the language of the question to set you up like we were thinking about. So an alternative for you could be the ear saying, So are you doing like a consumer, Chatbot, like style, consumer, model, or like, how are you getting this into people's hands? And you can


569
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:27.340
Chloe Lannert: use that as a setup to talk about how the fact that you


570
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:48.200
Chloe Lannert: tried the consumer model it didn't super work. And now you found this new niche that you're using based on your background, like you can frame out the narrative through the question. That's probably not the best way to do it, but just as different ways. You can frame that out to get the information that you want across and make it feel more conversational. Instead of just someone quizzing you on the boxes on your lean canvas.


571
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:51.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Anthony.


572
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:59.350
Anthony De Silva: Yeah. I thought of 2 questions. I think the 1st one we get asked especially if I'm like customers is like, How how does this work?


573
01:16:59.896 --> 01:17:02.379
Anthony De Silva: So I think that's a question we can probably.


574
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How does this work?


575
01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What do you mean? How does this work.


576
01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.299
Anthony De Silva: You guys are say, telling us that you can save like 2 weeks and save money like, how.


577
01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There we go. So so I love that refinement just now.


578
01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:23.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when you contextualize it like that, Anthony, it's conversational. It's personal. I can imagine myself asking that question.


579
01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:24.829
Anthony De Silva: Still there. Am I still here.


580
01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I'm here.


581
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:31.890
Chloe Lannert: Nope, Ellie getting booted off today.


582
01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:33.910
Anthony De Silva: Hello!


583
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:35.129
Anthony De Silva: Am I back?


584
01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:35.750
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.


585
01:17:36.105 --> 01:17:36.459
Anthony De Silva: Yeah.


586
01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:43.229
Chloe Lannert: That whole. This is what we can save you. Now let me show you how it works is a really great transition from pitch to video.


587
01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:48.340
Chloe Lannert: So you can use video for your how in in thinking about the whole set.


588
01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.630
Anthony De Silva: Yeah. And the and the second question, I was thinking, was like credibility. Like.


589
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:57.890
Anthony De Silva: again, it's like connected to how maybe, like, what kind of partnerships or


590
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.580
Anthony De Silva: credibility like, do you guys have to like execute this.


591
01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:05.929
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, yeah, credibility is is


592
01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:10.970
Chloe Lannert: solid. People like can put a logo on their video or whatever. But they typically wanna


593
01:18:11.370 --> 01:18:12.999
Chloe Lannert: expand on it a little bit.


594
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No.


595
01:18:19.801 --> 01:18:40.359
vivian: For me, I I don't actually get the question about the market size as often. But whenever it's in serious investor, that's what comes out. So that's why I anticipate. Also, I get a lot of like, what is the the dealership feedback. But then, also, like what is the future of the auto industry, or there's still going to be dealerships.


596
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:46.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Got it. And then what's the pushback from the serious investors about the market size?


597
01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:51.420
vivian: I think it's too small competitive.


598
01:18:53.360 --> 01:19:01.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. So so I guess the only feedback I have there is like, make sure you flesh that out more right like, lay out the question in a way that colors the concern.


599
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:09.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Don't just ask the question. Let's feed the Eir. The context of framing the question, yeah, alright.


600
01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:21.240
Meg Hall: So the questions I wanna them to ask potentially are, wow, there's a lot of competition in this space. What's your unique selling proposition.


601
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:35.040
Meg Hall: That's the number one. And then where do you see this going? I want to talk about the the grand vision for the company, and then I want to touch on like revenue, and how we're billing, and how like we can have a land and expand model for customers.


602
01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:39.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Got it. Those are. Those are solid.


603
01:19:39.670 --> 01:20:03.820
Meg Hall: One of the things that I was thinking about is like, you know, I went to this event that was for female founders. And there's this carta study that's about like the type of questions women get asked from investors versus the type of questions that men get asked and men get asked a lot more like, you know, how big is the market? Where are you going to go like, what's the rocket ship? Those kind of questions versus women. 66% of the questions


604
01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:22.490
Meg Hall: opposed to women are prevention oriented. So it's more about like risk. Right? And I know a lot of the questions I get are about like de-risking it. And so, on one hand, I want the opportunity to like showcase, the big dream and the big vision. But, on the other hand, if literally the entire audience is worried about risk, I want to address those things as well. So


605
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:30.929
Meg Hall: I don't know. That's something that's kind of floating in my mind is like, if we get to choose the questions I want to make sure. I at least get to show the big vision, you know, and get the opportunity.


606
01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.352
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I mean, you get to choose all the questions, of course, but just to be clear.


607
01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:49.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think it's important not to entertain the entire audience. And instead focus on the specific people you want to make a connection with. Right? I want you to be greedy. I want you to be really, really selfish and go. Here's who I want to talk to in the room. And I'm talking to you for this pitch.


608
01:20:50.170 --> 01:21:05.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? That's that's where we start. If there's a room to expand and make it accessible to everyone else, that's great. The number one priority for all of you, for your pitch, is to connect with the people that matter to you and to develop the artifact that's going to help you send it to the right people afterwards as well, so hopefully, that makes sense. Tonight.


609
01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Someone else unmuted. Real quick. Andrew, yeah.


610
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:15.150
Andrew Fernandes: I don't have an answer to this, but


611
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:23.750
Andrew Fernandes: my thought would be, it could be, you know, could be an opportunity to control the narrative, and just say, this is how big it can be, and to hell with talking about risk.


612
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.000
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, if they're gonna.


613
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:27.879
Andrew Fernandes: Just my personal.


614
01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.860
Chloe Lannert: Anyways.


615
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.519
Ankur Toshniwal: Thank you for sharing.


616
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.980
Ankur Toshniwal: sharing, sharing that stat, though, Meg. I didn't know that I appreciate it. It's good to know.


617
01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.443
Chloe Lannert: It's huge. We


618
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:45.720
Chloe Lannert: flag it in our screening committee sort of intro stuff. I put a little link out


619
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:52.170
Chloe Lannert: when we're inviting our people in alright. Next up.


620
01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:57.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's the question that you don't know how to answer right now?


621
01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:06.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But you think is important for you to answer at some point, and for us to maybe help you with figuring out a way to answer it. But think about this, and write it down.


622
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:12.860
Alex Nativelle: I was thinking about it when you like a more aggressive questions that I still don't know how to answer.


623
01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:17.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Think about it like I want you to take a minute right now, Alex, before you answer this like right now


624
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:20.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: take a second. Think about this, and write them down


625
01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:22.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright. Who cares to share.


626
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:30.936
Ankur Toshniwal: Happy to I I've I think I kind of have 2, but


627
01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:33.379
Ankur Toshniwal: one of the ones is like


628
01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:41.850
Ankur Toshniwal: this would be follow up of the 1st one, which is like, Why are you different? Right? What is the thing? And our answer is generally we understand the team's workflow


629
01:23:42.317 --> 01:24:04.659
Ankur Toshniwal: and we understand fundamentally who are the stakeholders, and who needs to know about actually doing this particular work? And then the question that comes after that would be like, how many teams face this workflow like, how big is this particular workflow that you care about? and you know what makes it repeatable is, is kind of the question of what makes this workflow repeatable, and how many orgs face it.


630
01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:07.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And you're unsure of how to answer that.


631
01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.349
Ankur Toshniwal: We we're


632
01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:31.459
Ankur Toshniwal: we. We're sure we're sure about how? Yeah, we we know how to answer it. Within specific verticals. But we don't know like a dollar figure signed yet, I guess, is is the hard part is like we don't know how to like fully. We don't know what the full ticket size of that entire market is, and that's what makes it.


633
01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:37.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Got it. So so the nuance question is like, Yeah, but what's the full ticket size? Right? So an investor is digging in in the conversation.


634
01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.620
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, yeah, that's.


635
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: About this right?


636
01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:41.760
Ankur Toshniwal: Right? Yeah, good. Yeah.


637
01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Good, good, good, I like that.


638
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:48.550
Alex Nativelle: I have one that have been


639
01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:55.329
Alex Nativelle: asked lately by some people is, I don't. I'm not sure how to answer this exactly. This is like.


640
01:24:55.540 --> 01:25:02.440
Alex Nativelle: why don't you cut the team in half like? What do you need for co-founders and not, you know the regular amount is like.


641
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:07.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, why, you have such a big team. Yeah, what's what's necessary about that? That's fair.


642
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.499
Alex Nativelle: To answer that.


643
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:09.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You're good.


644
01:25:15.525 --> 01:25:20.310
vivian: I think for me questions unsure is what defensibility and moat.


645
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:36.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, so help. Let's dig in a little bit. Right? Because I I you know. Obviously, I have that question for all of you always so what's that version for you, Vivian, that you're unsure how to answer.


646
01:25:37.196 --> 01:25:38.623
vivian: It's not that it


647
01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:56.519
vivian: like of what a good answer is, and I think I forgot which session it was recently. But someone one of the speakers had talked about like, there's like 4 different ways to answer defensibility. And that actually was really helpful. It was about like your data pipelines, your your your knowledge and your your expertise in your networks. And


648
01:25:56.952 --> 01:26:02.119
vivian: I think it comes down to that. But coming up with how to answer that succinctly.


649
01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:13.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I mean, and part of it is also like your actual answer, your strategy, right? Because you have to decide which of those you're being intentional about you know, building a business around, too. That makes sense. Okay.


650
01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:14.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool that smile.


651
01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:42.320
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Oh, yes, so it's for us is a bit like product specific, like as soon as we say, like 3D printing technologies or entry point, there would be always questions like around this topic like, Can you are, your product is scalable to other manufacturing sectors. Of course it's not difficult to answer, but there has to be some thought behind the the question, like how we can show that our product is really scalable, not to very specific sector.


652
01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:46.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Got it. So we just need to chisel how how you're gonna frame that good.


653
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.940
Esmaeil Sadeghi: True.


654
01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:47.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay.


655
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:55.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think we're ready for the final question. Does anybody want to guess? Oh, never mind, too late! But we gave it away. Sorry. Go ahead, go ahead. It's fine.


656
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:57.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Which ones are you afraid to get at


657
01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:07.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like? What's what's the question you're like? I really hope that they don't ask that, or I don't have to answer that on stage it. It makes me almost uncomfortable to think about having to answer this question.


658
01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:12.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I want you to think about it. You don't have to say right. Now. Take a minute.


659
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Think about it. Look within yourself. Go deep.


660
01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: all right. Let's hear this smile.


661
01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:19.548
Esmaeil Sadeghi: So for us is really like about like the academic background that we have here. So it seems it doesn't help. It hasn't helped us so far like having Phd. In the field like being a professor, but then, so usually they want to ensure like, we can manage the business somehow. So that would be like the question we get often and like,


662
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:25.269
Esmaeil Sadeghi: kind of like, well, of course, we should leverage this


663
01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:27.610
Esmaeil Sadeghi: background that we have somehow, you know.


664
01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:33.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Got it. So so the so the version of this I'm thinking of for us. Mile is usually like what I hear on the investor side is like.


665
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:39.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, like great technology, like solid, like experience from the team on the tech itself. But


666
01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:54.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't quite see a CEO here, right? I don't know who's gonna run this company who's gonna actually turn into a billion dollar business. I'm not seeing it, you know, in in the in the founder right now. Right? So there's a version of that where you're personally being called out about your leadership and potential to actually run the company itself right.


667
01:28:54.570 --> 01:28:55.290
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Thank you.


668
01:28:55.430 --> 01:29:01.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I get it, I get it, and I'll work with you on that, because 100 that could be a total concern by an investor.


669
01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Thank you for being vulnerable. That's not.


670
01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:06.159
Esmaeil Sadeghi: Of course.


671
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:07.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Anyone else.


672
01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:09.025
Ankur Toshniwal: Sure.


673
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:20.999
Ankur Toshniwal: but I I think this probably the hardest one is. You have one AI engineer and a Cro. How do you compete with the 1 billion dollar companies and large AI teams.


674
01:29:22.450 --> 01:29:24.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, the deck is stacked against you.


675
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:28.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: David versus Goliath. How do we respond to that?


676
01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:33.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Good Meg or Alex? Sorry.


677
01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:41.030
Alex Nativelle: I'm not sure if this is like a right question, or just me having too much Linkedin, but like


678
01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:52.869
Alex Nativelle: one of the questions, I might be afraid to answer would be like, it's been 2 years since you started working on this like, why haven't you moved faster? And what's stopping you from having way more


679
01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.600
Alex Nativelle: like revenue and stuff like.


680
01:29:54.600 --> 01:30:01.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Excellent question. Excellent question! That's the kind of stuff that rules you out from a conversation. If you don't address it properly right.


681
01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:12.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's the kind of thing you can get written off about. If someone reads a tear sheet or a 1 pager about you before deciding to take the meeting, and they're like, Hmm. Doesn't feel right. They've been around too long, they have no real traction. What's the deal there?


682
01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:21.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? So you, addressing that properly from the onset. Once they figure out how long you've been alive is a very helpful thing to remove a concern.


683
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.619
Alex Nativelle: I don't know how to answer that. But yeah.


684
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like. By the way, the purpose of right now isn't to answer all these questions.


685
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:31.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, get you all thinking about these things?


686
01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:34.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? So this is good, Meg.


687
01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:44.409
Meg Hall: Okay? So over half of your proof of concept, customers have not converted or not working with you. Now that seems bad. How are you thinking about that?


688
01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.782
Meg Hall: So please don't ask me that on stage.


689
01:30:48.170 --> 01:30:50.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Or we'll come up with a dope. Answer to it right.


690
01:30:50.670 --> 01:31:07.719
Meg Hall: Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And then team dynamics. So you guys all know that my CTO quit on last Thursday. Well, now, he's staying, and he's also self funding going to San Francisco, so he will be in the room. So probably don't want to ask about team dynamics up on stage.


691
01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:10.990
Anthony De Silva: Wait. He's back.


692
01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:12.530
Meg Hall: He's back.


693
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:13.340
Anthony De Silva: Nice.


694
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:15.460
Meg Hall: Yeah.


695
01:31:16.130 --> 01:31:22.059
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's lots of you guys to help each other out on. So hopefully, you have your own. I think you have a thread right where you guys can confirm.


696
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:22.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They all know.


697
01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:29.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, look out for Meg here, like I think she needs as much level support as possible from all of us, because that ain't easily go through.


698
01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:36.490
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, we definitely have a thread. We definitely have a thread.


699
01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:37.479
Andrew Fernandes: Before we meet him.


700
01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right. Chris.


701
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:50.575
Chris Wong: Yeah, I think for us it's like 2 things come to mind. One is


702
01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.589
Chris Wong: Why is traction taking so long to get to where it is now.


703
01:31:55.182 --> 01:31:56.508
Chris Wong: And what what's


704
01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.539
Chris Wong: What is traction like?


705
01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.666
Chris Wong: And then the other one for me is,


706
01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:07.620
Chris Wong: how does legal ease differentiate itself from point One and billables to competitors that are already ahead in the race.


707
01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:24.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I have already thoughts on this, Chris, but we'll we'll let it ride. Okay, but I'm excited to help you answer those questions. I think we come up with some even tougher ones, because I think there's ways for you to knock that out of the park because you're kind of crazy. But I think we just need to lean into the crazy.


708
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:26.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I had the tiger.


709
01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:33.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool, Anthony. I saw. Anthony, did you raise your hand multiple times.


710
01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:40.599
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, yeah. I think my question was gonna be like, similar to what Alex said, like growth and like revenue in the past months.


711
01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:42.150
Anthony De Silva: How's that tracking?


712
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:45.090
Anthony De Silva: It's not not a question I want to get asked.


713
01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:58.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, I mean, there's versions of that, too, that we can talk about right as sound tech stars trying to figure things out. They had me slow down in order to speed up like those are. Those are actually not too bad. I would give that a like a medium negative, as far as difficulty.


714
01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:08.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's gotta be. There's probably some tougher ones, too. But anyway, it doesn't matter. We're we're good. Thank you for humoring that exercise guys. You've got 23 min left


715
01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:12.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the rest of this time. Chloe has figured out breakout rooms.


716
01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:16.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you're gonna take those questions that you just wrote down. We paired up the companies.


717
01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:20.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and in those breakout rooms you're gonna ask each other those questions


718
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:31.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: just to get it. Get get a rep in, get a feeling for what it's like to talk out. You know to each other how you're thinking about your actual answers to those questions. So one person is the Eir.


719
01:33:31.710 --> 01:33:35.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You give them the questions they ask them. And then you role play switch.


720
01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:36.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay.


721
01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:38.900
Chloe Lannert: Phones.


722
01:33:39.299 --> 01:33:57.260
Chloe Lannert: Before we get into the breakout rooms. I just want to remind everyone on some timeline stuff start thinking about the pitches. If you're lost on where to start, go back to our last demo day intro session and start with like the sort of blank slides. What are the 3 things. I want this pitch to communicate


723
01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:14.960
Chloe Lannert: and start thinking about how those points fit in across the pitch video. And QA. We're gonna go over your storyboards next week. I'm gonna drop more details about what you need to bring to that call in the weekly what to expect. Yeah. Ankle. Your zoom is insane. I don't know what's happening.


724
01:34:15.465 --> 01:34:26.850
Chloe Lannert: But just thinking about those 3 points, and then over the next week or so, if you want to start posting like example, pitch scripts start posting videos of you practicing a pitch.


725
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:35.319
Chloe Lannert: Please do that. I'll make a chain for everyone to drop those in, start massaging it together, and then we'll have more formal practices


726
01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.310
Chloe Lannert: later down the line.


727
01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:46.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We include for awkward rejoining. You can just have Andrew start it, and then, like awkward can join Andrew's room. If whoever he's paired up with.


728
01:34:46.670 --> 01:34:50.400
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, I also, it's


729
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:56.950
Chloe Lannert: harvest and brio. I put you guys together because you're physically in the office. So you guys can just log off and chat together for the next 20.


730
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:58.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Perfect. Perfect. That's smart.


731
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.220
Chloe Lannert: And then we've got.


732
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:23.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool. Well, just let me say a final thing, because I know this is going to be the end of the session, but we want you all to like. Move forward to take the 20 min if you want to go longer, do that, too. But just know that this is something that you know we've done over many years, and I'd love to work with each and every one of you to get as thoughtful, nuanced, and as aggressive as possible.


733
01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:27.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I would love for this class to be the strongest like


734
01:35:28.050 --> 01:35:33.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: degree of questioning at Demo Day that we've ever seen, and I know I I think it's totally doable, too.


735
01:35:34.255 --> 01:35:47.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Because I feel more confident about this model and format now, because we've done it so many times, and I know what good looks like, and I feel really good about all of your businesses. So allow me the opportunity to help you guys trickle, presenting yourselves in the best possible life.


736
01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:52.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool, alright! See you tomorrow, you ready for Bob.


737
01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:54.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is not a drill.


738
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:07.140
Chloe Lannert: Alright. Let me make sure.


739
01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.200
Chloe Lannert: Trina.


740
01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:20.948
Chloe Lannert: Anthony, you got your assignment.
