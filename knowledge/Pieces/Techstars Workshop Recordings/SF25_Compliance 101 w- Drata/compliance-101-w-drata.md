### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Meg Hall: because we needed to have something that was like fully set up. And it was between the 2 like the 2 platforms. I just wanna obviously support the other founders that I know, you know. So but we end up going with both you guys. Just because, like, it is a overwhelming process, right? Like, just as like startup founders like, we just don't have that much time and capacity. So that's why we did agency plus strata together.
- Meg Hall: Takes time to set up, and, like, you know, there was steps before this where, like we had like our like it documents, and we had like, like the Ciso questionnaires, all filled out and stuff. But like
- Lev Parker: Yup, Yup, love it. Okay, so going enterprise customers trying to make sense of the process. Take something opaque and make it easy and understand. You know, like, how that process works. Aka, how long it takes could be 250Â h and 6 months, or it could be a hundred hours in 3 weeks. It kind of varies by company and by technical aptitude, but we can walk through that

### Key Insights

> "Lev Parker: what it means for companies from foundation, how it impacts scale and then talk about what solutions like ours do, and how we kind of change that phenomena for companies. And then we could talk about decision, criteria and some resources to help you all navigate it. My thesis is that I think, if more investors understood what cyber security compliance is, how companies can utilize it. Why, it's important, and what some of the pain points are."

> "Lev Parker: So anyone selling to Enterprise has to cater to that same with mid market, and frankly like, you know, any 50 to 100 person company is also experiencing this. Whenever those companies ha fortify their security posture. Part of that process is then evaluating their vendors to make sure that they are also persuant to the standards that they're upholding themselves. So it has this broader ripple effect."

> "Lev Parker: The problem is that historically, that's 1 hard to know what requirements I need and have to give to the audit. They can be vague and opaque. They might not represent your particular tech stack or your kind of business model. And then, 2. Most importantly, it takes a lot of time to have to go and collect these like as you as early stage companies, and even as you grow later on. None of you can afford to have tech talent taking screenshots on a day to day basis."

> "Shane Tierney: process, right? Usually at some kind of, you know, critical moment in the sales cycle, you know, where like it'll be in the T's and C's that you have to sign that, hey? We are. You know we're up to speed on Ccpa. We're up to speed on. Gdpr, we're in process with getting our sock 2, you know, in place, and this is now something that that is holding up the deal stage right? And and not having that kind of stuff, goes to the second bullet point."

> "Lev Parker: aside from frameworks, what else do you really care about? And the person was like, well, I mean, in an ideal world. I'd be able to see this, this and that and live on the call. He shared. The screen popped into Drawda, and they looked, and sure enough, in our control library there's already 800 basic in there. There were a number of controls that this regional it director needed. And he's like that's really cool. I've never been able to see that. So our customer put together this select package"
