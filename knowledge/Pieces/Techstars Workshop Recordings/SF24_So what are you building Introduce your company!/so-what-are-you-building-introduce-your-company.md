And so there's many different processes within this busy work. But here's an example of one of them. So typically when we start a clinical trial, we have to create a bunch of Excel or Google spreadsheets. Because we have to track
- Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): and that's just one process. And so if you take this process and you spread it out over every therapeutic area in a pharmaceutical company like you can have oncology, you can have dermatology, etc. And you have multiple trials under each. This kind of inefficiency just compounds.
- Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): And so our platform is trying to automate as much of these processes as possible. Here are some examples like these are some of the types of things we do in clinical trial management. So we have to do the spreadsheet tracking. We create timelines, multiple timelines.
