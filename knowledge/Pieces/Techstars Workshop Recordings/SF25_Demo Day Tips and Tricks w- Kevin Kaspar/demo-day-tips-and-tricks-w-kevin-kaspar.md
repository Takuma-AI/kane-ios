## Overview

Kevin Kaspar, an expert in Demo Day presentations and pitch competitions, delivers comprehensive guidance on mastering the 6-minute Demo Day format (1-minute pitch + 1-minute video + 4-minute Q&A). The workshop emphasizes building confidence, creating cohesive narratives, and practical preparation techniques. Kevin brings extensive experience from viewing "36, 48" Demo Day presentations and coaching founders through high-stakes pitch competitions.

## Key Philosophy: Confidence Through Preparation

**Core Principle**: 
> "The best thing that I can do for you is give you kind of like the mindset and the framework for how to actually make the most out of demo Day. Because if you have a clear vision of what you want that to be going in, I think you can definitely make the most of it."

**Confidence Building Strategy**:
> "The best way to do that is to kind of increase the amount of confidence and comfort that you have going into the day of, because you only get one trial run right when you're up there to be able to do that."

## Universal Demo Day Principles

### 1. Unified Storyline Architecture

**The Flow Imperative**:
> "I think the most important thing on the left hand side is like having one storyline that you can pull through from the very beginning to the end."

**The Fragmentation Problem**:
> "Oftentimes what I've seen is that the demo might be different from the pitch which might be different from the QA. And that creates like a little bit of like fragmentation between them and the best thing you can do is like, set yourself up for the demo when you're doing the pitch."

**Seamless Transitions**:
> "Set yourself up for the QA. When you're doing the demo and that can be done by as easy as like. Let's see how this works right. And then you go into your demo. You just want to make sure that people, users and listeners are always tied to what you're doing next."

### 2. Strategic Attention Management

**Fighting for Focus**:
> "The second thing is, it's a reality that you'll be fighting for attention like I'd be lying to you. Everyone would be lying to you if they were saying they were engaged for all 2 h of demo day, or however long it is."

**Targeted Engagement Strategy**:
> "There are specific listeners that you want in the audience to pay attention to, and making sure that you attract their attention quickly is really important."

**The Realism of Selectivity**:
> "You can't attract everyone in the room. That's totally okay. I think this is something that techstars founders also have a sometimes of a challenging time with. They do want to please everyone."

**Strategic Focus Approach**:
> "But I think it's okay to design a pitch around like, Okay, who are the 3, 4, 5 people in this room that I really want attention from? And how am I going to make sure that I get it."

### 3. Network Effect Awareness

**Hidden Connections Principle**:
> "The caveat to that is, of course, like you never really know who someone else knows, just because, like. I don't have a lot of experience in like B, 2 B AI, like a gentic. AI. It doesn't mean that I don't know someone who will have that information and be able to like point you in the right direction."

## Core Pitching Principles

### The 10-Year-Old Rule

**Fundamental Accessibility**:
> "The most important thing is that people really are not as smart as you give them credit for. I think, in the sense that, like you do have to teach people what you're building like. They're genuinely 10 years old."

**Foundation Building Strategy**:
> "You have to make it so simple for them to understand that then they can build on what they know, so that you can explain everything that you want to explain to them in 6 min, but you have to give them the like 10 year old version in the 1st 60 seconds for them to understand the rest of your presentation."

**Cascading Understanding**:
> "Because if they don't understand the core of your business, they're not going to understand the pricing model, or who you're selling to, or why it matters so it makes it's really important to get this part right."

**Chloe's Context for SF25**:
> "Yeah, just to double tap. This is so important for this class in particular, because we have a lot more sort of vertical specificity. And you guys understand the people you're selling into and the industries you're selling into so much better than anyone else in the audience will."

### Essential Information Curation

**Critical Question Framework**:
> "You have to identify like, what is the absolute, essential information that I need to teach my audience that they don't know that they don't already have in their brain, but that they have to know in order for them to understand the rest of the pitch."

**Information Tunnel Strategy**:
> "An image that you can keep in mind is like having this truly be more of like an information tunnel right like, keep it very broad in the beginning and then work your way into the specificity that you need to explain down the line."

**Specificity Progression**:
> "You want to get your most specific insights and data. And you know points of reference at the end of the pitch, probably in your Q, and a. And less so in the very beginning."

### Sentence-Level Connection Mastery

**Dot-Connecting Excellence**:
> "One of my favorite things that I think people don't do enough of is like really being able to connect the dots between sentences, because you really only do have 6 min."

**Seamless Flow Examples**:
> "As an all female Gen. Z. Team. We not only have the technical abilities to build cue the curves. but our team deeply understands our users experience. And then they say, as women who grew up in the age of online shopping and social media. Right? Do you see how they tied those 2 sentences together?"

**Elimination of Mental Work**:
> "Similarly I was shocked to learn that 100% of interviewees reported word of mouth or direct site as their primary method of notification. And then I go on to say landowners rely so heavily on word of mouth, because right? So you're not requiring the audience to do any work. You're giving it all themselves, and you're connecting the dots between every sentence."

**Thought Architecture**:
> "It's kind of like the beginning of the sentence should have a thought, and the end of the sentence should have a thought, and the end and beginning should always be tied."

## Conversational Delivery Mastery

### Natural Voice Development

**Authenticity First Approach**:
> "The next thing is much easier said than done. But really treating your pitch as a conversation, I think, is the best opportunity for you to engage your audience very authentically."

**Script Development Method**:
> "When you're prototyping like what you want the pitch to be. I think the best way to practice is to actually say out loud what you want to say, and then write it down, because I think when you're trying to create a script or write what you want to say down first, st it comes kind of it comes across differently than how you would say it."

**Voice-First Creation**:
> "The best thing you can do for yourself is. put it in your own words, and how you would more naturally say these things, and then write that down and use that as kind of like your 1st filter for creating these kind of drafts or pitches."

### Personal Style Integration

**Unique Voice Emphasis**:
> "Everyone is, gonna have their own tone when you're building this out. And I think that bringing that and like owning. That is definitely something that like makes you and your company unique. So I wouldn't be afraid to kind of like lean into that and definitely like, own your like style of speaking the way that you like to present yourself."

### Logic Over Technical Complexity

**The Wildfire Example**:
Kevin's wildfire detection startup faced the question: "How are you going to deploy all of these devices in the middle of like the forest? That seems like really impossible."

**Technical Answer (Less Effective)**:
> "A technical answer could be like, well, we've created this risk model that tells us how many devices we need to put and where we need to put them. And like we've used a very mathematical model to like help. Answer that question."

**Logic Answer (More Effective)**:
> "The logic part of that answer is something as simple as like, well, we work with timber companies. And they have, like, really well built in road systems. So like, I can actually access every square inch of the property that I need to access."

**Intuitive Understanding**:
> "So putting these down on the property isn't as actually as challenging as you think. It is right. So that's like a very clear example of when you could have led with a more technical example or something that's a little bit more intuitive, and it it lets the audience take it in a bit more naturally."

## CEO Ownership Philosophy

### Personal Responsibility Framework

**Ultimate Ownership Principle**:
> "This is your pitch, and at the end of the day you, the CEO, is the one that's presenting this information and no one else. So it's great to get advice from other people. It's like essential to get advice for other people. But at the end of the day like this really is your pitch."

**Leadership Through Demo Day**:
> "You, as a CEO, I think, need to be the one taking the lead on this. It's pretty easy to like offshore some of this work to like an intern, or someone on your marketing team, or an advisor, or another co-founder. But I think at the end of the day, like you're the one presenting."

**Business Understanding Benefit**:
> "Taking responsibility and owning this will not only help Demo Day go well, but will also help you understand your business in a much broader way that I think is really important."

### Question Bank Development

**Comprehensive Preparation**:
> "Building out this repertoire of like like questions that you might get like, get asked is really helpful. Because if you have a list of like, okay, what are all of the things that people are currently asking me about."

**Source Integration**:
> "Whether it's through mentor madness, whether it's through like investors that you've worked with. You have a set of like criteria that other people want to know the answers to, and you can be able to kind of package that."

**Authentic Voice Maintenance**:
> "But do it in your own tone. Do it in your own voice, and the way that, like your company, would talk about that, not the way an investor would want to hear that information."

## Quality Assessment Framework

### The "So What?" Test

**Core Validation Method**:
> "I think the best pitches. Answer a few of these questions. Your pitch should always answer the. So what one test that I've always used is like, okay, if I go through, you know, I want to talk about like my customer segments, who I'm selling to, and why that matters."

**Five-Why Methodology**:
> "The best thing you can do for yourself is like, have I answered the so what? Okay? Why am I selling to those people? And like kind of a core testing point you can do is like, ask yourself why 5 times, and see if, like, the answer at the end is what you have kind of at the end of the day on like that you're planning on presenting."

### Confidence vs. Cockiness Balance

**Confidence Requirement**:
> "You do have to kind of have a hundred percent confidence in what you're building and the way that you're approaching the pitch. Obviously, there's a difference between like confidence and cockiness."

**Autopilot Readiness**:
> "Getting to that level gets you to a place where you can kind of do it on autopilot. You can feel confident doing it at any time of the day. And you're like excited to get up there and share."

## Delivery Excellence

### Content vs. Delivery Priority

**Delivery Supremacy**:
> "The way that you deliver the pitch, I would say, is, is arguably more important than the content itself, because you can have the best content in the world on paper. But if you're not delivering that in a way that's like resonating with people. It makes it a lot harder for them to actually want to have a conversation with you after."

### Self-Recording Practice Method

**Ruthless Self-Analysis**:
> "The way that I do that is literally record yourself like, do it in front of a mirror. Force yourself to watch the recording. I had a ton of pitches that I like hated the way that I looked the way that I was walking around things that I was saying, and that makes you realize what you like about your pitch, what you don't like about your pitch, and how you want to change it."

**Multi-Dimensional Awareness**:
> "Some things to keep in mind are just like the tone that you're actually sharing the intonation, the speed, the pace, right? All of those things really matter."

**Dynamic Variation**:
> "The way that you say the 1st sentence of your pitch is probably different than the way you say. Your last sentence of the pitch, which is different than how you might answer a question to one of the eirs right?"

## 1-Minute Pitch Mastery

### Problem-First Philosophy

**Problem Precedence**:
> "My favorite is the 1st one. I think it's well worth it to spend the 1st minute of your pitch focusing far more on the problem than the solution that you're actually delivering."

**Understanding Before Product**:
> "Because people really need to understand why you're building something, and why they should care before they need to understand what the product actually is."

### Essential Components Framework

**Four Core Elements**:

1. **The What and How**: 
> "You need to explain it to someone like they're 10 years old because people don't often understand the what or the how behind, like a demo or behind a pitch, and just being able to answer that super clearly for people like, is it a platform? Is it an app? Is it a physical product?"

2. **Usage Patterns**:
> "How does how does the user interact with that? How do they use it? Do they use it every day? Do they use it, you know, at a certain time, just like having the the bare bones that you probably think are so absurdly simple."

3. **Founder Credibility**:
> "The next thing is just like why you're the right person to be doing this... they need to trust that you can actually go out and execute building this business, and you need to showcase that."

4. **Concrete Examples**:
> "The last piece that's super helpful is just like anytime that you can give an example. It's it's like leaps and bounds more helpful than trying to explain it broadly."

### The Power of Specific Examples

**Kevin's Wildfire Story**:
> "I always talk about this customer named Corey Bingaman, who was a forester at Collins Co. Lumber, and he was in a family farm and harvested his trees for like 35 years, and then he had a wildfire go through his property and ruin 100 million dollars of of timber that he didn't have wildfire insurance on."

**Extrapolation Value**:
> "If you understand that visual of someone who's worked for 30 years to harvest these trees that then they lost in a fire. You can understand why a solution for, like prompt detection of these wildfires could be beneficial."

**Broad Application**:
> "And it doesn't mean that, like Corey is like the end all be all example. But it just shows, like the type of customer that I'm trying to sell to why, they might have this need and like, why, a solution like ours might be valuable."

### Word Count Guidelines

**Esmaeil's Question**: How many words can fit in a 1-minute pitch?

**Kevin's Practical Answer**:
> "I don't have an answer. But I think it's because every pitch is different and everyone has a different speed that they talk, and I wouldn't try to increase the amount of words that you say, or necessarily decrease the amount of words that you say, but I would always argue that slower is probably better."

**Chloe's Practical Test**:
> "Literally find a document and time yourself for 1 min, and see how many words you can read out loud, and use that as a baseline like that. 1 min pitch. Those scripts are short, like shorter than you expect them to be."

**Kevin's Reality Check**:
> "Realistically, it'll probably be like 6 sentences."

**Non-Native Speaker Considerations**:
Esmaeil: "For a native person like a native speaking person, it would be like 150 words. But for me it's probably like 100 words."

## Script vs. Flexibility Balance

### Memorization Strategy

**Script Necessity**:
> "I think it really is important for this pitch to write a script. I think that getting to a point where you have exactly what you want to say in the allotted time is super important."

**Over-Memorization Warning**:
> "But over memorizing can kind of create some challenges because, you want to be able to think quickly on your feet. If you know, something doesn't go the way that you're hoping it to."

**Broader Structure Understanding**:
> "So just always being able to like, think about, okay, what's the broader story that I'm trying to connect? Like, okay, what are the 4 or 5 ideas I'm trying to communicate, in addition to having that like bundled up script."

### Word Optimization

**Intentional Language**:
> "How do you fight for every single word that you have? And how do you make sure that everything that you're saying is meaningful?... being able to be very tactical with every single word choice that you use will make the listener kind of, I think. Understand what you're building better."

**Improvisation Skills**:
> "Having the ability to improv is like the best thing that you can do for yourself in a pitch. You probably might not think it makes sense in the moment what you're like saying. But I promise you it's like a connected thought."

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Cramming Deck Content**:
> "The downfall to achieving that is like thinking about the pitch as a crammed pitch deck, because you're not going to be able to say the 1012, 15 things that you typically say in like a longer form deck in this 1 min."

**Focus Over Coverage**:
> "You're really only going to be able to say like one, maybe 2 or 3 of those topics. But it's about making the most of those specific topics as opposed to trying to answer every single question."

## 1-Minute Demo Excellence

### Storyboard Development

**Planning Imperative**:
> "1st one is like, definitely do a storyboarding walkthrough exercise. I think that is like the most important piece here is you only have 60 seconds, so make sure that you like. Can imagine what on the slot like, what on the video is going to be shared with the words that are being voiced over in the background."

**Time-Block Planning**:
> "The best, this is the best way to do it right, just like plan out all right. The 1st 10 seconds are going to be this next 10 seconds are going to be this. These are the sentences that are going to go behind it."

### Content Integration Strategy

**Seamless Continuation**:
> "My biggest thing is, try to try to treat this as a continuation of your pitch, and if this is first, st you know, have a good, strong, strong landing point for you to then continue into the pitch. Later."

**Transition Mastery**:
> "The way that you can solve, for that is like, all right. Here's how it works right bringing in those those transitional phrases for you to imply that you're about to show them a demo."

### Time Management Discipline

**Content Purity**:
> "I wouldn't fill the time with like disconnected content. So I wouldn't view this as like, okay, I have. I have 6 min total, and I have 1 min, Demo. And I really only have like 40 seconds of demo content. But I'm just gonna shove 20 other set like seconds of other content."

**Length Flexibility**:
> "If your demo like doesn't need to be a full minute. That's like, okay, it can be 45 seconds. It can be 50 seconds right? But just like, make sure that the information you're presenting is like, only relevant to the to the purposes of a demo."

### User-Centric Approach

**Customer Journey Focus**:
> "The best way to do that is to kind of bring in like a user, a user, focused aspect to it, right, always route what you're walking through. And in the way of like, how how someone would be interacting with this product, how they'd be using it. What's the like context for it? What's the benefits that they get as a result?"

**Core Demonstration**:
> "But don't forget, like at the end of the day you need to show what you've built and how you've built it, and and why people are using it."

### Multi-Use Strategy

**Repurposing Value**:
> "One strong, like point of view that I've seen people do in the past which I've enjoyed is they view this as something that they can use for demo day, but they can also. I don't want to say, repurpose, but also leverage on their website, or in other aspects of their business."

**Investment Justification**:
> "So to the extent that you can highly customize it for Demo Day, and make sure that it builds into your pitch and your broader storyline. but also have it be applicable to somewhere else. I think it's okay to invest a little bit more time, energy, and or money."

## Q&A Mastery

### Answer-First Methodology

**Direct Response Strategy**:
> "The 1st one is to be answer 1st in your approach, and what I mean by that is. don't give the context for the answer, and then give the answer. Give the answer immediately."

**Practical Example**:
> "So if, like, someone asks, Who is your what's your beachhead market like it's okay to literally be like my beachhead market is, and then fill in the blank."

**Context After Answer**:
> "It's much better that you do that. And then you give the content? Well, we're targeting this demographic. For these reasons this is what what our customers have said. This is why it matters. Here's where we're going next right like you can bring all of that in."

**Respect Through Directness**:
> "I think you get a lot of respect if someone asks you a challenging question and you're able to answer it directly and discreetly, as quickly as possible."

### Question Frequency Strategy

**One Thought Per Question**:
> "I think it's also pretty important to have kind of like one primary thought per question. As a result, I think that it's better to have more, a few more questions that are more targeted than like 3 questions across these 4 min, and you speak and ramble for a long time."

**Chloe's Breaking Point**:
> "I often see 1st draft versions of the Q&A having like literally just 4 questions. And then these long, long answers like. Please break it up as soon as possible."

**Conversational Benefits**:
> "You're giving your eir a chance to signpost to the audience what you're talking about, and make each point more distinct, like, use that conversation element to to break things up."

### EIR Collaboration

**Partnership Approach**:
> "Goes back to like. The idea of the Eir is trying to keep this a conversation. I think that this is one of the best things that Eirs actually do for Demo Day is, they make it very conversational."

**Natural Feel Creation**:
> "They make it feel like you're just like sitting at a room talking to them. And this is a way to really bring the audience in so like, feel free to talk about this with your like Eir beforehand."

**Preparation Coordination**:
> "Ways that you can make it conversational things that you want to talk about ways that you want the Q. And a. To go like their job is to make sure that this demo get day goes as smoothly as possible for you."

### Hard Questions Strategy

**Embrace Difficulty**:
> "Please please answer the hard questions, and own up to the hard questions and be forthcoming with challenges that you've had, because people like to see the resiliency and like you overcoming those challenges or you overcoming those hurdles."

**Reality Acknowledgment**:
> "Everyone knows that building a startup is very hard, and it's really important that you kind of address any challenges or or difficulties that you have in the Q. And a."

**Solution Orientation**:
> "The best thing you can do is really own that and show how you're thinking about it, how you are planning on overcoming it. What processes you have in place to make, you know, to turn the outcome around right?"

### Attention Flow Management

**Ankur's Insight**: Building "train tracks" for audience attention management.

**Guard Rail Questions**:
> "Does it ever make sense to do certain like gimme questions, to help people like just jump back on the train. Right? So like, for example, one of the things we were planning on doing is just like an early entry question is like, you know, so how long have you been working on this right?"

**Kevin's Validation**:
> "Having a build is like Super fair, and I think it can be important. You don't want to like constantly being delivering just like very intense topics like back to back to back that like you have to teach your audience a lot about for them to understand."

**Balance Requirement**:
> "So, throwing in, like other topics that are a little bit easier to discuss and more intuitive for the audience to understand is totally fine. I would just make sure that any of those topics are still like core to the business."

### Question Sequencing

**Additive Structure**:
> "Please sequence the questions like, I think sometimes people don't put a lot of thought into which. like which questions they answer 1st versus last. You have a lot of autonomy over how you structure this. So make sure that each question builds on one another, and that it's additive."

**Natural Flow Priority**:
> "But like don't overthink this too much, I think sometimes people are like, Oh, I'm thinking about making this my second question versus my 4th question, like it should just flow naturally."

## Memory and Recall Strategies

### Presentation-Audience Disconnect

**Memorability Framework**:
> "Just hearing the like volume of pitches that you'll they'll likely hear, you know, in any given day, making sure that they can tie a name to a face. And a company, I think, is like really important, and not an easy exercise, for, like any broad listener to do."

**Chloe's Identity Question**:
> "Do you all know how you're sort of going to be presenting yourselves the almost. Like the. That people like when people are referring to you. Oh, the lawyer like, Oh, the brand guy, do you? Do? You have an idea of like how you want to be remembered. based on your pitch."

**NSG's Typecasting Reality**:
> "You don't have to have it. That's how people are. So people are gonna take away and they're gonna go. Oh, yeah, what was that the the content company? Right? They're gonna oh, it's already right. They're gonna start to like, kind of typecast you guys as they recall who you are and what you do."

**Control the Narrative**:
> "So you have to give it to them. Otherwise they're gonna come up with different versions of it. That may not be what you want."

## Practical Preparation Framework

### Single Document Strategy

**Unified Flow Creation**:
> "Build out the pitch, the demo and the Q. And A. All in one singular document. My main reason for this is because, like I said, I, I think it's great to have it flow as much as possible. And the only way to make sure that it flows between different components is to have it all be in one place for you to stare at it and be like, does this actually flow?"

### Placeholder Methodology

**Future-State Planning**:
> "There might be areas that you still haven't fully like wrapped your head around or don't have answers yet, like startups move very quickly. There's a lot that can change between now and the 29, th when you are pitching."

**Aspirational Integration**:
> "So just making sure that you like have placeholders. If there's a placeholder that needs to be in place, or there's like something. Maybe there's a contract you're hoping to land that you want to put in your pitch deck like build for those events as if they are going to happen."

**Self-Incentivization**:
> "So that you can also incentivize yourself to make those happen."

### Feedback Collection Strategy

**Simultaneous Feedback Approach**:
> "My my biggest piece of advice is to get feedback from your most trusted mentors, your most trusted peers all at the same time. and the reason that I say, all at the same time is because if you get it in increments, you're going to always feel like the person who you're receiving feedback from is right."

**Pattern Recognition**:
> "On the other hand, if you get 5 pieces of feedback. In 2 days you can look at it a lot more from an unbiased perspective and say, Okay, there are patterns in what these 3 people are saying. This is something that I actually need to change versus. This is something that's a little bit more of like a 1 off piece of advice."

**Quality Gate**:
> "Don't don't come to mentors until you have kind of all of these areas built out. But once you've done the internal thought exercise to say, this is what I would present today if I had to. I think it's really important to get feedback all at once."

### Memorization Requirements

**Non-Negotiable Foundation**:
> "Please please memorize your pitch and your Q. And a. There's really no excuses to this. I have seen some unfortunate circumstances in which people have like kind of forgotten their pitch the day of, and had to like Cram to memorize, or were still writing their pitch the day before."

**Back-of-Hand Mastery**:
> "The expectation is that you have this pitch memorized front and back like you could do it while sleeping. You could answer any Q. And a. At any moment in time like you have to have that like. It's the back of your hand."

**Recording Discipline**:
> "Please record yourself pitching. I think this is super valuable exercise. I already talked about that earlier. Make sure to do that."

**Timeline Requirements**:
> "You should be able to do a run of show like a week before, which is why I have it as 2 x's. Like you should be able to absolutely do it a week before. No excuses, because you need to be in a good place where you feel confident about it."

**Chloe's Timeline Enforcement**:
> "You all will be able to do a run of show by the 23.rd That's final approval meetings. You all will. Yeah, absolutely keep that deadline. It's been flagged for a while. It's on the calendars. We're locked in."

## Audience Optimization

### Invitation Strategy

**Strategic Guest List**:
> "Please fill the room with the people that you want to be there, invite them. And that's the best way that you can optimize for a positive experience."

**Chloe's Targeting Emphasis**:
> "The audience is going to be slightly different. This is why we're asking for those invitation lists from you guys of the people you want there. So we are inviting mentors. We are inviting investors, but we really do want to invite the people who are most valuable to you."

**Urgency Factor**:
> "So, still looking out for those lists from folks, the sooner you can get those lists it's over, the sooner I can get those invites out so tailored invites. For whether it's customers, investors, super targeted people that you really want to be there based in the Bay area."

**Value-Driven Attendance**:
> "So we can fill the audience with people who matter to you."

### Approachability Strategy

**Post-Pitch Engagement**:
> "The the big question here is just like, what would someone actually come up to you and talk about right? You want to. You want to be. You want to appear as approachable, and someone that they can go and have a conversation with."

**Friction Reduction**:
> "That barrier of, like someone thinking about coming up and talking to you versus actually having a conversation with you is pretty high, I would argue, it's easier for some people than it is for others. But just think about the ways in which you can make that easier and reduce the amount of friction."

**Relatability Example** (Intentionally Silly):
> "This works in Chicago, when people are in Chicago, if you're a giants fan like people would probably talk to you more if you said, Hey, I'm a giants, Fan, and I'm building this cool thing right?"

**Real Application**:
> "So like I'm not saying that you should say that you're a baseball fan in your pitch, but I am saying you should think about ways of communicating that people resonate with, and that might bring people in easier than you having to pull them in."

## Final Excellence Mindset

### Over-the-Moon Requirement

**Energy Transfer Principle**:
> "You really do have to be over the moon about your pitch, because if you aren't, no one else will be right. You have to put yourself in a position where you're super excited about what you've built, sharing that with the audience, and then letting that energy like to the audience so that they can receive it."

**Confidence Detection**:
> "I think that if you aren't feeling 100% confident, the audience is certainly going to know that. And they're going to see 1012 pitches the same day, and they're going to know the people that feel super confident about their pitches, and the people that are a little bit more anxious as well."

**Collective Success Philosophy**:
> "So just for the purpose and the benefit of everyone, feel great about all of your pitches so that everyone can shine that day. There's certainly room for all of you, so make sure that you like feel great about that."
