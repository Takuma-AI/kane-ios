### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Annie Brown: say like you know, if you're trying to close a sale like, how can you break that up into weekly because I weekly does seem approachable. So yeah, maybe we can discuss that more.

### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: The Kr of Okr is the key result. So it's like a pair. So you have an objective but the objective is kind of vague, and it's not quantitative or measurable like, how do you know, when you've reached that you're running faster than 99% of the population. You you don't because you haven't set a key result. So the key result"

> "Lilliana Robinson: is they probably research what 1% of of the population can run a marathon in, and so, being able to run a marathon in under 2.5 h would mean that you reached your objective. So that's why it's okrs. They go together. You make an objective, make a goal, and then you have a key result that tells you when you've reached that goal. And the key result is like quantitative and measurable."

> "Lilliana Robinson: I think a lot of the mistakes we make. Maybe in our personal lives, maybe in the business is, we'll set goals or objectives without the key result."

> "Lilliana Robinson: So, like I personally do, that a lot. So making a goal is great, like, I love vision, boarding all the different stuff, for, like New Year's resolutions, all of that, I think a lot of us lack a measurable key result. And so it's like very hard to work toward or create milestones toward a vague objective without that key result. So putting those together is very helpful. So that's okay, ours, and then Kpis are measuring along the way."

> "Lilliana Robinson: So while you're working toward that key result, you have milestones that you're doing, how do you know if you're working toward that key result at a steady pace. If you're getting the progress you need in order to reach it in the time you've allotted. That's what kpis are for. So"
