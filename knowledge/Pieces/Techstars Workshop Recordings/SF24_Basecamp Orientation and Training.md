### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: a 1 purpose of us having you use basecamp during this program other than it being easy for you, so that we have a hub with everything in it is to also level up your project management skills. Project management is something both Neil and I are very passionate about, and we find is really important. As a founder. We will have several founders come in to talk to you about project management, in addition to having a whole day next week dedicated to project management."

> "Lilliana Robinson: We also value asynchronous communication. So Neil talked about flow state yesterday. It's very important to us for you guys to have large blocks of time to work. We really believe that there's no other way to get quality work done other than being uninterrupted."

> "Lilliana Robinson: your time becomes your own, and you're the steward of your own time, and people can't take that away from you because they'll send you a message, and you respond when you can, so that your work is never interrupted or forcibly interrupted."

> "Lilliana Robinson: Pings is the most important up here for you, because that is Dms."

> "Lilliana Robinson: that from now on after tomorrow will go in the message board. So every week you'll get this very long weekly what to expect from me? I tell you more about that in the program handbook. That basically is your roadmap to the program. So every single week there will be a single post on Fridays that gives you every single thing you need to know for the following week. I I highly highly encourage you to read it thoroughly. Those will be in the message board, so those are really important."
