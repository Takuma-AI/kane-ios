WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Okay, Jake, let's start recording.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So everyone is watching their recording. I promised Jake that we will keep this internal. So make sure that we do not share this out.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I know that we never do, but I just want to say that. So we're super excited.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Jake, we've actually spoken the most about you. During this program than we ever have. I think these founders are particularly very, hyped up about jobs to be done, which is amazing.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Like so many of, these guys just have loved the process, gone headfirst into it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We require everyone to get to a Y before the Y. So they all did those presentations 2 weeks ago.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Awesome.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In person, it was awesome. So that's kind of the stage they're at. Some people are going into a second round of jobs beyond to either validate the other side of a marketplace or kind of pivot.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And do a new screening criteria set, but a lot of other people now are ready to implement the insights that they have and like follow those implications and make those iterations.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So this is the perfect time to meet meeting with you and tomorrow we're going to capstone this experience with Bob.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So I will hand it over to you. Guys, you already know we've talked about Jake.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He's the founder of Zest, our cooking app. That's out on the iPhone and Android app store right now.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I've talked about how they had virality when they came into program and fixed all of that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Jake, they've watched your full demo day set. We watched it together last week. So they have context there.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And Jake is just a great example of how to implement jobs to be done and most of the things we taught in programs.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So start pupil here and we're really pleased to have him because he has never been able to come back and share his time like this.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This is a treat for you guys, so. Without further ado, I'll give it to you, Jake.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Yeah. Well, I guess let me preface with 2 things. Number one is I view.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Obviously I take jobs seriously, I guess that you guys have seen some of the work product that came out of.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Me and my team. But I'm also humble the fact that I'm an of one in this experience.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I mean, you guys have been through mentor madness at this point and you know, like you put 10 of us in a room and we have 25 different opinions and so What I really care about, what jobs really is a question of to me is systems in foundations for creativity and foundations for work.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And so it doesn't necessarily need to be jobs. I happen to think is a really good system for myself.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm gonna speak to it, the utility of it, the utility potentially of other systems. I don't know necessarily where we want to take this.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But. If anybody, I mean, you never to the tech stars team necessarily say, if you're skeptical of jobs as an approach, that's totally fine, but you have to be intellectually honest with yourself and humbled to the fact that you need systems in place that at least simulate.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
What jobs are trying to do and what other areas of the business like how you can bring deep thought to other areas of the business.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And so for me, that happens to be jobs and I can go very deep in it. If you look at the larger system at play, it's just like.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Look at what jobs is accomplishing, like why do the jobs of jobs in a way and like understand that there are.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000
There is utility to taking a slower approach to building your product and understanding why people might purchase and This again happens to be good for me.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So second thing that I would say is I don't know who is meant to facilitate, Liana, Neil, Sophie, but.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I'm given that I'm an out of one. I'm not going to preface anything else that I say with it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I'm going to speak fairly authoritatively. Again, all the matters I believe is that you have a system, but for the sake of time, I'm only going to give this one caveat at the very beginning.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But then I would ask anybody who's like moderating to pull pull me out. So if I'm ever going a little bit deeper speaking and like what sounds like tongues because we were playing talking heads just now.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Like pull me out of it and Tell me, like, tell me to clarify, tell me to go down or not a 1 rabbit hole versus another, cause I'm not gonna police myself.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I'm just gonna go a stream of consciousness.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That's awesome, Jake.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Well, I'll also put it, I'll put it on the founders too, Jake, like they need to steer you, right?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Yeah, like.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So I mean, they're, leaders. They all have companies that they run like they're adults.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
They can handle this.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If I say something that's nonsense, it probably is nonsense. It's not you not getting it.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So just say like call me out on it and then we'll clarify or great contrast or necessary. Okay, so that being said then.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
What what would be most helpful here? Where do you want me to go?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I'd love if at the top you could tell the story of kind of where you were coming into tech stars and then how as you learned the GTP process and iterated it and I know you were familiar pre program as well but like how did those implications change your business?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Like when you went through first, st give some background, but then knowing where they are at right now, when you were at that stage, how did you make the necessary changes?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Based on your why before the why because they've seen it they've read it How did you make your business succeed based on that?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Like kind of connect the dots between A and B because that's exactly where everybody is gonna be the next couple of weeks.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Yeah, this is like a really difficult part of the process, right? So, jobs as a system, when you're 1st introduced to it, it's not, you know, it's all arbitrarily one thing, but in truth it's really 5 steps.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So screen criterion learning objectives, sourcing interviews based on those screening criteria, conducting the interviews, clustering, and then actually building.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And the way that like my team has formulated it to ourselves, you lose a efficiency at each step in the process.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So like I'm sure that some of you have, for example, started conducting your interviews or did your interviews and at the end you were like darn we really should have focused in on this area and that's more a symptom of the screening criteria wasn't tight enough it's not an indictment on the interviews or like it took forever to source and it's like okay we lost so much time here that's

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:13.000
where we can get better and I always view it as a product so like the ability to do step one, time step 2, time step 3, ultimately each thing runs up below an efficiency of one and you ultimately end up with the overall.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Like ability to do your product, like process. So we came into tech stars. Lilyanna refer to it.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We understood some of these problems at an abstract level. We would speak to them on social media and we went viral as a result.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:35.000
We were pretty successful there. But like there's an expression like a leaky bucket, like if you return, we like were like a pipe.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
We just like sending people literally through our thing. Couldn't retain anybody. And so needed to take a step back in program and essentially reevaluate where our product was at.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:51.000
What we had been doing, our critical mistake was in the screening criteria. Side of the process.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So we were speaking to people who are using zest who are paying possessed. About their journey about what they were hiring us for In reality, that was a really bad strategy for where we were at.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Because in essence we were talking to people who had never successfully learned how to cook and with an extremely high probability would fall out of our system.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:25.000
About their experience successfully learning how to cook. And so what we decided we needed to do is actually remove zest from the equation entirely and speak to people who had successfully learned how to cook without us.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
In particular, what we did is we looked at the pandemic, people had way more time during the pandemic than they do right now.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Big picture. People had way more time during the pandemic than they do right now. And so We just talked to them.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
We talked to them about the forces pushes and polls that were acting on them. They're in the context of their situation that got them to learn how to cook.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But then also through their story came to observe. Inefficiencies in their process where we could cut out time.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Most effectively, and that's what led to the why behind the why that. I think that you guys were familiar with and ended up like studying in program.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And so I think that like, Let's do this.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Like why not open up some forms? Okay, so This is yes Wiki. We

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I'll do, wait, you gotta sit down and say, you gotta show people when like, what are we even looking at?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Okay.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Like go back a few layers? Cause you, I know how awful you are and how you set up your systems.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So when you're like, okay, let me show the team my jobs to be done spot in my company's like.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
You know, hub. What? Just happened just

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Yeah, this is So there are 2 things. One is. You can live life with a growth mindset or a fixed mindset.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And typically high achieving people have got into where they are as a result of having a fixed mindset.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
There's a blue ribbon you're gonna accomplish next thing you're gonna accomplish the next thing.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:12.000
That makes it really hard to build compounding. Successful systems within a company. Like essentially, same with jobs, like you have to acknowledge that you're going to suck at 1st and then over time you're as you like start to build something it's just the best worst version of what you're going to have available.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So like an example of that within our company, we have something called the Wiki. If you do something more than twice, it gets its own article.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Things live inside of This and it essentially details how we work. So over time as we change how we work, the wiki will evolve with that.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Within that there's something that we have our called caller thought playbooks. This is essentially like, I'm dealing with a really difficult problem.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I wonder if I could throw a process at it to solve it. I think like analogy, potentially helpful.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Like, are you guys familiar with the band The White Stripes? The, it's so, yeah, alternative Broken.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Yeah, you have Jack and Meg White. Meg White is railed on in the music community for being a terrible bad drummer.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Jack White, they're like, why is Jack White playing with her? He's a transcendent guitar player.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Why does he play with Meg White? Who is just not complex as a drummer. But if you ask Jack White, his entire success is because Meg creates a structure that he has to function within.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And that allows for his creativity to blossom because it essentially creates constraints that then force him to work effectively.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And that's really like what honestly all of this stuff is. But within that. Job stuff.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Okay, we are.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
That

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So you created a home for your jobs to be done process as a company. So now this is like, is this a resource that you guys like utilize at some cadence or interval or is it more ad hoc?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000
At this point we use these things. It's almost like you can feel. When you need to.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So for example, We will lean on jobs as a method of conducting customer research whenever there's a question of customer research because again essentially it comes down to again this is how we filter information progress it's like what progress were people trying to make what were the forces acting on them if we can diagram those forces we'll be able to effectively diagnose a problem.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So like something some recently that we did was we looked at churn. We just like People are leaving our product, particularly bad terms.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So like people who had spent call it, I think it was like, 10 to 24 h. In zest.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.000
It's like we should have you. Why why are you leaving us at this point? We like interviewed them.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We heard their stories because seemingly irrational decision, we were hearing irrational stuff. People would be like, I left because you don't have enough recipes.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.000
If you cooked one's best recipe a day. For a year and a half, you would still have more zest recipes that you would cook.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So it's like, obviously, We have more recipe. So what does it actually mean you don't have enough recipes?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And it turns out we don't have the right recipe for you in a moment. So like I'm on TikTok and I see something I really want to cook and I go to zest and you don't have it God this app doesn't have anything and I like and not feeling that.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So to be clear about that. Jake, you were in a team meeting at some point and you all are talking about churn.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Yeah.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And you're like, well, we need to, we need to actually go talk to somebody. That will happen or is it some other way that.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
You all decided to do this.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Yeah, we're gonna yeah again like this is gonna get deep we basically have something that we call spikes.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I this is like normally like in development you will spike things but the way that we spike things is by going and doing research over a set period of time.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And so we have like this is the, these are the research projects that we currently have, going on.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You have, this is like April Dunford stuff, Neil. So it's like less jobs oriented, but, dualingo for cooking.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Super successful messaging for us. It's our what and how? So it makes sense. It's like, what are we?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We are, we teach how to cook. Like, how do we do it? We do it like do a lingo.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So like on a surface level, we have an understanding, okay, this thing works. But what does it actually mean to somebody?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Who sees that and then decides and when do they see it and decide like, oh yeah, this makes total sense for me in my context.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Versus somebody that wouldn't. And so we actually like keep track of all that stuff. And we'll run our research that way.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:30.000
On the demand side of things. So, Lilian, at your point, what we do is like, we essentially like, have you guys talked about the wall?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Oh.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Not really, not really, a little bit.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Some people have read demands that sales. Yeah.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Okay, well basically it's like your This is the hard thing that like we have to constantly remind ourselves as well as like your product doesn't matter to people like.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
The fight that I got in with my sister yesterday matters to me. I, your product doesn't matter to me.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:56.000
At best, it is like something that could potentially prevent me from losing my job. But like that's honestly typically an anxiety.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
It's like, how do I know that I won't get in trouble for adopting this?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And this is like on the baby side. But like It is humiliated that that then drives in like a an understanding of the requirements needed to then end up building your product.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And so You guys have done this part ideally as effectively as you can the 1st time. You have to be okay with kind of stinking the 1st time the year, but like the best that you can to identify demand side.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:31.000
What is lately out there without your product in the world and how are people solving the problem? Ideally that then lead you to a why behind the why that's like this thing is ton of words but the idea is like there's a wall.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And you've. 2 choices, you can either look, you can either be on the demand side of the wall, understand lane, demand in the market, and look over.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000
The wall at the supply side, understand the requirements dictated to you by your customers behaviors. That you now have to build towards or you can be on the supply side of the market.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Our camera is the best at in focus zoom. It has its shutter speed is XY, or Z.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And look over at the demand side and be like, it's good at solving those problems. And the difference between those things are subtle, but to me, ultimately it's actually pretty big.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
It's the difference between the dog wagging the tail and the tail wagging the dog.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And so

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Jake, what the point you just made is, have you had any experience helping people? Get over that, challenge because I think there are people in this room right now on the zoom call among our founders who are probably still struggling with conceptualizing.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The prioritization of the demand side before the supply side.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:37.000
It's a Yeah. So one thing which I think that sounds like you got, you got to be true of mine and humble with spirit.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:46.000
But I like, you know, like you have to actually be to say that you're down to do it this way is different than actually conducting and behaving this way.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And I will say a great way to waste a lot of time accept that you're doing a demand side and then like maintain a supply side attitude because what it will do is it'll essentially leave you in the middle, you'll stand on the wall, you won't be based in anything, and then like you'll struggle no matter what.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Do the reality is like a lot of companies can make it to like series A without a really tight understanding of demand side.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:21.000
It's not again the way that I would do it. But you see, that's obviously like Bob, Andrew Glazer, they have made a lot of money coming in to companies who can no longer grow and are going under really quickly who need to understand why their customers were buying from them in the 1st place.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And understand and come to understand that they're an entirely different product than they initially believe. That being said, it is really difficult.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:47.000
It is very easy to over intellectualize this at the stage that you're at where like if you have assuming the prerequisites been met you've engaged with this very honestly it's very difficult to then switch to features and benefits because those things are important.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I've almost like if you guys are familiar with the avatar, this is like air bending.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
It's like you have like financial modeling which I view as fire vending. It's like church of finance stuff.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000
This stuff is really important. Like Avatar still has to fire Ben. But like it's you got to know when to draw on these tools and how to use them.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So for example, in marketing. We are building and cooking out. Makes a lot of sense for us to have good food content on our platform or on our pages.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:20.000
We have no food content on our platform pages because other people are building a lot of interest in our product when they're showing their they're making people insecure.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
They scroll through videos of great food and then you come upon our content and our content sees it on that moment.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And it's like Why are you, why are you looking at this and eating a cholera burrito and completely out of control over the way that you put food in your body?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And that's kind of where our positioning ends up finding itself. You see like. This is kind of a weird thing, but like loneliness and getting people to hang out with you is a big part of who we are as a product.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And so all of a sudden our brand is a friend in the kitchen. It's a knowledgeable friend who helps you through this process.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:00.000
It's triggered in one way, like it's triggered because I go from a heavily socialized environment to a less socialized environment.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
All of a sudden I'm I wasn't a dorm. I'm now living all campus. I was in college.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I'm now living out of college. But the tone of the app itself. Comes to reflect that in a different way.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Cadence for shipping. Becomes very important so that you This is again with the perfectionistic thing.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
You just got to get stuff out there now and ruthless prioritization is going to be critical to the success of your company.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Also finding capacity for what you guys can get out in a certain period of time. Is really, really tough.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So this is like again, it tips into our stuff. I have kind of these systems for a lot of stuff.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000
We leverage a system for building and shipping called Shape of. It comes from like I don't know if you guys have talked about that.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
As well.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
They will in book club in in like a month or like a few weeks.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Hell yeah, I would, it, you will read it and you'll be like, this is great and our team just isn't at the point where we can stand this up yet.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000
That's gonna be the 1st thought that comes into your head. Stand it up. Just like do it as soon as you can.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
You did it the hard way.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Because it's going to be intimidating. Right, right, right. We try not to.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:19.000
But then the reality is like we're not shipping what Matters and and so you're gonna have essentially you're gonna have everything is Everything feels like the most exciting, most pressing problem to solve for your business in the moment.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:37.000
You go down these rabbit holes of passion and the key is just Creating checks to validate them and allow yourself to take a step back to actually prioritize where where you're at.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.000
So With shape up as a system, I mean, you guys will end up talking about it. But in essence, it's like you have 2 control factors when it comes to building.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:53.000
You can you ship something. And you have time, like the amount of time that you dedicate to the project.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And most people will hinge on shipping something. And so even though like things are set up in 1, 2, 4 week sprints, it's really built around getting this feature this element of your product out.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Shape of flips that on its head and essentially says I don't care what you put out but you gotta put up in a set period of time that addresses this problem.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Then it becomes, I mean, it's similar to these other processes. How well can you shape?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.000
How well can you put together pitches that will, help to address the problem that you're going after.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And allow you to get a get an actual usable product out. So basically like what we had was a product that didn't work at all.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:38.000
We had a demand side understanding of why people might come to us or why people might learn how to cook.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And then we had a bunch of ideas and I wrote it like from there it's like rooms not built in a day you just gotta get to building to the degree that you can take a step back.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And understand what's what are the options at your disposal, create as much contrast as you can.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Like I would, I do this with my team they used to hate it now like everyone does not literally like we're working with the game mechanics guy and we're forcing him to do it and I'm not even the one that recommended is like, We have an issue with activation.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
People aren't, people aren't coming on and starting to do the thing that we want them to do.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Yeah.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
So I think that we should create a small, mini experience. At the beginning that teaches them something.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Great. That sounds like a really good idea. What are 2 to 3 other ways that you can solve this activation problem?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And even if you end up coming back to the first, st way that you do it, it will be sharper for you, have for your having created the contrast.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000
In the different approaches that you can take. Does that make sense? That's like a

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Pretty important thing for like how we ultimately end up matching supply.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I mean, it makes sense to me. I'm more curious to see if other people. Other founders want to chime in and I think Brian through the question in the chat, Brian, do you want to say your question out loud to Jake?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Yeah, sure. So hi, hi, Jake. Pretty much we are a data company and we are going through the same problem.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
We are going through the same problem. Literally, we can have 200 sets of universities or investors.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And when somebody comes onto a platform and such is for their specific university. They completely discredit everything else we have.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:35.000
So I'm just curious, I mean, I know it's not, you know, talking it's not the one on the same thing but I'm just curious what incense did you gather Probably, jobs to be done in when you realize that hey people are coming and looking for a specific recipe on our platform they don't find it and because they don't find it they leave what, how did you solve for

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
that? Yeah.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So this again is gonna like come down to. I mean you guys have seen the why behind the why so you know like Again, there's not there's not much mystery to how we do this.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
This, this is good. Yeah, I remember you showed me this.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:01.000
But. Yeah, and this is like a reason work product is basically like We know that 2 things are going to trigger people to leave, but they're not the reason that they leave us.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
It's a budgeting event. So like a major life event happening or like us violating trust.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So we're the people that are going to teach you how to cook. But it's like we screw up scaling up or down in a recipe and it's like these guys are supposed to be the cooking people but they can't even do this small thing like how can they how can I trust them to do the big thing?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Those cause people to turn, but they've already essentially decided that they were going to turn before that.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
So what happens is like we essentially got 5 reasons. They complete all the levels in the app.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:39.000
So these guys have no nothing more to teach me. They're no longer anxious as a cook. So, we dearest and we call going from 0 to one incompetence to competence.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:47.000
And then we actually came to define like what are we currently believe incompetence means to somebody, what we believe confidence means to somebody.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
We are hoping that with something like this, it's actually 0 to one to 2 to 3 to 4.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000
And if we can, in a process bring someone from 0 to one, then we can essentially copy and paste that process moving forward.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:04.000
We have this was what we were talking about, which is essentially I saw your stuff on TikTok.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:13.000
I saw it on the food network and you didn't have that. I'm tired of seeing the same finite set of recipes in the app and then you're, too rigid.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:25.000
For me. So like you're forcing me to conform to a certain thing. And so what this allows me to do now is I mean, yeah, like I don't know if you're necessarily internalizing them, I do.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
So this is like, oh shoot, we have. 5 blinking red lights and the planes currently in there.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And so what we have to do is quickly prioritize. So to your point. I don't look at that pro the number 3 right now.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:51.000
We're not actually actively trying to solve it. We're trying to solve number 5 and we're getting really focused and how we want to solve number 5 and from there we'll go to number one and then from there we'll probably go to and then 3 and then 4 or maybe 3 than 2 than 4.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000
But it's like Once you have your set, it's like what is the most pressing problem?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:13.000
To solve and I we have believe it or not systems that we go about to solve what is like we'll prioritize based on those things.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Yeah.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Jake. Just, to be clear, like, Sorry, Brian.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Okay.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I, I just have to, Okay. Yeah, so I just have to throw a comment. I'm very impressed that you've taken the white before the why and you invited it and you've made a 2 lot of that is actually mind blowing man like after that is I'm just looking at that I'm just thinking a oh my gosh that's a very good defense against chart you know yeah

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Well, well. Okay.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Yeah. It's back. But push me, push me though, cause we can take it to, I wanna make sure that I get to the heart of your question as well.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
But.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Yeah.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Well, Jake, if I can help reinforce what's that being asked by Brian here. You had this question.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:57.000
I remember talking to you called me. We had a meeting and you were like We're trying to figure out how to understand why people are turning and we don't know.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
And maybe there's people in the room right now who have customers recently. And they're struggling to give them a talk to them and there's probably struggling to even know the proper answer to that.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:12.000
So one thing I wanted to call out with what you just showed. Is it didn't happen overnight.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Like you didn't just sit down with the team and then think of those 5 scenarios. There's a lot of work you had to do to figure out what those work, right?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Yeah.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So if you don't mind explaining the process that you went about actually understanding what and that would be helpful for everyone.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Is it a great point? It has to do with things not necessarily being zero-sum and we can also saw the question in the chat about the prioritization thing because that really does come into play is basically what I can to you deal with is that is not even necessarily the turn question, but basically like here are 10 different things that we can look at because the product isn't working the way that it's meant

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
to. Like I'm not We haven't broken even yet. The business is not. We're still trying to get things to click.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And so it's like, wow, we have so many different questions that we can investigate. Which one should we go after?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
And there are factors that go into that, how easy it is to get people on the phone is one.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:13.000
And then the other is how important it is. And we very quickly recognize like in that conversation it's like, yeah, bad churn is something that we really want to understand.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:23.000
At the same time, it's really hard to get turned customers on. So it's like, okay, we're gonna set up a cadence, but I can't say similar to the Wi-Fi the Y behind the Y that happened in 2 weeks.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Because it was basically like week number one, have all the conversations with number 2 cluster and write the article and it was a lot of work in 2 weeks.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:38.000
This one was a much longer project because what we do is when somebody spends all that time in the app and then turns, we'll email them $30 for 30 min.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
I mean, I'm more than happy to follow up with like what the format of we ended up sending out is, but like we essentially just beg turn users to get on the phone for money.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:28:04.000
And it's way more valuable to me for me to pay $300 to find out the information that I just shared than it is for me to pocket $300 and I don't know eventually like give it to amplitude or meta or like you know one of our vendors like And so it's.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:13.000
It was very important. Essentially understand what the questions are that we want to evaluate and then how many you saw there are like 3 active areas of research going on right now.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Now that can get a little bit confusing from time to time. So you want to really make sure that you keep it straight, but it's important because we're going to find out the answer to the dual lingo for cooking thing much quicker than we'll find out the next turn research that we're trying to we're trying to get to the bottom.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Jay, quick question. Oh, go, go ahead. You can go, yeah.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Hi.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Jake, hi everyone. Yeah, sorry. Do you follow, did you follow any framework for those questions?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Do you have any recommendation on how to repair and how to work inside internally on every single question that you do to the users.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
This is again where it's like, alright, we're gonna get deep, please try to push me if it's like, all right.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000
No, is unfortunately fortunately or unfortunately the answer this is what I do I do this to a piece of paper.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And I essentially like try to We record every conversation, already listen to the recordings so they're not quite there yet.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Different people will do this in different ways. So I've also seen people literally map the forces in real time.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:29.000
That to me is like way too, they're way too, that's like a level better than.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I could do it's like really nuts to watch. But I have this essentially this is just a program, a timeline of progress.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000
And so as somebody told their story, I'll mark. On the timeline where we are and I'll try to understand and then when they say weird words I'll essentially clarify.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:56.000
The key is, understanding what you're going after. Which is essentially what was the underlying progress that somebody was trying to make.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
When did they go from passive looking all the way through deciding. As long as you're within the ballpark of that then, when do they use relativistic language?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000
So seizing on relativistic language is a really easy way to like kind of level up your game, which is to say I wanted to cook healthier food.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:22.000
It's healthier than what? And so it's like creating and then I'll ask purposeful questions to create context and this is like kind of like a And then also contrast can help a lot.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:31.000
So it's like, I'll purposely get a very minor detail wrong. Or like a couple of things wrong when I'm repeating back.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:55.000
To somebody what they said because that actually then forces them to be like noble cause like no that's not right it was this thing because of this and then they'll like expose more information than before I think like again the key key is under like staying on the timeline of progress.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Should do it. How did you get your team to align on that system. I look how you you implemented this job suite on the framework, but it's like in the culture and fabric of your company now.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000
So where now when you have the conversation, it's a lot easier because you can tell when somebody's on their supply side thinking versus the mass I thinking.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:25.000
How did you get You're did that. What systems you put in place to align on, hey, we're, we're gonna focus on man side because you don't want to be the guy selling just.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Features for feature sake, we have a empathetic understanding of. What the problem is and we're going to tackle it.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
How did you like align on it?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Yeah. It's tough. I mean, so like this, it has to happen over time. Some people were all in right away.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Some people were more skeptical of it.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Ultimately, I'm building a cooking app. And if you put 10 people in a room and ask them to build a cooking at, they'll build 95% of the same product.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000
And so our opportunity is gonna be one along the margins. That's probably true for most of the businesses here is like the actual.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Business needs to be one along the margin and what can you do to position yourself or think differently? Than other people.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
It is undeniable that it will, it's just.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:22.000
It projects a different level of thinking. Once this is fully implemented. And that becomes very clear externally.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
There's another kind of subsect or subcategory as you guys get into pit pitching where it's like I need to be able to confidently and concisely express these ideas.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:50.000
This is not the forum where I'm doing that, right? Like I, my essential understanding and again, we can tighten this if not is this is just like freaking knowledge don't don't time won't just like rant but essentially like in external you'll be like my CTO slower to accept this than say the head of our design.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And what made him way more into it was you sat in a pitch or like, yeah, it was a pitch.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:09.000
And he's like, oh, damn, like we sound so unbelievably competent. Because, once you have this I mean, toss this up one more time, but like.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:20.000
This is what you're going to see. Like. Like this is the maximum that anyone ever will be exposed to.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
If that makes sense. Like, if they're just gonna look at it and be like, they have a good brand.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
And you know, like you can just like sit there and laugh and be like, yeah, we have a good brand.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:39.000
You know, it's just like the users need. You need something. So if there are other ideas to sharpen this, I would advise doing it.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Our version of Shape Up is like, It's like the Protestant version to like the Basecamp Catholic version, you know, like it's we don't actually like do it the exact same way that they did it, but we evolved over time to have it fit what we needed from it.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:03.000
And then we have honest like mentors and brokers who keep us on track when things are a little bit if it's cutting a corner versus, you know, customizing a process.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Awesome. Thank you.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I think one reference to validate we just said Jake is beyond just your CTO acknowledging it during a pitch, but could you provide a few, maybe one other example of a context where you realize that having this way of thinking about your business has been official.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Yeah.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Like I'm thinking about maybe That's the Koya Pitch that you had to come into town and give or I don't know if there's been other contexts where like I want the founders to understand like what they're hearing right now like It's not just conjecture and it's not just.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Like we're not over intellectualizing this notion like I think what you just said is very important for people to internalize and understand.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Well, I mean, like the reality is Like. Grandma, I would laugh. So we have like, you know, a quarter 1 million of people who follow us on and engage with us in social media and people hop on the phone with Graham and they're like, wow, I really want to do TikTok.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
TikTok will be very important for our business. How should we do it? And there's 2 ways that the conversation goes.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
One is like this very open, intellectually open, honest discussion on what it takes to set that up.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000
What is right for you? Like what are the mental benchmarks that you should go through to understand what channels for acquisition will work for you and your brand.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000
The other is make good content. You know, and like, I think the version of that for this is like, Go get traction.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:33.000
And it's like if you can get Traction for your business. Now this is the point of like so many people end up plateauing because there are people who, you know, I worked at Meta for I made it to a VP level.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
And that I go went down to my own business. I immediately closed a bunch of clients. And now I can't understand why they're continuing to pay me.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
And that's like, I raised Series A and I completely tap out. And a lot of companies go under that way.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
For us. We're playing in a highly fragmented field where like mine chairs had a premium.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
This is ultimately going to be an advantage when we invert it when we turn on our head or reach scale.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
But for now, huge uphill. It's like a moat. It's why it's hard is also going to be why it's better for us later on.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And so the answer is we needed to build good product in an amount of time. Before we go out of business.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
And it's like, okay, go do it. How are you going to do it? And we needed a way to do it.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:21.000
And this is our way, right? Good, Neil, to your point like, yes, like you ultimately end up sitting in rooms with people who have heard.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Great pitches and I happen to actually like when we pitched the Sequoia meeting, we pitch it with like 6 or 7 other 6 companies.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
We're saying next house and they literally ranked the companies and it was like everybody got an honorable mention other than us and one other team.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Were like were the ones who could articulate what we were trying to solve. And so it ultimately shows, but what they're benchmarking behind is that traction and how you get that traction.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Like. You know, like, are you trying to like diet an exercise or you trying to just like stop drinking water for a week and a half?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:37:01.000
It's like, you'll lose weight both ways, but one way you're gonna be able to keep it off and the other way it's going to be a lot harder once you start like, you know, doing what you need to do to live.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:21.000
And so it's like, I, it's, it's a tough. To me it is hard to underestimate how important this type of Approaches but again I cannot stress you just happen to have put yourself in a position where you are around the masters of a certain way of thinking.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And so it's like, to me, it's like, cool. Yes, sense. Like let learn from the people that can know that but if you want to like go out and chart your own path and creating these systems for thought and how to work, that is also a viable alternative.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000
It's just like You need something. It's like you gotta have something or else you will be.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Building. Like on the skinny or teeth trying to like close contracts barely getting through it's just gonna be a mess And so it's like, I don't know, this is what, you know, creates order.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:05.000
You also gotta be very comfortable with the. That's, that's a different thing.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Cool. I know I saw.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Alright, founders, it's a jump all like you guys can talk to Jake. This time is yours.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:24.000
I saw one in the chat on prioritization. I can Toss up the way that we think on that.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
So basically what we'll do is we create a set of. Like ideas for like, here's everything that we could do right now.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:39.000
And then you end up whittling it down. You narrow it down. But like, so for example, in this situation, like there are 4 things that we could do.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:51.000
I create like 4 little bubbles here. I then like Matt. So, for option number one, will option one directly lead with the work we do directly lead into option number 2.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Well, if it does, I draw an arrow going into from one into 2. Same for one to 3, same for one to 4.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:06.000
That means like when I'm done, 2 errors go out of option one. I then do this like just to lead into one.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
If yes, draw that arrow to eat into 3 if yes, draw that arrow to lead into 4. No, no arrow going out from 2 and 4.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:22.000
There are 2 going out again. I mean, I go around the circle and I do this and all you see like at the very end I have 3 arrows going in and 2 going out.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Of this option I think that yeah in in that creates what we call like it says the natural priority of work so it's basically like what is the option that we will take right now that will open up the most doors for us.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:42.000
And in this case, Option 4 leads out into 3 different things. This then goes into a tie.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:49.000
And so what we do at a time, like you can get like a little bit, you know, triggered, but as a rule of thumb, the way that we'll do it is option 4 leads to the most options.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Next we choose to do 3. Because 3 leads to an equal number of options as these other ones, but there's fewer ways to actually get there.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:06.000
So 2, there's only 2 things going in, but everything goes out. And then from here, the same thing then goes again.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
These ones are a tie. So you could go to one or 1, 2 depending on your own process.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:25.000
We do this for like literally large numbers. Things so like when there are more than 4 to 6 of these it gets very confusing to do by

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Oh, let's see. I gotta open up Excel. It gets very confusing, to hit like circle and then you have like a million different lines.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
And so I've essentially created a.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Diagram here. I've created a little Excel sheet that just does it for me. At this point.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And so this is literally the same thing. It's 2. Does 2 go into one? Yes, 3 going to one.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Yes. To 4 going to one, yes. And you just go down the column and you do it for everything.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:10.000
And it creates a natural priority of work that is created down here and then clarified over here. And so this is how we like will ruthlessly, ruthlessly, we say ruthlessly prioritized, right?

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
And what it also lets you do is like, this was we did for the game. This is real inside baseball.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:29.000
This is one that we just used and we had too much work and so there's this expression at base camp which I forget who brought up Jeremy was saying about, how to get team buy in.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
I don't have team buy in on this phrase, but I use it anyway because I like the praise and that's it's better to create a kick-ass hat than a half-assed hole.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:44.000
And it's like we had to cut. Half the stuff on this list. Because it's better to ship.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Project done to our degree right in our set period of time, then it is to either stretch the amount of time we don't compromise on the timeline or ship.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:04.000
You know, some like mediocre done. Feature for all this stuff.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
What's happening then?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:14.000
I have a question about this. So what is leading into mean in this context? You say one leads into 2 or 3 leads into 4.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Can you give us an example maybe with the, yeah, with this spreadsheet or something like that.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, here are 8 different things that we can do for our game.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:33.000
It's a little bit deep to like this is one of those things where I don't it's gonna be hard for you to know the level of context that you guys need for this to make any sense whatsoever.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
So I don't wanna go on rants about what I'm working on, but if it's just I'll keep it high level and then be like it still doesn't make sense and then I'll go lower level.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Basically like we could design onboarding and user placement for the app. We could create a new menu, we could create a new discover page, but create better recipe selection, redo our paywall, do 2 different features that impact our diary or a journal, or do side press.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:43:02.000
So there's a main question, zesta game, and their main question, there's main quest to the game, and then there are a side quest that you can get.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:10.000
And what we looked at, for example, the clear winner here, was the just,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:25.000
This discover page, which had 5 things going out of it, 3 things going into it. And the reason that you would do discover, for example, before onboarding is that it probably makes sense that you need to do You have to know what you're onboarding people into.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:46.000
And so like, this is the type of stuff. That, that example is very obvious, but, there, there will always without fail be like one or 2 things that are in different spots than you would actually think that they were because it's just too hard at least for me personally to like hold all these different permutations in my head of like what we could do in one order. And so then passion naturally takes over.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000
I like this idea more than that idea. And this is to de-risk. That passion. It's not to negate it.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Again, these are just different styles, but I certainly will index here so that I can then bring it to my team and then they're like, but we need this and it's like, yeah, well that diary actually isn't really gonna move the needle for us.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:13.000
We need to do all this error. It might, it might be a great idea, but we have to do this other stuff to make it make any sense or else we're going to have to redo it anyway.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Receive that help.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
I think we'll just jump to Ali, maybe, or maybe Mitch is not on.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Thank you, Jake. And, yeah, it

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
And It might have interrupted, but I'm here.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Did that help me too?

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Yes, okay, so I didn't hear that question if that's what the question was at the end.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
I see. So it's like you need, in order to build feature B, that's what means that feature A leads the feature.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Correct. Sometimes it will be a little bit more gray than that, but. Yes. You'll see like when you actually do it, it's like, darn, this kind of does it and then you have to like decide how you're going to run the process that time.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Hmm.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
So it's not, it's not entirely binary.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Ali, I think.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Yeah, mine was a follow-up similar to Murcha. I was gonna ask, is it always a matter of workflow or is it more infrastructure like, you know, I can't build B without A or, you know, I can build B, it will be more effective with A and we see and that's where the grace start coming in like.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I tend to be deals. I tend to be partial to the latter and I'll show why is you can actually have it going both ways.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:42.000
It's not entirely dependent. This is not a good, it's not an exercise of dependencies, but rather, increased or better optimized like workflow.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Is we're 2 resource constrained to do one and 2 at the same time.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Cool. I'll check in. So, Pay Jake, thanks for being here.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Me too.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
This is really, really fun. So. It's amazing. So.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
I'm curious, it's going to give you the number of idea in that instance with the Excel sheet.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:26.000
You had a number of ideas that you wanted to work on. Number of features that you wanted to. They haven't read shape up yet, but, essentially at the end of shape of this thing called the betting table.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
And maybe Jacob can talk a little bit about that, but I'm curious how this work quantitatively.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Okay, quantitative approach to making a feature. Is wait for that. Yeah.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:46.000
This is my Victoria Hunt sword. At the betting table. It's like I Everybody comes prepared with.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:54.000
With me and my team, like we all will say we fight all the time. Yeah, our best we fight about the right things.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000
And we've actually like. This is like where it's like, okay, he's he's obviously like kinda wired.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
He's a little bit crazy, but he's like, I know, he's actually pretty crazy.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Is like, this is how we debates, you know, and so like literally like we'll have like, we had to get better at this because like sometimes it's very easy in these highly emotional situations where people are super, to, essentially have ego.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Leak in and it's like, okay, how can we check that? In our conversations. The betting table is like full body contact.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Founding a company. Like it's just No, no holds barred. And so everybody comes with essentially their ideas of what we believe that we should work on.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
This is my, this is what I bring to it because we'll have times we just had betting day last week.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000
And it was honestly like it was like a pass through. It was like we actually kind of knew the work that we needed to get done over the course of the next 6 weeks.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:14.000
We already had it relatively shaped. There were fewer cards on the table. Easy. We also have like crazy aggressive like it could be this it could be that it could be this one like your I think it should be this one like betting days in that this is where it helps for me, to just come and be like, well guys, I think this is what I will say is I circulate it to my team

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:30.000
like 24 h in advance. So like I'm not coming and being like, oh, it's interesting that you think that this is the priority because, man, and like trying to, like, there are no surprises here, but it's like, I just want to, you know, it's really hard.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:38.000
They're like 8, we've had like 20 ideas. Fully shaped. That's where like framing comes in play too when you guys read shape up.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:48.000
I extremely like I could not recommend more highly, particularly for building companies at our stage to frame. Ideas before you shape them.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000
It's like a new part of the process that Ryan is like now writing into a book I think but like it is.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Of most importance. Cross.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Can you elaborate on what framing is just briefly?

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Okay. So basically like I know that Ryan and Bob, but maybe, just Ryan is currently working on like a new shape up that's not just kind of base camp specific.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:20.000
What we do is essentially there is shaping the idea which is essentially creating an idea of what a solution might look like within the current context of the system.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Before that, we do something called framing. Framing is validating a business case to work on the solution right now.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And it essentially, table or kill ideas in the crib. To make sure that they don't end up getting too far.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
So the way that we do that, this is our template for shaping. We have like a bunch of questions.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:58.000
That you'll answer on a pitch you guys will like get into this when you do the shape of process before you ever do it though you gotta talk about the opportunity problem that you're solving for who when do they feel it what data research do we have to back it up in the plainest English what problem are you solving?

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:07.000
After you do that, it's the outcome. How of users life be different. This is again like, Jeremy, you were talking about how to make sure that you have collected buy in.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:14.000
It needs to infect your company culture. So this is not outcome what KPIs will be driven by the result of this experiment.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:29.000
It's What is changing the users life? What in their story is different now and that's a demand side question versus the supply side oriented ones and then you have prioritization so like which users are effective, how valuable are they to the company versus other ones?

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Contrast it with whatever else we could do, isn't worth our time right now. And this will be like, okay, this is a really, cause there's always passion.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
It's always like, dang, this is a really good idea. Like I can give you a.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Like cooking, tracker for zest. I love this idea and Julie, my one of my founding team members loves this idea.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
This idea is not clearing framing. Julie doesn't know yet, but this idea is not getting passed for anything.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:08.000
I like, I just, I'm again, as somebody that's passionate about it, know that it's just, I've done the mental math and we'll put it, I'll be in all actually honest and I'll do the process with it, but I just can't see a world where we have other things going on that this is the right time to deal with shaping a solution.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
And that allows you then to shape more honestly. And that allows you then to shape more honestly because you can shape more holistically.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:23.000
You can think about it almost like. Forces your attention to the right. Areas of the problem in the right moment.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:31.000
So Jake, just quickly, as I'm seeing you like kind of show all these different processes that you have written out.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:41.000
I what I've noticed about you is that whenever there's something that comes up at the company that's like a struggling moment, you tend to default to designing a system.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:50.000
To prevent that from happening again, where you'll come up with some kind of documentation process. Whereas like I think a lot of folks right now might just and start a plan.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:58.000
We just kinda like wing it and kinda figure it out and kinda do our best to figure out how to prioritize something and do our best to resolve the disagreement or to make the team member.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000
So what brings you over the edge by default? Always documented for the system in place. You don't have to repeat yourself.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Recidivism. So like if the problem comes up Oh, in our we say 2 times what that might mean is like 4 times though if it continues to rise and it's like dang this is that thing again and it can manifest very differently.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.000
We'll build, will like put something in place. And again, it doesn't have to be the end of the world.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:40.000
It's just like, let's put documentation on this. So next time, I don't need to start from square 0 because ultimately like these the success of these systems compound on one another so I move a little bit slower in the moment to write 4 sentences on how 4 bullet points on how we debate, for example, but it saves me so much time next time.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:53.000
And I can give an example of one that's come up relatively recently. Communication in terms of do I need to give you progress on an idea that is fully in my lane, but a concern that you brought to me?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:02.000
It came up on culinary. I have a recipe recommendation that I like love. And I would give it to Julie and who's our head of colony, nothing would ever happen with it.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.000
It's like, easy not happening because she doesn't like it. Is not happening because she forgot about it is not it's very uncomfortable because like.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Like this is a blood sport and we're like charging for it and this is my team and I can't be walking behind me when I'm trying to like make progress towards our ultimate goal.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Another one was bugs for, these are 2 completely seemingly separate issues, but it ran into the same thing.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Hey, we were reporting a bug. Nothing comes back. Turns out they're all getting fixed, but I don't know.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:31.000
I don't know if he's building something else if it's getting lost. Like literally had no process around that.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
And so it's like, oh, there are 2 types of like points of feedback, random points of feedback on team.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
There's a 1 which is basically like, I came across this recipe on TikTok.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
I just want, I'd be remiss if I didn't share this with you. But I never need to hear about it.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Like I'm just like, I know that I would like to share with you. And there's a 2, which is like, Hey, this is actually something that I saw that was stressing me out quite a bit.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Can you update me? And we have like check in like points to update. Just like let me know when it's taken care of and the person knows it and I know it and like now you know it's much easier to avoid that type of problem but like it's not like Oh, I don't know what's happening.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:15.000
It takes several times of this Julie thing happening. And then several times the bug thing happening. And then a couple other stuff and it's like, this is a system problem.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Like this is our team. I don't like blame the people. It's generally it's a failure on our like my part, right?

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:31.000
To make sure that people are set up. Best to succeed. And so, yeah, it's anything that you can see, ultimately lean to like multiplicative returns.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
It's like, okay, yeah, like we should put this in place because we'll move faster.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:43.000
It's like I no longer have to be worried about this. All takes up space. And I just, yeah, like I just, I'm not, good enough.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.000
You know, like I'm not smart enough to like have it all hearing more, mentalized fully and just like, I just like need, I, set it and forget it.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
I don't think about things. I just have it set up so that like I can be present. Like it's hard enough to be present.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000
So. It's like, yeah.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Thank you, Jake. And I'll just say that there's attributes like that and how you think thinking about that that I think signal to other people.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Namely investors, but also others. To want to support you because they're They're fascinated by a founder who can think about putting systems in place for scale at this early stage.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000
So those are some indicators that are more intangible and less like objective traction based or metric based decision making.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:34.000
That we tend to evaluate as investors. So I just wanted to call that out for everybody to be here.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Yeah, evidently attention to detail matters when you're asking for a 7 figure check.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Ally, I think you had a question.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Yes, thank you. So would you show being discipline with all these systems and following the process?

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Hmm.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:03.000
A is a lot of work and and you have so many ideas to frame to shape and so on. How do you assign ownership within the team, particularly when it's very small?

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Yeah.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:23.000
And how do you avoid bias if there's only one owner gathering the data and framing something? That you know i mean jTV kind of like eliminate the bias but if you only have one person you know that it's 1 interpretation to be a little that framing and all that shaping.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:32.000
No, yeah, so it's a great question. There needs to be,

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Again, like this is like, I, you know, an interesting part of this founding journey for me has been the seeds of a worldview that feel like they begin to form right.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000
So I don't necessarily like. One very important thing. It seems like a lot of work to maintain these systems.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000
I have no ego attached to these systems. Like if they stop working, it's because they're breaking and I gotta find out why they're breaking and just like.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Fix it, right? So it's like, I, they're actually designed in certain ways to, to collapse.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000
And once they do, that's when we adjust this. It's not working for us anymore.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:09.000
It should like at their best when It's a rupture repair cycle with where like your relationship is with the company.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
It's like when things break, you just figure out why they're breaking, but it should at its best feel like like handing love.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Like this is how it should be working. We use a system for prioritization or for ownership called AORs.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:30.000
It stands for areas of responsibility. I believe Apple is the one that's started it. But the way that it works is at the highest level of company ownership.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.000
There's a directly responsible individual for everybody. You then can have all unlimited backups, but the buck stops with this person.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Huge this is again like you start to like once the system is stand up other stuff might get easier so like a huge blow fights about something not getting done is not because you're stupid and lazy and weren't thinking about it.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:56.000
It's because the AORs weren't worked out right. Literally without fail. Like it's like when they're right, You're the AR.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:07.000
You were wrong. Yes, I was the AOR. I am responsible for that. I and I need to tell through or like I was it was clearly delegated enough that someone knew that they were supposed to do it.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:16.000
So, you'll see like this is, they stay relatively. High level for us in this set they go like a little bit so like database admin is on.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:24.000
That's my CTO here. We have different, you know, at this point it's fairly robust, but it didn't start this way.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Them over time as things break. You try your best at 1st to set it up and what I do is every I, I can check for an actual number here, cause I know it's next week on Tuesday.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:46.000
2 months, we have a designated time to go in and remove things that are no longer relevant. And then we also will Yeah.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Add throughout. So like in that rupture moment, like in when a DRI fails, like we just look here and we tend to just added.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:09.000
There's like companies change. So then within that, for pitching and we actually detail like again, like I'm not, I'm not like, this is just, it's a way that works for us, but like we have the breakdown of like how shape-up works for our company here.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
We've essentially rewritten the book, but it's like kind of like shorter just for us.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Pitch composition roles. Each pitch has a lead in sports squad. There's only allowed one lead.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:28.000
And they're directly responsible for bringing the page from start to finish. Sword squad is there to either lead or help, help the lead out as needed.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.000
This should be armed out before the cards move to giraffes, which is when we actually shape this stuff out.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Here. Okay. So backup. I don't even need to read it off from this, but essentially like the backup on framing is ideally if there is a product level, expertise required.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:56.000
So like if there's technical expertise, if there's acquisition-based act, I should not be creating an acquisition strategy for META with my other co-founder who does nothing on those platforms.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I should be doing it with the person who's responsible. If that doesn't exist, I want to do it second order priority is with someone who vehemently opposes the idea.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Again, like we have why we debate. This is a big problem for us. Is like people say, no, I don't like it like things like that.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Bad debate. Yeah. I don't like it because. No because.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Create the contrast and then like you guys can actually litigate or, litigate the problem together.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:27.000
3rd order priority is just anybody on the team. So it's basically like, do I need a technical person on this call? So it's basically like, do I need a technical person on this call?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Does anybody object to this to their core? Does anybody object to this to their core? Do they really not like it?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And then if there's none of those, then we meet with. Just like somebody else tell.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Shape this thing out. So again for cooking tracker me, Julie, we happen to really like it.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It's only 2, so it's normally a lead and then a support squad that's just cause like we're a bootstrap team.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000
But, I'm not, I don't like this idea at all. And so because of that, like we have.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
A framing session set up with 3 of us. Julie is responsible for getting on the calendar.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Julie is responsible for making sure everybody's there. Julie is responsible for making sure that everybody has the right information in the right amount of time because she's believed she's the DRI.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And once you have kind of that set up, you don't even have to think about it. Public.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Was one of your areas of responsibility to put up with the AOR system in place at the very beginning.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Yeah. So yeah, and I love it. So you don't even understand, but this is great, right?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Because money where my map is like, okay, cool. Do they actually like do this thing and it's like, alright.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah. Maintain. Look, correct down here. Right above development, line right above development.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
That's amazing. I missed that difference.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Right. So it's like, we do it like I'm not just like, I didn't prepare, Neil didn't like email me to prepare things for this call.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Okay.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
We actually. We actually have it. Oh, yeah, what's up, Nelson?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Cool. I could jump in. Yeah, so, you talked a lot about product prioritization.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I like the AOR thing because I think that's an interesting way to divide up responsibility and keep people honest.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
So that's that's cool. I'm curious about your approach to management and communication, right?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:16.000
So. I'm not sure how big your company is. So if you could give us a idea of like the scale that you're working with.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And then describe the systems. Where the approaches you're using for number one, situational awareness like you're the CEO, you gotta know what's going on.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Number 2. One of the things I ran into my last company was decision making. Like it took a long time to make decisions.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:39.000
It took a long time to make sure that people were on board with decision. So if you could talk a little bit about.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:46.000
How you know what's going on and then number 2. Like how decisions get made, implemented, tracked.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And closed out. I'd love to learn more about that.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I may. I'm gonna hit the system. Systems that come to mind.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
If I miss anything though, do let me know. There's like a level of EQ responsible.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:16.000
We just made this thing, so I actually don't know. This is like a newer addition to the Wiki, but like how people give and receive feedback.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I have 6 core team members plus like a couple of contractors. But like we were really trying to build a lean like the contractors are like a subject matter expert in game mechanic design, you know, who's referred to us by like multiple parties and like.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Is we're pretty tight in our understanding there.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I wanted just because there's gonna be a lot that we do that I may miss and I apologize in advance if I do that I may miss and I apologize in advance if I do because I just not I don't have an itemized list for situational awareness.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I batch what I want to talk to people about and I have weekly one on ones. I recently started recording.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:07.000
These one on one's essentially the format is as follows agenda items that I want to cover. Things that the person can do to improve in their role.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Things that I can do to better support them in their role and how, what I can be doing to better improve in my role.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And it's meant to be an open forum. One on one, we'll talk about this stuff.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I prefer to batch things just because I hate one off request, but that's like a personal.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Thing. We didn't do, we call it a retro. It's not really a retro, but we have an hour and a half meeting every week, the core 6 of us, we're probably going to cap it at 6 as we continue to grow the company and will create smaller versions of this meeting.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:46.000
But it's essentially a no holds bar discussion, a showcase of last week of work, plus like There it's very emotional, emotionally charged.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:54.000
So things that are ragging on people that they need to bring up. If you want to check in on what's going on or the progress being made on certain cards.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:01.000
There is a tremendous amount of trust built into our company. And so there are 2 things that.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:11.000
We are like extremely, extremely strict on. One is, if I say verbal agreements, the, the importance of verbal agreements.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
If I say I'm going to get something done, I'm going to go get something done.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And I'm going to get it done in the set period of time that I say that I'm going to get done.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And if not, I'm going to tell you as far in advance. As possible so the issue is in like so for example we have a mid cycle check and we scope work for 6 weeks like I mentioned through shape up.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.000
We'll check in mid-cycle but even before like we check in throughout the course of the week, Hey, I, as I've been getting this under my belt, I think we're gonna need to make trade-offs.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:47.000
We're gonna have to like get rid of this stuff and get this in so it doesn't come to ship date and it's like where is this one thing that we were so excited about it's like there are no real surprises because our natural moments check in along the way.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:58.000
But also like, I don't need to, you know, Like I'm not trying to give out hall passes like I just want you to go do what you need to do and I want natural moments for us to like have this type of.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
This type of communicate could have cadence. The other is a respected value for people's time.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And so like we show up and start meetings like on the dot. And you know it's funny is I came to entrepreneurship through Neil.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I found my 1st company coming out of this class at school. And so like his 1st day, the 1st thing he ever told us was, 5 min early is on time, on time is late.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And that's, that's literally our company because it's like, you start a meeting.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I've been meeting with 4 people. I show up 5 min late. I am showing up 5 min late.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I've wasted 5 min of my time, but I've wasted 15 min of their time because there are 3 people who had to wait 5 min.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And to me that's unacceptable. That's a lack of respect. So this type of stuff is Believe it or not, codified.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You're really making me now I'm like I feel like like one of those when the FDI raids my house I'm just like have all the diagrams like my manifestos up.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
This is awesome, Jake.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I don't, don't you don't think about it ultimately but like We have a team charter.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And the team charter is adhered to. And so like you can literally see, I would click into it, we require like bouncing around the share we can if we want to, but scoping work is mentioned accountability, work for the team, present and participate.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:23.000
That's like. I hate I'm very, I hate wasting time. And so like my thing is like, I like if you're there and don't need to be there, don't beat it.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Like I don't care but just don't be there, you know, like it versus like if you're, it's just like it's a waste for everybody.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And so figuring out that whole thing. The last thing I would say here on decision making is trust in the directly responsible individual to be accountable to the decisions that they're making.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000
This is something that like full transparency, like go-founder therapy set, you know, game off founder therapy session for a minute.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I've been dealing with recently because I'm empowering the product to decisions on my team and decisions are sometimes made that I wouldn't have made myself.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But I have to check that and understand like, again, if we're aligned in process and if we're engaging in this wholeheartedly.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
If I think their process was good, again, but I wouldn't agree with like who am I to say that what they came up with was bad and what I came up with is good.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Necessarily articulated and also how much more progress will we able to make because I was able to trust this group to come up with something in the meantime.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
This compounds over time though. I will say. And so like AORs need to be really, really tight.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Like, I don't want my marketing person thinking about our, our finance, I don't want him managing our financial model.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
He needs to be, he is deeply in our financial model, but like I'm the one that's going in and like.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Changing that stuff or driving major changes to our spending plan. Alongside him and That's important to me.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000
He doesn't want me going into our ad manager and like messing around with what we have going on over there.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And so yeah, it's It's certainly, you know, it's a growth path, but you just kinda like put these natural things in place to deal with it.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Super helpful, thanks.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
For sure.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Belaria. Go ahead.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Okay, yeah, I was gonna ask so Max and I, we're just 2 person team right now.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Yeah.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
We're like in the starting phases of trying to figure out and make sure that all of our core values are aligned, but we haven't really started jotting it out into like detail pages like this like I've just begun experimenting like with our interns having them document processes like you said if it happens more than twice there should be a guideline for it like at what point did you start doing this and like was that a

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:48.000
good time to start doing it or do you wish you had started earlier if so like how do you figure out when to dedicate that time to it and like what to prioritize.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Which I guess the prioritization like table or game might be the 1st step in this process.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Yes. To the last one.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Like.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I think.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:27.000
If you were forced to move to a foreign country where you can't We know nothing of anything. There like almost like a alien planet.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:39.000
There will naturally be foundational things that you would take care of before. Others. You'll probably figure out how to eat before you start learning the language.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:47.000
But quickly after these basic. Areas are taken care of. You're going to learn ways to actually live in the place that you are now situated.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I think it's very easy in this journey to not necessarily take the slowly compounding steps because it doesn't feel like the right time.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I think at this point you guys are in tech stars like you're this far through program. To not stand these up.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Is a disservice to have to do it all at once is daunting and like spoiler alert also will not like none of it will be done right right away because what I'm showing you is gonna change from Lauren like it's just like to have something in place.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:25.000
So one is I'm assuming that everyone is filed correctly. That's like gonna be without saying, but like from a legal compliance standpoint, make sure that like.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
You're an actual company that's incorporated and like stuff like that. Like you don't wanna like.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
It's like with the fun, like don't be like. You know, we're a Wyoming S-corp and it's like What?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Like, why don't do that. And then the other side of it though is like that team charter, for example.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I think that was the 1st thing that we did is like slowly starting to stack this stuff. Recommending a book.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Just book takes the cape for the ratio of worst title to most tactically useful information. A great CEO within.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Is indispensable in terms of like AORs are detailed in there and like essentially what great CEO thing did is like hear a bunch of ideas for what an AOR could be.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I tried a bunch of them out. Some of them didn't like some of them were complete gibberish nonsense for what our company is.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
We had our 2 month check-in and so by the 3rd two-month check-in we like pruned it.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And this is also a good example, Jeremy, for like the buy-in thing. Is like i IA team member who is like, these ALRs are ridiculous.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And then like by the 3rd cycle of doing then it was like these are ridiculous. And it's like, why are they ridiculous?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Because you never do that thing. And it's like, okay, let's get rid of it.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
And I never do this thing. And it's like, okay, let's get rid of that one.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And then it was like, and I also do this thing. And it's like, okay, now that's there.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And it's like, Oh, dang, this is highly representative of how it works. And now it's like literally it will function that way.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:08.000
All of, all of it, like this is just an incredibly frustrating journey in compounding. Compounded growth in systems and like things that you don't think will pay off in do in ways that you might not necessarily recognize.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I would say like prioritize, create a timeline for when you want to get stuff done. Make sure that it gets done in a long in accordance with the other things that you have to work on.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000
So you don't need to like, again, the temptation is when you don't have a lot of this stuff set up, it's like, I gotta get it done by Monday.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Because if I don't get it done, then I can't move on to the next thing.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:41.000
It's like, well. Slow down like there's actually like a lot of time and we gotta you gotta make sure you're working on the right thing in the right order.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Okay, have like a quick follow-up to that. So 1st of all, that was awesome. Thank you.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Second of all, I was going to ask, is it possible, obviously not to show the content of your notion, but like the framework that you've used in built, cause like that's the platform we're using and like that I think the comment said it best.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Like that's the most like genius organization I've seen on notion yet. And so yeah, would that be possible?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Yeah, yeah, but you're not gonna like the answer. I'm pretty sure there's a pre templated wiki format.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:25.000
On notion if you just like do the wiki template it will set up it'll set you up like that and what we did is we have like a little archive, you know, say the notion references or something at the bottom.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And that's just like at the bottom of the page and we've just put our thing on top of it.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Yes. Yeah.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Yeah, and then to be clear, plus about the, template, it's more about the mental.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Muscles that get developed to even think to go into documents.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Right. And it's muscle is a good word again because it's like

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000
You know, it's hard and it's hard to get into working out when you're like tiny and gawkey and stringy, but like.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.000
What this be like a thing that you are actually committed to building muscle in, versus kind of the one off.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Habits. It's just like

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Yeah, I don't know. It's a fairly good way to de-rest the experience of building this.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You know, it's at least we had an approach. We can't say we didn't have an approach.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
So.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
So they got they got 11 min left. So.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Yeah, so just, I just wanna, for I think it was Ali mentioned it for us, and given some concept of the answers to be done.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Many at times. System dilation does happen sometimes it's just not that the system is broken but system dilation basically you have a situation steps are not followed in the contents that they were created initially created or there is pressure from external factor that really completely pushes you to just jump a step or skip the process.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:09.000
We have a way to ensure a rain system, you know, when you're creating most of the system, there's a lot of.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.000
However, they actually, application, yes down the line. There's normally that temptation to that system.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Do you have anything that you counter that, you know, physical checks and balances that really reinforce them?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Okay.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Yeah, and this is a really nice circle question. Is This is in lab work. So there are factors beyond your control that will be influencing this process, similar to jobs now.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Hey, I have this insight and I need to apply it to my business. There's gonna be a lot, but our fume date is in 3 months and it's like, And that does rightfully impact the way that you should be thinking about these things.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
That's said.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Having the systems in place tends to help. And so like I use this phrase rupture and repair and that truly is what we do here is like if the system I'm not running a physics experiment in a lab where like I get to pull a little ball back and see how far it travels across the room.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I'm like pulling back the catapult on, you know, I'm on the shore and the enemy boats are outside and we got a fire fire this thing and hit the ship right so it's like it now there's wind now there's rain now there's like a lot of stuff going on and you have to be able to function in that environment.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Not in the environment that like makes sense in this perfect lab. And flexibility is what I have found matters there.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
So I view it less is dilution if it's happening repeatedly it may be a rupture in the system that then needs to be shifted.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Hey, our approach here doesn't really work anymore. We just had this our 16 member is an engineer.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And it's like, and he's worked with our CTO for a decade in the past.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.000
So they're not skipping a beat. They're like they can code or all this on our capacity as it relates to shipping.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Chipping is like way higher. It's like, oh shoot shape-up just completely broke. Cause like we used to have one designer, one developer.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
We would the cadence was totally understood. Now it's like, are we betting on enough work?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Is it too little work? We don't know. And it's like, we really quickly need to find out because our business is.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:25.000
As have to like our problems are just as existential as those facing anybody else. And so it becomes just when it is a repeated breach.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.000
What needs to change, how do the systems that plan need to change because they're all flexible. You were the one that created them.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:38.000
It's like this is where Yeah, we're functioning like within our own lanes or zones of filtering information and pollution.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Hopefully I can like, I think at my best I will remain conscious of that and like, you know, when I.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Ultimately falter, stumble and fall will be when I have lost track of that. Like in hindsight I will look back and be like, wow, I was way too fixed or less humble than I should have been or something like that to the way that we were running our our company.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Gotcha, Mark, I just said, let's just let me log with the mic for a minute here.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:10.000
The other thing that I want to move back to the interviews, to what extent. Do you still keep the interview centralized to you?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000
You know, cause one thing I'm learning very quickly is, yeah, it's great for the CEO to be in the room.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:23.000
But the engineers, you know, if you tell engineers to design a box, they'll design a box and they don't have the empathy, the thing needs to be.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Do you get them involved in some shape or form in the interests other than listening to the recordings or reading the transcripts, for the jobs interviews?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Yeah, so we did based on interest. So I had a team member who was like, I really want to see what this is like and she has gotten involved.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:20:04.000
We also stole something so intercom runs on JavaScript. And when they onboard new employees, they'll source interviews, they'll literally pay to source interviews with clients that they you know like I can tell based on how you did onboarding that you're going to be a good customer interview, and they will have the new interview you sit in and we did that with our 6 hire.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:13.000
He sat in on 3 interviews to hear what it's like. We told him in advance we were like we're gonna have because at this point the jobs don't change unless the context of the world.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Drastically changes, these jobs don't change. Our understanding of them might be sharpened, but it's like No global pandemic then like guess what when I move in with my partner and I don't know how to cook and I'm giving them day old chicken and rice and like expecting to pass it off as dinner and hey this is the rest of your life like yeah I'm gonna like there's gonna be pressure on me

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:39.000
to change that. And so like we've found that gain buy in from the new employees, obviously really important.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Otherwise though, It just has to be core. Like I did like the person like I was talking to Jeremy about who might not have bought in on this like has said to me multiple times.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Recently, like our competitive advantage is our understanding of our customer. This is not something that I ever would have thought that person would have told me.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Was the one who had to drill that in him. And so it's like I, yeah, I think that I try to give people access.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
The flip side of this. I, I've talked to Neil about this a bit.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I like love. This stuff, obviously. The understanding like making the irrational rational like understanding rational and making the abstract more concrete and like understanding how these decisions are made is like where I find my passion in this journey.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.000
And that to me is a huge red flag warning sign to be aware of because I have to make sure that as I continue to build this company.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I am doing what's best for the company. In every given moment, not necessarily what I drive the most passion or pleasure from doing.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000
And so. This was.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Difficult it's a difficult thing I don't necessarily know where that kicks out yet I'm still very very involved in it and I still believe that's really important but I've seen other founders is fundraising.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:06.000
People are like I love it. Get me out there, get me talking about my thing. Salesmen in a room, chalk it up, buy your coffee.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Like, I go to the event, hold a cocktail, like that's what I love doing because I get to talk about my thing and share with work and it's like ultimately like.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Sure, but then you never raised the round or like you struggle to raise the the fall. It's just like understanding where your time needs to be spent, not where you enjoy spending your time is critically important.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And then also then there's the whole thing about insecurity driving where you spend your time and you also want to set that's the flip side of it and you want to obviously hedge against that as well.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
What's up, Mel?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Hey Jake, just 1st off, man. Thanks for all this. This is super, super clear.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I really appreciate it. You started to get in touch on the topic I was interested more about really around the idea of new hires and onboarding.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:57.000
And how explicit you are with your values and things like that. I'm curious if that spills over into your selection process and even explicitly what that onboarding process looks like.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:05.000
You know, you just mentioned shadowing some things, but curious how you translate that or if it's something someone's meant to go and read, yeah, just, just, do you mind again on packing that process?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Yeah, so Very rare in life that you can like lean on like phrases. Higher slow fire fast feels like a really Good one.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:38.000
And then within the onboarding of somebody, something that Neil told me, one of those moments where it's like he's hopping off a call and said something offhandedly and he's like, yeah, blows my mind is like you coach to success you change the role if the person needs that and if that doesn't work that's when you cut me you have to do that fairly

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:47.000
ruthlessly. On onboarding right now, we've onboarded, we, have I'm a team of 4 founder.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:56.000
So we're a big founding team. I have a 5th employee founding team member who came on and then the 6th person who just added in February.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:04.000
This is not yet at the the 5th the 5th Oh, sorry, 6%. The 5th person came on like 3 tech stars.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I think Julie was on team or maybe it was the, I think Julie was on team or maybe it was the summer half.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah, Julian.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:16.000
It was like she was in early. So there is no like, She was just like, it's almost as if she's a founder.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
On the team, this is our 1st ever real hire. So it doesn't meet the threshold or criteria to have that outlined.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Process. Yeah, I just, we're trying to figure out where the pain points are.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Like, what are the forces that are acting on us in these moments? One thing that I lean heavily on, it seems, again, though I'm like 3 months in, so like, Hey, let's catch up and like.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.000
6 months or whatever, a year and I'll tell you if this worked out for us. But it's intrinsic motivation rather than extrinsic award.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
It's like I can't give this person passion. I can put him in front of successful customers.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I can understand or try to empathize with where he's coming from. This guy's at Grubhub.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
They told him to come in 2 days a week. He's an engineering. He's like, Why?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Like it doesn't make sense to me. And he was working, you know, like Hey, remember like those internal tools that took 8 and a half months to get out the door that you were shipping that they never actually implemented like, hey, you can come over here and you'll rebuild our app within like 6 weeks and it's like trusting him with his instinct empowering him and again through the scope

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
of like what the DRIs are. Higher slow, one thing I'll say that I do.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And Obviously, still creating. Kind of going culture around this. Fairly consistently is like We have.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Job interviews. I would highly recommend who? WHO as a book around how to hire. There's also high output management.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
That's by Andy Grove, how to hire. There's also high output management.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
That's by Andy Grove, who used to be head of Intel. Just have a how to hire stuff, but essentially I can see that there aren't that many questions here.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So we ask 4 questions. To anybody that chose interest in a job, who might slot in because I don't, when I say high or slow, I don't mean I need an engineer, I gotta go hire an engineer.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Ideally what it means is I need an engineer. I'm gonna hire Fred who I talk I spoke to the 1st time 2 years ago who we've been in touch with who like has always wanted to come on and it's like, Dan, can you imagine that level of like intrinsic drive or desire?

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Now every story is different it might take place differently but like that's what I'm looking for.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
And so we we gauge them like hey what are your career goals? What are you really good at professionally?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000
What are you not good at or not interested in professionally? And why are you interested in zest?

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
We also say what will your last 5 bosses? Like how will they rate you on a scale of one to 10 when we speak to them?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:38.000
When we speak to them very important and makes the question a little bit more real, what you could do if you don't love the answer is also pulled the number they said.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000
So like my boss will write me an 8. If they can't write you an 8, would you be a 7 or 9?

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
To kind of drill down a little bit deeper there. This person not asked that because they were an intern candidate.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:56.000
And so, you know, when you're an intern, in matter cycle over less, but, this just gives a a very good picture.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:13.000
So this is like kind of how we go about hiring. I would also say, to the degree that you guys can do.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I lost my train phone actually. If it comes back, it will be important.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I appreciate that man. That was really clear. Thank you for going on the extra details well.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Yeah, sure.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Jake. I think. Oh yeah, go ahead, ianna.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Yeah, I was gonna say I recognize we're at time, Jake. So. I can stick around and try and answer other people's questions.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I wanna let you go. Do you have a hard stop? Do you wanna answer the last 2 questions?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Okay, great.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
This is extremely helpful.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
No, so I, yeah, I actually can go a bit over. So I'm like happy to stay on as long as it's like helpful slash tactical, but also the Yeah, likewise goes to anybody like please don't feel obligated.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.000
A mate
