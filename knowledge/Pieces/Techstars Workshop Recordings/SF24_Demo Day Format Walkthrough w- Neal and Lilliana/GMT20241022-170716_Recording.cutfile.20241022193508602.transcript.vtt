1
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:19.389
Lilliana Robinson: This is gonna answer a lot of the general questions that you guys have. We're gonna go over where it's gonna be when it's gonna be and what the format is. We've kind of hinted at the format a bit as we've kind of taught you guys over the past few weeks. But


2
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.190
Lilliana Robinson: we're gonna go over it in detail. We're gonna answer any questions you guys have. And then we're gonna watch some pitches.


3
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:49.820
Lilliana Robinson: So this is all in preparation, really, for next week for me and Troy to give you the full intro to demo day pitching. So today there's not really an action item after this, it's just to get you thinking and get you familiar with what is gonna happen. You don't have to do anything after this workshop other than just like, let it sink in and start start just generally thinking about what you might want to do


4
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.029
Lilliana Robinson: next week when Troy and I address you guys that's going to be the kickoff to starting to build your pitch.


5
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:14.780
Lilliana Robinson: So once we give the intro next week and we'll give you some exercises and things like that. That's when we're gonna really start crafting it. But Neil and I have always added this workshop ahead of time to just get you guys familiar with the concept of Demo Day what to expect all those different things. And to just give you some examples to just kind of set your sights in the right direction.


6
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.310
Lilliana Robinson: Cool.


7
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.539
Lilliana Robinson: All right.


8
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.010
Lilliana Robinson: Alright.


9
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.329
Lilliana Robinson: So 1st we're gonna do some expectation setting. So we've already kind of talked about this with you guys because it has come up in a couple of workshops. But


10
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.620
Lilliana Robinson: the general expectations for Demo Day are


11
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:53.420
Lilliana Robinson: that this is just a single day. It's not how it used to be in the 2,010 s. Where it was just the end. All be all. Honestly, it's seen as a lot more as like you're coming out into the community. You're graduating from techstars, and you do get this


12
00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:10.209
Lilliana Robinson: nicely recorded artifact that then you can use for fundraising customer acquisition all different things coming out of it. So it's a lot more about the things that happen as a result of Demo Day than it is the actual day, and any sort of like amazing conversation you might have in the room at that day.


13
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.889
Lilliana Robinson: that being said, people do make some really great connections that then lead


14
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.560
Lilliana Robinson: to business progress or investment progress down the road.


15
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:31.460
Lilliana Robinson: But just the the days of just having Demo Day, and there being all these investors that are throwing checks at you is far gone. I think we've said this before. So it's not surprising to you guys, but we always like to set that expectation, especially being out in the bay.


16
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:42.840
Lilliana Robinson: It's extremely saturated. So I'm sure these investors will have been to like multiple demo days the same month as ours. That's just how it is. There are people that are going through accelerators left and right out. Here.


17
00:02:42.890 --> 00:03:05.130
Lilliana Robinson: however, we do have different ways that we make it special and engaging for the audience, so it'll still be an amazing time, I would just say it's all about what happens as follow up from the demo day itself than the actual day, the actual 12 h that you're having your demo day. It's much more about community graduation, a milestone for you and getting that artifact of you pitching on stage.


18
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.470
Lilliana Robinson: Did you want to add anything now.


19
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:19.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Just reinforcing that it's like, I think some people freak out about this and spend way too much time obsessing over it and worrying about it and think it's gonna make some like big difference in your business. And it isn't.


20
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I just really want that to be abundantly clear. It's gonna help you, and it's worth investing time in.


21
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But it is not the answer to your problems, and it is not a proxy for your progress.


22
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.210
Lilliana Robinson: Alright.


23
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.074
Lilliana Robinson: So what does a winning Demo Day look like? You've heard some of the alumni say like winning Demo Day like Eric said that.


24
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.979
Lilliana Robinson: I would say.


25
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:57.309
Lilliana Robinson: if you're a competitive person you are going to think about like, Oh, how do I basically optimize Demo Day? Maybe not in a competitive mindset, but just like for yourself.


26
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.340
Lilliana Robinson: And I have an answer for you. Actually, it's different than what winning Demo Day would have meant when Eric was in the class that was


27
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.960
Lilliana Robinson: kind of a toxic culture.


28
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, they made that pretty intense. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I just want to clarify what you just said. So


29
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the way it used to be was pretty intense, like they would stack people up against each other. They would compare each other in a way that was kind of like


30
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this person's better than this. Per, you know, like that kind of stuff. And it was just not really that.


31
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:32.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't know that, like we have better things to do than to try to pit you all against each other, to perform well at an event. It's not that deep.


32
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:57.069
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly so. 1st of all, the order that we make is has no ramification or or indication of what you guys are are like, like. Basically there's no stack rank, there's no best and last and worst. And then all of these different things. We design the order very thoughtfully. The week before demo day to maximize audience engagement.


33
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:16.630
Lilliana Robinson: What does that mean? It means basically, we mix b 2 BB, 2 C, we mix our female Ceos into the mix. I like to spread them out. We mix different industry verticals. We. We mix the different types of pitches. Sometimes pitches have humor in them, and sometimes they're more serious, and all.


34
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: EIR.


35
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.019
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, yeah. And we mix the eirs who are gonna interview you so that they don't have to go back to back to back.


36
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:52.070
Lilliana Robinson: So there are like a lot of different parameters. Neil and I take into consideration. We sit and we whiteboard it, and we like really think it out, and I promise you can analyze the list all day long. You're never gonna find like any sort of pattern of oh, this person's the best. This person's the worst. It's all about these different parameters of what will maximize audience engagement. That's what's best for you guys is for them to be completely engaged from start to finish for all 12 pitches. So the best that we can do for that.


37
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.729
Lilliana Robinson: That's how we make the list.


38
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.800
Lilliana Robinson: Now back to Winning Demo Day.


39
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:04.189
Lilliana Robinson: The answer here for us. What does winning Demo Day look like is the person who has the most follow up calls


40
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.849
Lilliana Robinson: that contribute to their demo day goal


41
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.560
Lilliana Robinson: after demo Day.


42
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.269
Lilliana Robinson: I'll so I'll say it again. It is having the most follow up calls


43
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:24.809
Lilliana Robinson: that contribute to your goal. That is how you win demo day. So I actually know who has done that in the past. I know which company has quote unquote. One demo day each of you will have a different goal.


44
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.810
Lilliana Robinson: A lot of you are interested in boost trapping. That means that a lot of your goal is


45
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.280
Lilliana Robinson: a lot of your goals are going to be about customer acquisition, maybe getting key advisement. Key mentors


46
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:45.930
Lilliana Robinson: getting your name out there. It could just be about getting your presence known. In general. Everyone will have a different goal, and maybe your goal is fundraising, whatever that goal is.


47
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:53.199
Lilliana Robinson: Having. Follow up calls from people, from meeting people, from getting introductions from the people you meet to other people that might be relevant.


48
00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:03.010
Lilliana Robinson: Because, remember, even if someone can't help you, they probably know someone who can help you. All of those things are how you win Demo Day. So that is my biggest hope for each of you.


49
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.559
Lilliana Robinson: and I think all of you can achieve this


50
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:19.210
Lilliana Robinson: venue. So where is Demo Day happening? I'm very happy to say. Thanks to Chloe's hard work, it's going to be at the Google Headquarters, which is really cool. We've actually never had a demo day at a partner space.


51
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.379
Lilliana Robinson: And I think it's gonna be really nice for you guys.


52
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:30.980
Lilliana Robinson: Here are some pictures. So this is the auditorium space on the left. You should expect about 200 people.


53
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:52.609
Lilliana Robinson: Then we're gonna move upstairs to this big reception space that has a giant car in the middle. It has a Delorean in the middle. It's like a really quirky Google space. And it's really nice. And they're gonna provide you food. You guys will pitch right in front of that. G, you have the 2 screens if they have all the tech already built in, and it's gonna be really nice for our guests.


54
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.459
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, yeah.


55
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Clear. We're paying for the food.


56
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.430
Lilliana Robinson: Oh!


57
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They're not providing it. We're paying.


58
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.199
Dave Scott: Paying for it.


59
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Just to be clear.


60
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:10.860
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, we're paying for the food. Thank you for the clarification. I also forgot to say, to hold all your questions till the end, and just put them in the chat, and Neil and I will go through them one by one


61
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.150
Lilliana Robinson: after that in the chat.


62
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:23.949
Lilliana Robinson: This is the view from the space which I think is gorgeous. In the bottom, right? We took that when we were there for an event. The day before you guys came during tech week.


63
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.249
Lilliana Robinson: So yeah, this is the space I'm really excited about it. I think you guys are, gonna have a great time.


64
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:41.829
Lilliana Robinson: You guys will be able to invite one to 2 people personally per founder. So if you have family or friends, you were hoping to invite, you can have one to 2, and you can also kind of like trade trade that within


65
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.450
Lilliana Robinson: your team. So if a team member doesn't want to bring any, then you could bring 3 or 4 things it'll work like that.


66
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:56.420
Lilliana Robinson: So our secret sauce Demo day format. So we just talked about where it's happening. So what is happening? How do we do, Demo Day?


67
00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:09.099
Lilliana Robinson: I would say we call it our secret sauce, because it's something that Neil and I came up with. As we were brainstorming post Covid, how to do Demo Day, because we had only done virtual demo days


68
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.789
Lilliana Robinson: due to the pandemic. And then in 2022, we were able to have our 1st in person Demo Day.


69
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.929
Lilliana Robinson: But the old method was so tired


70
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.932
Lilliana Robinson: people had been


71
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:43.209
Lilliana Robinson: they didn't want to come anymore. If we were just going to do 10 min long pitches 12 people get on stage. They pitch for 10 min with a deck, and then they get off stage, and it's just boring. People didn't want to do that anymore. So Neil came up with the idea that I'll show you in a second to engage the audience by having shorter pitches and then having QA. On stage. And I call it the secret sauce, because it worked really well.


72
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:53.369
Lilliana Robinson: and a bunch of other programs started asking us about it, and we sent them information about it. We sent them our videos. And now I would say, 6 or 7 different techstars programs


73
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.509
Lilliana Robinson: have consistently done our format for the past couple of years, which is really cool.


74
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:19.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I can add one quick thing. The premise of this was, what is the purpose of Demo Day? I asked myself, like, why are we doing it? What is the point? And what do founders want? And one of the big things was either want to close customers or they wanna have conversations with investors. Those were the 2 main jobs. So I was like, Okay, well, why don't we just cut the


75
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:20.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like?


76
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The the mess


77
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of the pageantry of a of a fancy pitch that looks really good


78
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and just have that 1st conversation live on stage.


79
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:46.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the idea was, let's save everyone some time and have that 1st investor conversation, or that 1st customer call introducing yourself in your business and your why? In a meaningful way that gives you even more progress when you have that initial interaction with somebody that you actually want to talk to or share this with


80
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: exactly.


81
00:10:51.060 --> 00:11:03.379
Lilliana Robinson: So we've experimented with this for the last 6 demo days, and it has gone really, really well. So this is in Chicago. We have about 200 people that come to our Chicago ones as well. So it's the same kind of size as the Google one we're throwing.


82
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:17.710
Lilliana Robinson: It was a huge success. So not not only did an increase audience, participation or audience engagement, people were not on their phones. They're paying attention. They're staying till the end. They're asking amazing questions to the founders in the post


83
00:11:18.087 --> 00:11:22.970
Lilliana Robinson: networking hour. All of those things were fixed that were kind of issues with Demo Day before.


84
00:11:24.229 --> 00:11:48.609
Lilliana Robinson: So I think we've been pretty clear on this. But Demo Day is not a fundraising event, so a lot of people might launch their rounds at Demo Day. But I would say, if you are planning on fundraising, you should not consider Demo Day as a factor at all. It shouldn't be. Oh, and then Demo Day is going to hit, and then I'm really going to boost my funding, if anything, you should see it as like a second mentor madness where you may make some connections that may lead to funding.


85
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:57.499
Lilliana Robinson: This is kind of what Neil was saying. The whole idea before, both behind the format is, we want to arm you with confidence.


86
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:10.569
Lilliana Robinson: clarity, and real skills on articulating your business by answering questions. So a lot of you are kind of uncomfortable talking about your business. I can tell from how you were pitching at the different public events we've had.


87
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.439
Lilliana Robinson: This is going to get you


88
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:24.149
Lilliana Robinson: extremely comfortable with it, articulating your business, answering the hard questions because we're not just gonna let you have softballs. They're gonna be difficult questions. You're gonna practice how to answer them. And you're gonna have the confidence to do so


89
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:29.589
Lilliana Robinson: so with that being said, here's the actual format. So 1 min product video.


90
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.949
Lilliana Robinson: 1 min elevator pitch on a mic.


91
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.580
Lilliana Robinson: no slides behind you. Just


92
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.489
Lilliana Robinson: spotlight on the CEO,


93
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:43.259
Lilliana Robinson: 4 min of Q&A with an eir with one slide displayed.


94
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:54.480
Lilliana Robinson: and you can choose the order of these 1st 2. So some people do their product. Video. First, st some people do their pitch first, st I would say the majority of people do their pitch first, st


95
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.969
Lilliana Robinson: and that


96
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:16.899
Lilliana Robinson: only has the exception of if your product is kind of hard to explain, or if it would be distracting to hear the pitch without seeing the product like if people would be wondering. For example, we had a company making batteries for drones. So their product video just illustrated it perfectly, and people were able to immediately understand. And then he was able to go into his pitch.


97
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.230
Lilliana Robinson: If that sounds like you, we can talk about it


98
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:48.720
Lilliana Robinson: otherwise most people do the pitch. 1st go into the product video, then your Eir comes on stage and you sit down and have what I call like an Oprah style. QA. Where we have like 2 talk show chairs, and they'll ask you questions to be clear. This QA. Is scripted, it will not seem scripted. A lot of people are surprised to learn it's scripted because you will practice being supernatural, but it is scripted. So you guys are not being asked anything on the spot.


99
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.289
Lilliana Robinson: You will memorize your answers.


100
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And just to reinforce 90 to 95% of the pitches usually do pitch 1st and then video.


101
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:30.259
Lilliana Robinson: So we have a lot of practices designed to help you prepare both synchronously and asynchronously. So. These are just some of the sessions. So I said, next week we're going to start with intro to Demo Day with Troy. That's always our 1st one that kicks it off. We'll continuously have pitch practice with Troy. I think we have 2 of them. He comes every 2 weeks to work with you guys. I work with you guys on storyboarding the product. Demo video. Kevin is going to teach a workshop. He teaches every time which is pitching pitching tips and tricks


102
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:43.740
Lilliana Robinson: after he's won almost half a million dollars in pitch competitions. He has some great tips for you guys, and then we're going to invite alumni mentors to come to pitch practice with you guys, the Eirs and Neil will also work with you in crafting your Q. And A.


103
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:57.499
Lilliana Robinson: The event will be a a demo day for all 12 companies, so we'll go back to back. We always do start to finish. We'll do 12, and then it'll be followed by 1 h of networking cocktail hour.


104
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:14.029
Lilliana Robinson: usually demo days about 3 h. It's gonna be on Friday, December 6.th This is the major announcement I wanted to make here. It's not going to be on Thursday, December 5, th as I sent you guys when you got your offers, so change it in your calendars. If you told your spouse or your friends


105
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.939
Lilliana Robinson: it's going to be on Friday. This is because of the Google space availability.


106
00:15:19.278 --> 00:15:29.100
Lilliana Robinson: And we're gonna start at about 4 pm, so it'll be 4 to 7 pitches, and then, like a cocktail hour, 7 to 8 or 7 to 9. Whenever people kind of finish up


107
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:53.269
Lilliana Robinson: the networking cocktail is usually where all the connections are made, so we'll have everybody go up to the reception space. We'll keep you guys downstairs with us in the auditorium for a little bit, and then almost like, if you've ever had a wedding, or been to a wedding where the bride and groom come in to the reception once everyone's there that's going to be, you guys, and you'll get to come in, and then you get to meet everybody and chat with them on. People will be excited to talk to you.


108
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:06.500
Lilliana Robinson: So the one thing you do need to do you don't have to start crafting your pitch yet until Troy and I talk to you next week. But start building your investor pipelines now so that we can invite them.


109
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:32.920
Lilliana Robinson: We will do invites to your list of investors, and it doesn't have to be investors. It's whatever will contribute to your goal. So I would just say, your Demo Day invite list. If you're interested in b 2 b customers, a lot of people invite potential customers to demo day people from those companies to come and see what they're all about. And it has worked in the past. If you're interested in getting that key advisor, that key mentor, invite them to Demo Day.


110
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:56.400
Lilliana Robinson: they don't have to have anything to do with techstars, it's up to you guys, you build your own lists and we invite them. So we'll start sending invites in a 2 to 3 weeks. We are ahead of schedule right now, having this session. So I would say, 2 to 3 weeks. But start now, start thinking about who you want to invite. We have our own invite list. Everyone you met in mentor madness, everyone you met in the 1st mentor event in week, one


111
00:16:56.711 --> 00:17:03.739
Lilliana Robinson: all the alumni that you've met, all those people will be automatically invited from us. So you don't have to worry about that. Just make your own list


112
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.280
Lilliana Robinson: all right.


113
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.380
Lilliana Robinson: So now we can open up to questions. We'll take


114
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.710
Lilliana Robinson: Neil. Let's take like 6 min to answer questions, and then we'll jump into examples.


115
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:37.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sure I will knock out all the the key ones, and then it looks like, I think my impression is that Collab has some scheduling problems with that date adjustment. So we'll talk about that, too. But there's ways around. If for some reason you can't come, we've actually designed for that as well in the past. So just so, you know, if there's actually something really important that you can't miss. Given the date change, we'll find a way to make it work and make it valuable for you.


116
00:17:37.862 --> 00:17:43.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we know the questions advanced. Yes, we already answered that.


117
00:17:44.049 --> 00:17:47.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One or 2 people per founder that does not include investors. Fabio.


118
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.480
Lilliana Robinson: That was for.


119
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Any other questions.


120
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.879
Lilliana Robinson: One to 2 people was for your personal invites.


121
00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So Collab, what's up.


122
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:05.779
Florence Ettlin: We're flying out on that date like we're literally flying out at 8 Pm.


123
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 8 pm. That day.


124
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:09.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Wait.


125
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.540
Lilliana Robinson: I accidentally muted. You guys.


126
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They're flying out at 8 pm. On Friday night.


127
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.080
Florence Ettlin: Yeah.


128
00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.489
Lilliana Robinson: Can you change your flight?


129
00:18:16.167 --> 00:18:18.192
Florence Ettlin: We'll we will have to. Yes.


130
00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.379
Florence Ettlin: if you thought it was definitely on Thursday. So we have a friend.


131
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.395
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, we did, too.


132
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.580
Florence Ettlin: Yeah. But that's why.


133
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.809
Lilliana Robinson: We can help find you a place to stay, if, like your lease ends and stuff. But that's not a problem at all.


134
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.759
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, we didn't even think of that. We're just like we need to.


135
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.669
Lilliana Robinson: Not a big deal.


136
00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:39.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We'll we'll we'll we'll help you out. We'll work. We'll work with you all specifically to make that work, even if you gotta fly out at midnight.


137
00:18:40.123 --> 00:18:40.830
Florence Ettlin: Okay, yeah.


138
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:42.049
Florence Ettlin: I have fun.


139
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.269
Lilliana Robinson: At midnight after demo, day before, so like.


140
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We'll have a big party at the airport with everybody after Demo day.


141
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.374
Florence Ettlin: You'll drop us off.


142
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.260
Florence Ettlin: Cool.


143
00:18:53.790 --> 00:19:10.005
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, one thing you didn't mention, Lily, I think, is important is like we always celebrate afterwards, and usually it's Thursday night. Y'all recover, and then we hang out Friday and like, do a bunch of stuff and like whatever. But now we're just gonna do it all in one night. So you guys are gonna be gassed.


144
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's gonna be interesting, but


145
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it'll be fine.


146
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Nobody's got any questions.


147
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.054
Annie: I guess. Just a quick question.


148
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:31.470
Annie: since it's a 1 min pitch, since it's really so, I'm assuming just the the CEO will just go up there and pitch.


149
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Correct. Okay. Great.


150
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.380
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: On, the.


151
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.209
Lilliana Robinson: CEO will do the whole thing, so only the CEO is ever on stage.


152
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Correct.


153
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's up? Agent lunar.


154
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.170
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: It's it's it's me. So.


155
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, it's health blocks! Oh.


156
00:19:52.320 --> 00:20:09.060
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Being a solo founder of one company wasn't painful enough, so I joined another. So I was gonna ask like for the investor pipeline. Should we do warm outreaches on our on our wish list? First.st


157
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:09.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.


158
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.194
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Have a wish list


159
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.


160
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay.


161
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:24.219
Kevin Su: Will it be streamed anywhere? Or is it just in person event.


162
00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:30.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It. It's normally in person and with a high end recording we're in conversations about


163
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: streaming, but we haven't decided that yet, and don't know if we can commit to it.


164
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:40.029
Lilliana Robinson: We. We've always decided against streaming because it makes people not show up.


165
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.640
Lilliana Robinson: So the people at Techsars who do a demo day that's also streamed. We realized, like


166
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.960
Lilliana Robinson: 30


167
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.130
Lilliana Robinson: to 50%, just opt for the virtual.


168
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:55.320
Lilliana Robinson: But then they don't get the numbers on their actual stream. Which means that people just say they're gonna go to the virtual, and they end up like.


169
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You had to be there.


170
00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.940
Lilliana Robinson: So it's not good for attendance.


171
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:05.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But then, when each of you get your individual 6 min video to send, that's really helpful to send afterwards to people who missed it.


172
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that helps, but it also forces people to show up


173
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:09.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right.


174
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.550
Lilliana Robinson: Alright. We have time for one more question before we jump into


175
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.140
Lilliana Robinson: examples.


176
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.089
Lilliana Robinson: I see Collab so freaking out, it's really gonna be okay. We're gonna make it happen.


177
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, we'll work with you. It'll be alright.


178
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.110
Lilliana Robinson: Someone who had a baby born the week of Demo Day. So we just we just made it happen.


179
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.200
Florence Ettlin: A lot better put into perspective.


180
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:42.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, yeah, trust me, we we've dealt with some challenging situations. So a flight issue is like.


181
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.400
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.


182
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:48.720
Lilliana Robinson: people have had like family emergencies, like, it's, it's really gonna be fine. Don't.


183
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.230
Florence Ettlin: Very good.


184
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.370
Lilliana Robinson: And we wouldn't have it without.


185
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.620
Florence Ettlin: Behind the smiles. But you notice, Lianna, you could tell.


186
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I mean, y'all were freaking out when she said that I saw it. I was like, Oh, my God!


187
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.849
Lilliana Robinson: Eyes were gonna pop out of her.


188
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.954
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He's getting married like.


189
00:22:01.783 --> 00:22:03.889
Florence Ettlin: I don't have the best poker face so.


190
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:13.439
Lilliana Robinson: Alright. Okay. Well, if you guys get more questions to save them, we can stay on at the end and and answer them. We're gonna jump now into


191
00:22:13.864 --> 00:22:15.520
Lilliana Robinson: examples. So the way.


192
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Examples that Liliana's gonna share right now, I just want to say to you all like.


193
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:39.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: just empathize for a second and realize like it's gonna be so easy for you to watch and judge someone else's pitch and go. Oh, I wouldn't do that, or that was not good, or they were nervous about this. And it's like, Yeah, okay. And then why don't you do it when you get up there? So I just want you all to know that when we watch, you're gonna be judgmental because you're gonna see things that you think should be different.


194
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:45.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But then I'm gonna put it back on you, and then when we see you get up there and do it, that's when the real work comes out.


195
00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just keep that in mind as we watch these Demos.


196
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.719
Lilliana Robinson: But now I do like the exercise we normally do where we do pick it apart. I think.


197
00:22:52.720 --> 00:23:03.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, you know I want their feedback on the pitches to evaluate what was good and bad for sure, but I also want to humble them as well, because I know how this goes, and everybody always knows what's best.


198
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.080
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.


199
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What someone else is supposed to do.


200
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.159
Lilliana Robinson: What is it? Monday morning? Quarterbacking.


201
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.795
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yup!


202
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:16.160
Lilliana Robinson: So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna play a video. And we have about 5, 5, yeah, 5 or 6.


203
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:45.379
Lilliana Robinson: We're gonna watch it together while we're watching it in the chat. I want you guys to say things that you like and things that you think could have been better, so like things that they're doing that are really good. That you also should emulate. And then anything that went wrong that you probably should learn from the whole point of watching them is to learn from it. So it's okay, like, some of them have mistakes. And some of them could have done better in like their stage presence, or whatever it is. But a lot of them have really good things that I also want you to point out, so that you can learn from.


204
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:59.960
Lilliana Robinson: We've hand selected the ones we're gonna show you guys for a reason. So each one should be able to teach you something different. So I'm just gonna start, after which we'll take like 1 min to quickly discuss each one, and then we'll go to the next one.


205
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.989
Lilliana Robinson: So we're going to start with Cicada. You've met Myrcha. He was in our alumni panel.


206
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.490
Lilliana Robinson: and this one we're only going to watch the pitch.


207
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.909
Lilliana Robinson: And do you want to also watch the video, Neil, pitch and video, right? We're just gonna watch the 1st segment. We're not gonna.


208
00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Pitch and be good.


209
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool.


210
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.690
Lilliana Robinson: And then


211
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:32.060
Lilliana Robinson: a a


212
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:46.189
Lilliana Robinson: all right. There's just nothing better than getting a room full of people to sing with you.


213
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.520
Lilliana Robinson: Taylor Swift earned over a billion dollars on her latest tour.


214
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:57.080
Lilliana Robinson: And yet the average Us. Musician only earns $20,000 a year.


215
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:06.050
Lilliana Robinson: The music business is hard. That's why musicians, hire managers, cicada helps, managers make more money for their artists.


216
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:11.070
Lilliana Robinson: and we do this by focusing on the live concert experience


217
00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:21.169
Lilliana Robinson: before sequera concert revenue could only come from tickets and merch. But traditional merch, as you might know, is an expensive logistical nightmare.


218
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:26.740
Lilliana Robinson: Cicada unlocks 6 new revenue streams at every single gig.


219
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:38.779
Lilliana Robinson: These include things like custom, merch on demand for every single fan paid dedications and crucially real-time calls to action activated by the music itself.


220
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:46.199
Lilliana Robinson: This helps us capitalize on people's exceptional state of mind before they even leave the venue.


221
00:25:46.460 --> 00:26:03.969
Lilliana Robinson: Since January, Cicada has been used by over 40 acts, which makes perfect sense because we built it for ourselves. The founders are professional musicians and highly technical people, and we believe the next Taylor Swift will earn her 1 billion dollars using cicada.


222
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.280
Lilliana Robinson: Let me show you how.


223
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:14.489
Lilliana Robinson: as a musician, it's my job to put people into a state of euphoria. But how do I translate that into revenue?


224
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:39.290
Lilliana Robinson: Well, when I go on tour I bring my Cicada QR. Code or my tappable signs this way. My fans can access cicada on their mobile browsers where they can buy unique products and services. I don't need a cashier, and my fans don't need to wait in line. They could buy merch on demand which makes my merch store infinite, saves me money on transport, and allows each fan to customize their items.


225
00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:46.289
Lilliana Robinson: I can do paint dedications kind of like cameo for live music. I can do tipping perks, vip access and more.


226
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.839
Lilliana Robinson: And my fans can interact with the band in real time.


227
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:54.729
Lilliana Robinson: They can sing along to synchronize lyrics vote in polls. Text a band and more.


228
00:26:55.070 --> 00:27:09.479
Lilliana Robinson: This allows me to gather some data so I can know my fans even if I don't control ticket sales. Cicada has been used by over 40 acts with thousands of dollars transacted, cicada making music profitable.


229
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:21.840
Lilliana Robinson: So I'm sure a lot of you are wondering about the music before we jump in about the actual pitch each of you will have a walk on song that you get to pick.


230
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.799
Lilliana Robinson: It'll be like 15 seconds


231
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:29.190
Lilliana Robinson: Mircha ended up choosing the A song that he and his co-founder composed


232
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.380
Lilliana Robinson: at the retreat.


233
00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:40.230
Lilliana Robinson: So everyone in the audience that were our founders knew this like the singing part of that, because we did at the Retreat. So then he asked us to sing with him when he came on stage, which is pretty cool.


234
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.540
Lilliana Robinson: but you'll see in the other ones. Normally, we just play like 15 seconds of a song


235
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:59.170
Lilliana Robinson: that either like hypes you as the CEO up or it's related to your business. Whatever you want to do like, there's no rules for that, except that it needs to be like Demo Day appropriate. So no offensive language, or anything like that. But other than that you can do any song you want.


236
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:04.020
Lilliana Robinson: So what did? Let's do like 2 things, Major did well, and 2 things that he could have done better


237
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.750
Lilliana Robinson: feel free to just unmute.


238
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:16.700
Kevin Su: The the energy was insanely good came in. Crowd was high. I think that that was the most obvious one. Like I felt like I was part of that crowd during the opening few seconds.


239
00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:28.620
Florence Ettlin: Yeah, I agree with Kevin. He just used a lot of movement as well. So it took up the space on the stage. And he felt very natural, too. So brought in the energy through that. Yeah.


240
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:34.379
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, it showed a lot of confidence, right? He wasn't trying to like shrive into himself. So that's something you guys should all be thinking about


241
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.060
Lilliana Robinson: is like a power pose. If you've ever heard of that.


242
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.499
Lilliana Robinson: the same thing.


243
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:39.920
Dave Scott: Okay? What?


244
00:28:39.920 --> 00:29:02.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So embodied his own creativity. Just to add, he was actually playing live music as people were walking in before Demo Day started. So he was like. He was really thoughtful about how he wanted the entire experience of Demo Day to be for him and his business, and we ended up using his platform actually facilitate Demo Day, too. So he was really, really intentional about every aspect of it.


245
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.530
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Very cool.


246
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:09.230
Dave Scott: So can I ask a question you said was that his demo, or what was that? The or the video was part of his pitch?


247
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.450
Lilliana Robinson: No, that was the first.st


248
00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is product demo. Yeah.


249
00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:19.949
Dave Scott: Okay, I was. It was excellent, like, just really caught the the vibe of the technology. And and really the problem of the customer.


250
00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:29.999
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So he did pitch first, st and then video. So that was the 1 min. 1 min. Let's take one more from okay, 2 more Dominique's square. Whoever's in there.


251
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:54.479
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, I I think to Dave's point what we were discussing like he he built a stuff he kind of drew us in, and then we were ready to to jump in the boat when the kind of explainer video came. It was really clear with that combination, and he also didn't say he was very good at not saying like you know, when people are talking, and they'll say like or like, because they're trying to fill.


252
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.059
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No. Filler words. Yeah.


253
00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:00.330
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: All filler words was really helps you to stay engaged. Yeah.


254
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:04.530
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, that took a lot of practice. He practiced his pitch a lot to get there.


255
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.520
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Like.


256
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.849
Lilliana Robinson: Fabio. Final comment.


257
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:13.580
Fabio Caironi: I really like the product presentation. I it looks very professional, and


258
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:19.699
Fabio Caironi: I know many people are impressed by like a good looking presentations. Maybe.


259
00:30:20.222 --> 00:30:31.789
Fabio Caironi: You know, 3 nations kind of stuff that that's probably the moment when you wanna have someone do that for you like, do you know who like, if they made that, or do that for them.


260
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.089
Lilliana Robinson: If if they, if they made, what.


261
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The video.


262
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.060
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, yeah, they.


263
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:40.790
Fabio Caironi: The video. Yes.


264
00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:51.860
Lilliana Robinson: I think they storyboarded it, and they produced a lot of the assets. And then they had someone on Fiverr do like the animation where that, like it moves. The, you know, moves the iphone, and like


265
00:30:52.060 --> 00:31:05.389
Lilliana Robinson: does all of the different like movement pieces. But they made the wireframes, and they made all the different video assets of like. They went and filmed actual performances of their actual customers and stuff like that. So that wasn't even like stock footage pretty cool.


266
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:11.909
Lilliana Robinson: I'll post this. So you guys can watch again. That brings me to a question. Everyone always asks, which is, How do we make the video


267
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.639
Lilliana Robinson: different options.


268
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.969
Lilliana Robinson: You can go completely handmade


269
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:20.649
Lilliana Robinson: like you can just make it for $0 on canva. A lot of people do that.


270
00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:41.280
Lilliana Robinson: It's totally fine some people have, like their sister or their roommate, do the voice over, and then they just make it on canva, or like Imovie, and then they ship it, and that's great. Then there's the next option, which is like fiber, so like you make all the assets you want, but, like someone puts it together on fiber, I would be careful. Don't have any sort of like AI voice. It's super annoying.


271
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:56.629
Lilliana Robinson: Have an actual voice over as much as you can. And then, like the step up from that is to hire an actual like video maker, not like you're paying like 10 bucks for someone to slap it together. But like you're actually paying a company like you're outsourcing it. That would be only if you want to invest


272
00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:06.470
Lilliana Robinson: a few $100 in it, because you might want to use it on your website, or you might want to use it for customer acquisition you. This video has other uses than just using it for Demo Day.


273
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.609
Lilliana Robinson: So some people do invest, maybe like $500 into that.


274
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:19.579
Lilliana Robinson: I always say you should not be spending over a thousand dollars on this video, I would say, a thousand dollars is the cap. If you have trouble finding a professional


275
00:32:19.888 --> 00:32:30.619
Lilliana Robinson: contractor to hire, and you want, like a higher fidelity. Video, ask the alums, so ask the people who just went through who they used. A lot of them just shared the same person. I know that for a fact.


276
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.180
Lilliana Robinson: So just ask them.


277
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:55.509
Lilliana Robinson: Those are the different tiers, and there's no problem with any of those tiers. It's up to you how much time and money you want to invest in the video. I will say we will tell you if it's bad, so don't worry about that like there have been times that we go. We have approval sessions. And sometimes in the approval session, someone will show their video and maybe they didn't want to invest too much time in it, and I just tell them this isn't going to be acceptable for Demo Day. You need to like make this a little better.


278
00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.350
Lilliana Robinson: So there is like a threshold. But other than that don't spend too much money.


279
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.950
Lilliana Robinson: Kevin. You had a question.


280
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:05.870
Kevin Su: Yeah. 2 quick questions. Did tech starts ever offer someone to do all these


281
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.890
Kevin Su: the demo day videos? Or am I matching that? Okay?


282
00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:10.330
Lilliana Robinson: No, we've never done that.


283
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:18.380
Kevin Su: Oh, good second question. When should we have the 1st video ready for the tech stars team to review and get feedback on.


284
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:25.799
Lilliana Robinson: We're gonna start with a storyboard. It's a session. I I run you'll have to look in the calendar. I think it's in 3 weeks.


285
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:46.659
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I think it's in week, 9 or 10. It's on the Google Calendar right now. So it'll say, like, product demo walkthrough with Liliana, that is when you'll have your storyboard. So like, no video, you're just gonna show me like, walk me through what you want. And the group. And I will give you feedback, and then from there you can start making it so, for now you should just be in brainstorming things.


286
00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.530
Kevin Su: Okay.


287
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.600
Kevin Su: Cool.


288
00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.420
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, let's go to the next one.


289
00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.369
Lilliana Robinson: So the next video is


290
00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:10.729
Lilliana Robinson: completely different. This one's B to C, and we're showing this one to you because Ariana, the CEO, is an incredible, incredible storyteller. Her background is in film, and her company


291
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:17.279
Lilliana Robinson: also focuses on like videos. So just take that with a grain of salt. When you see her video, it's gonna be like.


292
00:34:17.539 --> 00:34:24.600
Lilliana Robinson: clearly someone who went to film school. But the pitch itself is so powerful, and even though


293
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:40.659
Lilliana Robinson: almost everyone here doesn't have like an emotional business, you're not like her businesses and mental health. I would say it's more emotional than most of the businesses here. I challenge each of you to find an emotional pull that can get the same kind of essence that is in this pitch.


294
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:41.880
Lilliana Robinson: So the storytelling


295
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:42.859
Lilliana Robinson: to use it.


296
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:53.099
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I would I would. I would just adjust that a little bit, Leon, and say that I think there is actually emotion in most of your businesses. But what she's saying is that it's less apparent or overt.


297
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:58.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we're gonna do work with each of you to bring out the emotions within your business.


298
00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:12.519
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly, because you'll see Ariana's pitch in a second, and you're gonna think, oh, mine can't be like that, because hers is about mental health is very clear and easy to to pull on people's heartstrings, but a lot of people are able to do it. So use this as an example.


299
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.070
Lilliana Robinson: Some days I find myself thinking.


300
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.450
Lilliana Robinson: I wish I just wouldn't wake up in the morning.


301
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:35.239
Lilliana Robinson: This is a message that was shared on stigma app by a member who answered No to our security question, is this a mental health emergency?


302
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.840
Lilliana Robinson: Acknowledging that we're struggling with our mental health is hard.


303
00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.489
Lilliana Robinson: but asking for help is harder.


304
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:53.439
Lilliana Robinson: It is the reason that a lot of people don't seek treatment, don't seek help, lack of trust, and not knowing where to start, is the reason that 34 million Americans who are struggling with their mental health don't seek treatment.


305
00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:00.210
Lilliana Robinson: So at stigma, we're solving this problem by creating engaging human stories that inspire people to be open about their mental health


306
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:11.189
Lilliana Robinson: when they're ready to seek support. We provide easy on-ramps to resources they didn't know existed when we did this for the member whose message I just shared. She accepted. I know I need to see a therapist, she said.


307
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.830
Lilliana Robinson: I just didn't know where to start


308
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.019
Lilliana Robinson: last week. Google named Stigma 2020 two's best app for good.


309
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:31.050
Lilliana Robinson: In the last 7 days we have more than doubled the size of our community.


310
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:50.020
Lilliana Robinson: Companies like Nerdwallet use written content to educate people about their financial health and then connect them with the resources that they need. Financially, our vision is to use video storytelling to educate people about their mental health and then connect them with the services that actually match their lived experience. I'd like to show you what this looks like and why it matters.


311
00:36:51.540 --> 00:37:17.400
Lilliana Robinson: This is the stigma app in it. Members can watch stories to see living proof that they're not alone and ask for or receive messages of hope from members who share their lived experience. As our members engage with content, we learn more about their needs and recommend stories and resources that are relevant to them. When someone struggles with their mental health, they're looking for hope. So that's exactly what we give them. I never thought I'd have support like this.


312
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:22.620
Lilliana Robinson: and so accessible and so


313
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.770
Lilliana Robinson: it's not even validation, it really is. Hope.


314
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.680
Lilliana Robinson: So thank you for giving us this opportunity.


315
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.510
Lilliana Robinson: All right.


316
00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:49.280
Lilliana Robinson: What is that? What are 2 things that she did? Well, and 2 things she could have done better.


317
00:37:52.170 --> 00:38:02.290
Annie: I like that, she shouted out like a recent win, like, you know. She balanced the emotional also with the the business traction, which I thought was a really good


318
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.279
Annie: yeah, it's nice to have both of those.


319
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.280
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I think


320
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:14.169
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: positives and things she could have done better. Am I?


321
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:22.359
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: So I think, in terms of positives. Of course her storytelling was phenomenal, fantastic, that she had


322
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:27.319
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: one of her community members speak that that was beautiful.


323
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:32.459
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: it reminded me of Dave as well with your community. So I thought that was really special


324
00:38:32.824 --> 00:38:40.770
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: in terms of what she could do better. There were certain moments of her body language where I think she was nervous. I could see her like


325
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.713
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: jacket so I picked up on those queues. So that's


326
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:50.750
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, something that I don't wanna say could do better, but yeah could


327
00:38:51.400 --> 00:39:18.449
Lilliana Robinson: Whole point of. We want to see what we can do better, so that you guys can learn from your predecessors. I would say. Her voice was also really shaky. I think that just comes from not getting in front of people enough with your pitch, because she knew it. She could do it front and back like to just me and Neil. But as soon as she saw all those people you could tell, like she got a little nervous. Her voice was kind of shaky like you said, clutching the jacket. And that's just a matter of practice. So you guys need to take every opportunity you can to get in front of people. So that doesn't happen.


328
00:39:19.176 --> 00:39:24.390
Lilliana Robinson: Morgan, I'll take yours. And 1 1 other thing I wanted to point out really quick was.


329
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:29.299
Lilliana Robinson: I love that. She compared it to a real world success


330
00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.999
Lilliana Robinson: in a different market.


331
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:54.320
Lilliana Robinson: That is one of the best things you guys can do. You'll see Jake does that, too, in zest which we're about to watch, she said. Nerd wallet has done this successfully. They are, you know, valued at blank 1 billion dollars. And they do this model. We're doing that for mental health that is so helpful for the audience to hear, to just connect an analogous business so that they see the value in what you're trying to build.


332
00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.500
Lilliana Robinson: Morgan.


333
00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:15.960
Morgan Stanton: Yeah, I was only gonna say, I I liked her video pitch more than the previous one. I feel like it was a better pace like the other one was pretty packed like it had a lot of stuff kind of rapidly going. Hers was a nice pace, got easily, like clearly see what she offered. And then the success metric that she's looking at. The end was clean on the video.


334
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:23.469
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, that's good feedback. I think Murch's video represents who he is as a person. It's a little bit like bombastic. And, like.


335
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:29.339
Lilliana Robinson: you know throwing stuff at you. And maybe the information didn't land as much


336
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:42.460
Lilliana Robinson: as the stigma video because it wasn't at that learning pace. That's a great point. So you guys kind of have to balance engagement and making it exciting and energetic with not throwing too much at them. And this is a skill


337
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:59.590
Lilliana Robinson: you guys are gonna want to put the whole kitchen sink into these 6 min, the 1 1 and 4. And you just can't. You need to think of it like a movie trailer. The whole 6 min should be a movie trailer where you're just wetting the appetite of the audience so that they can then dig in more. You're like Hansel and Gretel, dropping breadcrumbs.


338
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:06.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The job is to get the right people that you want to reach with this, to talk to you and be curious, and to get to know you better.


339
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yep.


340
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:13.565
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, let's jump into the next one. So we kind of hyped up the zest video. Talking about


341
00:41:17.851 --> 00:41:23.231
Neal Sáles-Griffin: be excited about the business. You may be skeptical of the business, and yet you know where it stands so


342
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:37.731
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to be there.


343
00:41:45.581 --> 00:42:08.561
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're an app that teaches people how to cook. Zest is so much more than a recipe app zest offers skills and knowledge that you can use for the rest of your life. We're doing what headspace does for meditation. What mint does for personal finance, what Duolingo does for language we teach, we test, we reinforce. So users can gain agency over the process. And people are psyched that someone's finally stepping in to satisfy this need.


344
00:42:08.921 --> 00:42:11.551
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they're really psyched. Actually.


345
00:42:17.131 --> 00:42:32.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: since we launched the 1st version of our product 8 months ago, we've had over 130,000 account activations with $0 spent on customer acquisition. We've amassed an audience on social media of over 140,000 people and reached over 20 million people with our viral organic content.


346
00:42:32.931 --> 00:42:47.211
Neal Sáles-Griffin: In the last 3 months we've refined our product, turning enthusiasm into revenue. We've raised our paid conversion percentage 20 X our revenue 5 x, and we're about to make an entire generation happier and healthier through the power of cooking.


347
00:42:53.731 --> 00:42:56.131
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's not off. Gotta give a little talk. Sorry.


348
00:42:56.801 --> 00:42:59.291
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, shit! I'm early sorry, Jake.


349
00:42:59.491 --> 00:43:01.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll be right back. I'm sorry about that.


350
00:43:02.521 --> 00:43:03.661
Neal Sáles-Griffin: See you in a minute, Eric.


351
00:43:04.681 --> 00:43:14.141
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as you just saw during techstars my company zest 5 x our Mrr to $3.5,000 a month by selling an app that teaches people how to cook.


352
00:43:14.471 --> 00:43:17.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because more people need to be able to make nourishing


353
00:43:17.441 --> 00:43:20.351
Neal Sáles-Griffin: affordable and enjoyable food for themselves.


354
00:43:21.041 --> 00:43:24.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Our our competitive advantage is our ability to speak to our audience.


355
00:43:24.441 --> 00:43:31.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We know that 20 posts a week across Instagram and Tiktok yield 1,200 organic downloads with viral upside


356
00:43:32.121 --> 00:43:38.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: our analytical rigor at the top of the funnel. Can you turn it up 16% week over week growth rate throughout the course of.


357
00:43:38.301 --> 00:43:41.991
Lilliana Robinson: So it's up all the way. I don't know why it's so quiet.


358
00:43:42.441 --> 00:43:50.491
Lilliana Robinson: Since August we've been converting users to our $10 and a 16 prim. In Tiktok we yield 1,200 organic downloads with viral upside.


359
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:58.291
Lilliana Robinson: Our analytical rigor at the top of the funnel has allowed us to sustain a 16% week over week growth rate throughout the course of techstars.


360
00:43:58.831 --> 00:44:01.190
Lilliana Robinson: We're good at speaking to people within our app, too.


361
00:44:01.631 --> 00:44:08.680
Lilliana Robinson: Since August we've been converting users to our $10 monthly subscription at a rate that's 50% higher than average for education apps.


362
00:44:09.491 --> 00:44:10.950
Lilliana Robinson: We're like culinary school.


363
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:12.691
Lilliana Robinson: If culinary school is cheap.


364
00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:15.071
Lilliana Robinson: hilarious, and you can do it from your couch.


365
00:44:16.351 --> 00:44:27.750
Lilliana Robinson: Every year millions of twenty-somethings graduate into the real world and come to realize that a lifestyle of frozen food, and Doordash will leave them feeling unhealthy, unfulfilled, and with a hole in their wallet.


366
00:44:28.331 --> 00:44:35.561
Lilliana Robinson: It's why 9 out of 10 of them want to improve their cooking skills. Why, 50% of them are cooking more than they did last year. And why I'm on this stage


367
00:44:35.961 --> 00:44:42.501
Lilliana Robinson: to scale something that gives this increasingly large cohort, the confidence they need to change that from their very own kitchens.


368
00:44:45.231 --> 00:44:47.350
Lilliana Robinson: Now let's talk.


369
00:44:50.061 --> 00:44:50.891
Lilliana Robinson: What's going on, man.


370
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:53.240
Lilliana Robinson: you know, in all of this.


371
00:44:53.471 --> 00:45:01.951
Lilliana Robinson: The poor entrepreneurs have to go through all of this. These guys go through this nerve-wracking experience. And here it is the eir that screws up the phone.


372
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:12.320
Lilliana Robinson: anyway. Sorry about that, Jake. All right. I'm glad I didn't rob the audience of that presentation, because I love the discussion around zest. I love the conversation around food.


373
00:45:12.451 --> 00:45:15.320
Lilliana Robinson: Can you tell me more about how you spent the last 3 months at techstars?


374
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:22.511
Lilliana Robinson: We've made measurable impacts on our company throughout techstars? We 3 xed our


375
00:45:22.601 --> 00:45:29.011
Lilliana Robinson: average session time, the time that the user spends in the app we 20 x our conversion rate.


376
00:45:29.541 --> 00:45:33.141
Lilliana Robinson: all of that is due. And if there's 1 thing to know about


377
00:45:33.411 --> 00:45:39.991
Lilliana Robinson: myself, but my team who I work with because we've obsessed over knowing who our customer is.


378
00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:46.480
Lilliana Robinson: We've worked with industry leaders at the future of food, to understand how and why people learn how to cook.


379
00:45:46.571 --> 00:45:52.501
Lilliana Robinson: We've spent hours and hours talking to our users to find out where we succeeded them, and where we fell short.


380
00:45:52.761 --> 00:45:56.181
Lilliana Robinson: and what we came to realize was that we had a time to value issue in the app.


381
00:45:56.761 --> 00:46:00.640
Lilliana Robinson: So my team got to work. We built around that, and we saw the results that we saw.


382
00:46:01.861 --> 00:46:07.120
Lilliana Robinson: So it sounds like virality is kind of key to your customer acquisition.


383
00:46:07.161 --> 00:46:10.810
Lilliana Robinson: And, as we all know, virality can be notoriously fickle.


384
00:46:10.881 --> 00:46:20.771
Lilliana Robinson: Algorithms change previously available methods get arbitraged away like virality can be a really volatile metric to build a company on.


385
00:46:20.781 --> 00:46:26.901
Lilliana Robinson: Can you help me understand why we can trust the the customer acquisition as you think about virality.


386
00:46:27.401 --> 00:46:30.251
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So virality is not our strategy.


387
00:46:30.261 --> 00:46:42.690
Lilliana Robinson: One of the key goals that we went into techstars trying to achieve was to complete brand phase one of our brand rollout and content acquisition strategy to create some predictability around our organic growth.


388
00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:52.850
Lilliana Robinson: And we did just that. We now know that 20 posts a week across platforms with a proprietary blend of trending and unique content will yield 1,200 organic downloads.


389
00:46:53.121 --> 00:46:58.380
Lilliana Robinson: Now there is viral upside there. We do outperform that. But it's certainly not what we've modeled our business around.


390
00:46:58.591 --> 00:47:02.091
Lilliana Robinson: Got it. But you're not the only one creating food content out there.


391
00:47:02.141 --> 00:47:15.971
Lilliana Robinson: right? There are plenty of other big food influencers. There's Joshua Weissman. There's the golden balance. These folks have millions of followers and a dedicated fan base. How do you compete with them in a very crowded marketplace?


392
00:47:16.881 --> 00:47:23.511
Lilliana Robinson: We don't view them as our competition. We view what they do as highly complementary. To what zest does they build


393
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:27.640
Lilliana Robinson: a tremendous amount of intent in future zest users, somebody who


394
00:47:27.681 --> 00:47:42.701
Lilliana Robinson: is scrolling through their phone on Tiktok, watching beautiful food content being made with a Doordash order directly to the right of them on the same platform that they're looking at that content finds our organic content showing them how they get from the bag on the table to what they're looking at on their phone


395
00:47:43.381 --> 00:47:50.801
Lilliana Robinson: for us as the golden balance scales. As Joshua Weissman scales their followings. So, too, does the future cohort of


396
00:47:50.891 --> 00:47:52.471
Lilliana Robinson: high, intense users.


397
00:47:53.091 --> 00:47:54.260
Lilliana Robinson: I mean, okay.


398
00:47:54.641 --> 00:48:02.800
Lilliana Robinson: But these guys are also doing cooking lessons right? Like, I hear your answer. But they're also doing cooking lessons. They're also teaching people how to cook.


399
00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:08.951
Lilliana Robinson: So so how do you differentiate yourself? And and in particular, where a lot of their stuff is free.


400
00:48:09.041 --> 00:48:15.411
Lilliana Robinson: and you're asking people to pay you money, how do you differentiate yourself sufficiently so that you can get people to pay you money for your content.


401
00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:18.531
Lilliana Robinson: So


402
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:21.891
Lilliana Robinson: free options in general


403
00:48:22.401 --> 00:48:23.961
Lilliana Robinson: don't effectively teach.


404
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:27.140
Lilliana Robinson: They're fairly bulky, entertaining, yes.


405
00:48:27.691 --> 00:48:28.581
Lilliana Robinson: but


406
00:48:29.271 --> 00:48:40.741
Lilliana Robinson: lack any educational rigor. It's the same reason ultimately, that someone would pay for duolingo, or headspace, or mirror, or brilliant.org or lucid or peloton.


407
00:48:41.881 --> 00:48:47.391
Lilliana Robinson: 75% of people under the age of 35. Consider cooking to be wellness.


408
00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:52.750
Lilliana Robinson: 9 out of 10 in that same cohort are willing to spend $300 a month on their wellness.


409
00:48:53.131 --> 00:48:56.381
Lilliana Robinson: All the test is doing is stepping up to satisfy that existing need


410
00:48:57.311 --> 00:48:58.091
Lilliana Robinson: got it.


411
00:48:58.521 --> 00:49:11.360
Lilliana Robinson: So your engagement numbers seem great, right? I heard everything that you said about how you're able to get people to engage with the platform fantastic. But your Mrr is pretty low, comparatively. Can you help me understand how you're thinking about the business model in that world?


412
00:49:12.531 --> 00:49:19.530
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So I think I guess to put it in perspective for zest to be a 10 million dollars arr.


413
00:49:19.551 --> 00:49:22.580
Lilliana Robinson: We would need 83,000 paid subscribers


414
00:49:23.581 --> 00:49:32.311
Lilliana Robinson: right now, entirely, organically, without putting any money behind our message. We have 145,000 people following us on social media.


415
00:49:32.521 --> 00:49:35.091
Lilliana Robinson: We've reached 20 million people


416
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:37.781
Lilliana Robinson: again, entirely organically.


417
00:49:39.651 --> 00:49:51.380
Lilliana Robinson: Other comparable learning apps like, I just leaned on. Duolingo is a 4 billion dollars business headspace. 3 billion dollars. brilliant.org is worth hundreds of millions, as is lucid.


418
00:49:52.891 --> 00:50:00.020
Lilliana Robinson: All we're trying to do is take what has been effective in the way that they've taught people how to do certain tasks and apply it to food.


419
00:50:00.691 --> 00:50:14.270
Lilliana Robinson: Now, in terms of my team's ability to execute on that we went into techstars with 2 specific goals. We wanted to create predictability at the top of the funnel, and we wanted to improve our product. And I'm so proud. I'm like looking at my team right now. I'm so proud


420
00:50:14.431 --> 00:50:16.890
Lilliana Robinson: of the fact that we just knocked those out of the water.


421
00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:22.431
Lilliana Robinson: and so I'm energized. I'm excited by the opportunities and the unknowns to come that we can solve.


422
00:50:23.131 --> 00:50:23.951
Lilliana Robinson: But


423
00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:26.361
Lilliana Robinson: I'm I'm thrilled at the space that we're in


424
00:50:26.981 --> 00:50:29.510
Lilliana Robinson: very cool. Any last thoughts for the audience.


425
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:31.710
Lilliana Robinson: Sure, yeah, there is


426
00:50:32.221 --> 00:50:35.340
Lilliana Robinson: this QR code on the right side of your screens.


427
00:50:35.411 --> 00:50:40.611
Lilliana Robinson: If the idea of changing the way that people think about food energizes you.


428
00:50:40.701 --> 00:50:42.771
Lilliana Robinson: or if anything that I said


429
00:50:43.001 --> 00:50:46.171
Lilliana Robinson: requires a follow-up. If anything draws curiosity


430
00:50:46.361 --> 00:50:48.160
Lilliana Robinson: book a time to chat. I'd love to talk.


431
00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:58.101
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. Now I'll let you lead this discussion. I'm sure you have a lot to say about.


432
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:05.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Well, I think the the only main thing I wanted to say is that that is by far probably one of the more combative


433
00:51:05.241 --> 00:51:19.571
Neal Sáles-Griffin: eir conversations that we've ever had as a QA. Most of them are a lot more playful and complimentary in a way. But I like that one the most. And the reason I like that one the most is, it sounds most like what those tough investor calls sound like.


434
00:51:19.701 --> 00:51:44.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He's expressing real doubt about Jake's business model and his viability. He's questioning the cooking app, his low Mrr. He's calling out all the things that people skeptical of that business are thinking so. I would just encourage you all to consider embracing critique with your eir, because I think it is very impressive to people when they see you handle really really tough questions about your business.


435
00:51:45.091 --> 00:51:46.731
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's the only thing I'll say.


436
00:51:52.961 --> 00:51:54.971
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I don't know if the floor is open, but.


437
00:51:54.971 --> 00:51:56.181
Lilliana Robinson: Absolutely.


438
00:51:57.191 --> 00:52:05.260
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Fully agree. You know, already throwing our hat in the ring. That's exactly what we want, because when you get out into


439
00:52:05.401 --> 00:52:14.030
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: the real word with real world. Those are the questions you're going to get, anyway. So if you've already got a bank of answers awesome. And I think.


440
00:52:14.051 --> 00:52:26.830
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: yeah, I I just thought it was fun. And it's interesting for the audience to watch as well. I'm now gonna follow up with Jake because yeah, he can handle it, and he had all the right answers. He had numbers, metrics. It was


441
00:52:26.971 --> 00:52:28.610
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: brilliant. So yeah.


442
00:52:28.881 --> 00:52:30.750
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I think that style


443
00:52:31.301 --> 00:52:34.441
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: very authentic, very authentic. It was brilliant.


444
00:52:34.441 --> 00:52:34.851
Dave Scott: Was that.


445
00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:35.421
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That is exactly


446
00:52:35.841 --> 00:52:36.601
Neal Sáles-Griffin: strategic.


447
00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:39.311
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, it's all rehearsed. It's always rehearsed.


448
00:52:39.461 --> 00:52:41.071
Neal Sáles-Griffin: deeply rehearsed. The whole thing is.


449
00:52:41.071 --> 00:52:41.611
Dave Scott: So he.


450
00:52:41.611 --> 00:52:42.121
Neal Sáles-Griffin: People don't.


451
00:52:42.121 --> 00:52:45.390
Dave Scott: He took the hard he took the hard he took. He took the hard, hard road.


452
00:52:45.391 --> 00:53:05.681
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, yes, and here's the thing. It's choreographed. But like people come up to me afterwards. Neil, this is such a great demo day. Wow! That was really intense, like those questions. Were, they live like people? Don't believe that it's scripted, based on how well you know everyone handles it, and how everybody performs, which is cool. But the other thing I want you all to know is like.


453
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:10.911
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if you know, you're gonna get asked really tough, uncomfortable questions.


454
00:53:11.801 --> 00:53:18.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Handle them yourself on stage rather than having to deal with them afterwards. It saves you so much time.


455
00:53:18.541 --> 00:53:21.031
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that was part of the design. Here.


456
00:53:21.081 --> 00:53:23.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: go ahead, cogniscope.


457
00:53:23.891 --> 00:53:31.781
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, I I think the best part was the Q&A part, because the video itself was kind of like a pitch.


458
00:53:32.571 --> 00:53:41.091
Çoruh | CogniScope: and like it had so many information. I kinda lost track of what he was talking about.


459
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:44.210
Çoruh | CogniScope: and when he started to pitch


460
00:53:44.471 --> 00:53:50.131
Çoruh | CogniScope: he still tells about the same statistics, same stuff over and over again, and also


461
00:53:50.537 --> 00:53:57.601
Çoruh | CogniScope: some of the quests, like some of the answers. He had also had some same lingo. So I think it's like.


462
00:53:57.961 --> 00:53:59.301
Çoruh | CogniScope: like for the


463
00:54:00.431 --> 00:54:03.820
Çoruh | CogniScope: yeah, I don't know, like I kind of get that. I


464
00:54:04.211 --> 00:54:12.880
Çoruh | CogniScope: those are the only good thing about zest, and he's trying to push it so hard so we can believe it like, that's what I sensed.


465
00:54:13.051 --> 00:54:16.431
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, well, let me add to that, just to be clear like


466
00:54:16.591 --> 00:54:22.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: he learned that there was, it would be information overload to say more


467
00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:28.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so it made more sense to reinforce a few key points that he wanted you to remember. That would be good enough to get you to talk to him.


468
00:54:29.071 --> 00:54:32.801
Çoruh | CogniScope: Yeah, like, I, I'm just like pointing it out, because, like, we suppose.


469
00:54:32.801 --> 00:54:33.981
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, like.


470
00:54:34.511 --> 00:54:38.081
Çoruh | CogniScope: And like other than that, the Q. And A was the best part.


471
00:54:38.411 --> 00:54:45.130
Çoruh | CogniScope: I think, the pitching and the video had so many similarities. So it kinda


472
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:47.271
Çoruh | CogniScope: it may cost


473
00:54:47.341 --> 00:54:52.151
Çoruh | CogniScope: people to get lost in the in it, because they're hearing the same thing.


474
00:54:52.551 --> 00:54:54.211
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, who do you think he was talking to.


475
00:54:56.661 --> 00:54:57.731
Çoruh | CogniScope: To what?


476
00:54:57.731 --> 00:55:02.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Who was that bet pitch for? Was it for everybody in the room to be entertained, or was it for someone else.


477
00:55:02.751 --> 00:55:05.570
Çoruh | CogniScope: Like it's mostly for investors.


478
00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:06.671
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Exactly.


479
00:55:06.961 --> 00:55:11.861
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So here's the deal. So Jake knew his audience just to be clear. And the investors


480
00:55:12.811 --> 00:55:14.321
Neal Sáles-Griffin: are whip smart.


481
00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:18.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So they're gonna look at that, and they're gonna check out after about 30 seconds.


482
00:55:18.741 --> 00:55:28.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: unless there's more interesting metrics or details to share. Now, the rest of the audience might feel overwhelmed. Just like you said. But any adept investor has seen this model a hundred times.


483
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:44.821
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So they're already like kind of like waiting for the key things that would actually make them interested. Oh, wow! It's a food cooking app, is it? All free? Are they hoping for? Oh, no, they actually make money interesting. Oh, it's not a lot. Oh, but they do have Mrr like. So there's interesting little details that he thought through to like pepper in there, and it worked.


484
00:55:45.234 --> 00:55:48.641
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But I agree with you. It is redundant, but it was redundant on purpose.


485
00:55:48.841 --> 00:55:49.511
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay.


486
00:55:50.171 --> 00:55:50.921
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah.


487
00:55:51.831 --> 00:56:19.510
Kevin Su: I actually didn't feel was that redundant? I feel like everything was so strategically placed. And that's why I get like. That's why I get the oh, people are skeptical about him before you talk to him. You're no longer skeptical, like he had evidence to support either internal growth or external research, and every data point, or like Stat he had, was backed up by some sort of commentary like, Oh, this is why I'm telling you this, and like, I think, as consumer apps, especially at tech.


488
00:56:19.871 --> 00:56:31.851
Kevin Su: you're it's all you're always under more scrutiny, like, Yeah, it's a great idea. Can you actually execute? And he starts with the hard data, and he answers the hard questions. And I don't know it was, yeah. It was


489
00:56:32.201 --> 00:56:34.591
Kevin Su: a really really good presentation from.


490
00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:38.951
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Well, Kevin, he he knew, because he'd already faced a lot of scrutiny from investors.


491
00:56:38.951 --> 00:56:39.561
Kevin Su: Yep.


492
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:45.081
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So he already knew cause he had already been beaten up, so he knew what to put into the pitch, to kind of overcome those things.


493
00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:45.961
Kevin Su: Yeah.


494
00:56:46.321 --> 00:56:51.861
Annie: Do we get to? I guess. How? How is it selected which Eir interviews us.


495
00:56:52.151 --> 00:56:53.431
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They pick you.


496
00:56:53.431 --> 00:56:54.391
Annie: Oh, okay.


497
00:56:54.541 --> 00:56:55.331
Annie: Cool.


498
00:56:56.111 --> 00:57:02.351
Lilliana Robinson: That way. Every single person is with an Eir who wants to invest their time into that pitch.


499
00:57:02.791 --> 00:57:05.440
Lilliana Robinson: Then being excited about helping you is the most important.


500
00:57:05.441 --> 00:57:22.211
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So all the more reason to have really good decorum. And and and you know, bedside manner with your eirs like you gotta be cordial with them. You gotta be timely. You gotta communicate. Well, you gotta be respectful. You gotta follow through on your commitments with them, because it will matter on stage.


501
00:57:22.641 --> 00:57:23.311
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yep.


502
00:57:23.671 --> 00:57:24.081
Fabio Caironi: All right.


503
00:57:24.081 --> 00:57:24.491
Lilliana Robinson: Fabio.


504
00:57:25.731 --> 00:57:28.062
Fabio Caironi: So all these 3 companies were


505
00:57:28.471 --> 00:57:31.340
Fabio Caironi: B to C, and they already have


506
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:37.294
Fabio Caironi: attraction. Which is something I got here. Me loose.


507
00:57:37.721 --> 00:57:49.350
Fabio Caironi: I'm wondering how this translates to A, b 2 b company that maybe doesn't have that much structure like just hearing, you know, 140 K. Followers. 20 million engagement. It's like big numbers that kind of


508
00:57:49.742 --> 00:58:00.021
Fabio Caironi: draw the attention of the folks where you say. Oh, we got one pain pilot like it's not something you might wanna showcase on stage. So in terms of like the


509
00:58:00.781 --> 00:58:12.141
Fabio Caironi: the numbers and how you shape your achievements so that they sound compelling, and they immediate immediately


510
00:58:12.241 --> 00:58:16.470
Fabio Caironi: convey a sign of traction. It's something that.


511
00:58:16.471 --> 00:58:17.921
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, it has to be real.


512
00:58:18.201 --> 00:58:22.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You have to actually have it. It can't sound compelling. It has to actually be compelling


513
00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:27.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but we'll work with each of you on a pitch that's substantive. And to be clear, Cicada actually is A, b 2 b company


514
00:58:28.067 --> 00:58:31.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so that 1st pitch you saw is B, 2 B,


515
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:32.166
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but


516
00:58:34.421 --> 00:58:38.981
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And there's a couple more that we're about to show you now so hopefully that helps you with the reference.


517
00:58:38.981 --> 00:58:56.841
Lilliana Robinson: Sorry. Now, I think what you're realizing. Fabio is like, there's a reason that we're in week 7 showing this to you guys like, oh, it's really important to have traction to show like we always keep saying like, it's probably like a broken record with the 2 of us saying it. You need to build a good business. You need to build a good business like there's no way around it. You can't


518
00:58:56.841 --> 00:59:13.200
Lilliana Robinson: front like front it like you can't like. Just shape it to be something that it's not. You either have good traction that you can share or you don't, and having minimal traction that you want us to help you like storytell. That's okay. But when you have nothing, we can't really make it something.


519
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.821
Fabio Caironi: Am.


520
00:59:13.821 --> 00:59:17.460
Lilliana Robinson: Important that you guys focus on getting that during this growth month.


521
00:59:17.651 --> 00:59:21.741
Fabio Caironi: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, I was referring to like having like attraction that has


522
00:59:22.424 --> 00:59:32.031
Fabio Caironi: a size that is not comparable like to like a B to C business. And, by the way, sorry I yeah, I I was thinking of cicada.


523
00:59:32.161 --> 00:59:36.290
Fabio Caironi: like, you know, they sell to the agents so well.


524
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:36.631
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.


525
00:59:36.631 --> 00:59:37.631
Fabio Caironi: B, 2 b, but


526
00:59:37.961 --> 00:59:39.671
Fabio Caironi: yeah, yeah.


527
00:59:39.671 --> 00:59:43.031
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, have you heard of like a sizzle versus a steak


528
00:59:43.221 --> 00:59:46.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: pitch? Have you heard of that civil sizzle versus steak?


529
00:59:46.471 --> 00:59:52.541
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, okay. So sizzle versus steak. So the idea is that when you have sizzle, that's like presentation.


530
00:59:52.561 --> 01:00:05.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's like, Oh, wow! Look at that like it looks really cool, but where's the meat? So so there's there's steak pitches which like to have the substance, and then there's sizzle pitches which don't have any substance, but like have a lot of presentation.


531
01:00:05.951 --> 01:00:13.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's a nice little happy medium that will try to help you strike. But some a lot of companies, especially out here in the bay are all sizzle.


532
01:00:14.551 --> 01:00:15.241
Fabio Caironi: Yeah.


533
01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:18.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm not saying that's a good thing, but it is what it is.


534
01:00:19.231 --> 01:00:19.841
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.


535
01:00:20.121 --> 01:00:24.510
Lilliana Robinson: And I would say, saying, 1 1 paid pilot is impressive.


536
01:00:24.601 --> 01:00:30.420
Lilliana Robinson: Getting up there and saying, You have a paid pilot is is great. That's great, Fabia, that's nothing to be


537
01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.281
Lilliana Robinson: putting yourself down about


538
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:35.620
Lilliana Robinson: cool, Dave, did you want to say something really quick, because we're gonna jump into some B 2? B.


539
01:00:36.241 --> 01:00:45.981
Dave Scott: Yeah. One negative, I guess, was that I I kept on saying it's 20 times this or or 5 times that. But he didn't give actual numbers. And I just want to get your feedback on on that strategy versus real numbers.


540
01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:52.731
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, it was a style stylistic decision. I think he made.


541
01:00:54.521 --> 01:00:58.761
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't know if there's an objectively correct answer or way to frame it.


542
01:01:00.481 --> 01:01:06.331
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but I think more specific numbers probably would be more compelling instinctually, Dave, but you'd have to hear it to know.


543
01:01:07.771 --> 01:01:36.091
Lilliana Robinson: Final thing on Jake that I want from all of you is he didn't just he wasn't just rushing through, answering the questions, the real. The reason everyone thought that was real was because he actually took time, and he was almost thinking about his answers, which, even if they're memorized, you guys can still do. You can think about what you're saying, so that it's coming off extremely naturally, because a lot of the founders will the ones we're not showing you. They'll get up, and every time someone will ask them the question will say good question, and then they'll rattle off the answer, and then they'll just wait.


544
01:01:36.091 --> 01:01:52.131
Lilliana Robinson: It's like we're running lines in like a middle school play. It should be actual thought that goes into it. Real emotion like you're really telling these people your answers. You're not just rattling off something that you prepared. This is the time to actually say it. So take your time.


545
01:01:52.621 --> 01:01:58.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And last line on this, just to be clear, there's 1 other underlying really important factor with everything you've seen so far.


546
01:01:59.131 --> 01:02:03.231
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which is, it's not actually all the details of the business. And what's being said?


547
01:02:03.671 --> 01:02:11.351
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's how we feel about the CEO and their capacity to lead and pivot and run this business.


548
01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:18.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Do we think that this person is gonna figure it out because what they're saying now is probably gonna change next year?


549
01:02:19.201 --> 01:02:24.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm saying that as an investor. Right? I know better than to think that what I'm seeing now is what it's going to be forever.


550
01:02:24.681 --> 01:02:27.201
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm going to my I'm asking myself.


551
01:02:27.301 --> 01:02:34.491
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Is this the kind of CEO that I'd be willing to place a bet on because they seem like they demonstrated that they're able to adapt and figure things out.


552
01:02:35.031 --> 01:02:38.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's ultimately a CEO evaluation. For 6 min.


553
01:02:41.861 --> 01:02:47.501
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. Okay? So here's for all the b 2 b folks. The next 2 are heavy. B, 2 B


554
01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:48.971
Lilliana Robinson: watch. How we did that.


555
01:02:50.271 --> 01:02:52.481
Lilliana Robinson: hey? Hey?


556
01:02:53.261 --> 01:02:55.411
Lilliana Robinson: One more time!


557
01:02:57.221 --> 01:03:00.391
Lilliana Robinson: Yay.


558
01:03:00.881 --> 01:03:04.821
Lilliana Robinson: that's my people. That's great


559
01:03:06.131 --> 01:03:12.270
Lilliana Robinson: generative. AI is the biggest revolution in the world since invention of the computers.


560
01:03:12.601 --> 01:03:15.691
Lilliana Robinson: So what are you doing with Gen. AI.


561
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:22.931
Lilliana Robinson: Seriously, what are you doing with Gen. AI asking Chatgpt why this meme is funny?


562
01:03:23.401 --> 01:03:31.051
Lilliana Robinson: Our customers have increased their performance to 250% by using genai and run bear.


563
01:03:31.671 --> 01:03:33.520
Lilliana Robinson: are you going to lose this game?


564
01:03:33.531 --> 01:03:39.540
Lilliana Robinson: Are you going to hire AI consultant and spend months on implementations to see how it works.


565
01:03:39.741 --> 01:03:41.181
Lilliana Robinson: Don't don't


566
01:03:41.331 --> 01:03:42.791
Lilliana Robinson: meet rumbear


567
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:56.371
Lilliana Robinson: in just 10 min instead of month. In 10 min you can integrate your custom. AI built on Openai, or anthropic into your communication platforms like slack Hubspot. Send desk and more.


568
01:03:56.731 --> 01:04:00.780
Lilliana Robinson: and you don't need any coding or engineering support.


569
01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:04.061
Lilliana Robinson: Since joining techstars


570
01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:07.490
Lilliana Robinson: we have quadrupled our Mrr


571
01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:15.891
Lilliana Robinson: by increasing our customer base from 15 to 66 companies, including big names like Pcg.


572
01:04:16.321 --> 01:04:19.110
Lilliana Robinson: Let's see how Rumbere made this possible


573
01:04:23.001 --> 01:04:37.161
Lilliana Robinson: rumbear is a connector between Generative AI and communication platforms. In 10 min you can create your custom. AI, like Hr. Assistant on slack sales, copilot on teams or customer support agents on Hubspot.


574
01:04:37.401 --> 01:05:02.390
Lilliana Robinson: Hey, Todd? How many people in your company benefit from Rumbear? Probably I'd say 2 or 300, all of our medical team, and then we're starting to roll it out to the sales team and marketing and legal in each organization. The docs that everybody edits and they can just communicate directly with ais through slack, which is a game changer. How about you, Tash? What do you use from bear for putting live customer queries into slack to


575
01:05:02.391 --> 01:05:23.730
Lilliana Robinson: see what responses come out and then use them. We have been playing around with the Hubspot integration as well, which we have found useful. The benefit definitely is quicker testing and validation, and then to give the rest of the company a chance to play around with it as well. Ecg. Laser away, and 60 more customers are leading their industry, using rumbear, join rumbear


576
01:05:23.731 --> 01:05:25.261
Lilliana Robinson: and stay ahead.


577
01:05:37.201 --> 01:05:38.611
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, hey, Lillian?


578
01:05:41.631 --> 01:05:49.790
Lilliana Robinson: All right. Technical difficulties. We had to get the ipad there. So that was an amazing video, and those seem like some really happy customers.


579
01:05:50.391 --> 01:05:57.641
Lilliana Robinson: Could you help me understand, Runbear better? How is it different from all of the Gpts out there like Openai.


580
01:05:58.311 --> 01:06:00.180
Lilliana Robinson: Great. 1st of all, thank you.


581
01:06:02.071 --> 01:06:13.581
Lilliana Robinson: Think of Run Bear as a connector instead of an AI builder. You can still use Openai or anthropic, whatever you are familiar with to create your custom. AI,


582
01:06:13.771 --> 01:06:27.451
Lilliana Robinson: while rumble helps you create them even easier. Its core unique value. Prop is connecting those AI apps into the channels like Slack or hubspot that you face every day.


583
01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:43.761
Lilliana Robinson: This enables customizing the user experience for each AI seamlessly. And you can manage multiple AI apps for different purposes across various channels at a minimal cost. The best part. Anyone can do that in minutes.


584
01:06:44.491 --> 01:06:50.071
Lilliana Robinson: That seems so useful. But it makes me wonder why the integration piece is important in the 1st place.


585
01:06:50.081 --> 01:06:55.260
Lilliana Robinson: So why is it a big deal to have Gpts integrated into slack or Hubspot.


586
01:06:55.751 --> 01:06:56.691
Lilliana Robinson: Right?


587
01:06:56.901 --> 01:07:04.730
Lilliana Robinson: Companies need to meet their customers or their employees where they are, where they live every day.


588
01:07:04.761 --> 01:07:13.830
Lilliana Robinson: For example, if you want to return your fancy, Nike shoes for some reason. Would you go to Chatgpt and ask, How can I return my Nike shoes?


589
01:07:13.881 --> 01:07:15.680
Lilliana Robinson: No, you probably wouldn't.


590
01:07:15.751 --> 01:07:17.291
Lilliana Robinson: You'd go to where


591
01:07:17.481 --> 01:07:19.631
Lilliana Robinson: Nike customer center right


592
01:07:19.831 --> 01:07:30.301
Lilliana Robinson: by integrating AI into your communication platforms. You don't need to change users behavior to make the Gen. AI do its jobs.


593
01:07:30.751 --> 01:07:37.331
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I think I get it. So then how is it different from just using intercom or Zendesk? AI,


594
01:07:38.361 --> 01:07:39.161
Lilliana Robinson: good.


595
01:07:39.441 --> 01:07:40.901
Lilliana Robinson: long story short.


596
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.591
Lilliana Robinson: you can create what you want instead of using general purpose. AI.


597
01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.170
Lilliana Robinson: As long as companies have so different tasks and workflows


598
01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:54.420
Lilliana Robinson: the general purpose. AI often cannot meet all the requirements.


599
01:07:54.481 --> 01:08:05.221
Lilliana Robinson: For example, you probably wouldn't use friendly customer support AI, such as intercom to identify some potential compliance issues. Right?


600
01:08:05.251 --> 01:08:19.160
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So as a proof, our customers tend to begin with one AI app, and then they create more and more apps for different purposes as continue to use run, bear.


601
01:08:19.501 --> 01:08:31.230
Lilliana Robinson: and I have one more, one of the customers. They even use more than 3 AI apps simultaneously. That's 30, 30, more than 30 ais. That's incredible.


602
01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:40.841
Lilliana Robinson: So tell me, Gen. AI, as a landscape is extremely crowded, as we all know. So how is Runbear going to cut through that noise to be successful?


603
01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:53.020
Lilliana Robinson: Well, Openai, anthropic Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, they all aim to help people create custom? Gen. AI. Easily.


604
01:08:53.531 --> 01:08:55.861
Lilliana Robinson: But how are people using them?


605
01:08:56.381 --> 01:09:01.500
Lilliana Robinson: They need to integrate them into their workflows. But the current solutions are not cutting it


606
01:09:01.661 --> 01:09:14.780
Lilliana Robinson: because of that, people are hiring AI consultants who cost more than $250 per hour, and then spend 3 to 4 months on implementing one project.


607
01:09:15.061 --> 01:09:28.590
Lilliana Robinson: They can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per implementation and even more on maintenance with bomb bear. You can accomplish that in minutes, and it costs only a couple $100 per month.


608
01:09:28.751 --> 01:09:43.960
Lilliana Robinson: and we cover the maintenance, such as handling new api updates or even unexpected errors. The competitive advantage is so clear. That's why we are trusted by companies like, Bcg.


609
01:09:44.061 --> 01:09:45.761
Lilliana Robinson: yeah, that's impressive.


610
01:09:45.831 --> 01:09:47.671
Lilliana Robinson: So speaking of customers.


611
01:09:48.331 --> 01:09:51.131
Lilliana Robinson: what is next on the roadmap for runbear


612
01:09:52.031 --> 01:09:53.321
Lilliana Robinson: going forward.


613
01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:59.080
Lilliana Robinson: We aim to become the standard of integrating AI into workflows.


614
01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:05.121
Lilliana Robinson: for now we support Slack Microsoft teams, Discord, Zendesk and Hubspot.


615
01:10:05.231 --> 01:10:11.480
Lilliana Robinson: We are going to improve and expand our integrations based on our customers needs.


616
01:10:11.861 --> 01:10:12.711
Lilliana Robinson: Please


617
01:10:12.871 --> 01:10:16.871
Lilliana Robinson: keep your eye on us. Anyone who wants to utilize AI for work.


618
01:10:16.991 --> 01:10:19.191
Lilliana Robinson: They will think of rum bear. First, st


619
01:10:19.471 --> 01:10:20.681
Lilliana Robinson: I love that.


620
01:10:20.851 --> 01:10:26.331
Lilliana Robinson: We'll definitely keep our eye on you. So we have the whole audience here. How can we help you?


621
01:10:27.461 --> 01:10:28.481
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.


622
01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:36.601
Lilliana Robinson: although we still have around 15 months running. We'd love to boost our growth through investment and partnerships.


623
01:10:36.951 --> 01:10:41.710
Lilliana Robinson: So please look for this pink T-shirt or scan. Now this QR.


624
01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:44.190
Lilliana Robinson: To discuss how we might work together.


625
01:10:44.391 --> 01:10:49.211
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome! Look for the pink t-shirt, guys. This is Run bear.


626
01:10:49.331 --> 01:10:50.251
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you.


627
01:10:53.381 --> 01:10:55.410
Lilliana Robinson: Who was that random lady?


628
01:10:55.631 --> 01:10:59.111
Lilliana Robinson: I'm just kidding his Eir had to


629
01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:02.240
Lilliana Robinson: go to her daughter's graduation. So I something.


630
01:11:04.721 --> 01:11:05.971
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Did a good job.


631
01:11:06.141 --> 01:11:10.161
Lilliana Robinson: What did you guys think of snow? And like from the b 2 b perspective.


632
01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:23.490
Annie: I liked at the end, like, I guess. And it it's a question, too, that he had a slide up with the QR. Code and the Logos like behind. I thought that was cool. Will we also have the option to do that as we're talking.


633
01:11:23.491 --> 01:11:26.091
Lilliana Robinson: 1 1 slide behind you during the Q. And a.


634
01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:30.051
Annie: Cool. Okay, yeah. I like that. He really emphasized the


635
01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:34.841
Annie: the the customers that he had and brought them up in the discussion as well.


636
01:11:38.991 --> 01:11:47.683
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, the whole thing was super professional and like streamlined, and like a couple of the others very thematically, like, connected. And


637
01:11:48.491 --> 01:11:51.441
George Reed - Noetic: yeah, I've been kind of wondering as well about the


638
01:11:52.981 --> 01:11:57.880
George Reed - Noetic: sort of b 2 b side, and being a bit more dry with it. But I think that was really good. So


639
01:11:57.911 --> 01:12:01.641
George Reed - Noetic: I think, for personally that was the closest to what I'd like to try and do, too.


640
01:12:01.821 --> 01:12:02.661
George Reed - Noetic: So


641
01:12:03.251 --> 01:12:04.701
George Reed - Noetic: good example, thanks.


642
01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:08.140
Lilliana Robinson: Anything he could have done better.


643
01:12:11.211 --> 01:12:19.398
Fabio Caironi: I feel like the tone. Just like maybe being more engaging. And yeah, I feel like that was like, just


644
01:12:19.871 --> 01:12:23.621
Fabio Caironi: leaving some some space in between the words.


645
01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:31.511
Lilliana Robinson: And this applies to a lot of you. I had to so Snow, the founder there that you saw you. Some of you met him during tech week.


646
01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:40.670
Lilliana Robinson: He came here from Korea, so he needed a lot of dialect coaching, so I helped him enunciate the words so that it was


647
01:12:40.701 --> 01:12:50.151
Lilliana Robinson: audible to everybody in the room, and a lot of you are from different places around the world. You're going to have to do the same thing to really practice being clear with your language.


648
01:12:51.851 --> 01:12:58.411
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I will say he came a really long way, like if you saw him at the beginning of program, like he was shy to even speak up


649
01:12:58.451 --> 01:12:59.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like in a call.


650
01:13:00.061 --> 01:13:06.421
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So to go from that to being able to pitch on stage. The way he did was really impressive. We're really proud of him.


651
01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:15.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right. Let's give them one more b, 2 B.


652
01:13:15.851 --> 01:13:16.621
Lilliana Robinson: All right.


653
01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:20.451
Lilliana Robinson: Do you want to preface this one at all purposely? This is from our.


654
01:13:20.451 --> 01:13:31.561
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Obviously so, yeah, we actually have never demoed this one to founders before. So I haven't seen this one in a while. But I thought of it earlier this morning with Liliano. Because I was like, well, one.


655
01:13:31.861 --> 01:13:54.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They have some. Really. They have some like brand name investors now on their cap table, and they're doing quite well, so I thought it'd be cool to go back and see where they're at from back then, cause I don't think they were ones that, like everyone, was like super hyped about or betting on. But yet here they are like actually like seemingly thriving. So I think it's a cool thing to kind of use a time machine to go back one year and see where they were at.


656
01:13:57.121 --> 01:14:00.820
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, is there one and only e-commerce class through ebay?


657
01:14:04.271 --> 01:14:05.271
Lilliana Robinson: And then.


658
01:14:08.881 --> 01:14:11.420
Lilliana Robinson: when you call me, you call


659
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:23.871
Lilliana Robinson: every year 200 billion dollars is spent on digital advertising in the Us. Alone, and 50% is wasted.


660
01:14:23.971 --> 01:14:28.201
Lilliana Robinson: It's like the old mad men adage half my ads worked. I just don't know which half


661
01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:35.490
Lilliana Robinson: this waste is multifaceted. But it's largely due to marketers, especially creatives making decisions with guesswork


662
01:14:35.501 --> 01:14:37.381
Lilliana Robinson: rather than based on data.


663
01:14:37.401 --> 01:14:42.511
Lilliana Robinson: They want to make data-driven decisions. They just don't have the time or the resources.


664
01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:53.981
Lilliana Robinson: I experienced this firsthand working in this space for over a decade with brands like Team U.S.A. During the Rio Olympics, Dolby, and countless others. This guesswork problem really frustrated me.


665
01:14:54.081 --> 01:14:55.791
Lilliana Robinson: So I set out to fix it


666
01:14:56.061 --> 01:15:05.511
Lilliana Robinson: purposely. AI is a software platform that helps, advertisers, reclaim wasted media spend and wasted time using artificial intelligence.


667
01:15:05.611 --> 01:15:10.831
Lilliana Robinson: Put simply, our product tells you exactly which text and visual elements perform best.


668
01:15:11.361 --> 01:15:20.180
Lilliana Robinson: We've had 9 paying customers and have doubled our revenue since the beginning of techstars this month. We're set to surpass 100 k. Arr.


669
01:15:23.031 --> 01:15:25.981
Lilliana Robinson: What if marketers didn't have to guess


670
01:15:26.181 --> 01:15:32.330
Lilliana Robinson: that's the power of AI done right. That's purposely.ai. Let's see how it works with a real customer.


671
01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:38.451
Lilliana Robinson: Meet Mackenzie. She's an associate creative director at the app.


672
01:15:42.441 --> 01:15:44.740
Lilliana Robinson: Well done, sir.


673
01:15:45.411 --> 01:15:46.341
Lilliana Robinson: pretty pumped.


674
01:15:47.391 --> 01:15:50.560
Lilliana Robinson: I've never noticed that. Did Alex tell you that


675
01:15:50.621 --> 01:15:52.031
Lilliana Robinson: the videographer did not.


676
01:15:52.031 --> 01:15:54.072
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No idea what happened there.


677
01:15:54.661 --> 01:15:57.441
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's interesting, either way. Let's keep going.


678
01:15:57.461 --> 01:15:59.551
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll drop the link to his website.


679
01:15:59.871 --> 01:16:05.641
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Dante set the standard and you met it so well done.


680
01:16:05.751 --> 01:16:18.771
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so really high level. I helped introduce you to a customer or 2, and it's because I felt the pain, and I saw that this was something that a lot of the companies that I was talking to were dealing with and


681
01:16:18.821 --> 01:16:29.021
Neal Sáles-Griffin: tell us a little bit about your product roadmap. And how that's evolving. Yeah. So as you just saw, our current product is AI insights to tell you exactly which text and visual elements perform. Best


682
01:16:29.241 --> 01:16:36.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 2024 roadmap is all about streamlining, creative and production processes. So basically helping marketers design their ads


683
01:16:36.781 --> 01:16:47.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to do that, we're going to leverage fine-tuned generative AI models. Specifically, a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback. Basically, our users are helping to train our model and build our moat.


684
01:16:47.691 --> 01:17:00.641
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You know, there's really a lot. There's there's a handful of big AI marketing companies out there. Jasper AI is one of them. They're a billion dollar company. So what Jasper did to automate blog posts is what we're going to do for ads


685
01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:23.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: makes sense. Look. I've seen a ton of marketing tech companies out there, and it feels like these days, especially with AI. There's just more and more marketing tech companies popping out. Can you talk a little bit about how you differentiate from that crowd, for sure. Yeah, it's a crowded space. But we're unique for 3 reasons. So first, st our go-to-market strategy selling to agencies is unique.


686
01:17:23.321 --> 01:17:32.301
Neal Sáles-Griffin: A lot of Sas has trouble selling to agencies, but I worked there for much of my career. So I really understand that target persona and how to sell to them.


687
01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:33.441
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Second.


688
01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:45.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we have team market fit. So our go-to-market lead. Jj. Is here with us tonight. She worked in analytics at Warby Parker at segment during hyper growth. We also have an AI Ml. Engineer from Amazon.


689
01:17:45.861 --> 01:18:08.801
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And finally, the granularity of our insights is unique. So we go down to the text and visual component level. And so, for example, we'll say for a given advertiser, ads with green grass performed 30% better text with the words, benefits and thoughtfully crafted perform 70% better. So that granularity is not only in high demand, but it's also hard to come by.


690
01:18:08.831 --> 01:18:10.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, it makes sense. I mean, look.


691
01:18:10.751 --> 01:18:13.961
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you and I have been working now for a couple weeks, and I've seen


692
01:18:14.581 --> 01:18:38.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the product evolve. I've seen your sales evolve. The thing that I've been most impressed by is actually your go to market right? In a very short period of time. You've been able to add customers and show that there is product market fit. Can you expand a little bit about your go-to-market strategy? Because I think it's pretty unique, absolutely. So we're deliberately selling to ad agencies to get data 10 X faster.


693
01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:45.851
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So agencies have at least 10 to 30 clients of their own. And for each of those clients we're getting their data to train our model


694
01:18:45.851 --> 01:19:15.001
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for incremental revenue and to get more reps. So one of the other cool things about agencies is they're using our product and our insights for their own sales efforts. And so when they win a new client, they onboard them to purposely. We're getting incremental revenue because of our per brand pricing model. We've really been able to prove out this land and expand model. So, for example, we had an early customer at $300 a month. We've since expanded their contract value 8 x


695
01:19:15.161 --> 01:19:19.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: not bad. That's good. Nrr, for sure.


696
01:19:19.581 --> 01:19:27.221
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So yeah, you've got a bunch of people here all supportive, I'm assuming. Tell us how we can help


697
01:19:27.351 --> 01:19:51.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so surprise surprise. We're looking to talk to investors and customers on the investor front. We'd love to speak with pre-seed funds interested in b 2 b. AI, but specifically with ties to marketing and media. So we had a couple sales calls recently with business insider. We'd love to get intros to a few more kind of media publishers to really explore that segment. That'd be a great intro from an investor


698
01:19:51.411 --> 01:20:01.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: on the customer prospect side. It's all about agencies so agencies that work with D to C brands, nonprofits. Really, any consumer brand that runs a lot of Facebook ads is relevant.


699
01:20:01.571 --> 01:20:10.931
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And finally, just a quick, exciting update. Last month we signed our 1st annual contract. So nice


700
01:20:11.031 --> 01:20:31.411
Neal Sáles-Griffin: $30,000 contract. Not a bad size. That's great, especially in the market. You're targeting. So I feel like that's just proof point for exciting growth ahead. Absolutely. We're gaining momentum, would love to chat with anyone relevant. So investors, introductions and agency contacts.


701
01:20:31.461 --> 01:20:34.691
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, Alex, thanks a lot. Man. Great stuff. Thanks, Imran.


702
01:20:36.651 --> 01:20:42.761
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just for context, the they just got a commitment from Kleiner Perkins, I think, last month.


703
01:20:43.211 --> 01:20:49.471
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And it's set off a cascade, I think, of other commitments from a lot of other investors, since that's kind of how they operate.


704
01:20:52.181 --> 01:21:06.071
Lilliana Robinson: So in we only have a minute left. So instead of discussing that one, I I think, showing it was probably good enough. There are lots of examples of B, 2 B+B, 2 C, we'll post even more examples, probably next week.


705
01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:13.251
Lilliana Robinson: Closer to Troy. Session. For you to watch. Well, I'll post the ones that I just showed you, as well as some other ones, that if you wanted to look at


706
01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:20.700
Lilliana Robinson: but just start thinking. So this is just planting a little marker in your brain. December 6.th We have about


707
01:21:21.171 --> 01:21:35.400
Lilliana Robinson: a a month and a half. Until then. That's what you're aiming for. We have a lot of work to do to get there outside of just crafting the pitch about building the business itself so as much as we can do to help you get there definitely. Let us know. I don't know if you wanted to close with anything else, Neil.


708
01:21:35.401 --> 01:21:37.461
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's all about your business progress


709
01:21:37.501 --> 01:21:50.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: again. You'll have more interesting things to stay on stage if your business is doing well. If all we're doing for the next month is helping you come up with a story about the hope or potential of your business, because you haven't made any progress. That's tough.


710
01:21:50.911 --> 01:21:53.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let's let's make some progress.


711
01:21:55.421 --> 01:21:56.990
Lilliana Robinson: Alright. Thank you, everybody.
