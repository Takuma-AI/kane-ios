### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Brad Schnitzer: Ways to step up to the mic, or at least speak during the session. How does that work.
- Kevin Kaspar: video processing and data mining. We do this with a crowd source network of providers so alike. The big cloud guys like Aws, Google Cloud, we source computing power from underutilized assets, such as business work workstations and consumer devices.
- Kevin Kaspar: and so we the biggest problem right now in machine learning is actually at the labeling like the data labeling layer, and so what we do is, we bring user insights into the data labeling process

### Key Insights

> "Brad Schnitzer: Excited to have you all the way from Turkey right."

> "Brad Schnitzer: I'm going to try to convince you guys today that this is going to be one of the most important things during your time at techstars and beyond. So hopefully, I can do that in this presentation. What's cool is tech stars and and a lot of those manage the managing directors that are part of techstars, like we obsess with finding the best people that"

> "Brad Schnitzer: Cause, that's something I think that's always really helpful for founders. So maybe I'll I'll carve a little bit of time out of Kpi since you guys have gotten kind of a a little pre session on that, and I'll bring in one of his cool, Linkedin Demos, because I think it could be really helpful"

> "Brad Schnitzer: Talking about it right? Life's a million times richer when you give without the expectation of receiving, which is how you build deep relationships. So what I want to do, you know, I think I still need to work on what we're going to call this activity. It is relationship building and community building. So at its heart. It's not transactional. I think that's a really important lesson as we go through this"
