1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.450
max: Or

2
00:00:04.052 --> 00:00:04.870
max: okay? I mean.

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:12.300
Lilliana Robinson: You can also read out questions if there are like larger questions while you're doing it. Do you want me to read them to you, or we'll just wait till the end.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.319
max: Yeah, I'll go through. I made a little couple of notes here, and I can put this on the base camp when I'm done, so you don't have no one else to like

5
00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:26.513
max: type it. But so I can just share. Tell my story with this a little bit, which is so I I got

6
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.129
max: I got really really lucky, very young in my life, and I met Barack Obama

7
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.359
max: at an anti Iraq War rally in Chicago, and I just, and I was in high school, and I just went up.

8
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:57.009
max: I don't know why. I can't believe I did this, but I went up, and I was like, I love you. I want to work for you like let's make it happen. And he gave me his business card, and I and I just got so lucky, and I and I worked with him for many, many years, and I I also was very lucky that I got a job on the can the Presidential campaign when he ran for President the first time in 2,008,

9
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:12.329
max: and I've been like, I've had interesting, you know, whatever ups and downs in my career, and been in all these interesting places. And, like, I have to say, like the Presidential campaign, there's nothing I can't even compare it to anything in life like the pressure cooker. The it is

10
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.400
max: I I can't, I struggle, I can't even describe the intensity of it. And so to give you a picture, we're in this huge office

11
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.729
max: and a whole floor of a big building in Chicago.

12
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.708
max: and they have this countdown clock on the

13
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.679
max: They have this countdown clock on the wall, and it's showing like the day, the months, weeks, days.

14
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.059
max: hours, minutes, and seconds until election day.

15
00:01:37.090 --> 00:02:02.480
max: and you show up to work. And you're like, Oh, maybe I should like check my email, or like play a little like spider solitaire, or like chat with people, or like, figure out a lunch order. And you see those tech seconds counting down. And you're like, no, we're all every. It was the. It was a incredibly intense. And then this was before like scrum and agile. And all this was like 2,008. So it was like early days for all of that. But what what my little team that I was on would do

16
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:17.879
max: was we would check in in the morning, so we'd all get to work at, you know, whatever 7 or 8, and everyone would say what they wanted to accomplish during the day, and then we'd all work until you know whatever 8 or 9 at night, and we'd have a checkout meeting, and everyone would say what they got done, and there was just like no excuse for missing it. So

17
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:40.749
max: I was all that's I. I just got dropped. I was like, I'm a I am a by temperament. I'm like a very lazy and disorganized person, and so I had to learn this. I was in college at this time, and I just had to like get it together like it was on. I just could not. I couldn't go to these meetings like I didn't wanna let the campaign down. I didn't wanna let my team down, and I didn't wanna let myself down. And so I just had to like pick up these habits. So

18
00:02:41.192 --> 00:02:46.160
max: a couple of things. So so this is this is the things that have worked for me.

19
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.769
max: Me go back and do a screen share here.

20
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.320
max: You guys can see this right.

21
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: When you see it.

22
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.480
max: Here. Okay, cool.

23
00:02:54.513 --> 00:03:06.349
max: So I really connected with the system called getting things done. And there's a book by a guy called David Allen called getting things done. I I can't really like in good conscience, recommend reading that book. It's it's

24
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:17.826
max: I don't know. It's interesting. It's a classic, a lot of people really like it. I don't think it's necessary to read it, but it does have a lot of like. Really, I found it. It was just a very like

25
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:35.430
max: What would I say? Like a very like systematic way of like thinking about your time and your attention? And for me it was the first time in my life where someone said, You can have a system of what you do with your time and attention, and you can spend those precious resources in a in a way that is your decision

26
00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:52.360
max: another one that was really important to me, that I really I do really recommend everyone check out is a talk by a really really smart guy called Merlin man. And this is a talk called Inbox 0 that he gave it Google. It's from like the 2,010 s. Or something like that. It's old at this point.

27
00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:09.807
max: But this is like, if you've ever heard the phrase, Inbox 0. This is where the he coined the term in this talk, and it's just a great great talk, and we'll come back to that inbox 0 idea, and in a few minutes, and then another one. That's a really beautiful book is the checklist manifesto by a tool Galande. Does anyone anyone

28
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.590
max: can't. How do I so wish I could see the

29
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.120
max: the chat while I do this? Has anyone read that out of curiosity? That's like a big best seller.

30
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.170
max: I can't see everyone. Anyway, I'm seeing a lot of heads shaking now. Okay, well.

31
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.400
max: the quick

32
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.241
max: I I'm gonna spend a lot of time. I'll kind of today I'll kind of walk you through like the main ideas in

33
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:45.191
max: getting things done. But just to quickly give you, like a summary of the Checklist manifesto. And that book Rocks. It's a quick read is super well written atool galandes, an amazing guy. But basically, the story of that book is the World Health Organization. He's a really

34
00:04:45.600 --> 00:05:08.519
max: a great surgeon based in, I think, in the Us. The World Health Organization comes to him and says, hey! There's a lot of preventable and accidental deaths in surgical, in surgery, and like surgical theaters in the Third world, in refugee camps and places where they don't have proper equipment. And they said, Can you come up with something that basically is cost no money that would like reduce accidental deaths during surgery?

35
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:22.870
max: And first he was like, well, no, I don't think that's possible. And then he, the the book is his journey of he's like, well, he's like, well, wait a second. He's like, there's other industries that are like life and death where they basically statistically like, never make mistakes. Right? It's like aviation.

36
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:49.819
max: Statistically, 0 people die in airplane. It's crazy how safe aviation is. In the Us. Building construction like nobody dies in like building in like a collapse building in the us. It's basically non-existent. So he goes to these industries, does a lot of interviews, looks at how they do their job. And the common tool is the checklist. Everybody has a really expensive checklist that's like this repeatable process. And then there's behaviors that go around the checklist like healthy

37
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:59.900
max: team behaviors around the checklist and that that book is, and then he applies it to health, and the results are really cool. So love that book and also definitely recommend on that.

38
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:18.280
max: And then I'm also gonna walk through the to do list software that I use, which is called Omni focus. And if you, I will give like an overview. I don't. We'll see how that goes. If I can like. Explain it well, on this call, and we'll set up some projects together just to like, show how I use it.

39
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:28.080
max: But if you want to learn more about Omi focus, there is this guy, David Sparks has this website called Max Sparky.

40
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.000
max: where he teaches sort of like

41
00:06:30.480 --> 00:07:00.320
max: things, for, like Mac Power users. And he has a this thing called the Omni Focus Field Guide. That is excellent. It's a video. It's I don't know. Maybe 1 h video tutorial that will like, make you into an omni focus. Power user. Also everything. I I'm a apple like power user. I'm don't. I'm like a degenerate apple user. I'll never. I'll just buy anything they make. And I'm never gonna do anything different. But if you like, omni, focus, it's on every apple platform. So ios ipad OS vision OS Mac.

42
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:08.280
max: and they just launched in the new version. They have a web client. So even if I'm on like a gaming PC. Or whatever like that, I can still get it. Cross-platform, which is nice.

43
00:07:08.978 --> 00:07:15.390
max: Okay, so this is so just to talk us any questions about any of that before we get into getting things done.

44
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.369
max: I can't see if there's any questions.

45
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.279
max: Okay, no question. Oh, Samarth, you know someone who knows a tool. Galande. That's the coolest thing I've ever heard.

46
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:33.599
Samarth Gupta: Yeah, yeah, he's a really close friend of mine. Actually, he was at Harvard. Doing research with him

47
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.940
Samarth Gupta: a while back.

48
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:42.030
max: Dude. He's he's he's all he's so good, he's such a good writer and such a good storyteller. I I I really like him.

49
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.609
max: You wrote another book about death. If you have, if you wanna really get depressed and read that, it's pretty good.

50
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.739
max: alright. So getting things done.

51
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:57.519
max: Alright. So the main.

52
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.559
max: This is with one caveat on this.

53
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:28.439
max: This is like my ideas about getting things done. I'm not rep. I can't represent, you know the the. If you get really interested in it, read the book and hear what David Allen says, but this is my, what works for me in any case. So at that core of getting things done is like starting with like, what what do you want to be using your brain for during the day right? So like to use like a computing analogy like you have so many cycles. Dur, you know, per hour to like. Think about things. Where do you want to be putting your cycles like? Where is your memory allocated at any given moment?

54
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:39.579
max: You know, my, my! I think this has become like a more widespread, you know, way of thinking or whatever, but, like my belief is like, people are really like, what are people good at? Uniquely good at like, what's the superpower of humans

55
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.570
max: working together in teams, creativity, synthesizing new ideas.

56
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.510
max: writing poetry?

57
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.440
max: Right? This is like what we should be putting our energy into. And

58
00:08:50.460 --> 00:09:00.290
max: humans are uniquely, barely for me. My brain is like you, so bad at like remembering things, remembering things in sequence, knowing how long things are going to take

59
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:13.729
max: having lists of things like, I'm just so. I'm terrible. I don't know how you guys feel about it, but I feel ex. I feel it comes like I feel like every day I go. I can't leave the house without having this thing with me, and then, 9 times out of 10, I forget the thing like it's not in my backpack when I need it.

60
00:09:14.178 --> 00:09:17.370
max: So getting things done is all about having

61
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:30.650
max: good system in your life, so you can free up your brain to like solve problems and go to work for you and not be spending cycles thinking about? Do you have the right things with you. Did you remember to talk to this guy? You know, whatever

62
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.110
max: the

63
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.109
max: key idea of getting things done? If there's like one

64
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:46.150
max: takeaway that I think will like change your life. And I, from change my life. Is this idea of like ubiquitous capture, so ubiquitous capture means? If you think of something.

65
00:09:46.840 --> 00:10:02.489
max: write it down right then, because you won't, you'll go. I'll remember it in 10 min, and I'll write it down then. And I you definitely won't. It's gone, you'll be like, so I'll be walking around, and I'll be like, I think I was supposed to write something down, but I don't remember what it was Neil. Can you share when I was over at your place, what I left in your

66
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.349
max: yeah.

67
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Keys that I literally stood there and said, Hey, Max.

68
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:15.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I was like, Hey, Max, I really can. I have these keys back because I need them for the house. He goes. Yeah, I'll leave him right here on this counter, and I like looked him in the eye. And I'm like, Okay.

69
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:16.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then.

70
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:17.960
max: Actually got it.

71
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think of what we did.

72
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.550
max: The little house, the little house gift that I brought you.

73
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's what you're talking about. I thought.

74
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:23.680
max: Yeah, yeah.

75
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.686
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He? Yeah.

76
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so

77
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: were you talking about the like the red alert? I thought somebody snuck into my house.

78
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cause I'm in the restroom I look over, and I'm like yo

79
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: who was in my bath tub.

80
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cause there's something on the wall in my bathtub. I'm like

81
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:50.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: intruder alert, like what the heck is going on, and it turns out Max left this like idea. Notepad like the shower notepad thing in there. I don't know how he snuck in there, but he did, somehow, when I wasn't there

82
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: hung this thing up that allows me to like write down my ideas while I'm in the shower, which is great.

83
00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:22.963
max: So if you go on Amazon, there's like a lot of products like this, like the one I like is, I think it's called like the shower notepad, and it's like a waterproof, like a plastic key waterproof paper like a pad that you can tear, and then like a pencil, and it suction cups onto your shower. But this is like to me. This is like ubiquitous capture. Cause like there's something about. I don't know if you guys have this experience. But there's something about being in the shower where, like, I always remember that one thing where I'm like. And I'm like, and I'm like God, I like. I was like I didn't call that person back, or like.

84
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:31.710
max: I have to remember to get this done today, and you have to write it down then, because, if you like, get out, then it's like for me. I have a kid. Right? So then I need to

85
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:53.640
max: with my kid. It's like, it's, it's like, we're off to the races. So like, that's captures like always, you should always have some way to write things down and like the phone is so good for this, we'll get to this and Omni focus. But like another great tip I have for you. If anyone has a newer iphone. The iphone added this button on the side, the action button, which

86
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.760
max: for me, I I never had a great use of it right? And so what I have. Now

87
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:23.119
max: I'll hold it up to the camera here. So what happens now, if I hold the action button, it actually starts a voice memo, and it's recording now, and that goes into my to do list. So, and if I'm in the car anytime during the day, I just push that button, and then this gets transcribed and it's gonna go in my in my omni focus for later. So that for personally, for me, that's like the coolest, best thing I've found to do with this little button on the iphone.

88
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.330
max: and it's really helpful, because, like

89
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.150
max: is stuff path.

90
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:40.089
max: I I find stuff pops into your head at the weirdest times, you know. You can't sleep or you're out for a walk, or you're at lunch with someone. And this is like the key inside of getting things done is just capture. It. Put it in your to do list.

91
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:54.659
max: It will change. Just doing that will change your life. And my experience is like something like 90% of people are under capturing in their life, meaning like they're not writing down enough of the things that come into their head, and that could be things like business ideas, marketing ideas like

92
00:12:55.090 --> 00:13:06.389
max: I write down like jokes that I think of, like just all the weirdest stuff pops in your head, and you'll be so happy with yourself. It's such a great gift to give yourself in the future just to write it down, but especially things that you remember that are important to you.

93
00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:22.489
max: Along with a ubiquitous capture, is another idea which is so in the getting things done world, they call it reviews, and a review means it's like a little con. It's a contract with yourself, meaning like, I will look at my to do list and like review like.

94
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:44.370
max: remember this stuff right? Cause you don't wanna feel like you're just writing it down, and it goes into the void. So you also need some system to do a review and Omni focus the one. The program I'm gonna show you in a minute. It has a feature that just does this for you, but you can also put in your calendar review, you know. Review your to do list like for me. I have a little morning routine where I sit down and review my to do list, and and I I pick what I want to get done during the day.

95
00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:47.550
max: Some of the other ideas in getting things done.

96
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:56.579
max: Don't live in your email inbox. So a lot of I've I'm curious. If if anyone wants could. Shares has anything to share about this. But like.

97
00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:15.080
max: I think, many people basically use their email inbox as their to do list functionally, meaning, like, you wake up. You look at your inbox. And then, whatever is the most important thing in your inbox, that's what you wind up working on, or if you slow down during the day, and you're like, I don't know what to do next. You go into your inbox and you're like, I'm just gonna figure out who's in my inbox and start solving these problems.

98
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:26.240
max: The this is the from the inbox. 0 talk that I recommended by by Merlin. This is such a bad way to work like. If you could imagine that you're in like a big office right like you work in like a

99
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.959
max: a co-working space.

100
00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:45.359
max: This would be like if you had the door open, and at any time during the day anyone in the world could walk into that office and tap you in the shoulder and like, interrupt your work and say, could you do this really annoying thing? And then you just do it. It's it's like a it's like a maddening way to work and it, and it really saps your attention during the day.

101
00:14:45.410 --> 00:15:04.119
max: So the idea, I think, in the like getting things done, world is, you need a to do list is like a separate thing from your email. It has to come away from your email and doing the email becomes like a Chore like for me doing email like I try to think of it as like taking out the garbage. So I go. I will have 30 min a day. I'm gonna sit

102
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:18.410
max: set a timer. I'm gonna sit down. I'm gonna do my email. And then I'm like, but done with it until tomorrow, or whatever I mean realist like I. To be honest, I look at my email all the time. But like I try, that's the habit that's the better habit I'm trying to get into is to like

103
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:27.279
max: be more intentional about it, because I don't. You know, I don't want anyone in the world to be able to interrupt my day and tell me what's important for me to do.

104
00:15:28.198 --> 00:15:37.389
max: Related idea to that with it. This is this is another idea. I like about to do lists. I think it's very important to have

105
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:52.379
max: your own private personal to do list that has no sharing features with any other users, so I know probably everyone's company. You're on Base Camp. You're on notion you're on Trello, you know. Some bug tracker pivotal whatever

106
00:15:53.277 --> 00:16:00.620
max: Asana those are good. I have to use those for my work with other people, but I just find it.

107
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:15.390
max: It's upsetting to me. I don't like when other people like are moved things around like it's like a special. It's my like special, like my brain. It's like my order of what's important to me, and I don't want anyone else to be able to change that. So unfortunately, the best system I have for this is like often what I do is like.

108
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.759
max: If I have a team meeting. We're all on Asana together. We're all on notion together, and we make our to do lists. I then

109
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:44.309
max: copy my to do list out of notion and put them into omni focus. And I make my own private decision for myself of like, what am I gonna do? And what order does it go in? And all of that? And we'll we'll look at that omni focus in a few minutes. But just just it's a nice like. It's a nice like bulk against insanity, to have your own private place, with no other users where you get to decide what you do with your time.

110
00:16:45.142 --> 00:16:48.679
max: Pretty pretty nice luxury to have for yourself.

111
00:16:49.809 --> 00:17:04.649
max: Couple of other ideas in getting things done that are cool are when you write things down, so how you write it down matters a lot. You wanna give yourself like a gift of like when you write it down, make it as easy as possible to like, understand and do it. So a couple of ideas with that number one

112
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.589
max: write things down in the smallest possible chunks

113
00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.800
max: that you have, right? So it doesn't help you to be like.

114
00:17:12.538 --> 00:17:31.679
max: launch, my, you know, like, create a startup and launch it, because that's not really doable like. And and one of the rules of thumbs in getting things done is nothing should go on your to do list that can't be checked off right? So like I have a cat, for example, right? So I could. I can't really put a to do list. Item on my to do list. That's like, take care of my cat

115
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:45.329
max: cause like I can't ever check that. It's not the nature of that task, because it can't be completed. So what I could say is like, feed my cat at 5 pm. Because that's I can check that, and it goes away and it's done. But I can't be like

116
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:53.439
max: a a more like a like a lifestyle goal of like, provide a good quality of life for my cat, because that's that's really not like a like a checkable, doable thing.

117
00:17:53.570 --> 00:18:00.359
max: And you don't want to build that hat, you know. You don't want to be like exercising that muscle of writing things down for yourself that are impossible to complete.

118
00:18:01.312 --> 00:18:02.847
max: That's more for

119
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.209
max: I think for your yeah eirs to tell you to do every week.

120
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:15.389
Lilliana Robinson: Max, where would you put that stuff? Do you have like a separate thing with the goals, or like, when you do have something like that? Or do you just not.

121
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:42.419
max: That's a really good question. So this, I think this is very personal. I would love to throw this back also for the group that's actually really, I would love to hear about this. But like, so I've more. Ca, somewhat recently, I've gotten Intra a little bit interested in hearing people talk about like journaling and like intention setting and things like that. I think it's really cool. I don't know a ton about it, but I think there's some I really like people. I think it can be like a really beautiful practice to like.

122
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:50.583
max: wake up and be like, I want to have this kind of a life, or I want to be a more

123
00:18:53.086 --> 00:18:53.977
max: You know

124
00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:08.029
max: Gracious for what I had, you know, like th those sort of like lifestyle goals, or whatever or like. I want to be this kind of a father. I don't really do that to be honest. But but I'm curious. Does anyone have a practice like that that they could share, or

125
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:19.559
max: something of something of something like you like New Year's resolutions, or journaling, or, like anyone, have any experience with that.

126
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.749
Nelson Mitchell: Yeah, I did that. I have a a list. I keep it in my notebook.

127
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.059
Nelson Mitchell: and it's like my intentions.

128
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.210
Nelson Mitchell: So

129
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.619
Nelson Mitchell: it's it's part of a

130
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.449
Nelson Mitchell: therapeutic practice, where I tried to

131
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.350
Nelson Mitchell: align my actions with my intentions.

132
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.790
Nelson Mitchell: So I'll just go back to them and say, How How am I doing.

133
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.350
max: And has that? How long have you been doing that.

134
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.820
Nelson Mitchell: Couple of years on and off

135
00:19:49.138 --> 00:19:55.810
Nelson Mitchell: I find that it's helpful like it's helpful like when I'm trying to make a decision about like a finite resource. Whether it's my

136
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.300
Nelson Mitchell: time or my money or my attention.

137
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.639
Nelson Mitchell: I'll come back to that list. And I'll say, like, Okay.

138
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.329
Nelson Mitchell: does this fit.

139
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.657
Nelson Mitchell: It helps that it's short. It can't be longer than like 4 things, otherwise.

140
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:17.649
max: Rad, yeah, I I think that's a great question. For me, like I can tell you.

141
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:27.539
max: I was one time I was in a co-working space, and I had someone at my little pod of desks with me. Not a coworker, just someone a friend of mine right?

142
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:38.180
max: We're working in the middle of the day, and this was when I was. I was like in your situation, because I was in the midst of like starting up a startup right? And it was around 3 30 in the afternoon on like a Wednesday.

143
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:44.819
max: And this is my friend Nick, and he stands up and he goes. I'm done for the day. I did all my tasks, and I'm going to go for a bike ride.

144
00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:53.069
max: and I and I was stunned. I couldn't. I was like, what? And he goes, yeah, I'm done. I did everything. What do you mean? You did it. The concept of

145
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.609
max: being done, of of having a list of things that could be done in one day was like

146
00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.650
max: totally foreign to me, cause I was like, I'm gonna do as many things as I can until I like

147
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:28.930
max: collapse, basically right? And then I would wake up every day with a list that was so big that I couldn't possibly do it. And I just saw like this freedom like he had just a great life like. And he, he was like, Yeah, I'm going for bike ride at 3 30, and I was like, I want that life, and so like I don't have like. I don't have a journal, but that's like a top that became a be an important goal for myself of like I wanna have a life where I can be done with my work and have the important things in life

148
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:36.620
max: and decide to have time for them. I don't always do that. It's not always successful, but like that

149
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.939
max: for me, like if I'm

150
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:46.359
max: that comes back to like the to-do list and Omni focus, and some of the stuff we'll get into in a minute. But it's like by

151
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:56.590
max: making this little contract with myself, and like deciding at the beginning of the day, like we came in to do XY. And Z. And then I can consider this a successful day that give. That's like an important

152
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.459
max: thing in my life

153
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.519
max: that I like

154
00:22:02.243 --> 00:22:10.026
max: couple more getting things, done things, and then we'll do some of the questions. And then I'll show you guys, omni focus.

155
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:23.779
max: let's see, okay, so this is actually the last thing I have. So when you so you when you break, write down projects, I was saying, break into the smallest chunks right? So like, get really granular like, I think you can really check off like, not like

156
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:39.120
max: design and launch a marketing campaign, because that's like way too big. You have to be like, make 1 h to like. Go on a walk and brainstorm about the marketing campaign. And then you write down like, make a memo for myself of what I'm gonna do you know, it's like you're really breaking it down into like things that can actually be accomplished.

157
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.529
max: And along with that

158
00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:52.359
max: capture like right, you wanna give yourself the gift of writing down a lot of detail about the things you have to do so like for me, like, for example, like I have, all because I'm like a a homeowner.

159
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:57.549
max: and like a lot of my to do list. Things are like, call the plumber to fix the toilet.

160
00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:06.240
max: I know I need to do it, but I like I can't tell you like I hate. I don't know why that makes me so stressed. I but I like, do not want to. I just don't like doing that stuff.

161
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:29.330
max: So I know I can like, give myself a little boost. If when I write that down, I look up the plumbers phone number and put it there, and just like, get it all ready. And then when I it's time to do it, it's like I've taken away all the friction. It's just like I'm taking friction away taking friction away. So I can just sit down and do the job that I need to do. So it's just like giving yourself all the detail you need to complete the task.

162
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:35.370
max: And we I will get. We can get a little more into this. But another thing that I love is a lot of times when I'm doing email.

163
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:58.800
max: I I try to like Zip through email. Like most, the big, here's a the best trick about email that this is again. This is all in that Merlin man, that inbox 0 talk which is so funny and so good. And and I love but Merlin, says, the biggest thing about email, the biggest trick about email is you don't need to reply to like 99% of it. What you should be doing with most of your email is archiving and moving on with your life.

164
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:08.109
max: Most other emails they can be replied to in 20 s. And then, if it takes longer than 20 s, and you're like, Ok, I really have to think about this and solve a problem or write a letter.

165
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:22.710
max: just put it in your to do it like, make make an item in your to do list to be like right back to Neil right? And then I have to have a more detailed thing, and then take it out of your inbox just like it's like taking out the garbage like, take everything out of your inbox and just

166
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.410
max: be done with it. And I have to say, like.

167
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:39.630
max: I've like stopped responding to so much email. I just like, I just don't deal with it. And like that, there's been. It's been awesome like, it's so good. It solves so many problems in my life. So every email you send it's not like you're done with it. It just makes 5 more emails. So.

168
00:24:40.346 --> 00:25:03.859
max: okay, let's do a little. I'm curious what people are thinking any questions. And then we, I will get into omni focus. And I think it could be a good exercise to like, build out some projects, and I'll show you like exactly how I write stuff down this. I saw a question in here about recurring tasks, which is like my favorite thing. I love recurring tasks, and we'll get all into that. That's that's the best making little systems in your life

169
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.329
max: like a good engineer.

170
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.060
max: But

171
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.940
max: any questions.

172
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.399
Lilliana Robinson: Go ahead, Sergei.

173
00:25:14.619 --> 00:25:23.010
Sergey: Hey? Yeah, I read getting things done a whole bunch of years ago. Don't remember all the details. Use some of the concepts there. One thing

174
00:25:23.735 --> 00:25:28.090
Sergey: wanted to to add is one benefit is just

175
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.829
Sergey: not. I'm not only getting the ideas down, but then there's

176
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:45.909
Sergey: for me, anyway, there's a feeling of anxiety later in the day. If you don't do that, you're like you're like, what was that? What was that idea I had in the shower. What what was I just thinking? What did I have to do? And for me like that's even

177
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:55.659
Sergey: more annoying than like forgetting the idea is like the feeling that you forgot something. So just getting it down. So you don't have to worry about. That helps a lot.

178
00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:16.389
max: I I always find like if I just sit and like brain just like sit in the morning sometimes and just like write. And it's like, you know, just like here's everything I need to do, and I get it out of my head if I then like, go have my coffee, or go take a walk. I sometimes I have the best ideas, cause it's like you're almost like you like made space. And now, like, you can like, think you have, like you can like breathe

179
00:26:17.308 --> 00:26:19.749
max: but yeah, totally totally agree.

180
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:28.319
Lilliana Robinson: Max, how do you decide like if you want to be like that guy at with the 3 30 bike ride, how do you decide what

181
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:39.299
Lilliana Robinson: where the list ends for today. Cause I feel like you can always do more. And it's like, Yeah, I know there are deadlines for things. But how do you divide it up in today's versus like this is how much.

182
00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:45.440
max: I'm gonna show you in omni-focus. Cause it's very like it's just like, I just use the software. And then there's features that.

183
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:45.940
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, okay.

184
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.512
max: But there's a concept in Omni focus.

185
00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:58.270
max: So so so let's say, we have a task right? And the task could be let me think of an example of like well, like, write down my notes for the getting things done. Talk right?

186
00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:15.129
max: So I might have a bunch of subtasks, and that like, watch this talk on Youtube to familiarize myself with it. And that task has, like there's an idea and getting things done called like dependencies and dependencies can be all kinds of things. So what are the dependencies of, let's say the task for me is re-watch the inbox 0. Talk

187
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.159
max: to familiarize myself with it.

188
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.240
max: So the dependencies for that are like Number one. I have to have 1 h of time.

189
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:28.730
max: Number 2. I pretty much have to be at home. I don't really want to like, you know. That's like, kind of want to like. Be at my desk and like, be able to take notes and stuff.

190
00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:47.580
max: and that's and then that's about it. Right? But other dependencies, some tasks like, I have depend. Like, listen, I have like dependencies where it's like, okay, I need to buy this thing. And then I have to be a target. The dependencies I have to be in a certain place. I have dependencies of like meet with the founders for my one on ones, and those are dependencies on other people. So dependencies can be anything

191
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.779
max: outside of you that you need to do the task. So Omni focus has this great

192
00:27:53.150 --> 00:28:18.309
max: feature that shows that says, Show me the available tasks, meaning, where are the tasks without dependencies so like, what can I do now? And like, for example, on my, if you use it on your phone, it knows your location, and it will actually show you like. Let's say I'm at target, right? It will just show me as available all the shopping things I need to do a target really cool. So those become available because I'm standing at target.

193
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:33.850
max: Another one is like, let's say, like like Liliana, I have things that are tagged, Liliana, like things that you and I need to discuss, and I'm on a but they could be across this project that project right? Techstars like, maybe it's like I have one right now in my to do list of like, send you puzzles right

194
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:58.180
max: when we talk. I can be like, just show me all the I'm see, I can basically go into the Liliana dependency and just be like what's available for like stuff for Liliana right now. So basically, to give the answer to your question is like, in the beginning of the day I have omni focus. Show me everything available for the whole day, and I'm almost like you're almost like Doctor Strange, where you're like seeing all the possible futures. And you're like I could do this. I could do that. I could do that.

195
00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:06.989
max: I try to make a decision of like this is I. I'm like I could be go to sleep tonight and feel happy with myself if I get done this, that and that.

196
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:14.190
max: and then I have, and then I just pick them and omni-focus like I flag them, which I'll show you but like, and then that's it. And then that's my to do list for the day.

197
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.070
max: And do you get.

198
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.200
Lilliana Robinson: Lost. And

199
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.820
Lilliana Robinson: yeah, go ahead. Sorry, Mike.

200
00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:27.259
max: Oh, I do. I'm not like it's not possible to do like. I've probably a lot of you can relate to this, but like it's I can't do everything I need to do today, like it's not happening. So.

201
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.070
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, you know, that's it.

202
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:49.960
max: Yeah, but I always think like it's better like looking back on it. There's always like a you're like riding this like avalanche down a mountain or something right? And like it's always better to like. Let's say you've got a hundred things to do. And you know you're only gonna get 4 of them done. It's trust me. It's better to decide for yourself the 4 you're getting done than just have it be like who emailed you most recently

203
00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:57.710
max: what you know, whatever like you, you want to be intentional and be like. I can like help my company the most I can help my life the most if I do.

204
00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.149
max: 1, 2, 3, and 4.

205
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.949
Lilliana Robinson: Super helpful. Thanks, Max. Go ahead, Ali.

206
00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:30.750
Alejandra Guillen: Yeah, rather than a question is, maybe a reflection. So I I find personally myself doing Co making 2 mistakes. And I wonder if you know you've you've done it and have some feedback. One is overestimating the amount of time that I actually have available to work, because, you know, there's so many meetings, there's so many impromptu conversations that are important, that still away from the hours.

207
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:38.289
Alejandra Guillen: and that generates frustration because I never get down my to the least, because I have less and less time to complete.

208
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:52.759
Alejandra Guillen: So that's the first mistake that I'm making constantly. The second one is the underestimation of time that it takes me to do new things so I can assess how long it takes me to do something that I've done before.

209
00:30:52.860 --> 00:31:02.670
Alejandra Guillen: because I know how long it takes to think about it or like you said, it's an immediate thing, 20 s response to an email. But we're going through a lot of things that are new.

210
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:09.869
Alejandra Guillen: and I'm underestimating a lot of the time that it will take to think, to create a system, to repeat them

211
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.810
Alejandra Guillen: and

212
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:18.460
Alejandra Guillen: and and so that also contributes to not finishing things in time and kind of like, have that feeling of

213
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.640
Alejandra Guillen: the pile of things for the next day, and the following is only increasing. So

214
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.630
Alejandra Guillen: that's that's something that I feel

215
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:35.070
Alejandra Guillen: I need to start managing much better. So if you have any advice, or if if only focus can help on that.

216
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:46.845
max: Yeah, I so omni focus is not like a time tracker, you know. I think they do have some features in there. We which we can. I can open those up when we get in there in a second, and they do have some like, how much time will it take? I don't use that.

217
00:31:47.090 --> 00:32:14.213
max: So listen, I have the same problem as you. I'm I'm really. I have like a hole in my brain in the place where it's supposed to be where you know how long things will take and like I will like. I'm like famous where I'm like with a friend, and they're like, hey? I have like a half hour free, and I'm like great. Let's go get lunch, because it'll take like 10 min to walk there, and then we'll order them. We'll eat, and that'll be 10 min, and then 10 min to walk back and we'll be done. They're like, are you? Out of your mind like like a 90 min, you know, whatever. But like I'm so bad at it.

218
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:27.180
max: So I just have a couple of thoughts. I don't know if I can't even say if this is good advice, cause I'm late for every I'm the worst at. I'm I'm awful at this. I'm late, for everything everything takes me too long. But just a couple of quick things are like, number one.

219
00:32:28.335 --> 00:32:29.850
max: Okay, so I

220
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:34.909
max: do, you guys know about flow state, does that? I feel like that idea is out there, right? So like, if I'm working on something

221
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.750
max: programming.

222
00:32:36.850 --> 00:33:04.459
max: designing, writing, thinking whatever. And I get into that flow state where you just like part of the part of flow state is time really disappears, like I've heard like. For example, I've heard like basketball players talk about this like, if you're in flow state on the court, you don't know if it's like 6 h or 6 min, and it's just it. It's a it. I find it to be almost if I get there, which is like not easy, like. It's sometimes once a month. I have like a time when I'm working, and I'm like I'm in the Zone right now.

223
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.110
max: I find it to be like sacred like I. Just

224
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:19.910
max: the best work of my life is in those moments, and I don't care. I don't care what's on my to do list unless my, unless my daughter needs something for me, is about the only thing, but, like

225
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.420
max: everyone else, can

226
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.060
max: go pound sand like I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna do my work, and

227
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.410
max: I don't. I don't know if that's helpful or not. But like.

228
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:41.660
max: if I'm in just that's like such a special, you know. I think, like you only get so many of those. And you're I'm not a professional Mba player, so I can't just like get into the Zone, you know, whenever I want. But, like.

229
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.980
max: those are such

230
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:50.350
max: special moments in my life, I'm just like, forget I'm like, I'll text everyone I know. And I'm like, plans are off. Sorry I'm I'm

231
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.219
max: I had a good idea. I gotta work, and that's it, and just use it when you have it.

232
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.809
max: Yeah, blackout swings. Yeah, exactly.

233
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:16.580
Zach : So so there's a concept. I play baseball in college. We call them blackout swings where basically you'll hit a home run and you'll go back in the dugout, and your teammates will be asking you like what pitch it was where it was located at, and you have no idea like you were completely oblivious to what was going on, but you just crushed it. It's crazy.

234
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.586
max: Zach, can you talk about

235
00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:26.320
max: Is there any tricks? Or I guess we're getting a straying a little off topic? But I'm just so interested in this, like how to like

236
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.200
max: serious athletes like think of like, how do you get into that zone?

237
00:34:32.867 --> 00:34:37.642
Zach : I well, me personally, I did a lot of visualization prior to games.

238
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.690
Zach : So if you see yourself doing something

239
00:34:41.068 --> 00:35:00.670
Zach : it's more likely that you are gonna do it right. And when you get in these moments, if you kinda clear your mind and stop like letting anxieties pull your brain left and right, you wanna have like, if you ever meditated before, we just have this like empty state in your brain. If you can get in that empty mode more often than not. It kinda just, I say, like not to bring spirituality into it. But

240
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:14.210
Zach : I say, like the universe takes over when you stop trying to control and will your way to stuff. It just does what it's supposed to do. So that's I'm like more. Take the the dummy approach to it where it's like, clear your mind, and it just takes over. But

241
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:21.519
Zach : The less you have to think about, the more you kind of naturally just flow. That's how I do it. At least, I don't know about anyone else.

242
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.826
Sergey: Yeah, I I did practice martial arts and meditation for a while. So I think it's exactly that. It's like

243
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:34.810
Sergey: letting go. So letting go of everything. Thoughts.

244
00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.309
Sergey: The I think this specific thing is

245
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.309
Sergey: detachment from outcomes.

246
00:35:40.259 --> 00:35:41.429
Sergey: So it just

247
00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.359
Sergey: you. You don't care. You're just

248
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.410
Sergey: there, regardless in the moment.

249
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.570
Sergey: And that's a practice that you get. That's the muscle memory you get from

250
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.439
Sergey: from just mindfulness, practice.

251
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.529
Zach : Yeah, there.

252
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.020
Sergey: Doing that over and over again.

253
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:16.030
Zach : There was something else I'm I was thought about when you said that. A kind of like clearing your mind and and not focusing as much. So another concept in baseball is this thing called quality at Bats or Quabs, where you could do everything you're supposed to do correctly, but still get out.

254
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:37.989
Zach : You have a higher, higher chance of not being successful as a hitter than you do, being just like a one third of the time you'll you'll actually get on base, or you'll be successful at your job. So you really don't even focus on trying to hit. This is related to your task list. You don't focus on trying to get everything done every single day. You just try to do what you're supposed to do when you, when you align it when you wake up in the morning.

255
00:36:38.228 --> 00:36:46.350
Zach : Trying to be perfect all the time is like a losing battle. So that's another thing that we kind of focus on detach from the outcome is a great, great way to say that.

256
00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.519
Zach : Yeah. And.

257
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:54.730
max: Antonio, just linked to a really good book. I I read this book when this came out, called flow away! This is the I might have read a different book.

258
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.420
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Subscribe.

259
00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.459
max: Wait. Is this the guy who's is this the flow state? Guy?

260
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:15.899
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, the flow state guy like he he he is. This is is fascinating. Like he he did a study, and he interview lots of people to understand what what's flow. State. And he came out with these 7 bullet points of what takes us to to flow state.

261
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:16.770
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And it's.

262
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:17.380
max: I think.

263
00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.826
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Quickly address. It's really it's really, it's really nice book. But.

264
00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:46.053
max: I did read this. This book is really cool, and another one a aly that might be helpful. I think it's kind of in line with with your question. This is great book called that's newer called Deep Work by Cal Newport. I don't know if anyone read that, but it's about like a lot of I can give you the like back of the book. Blurb is like, basically like a lot of the most important work that you'll do, and the best work that you'll do is work that happens like

265
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:58.019
max: very slowly over a long period of time, and unless you like intentionally make that time in your life you could easily live a life where you're always putting out fires and working in short bursts, and you never

266
00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:03.169
max: have that that time to to get into the flow state and work on everything.

267
00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:09.019
max: and then add one more. One in here

268
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:17.359
max: Jennifer could tell. Tell. Say more. But I you were. I think this was maybe about like making systems about keeping. The shared note of problems to solve.

269
00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:39.579
Jennifer Loh: Yeah, I mean, I was thinking, where, when you write down these thoughts that you have my husband and I are always complaining about poor design. And so every time we see something where it's like, this is really poorly designed, or just like not good or anything, then we just write it down and write down our ideas on

270
00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:47.759
Jennifer Loh: how we can make it better. But the running, Doc we've had for a few years now, and it's like so long. And I think you know, at some point

271
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.650
Jennifer Loh: we will probably

272
00:38:49.950 --> 00:39:00.579
Jennifer Loh: build whatever we think is the best idea, or I guess my husband will. But yeah, I think that's kind of like our parking lot for ideas that come to our head.

273
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.390
Jennifer Loh: and you so.

274
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:07.849
max: How do you have like systems for like solving things in your house, for example, like.

275
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.030
max: you know, ordering

276
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:15.259
max: laundry detergent, or like, you know those like these like little like nuisance problems.

277
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:23.700
Jennifer Loh: No, but actually, I just downloaded coexist at the last demo day. I don't know where. Wait is Andy here? No

278
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:36.319
Jennifer Loh: doton. He okay? Well, anyways, coexist was from the last cohort and for a household. I do almost everything like I schedule the kids, doctors, appointments, and like

279
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:53.020
Jennifer Loh: schedule, the housekeepers and all sorts of stuff, and so a lot of times a lot of the like administrative stuff falls on me, and I'm like this is an inequitable. And so so yeah, we downloaded the coexist app, and we really need to like implement it, because I think it'll be better.

280
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.250
Jennifer Loh: or at least

281
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:57.751
Jennifer Loh: I don't know. Dawn, you tell me, have you used it?

282
00:39:59.429 --> 00:40:02.720
Dotan Shalev/Lexir: Well, I'm sure Andy and Stella would appreciate the shout out,

283
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:09.161
Dotan Shalev/Lexir: no, we're me! Me and my wife for a bit a bit on the messy side with all those kind of stuff. So unfortunately, it's

284
00:40:09.644 --> 00:40:13.230
Dotan Shalev/Lexir: it's not. It's not our way. But but it's an awesome. It's an awesome app.

285
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.170
Jennifer Loh: Yeah.

286
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.049
max: cool. I would love if we have a few minutes at the end.

287
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:29.740
max: I want to get into omni-focus just before we get too long, but if we have a few minutes at the end, I would love to have a little parents chat if there's any other parents, because that's my struggle right now is like

288
00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.750
max: I thought I had some stuff figured out, and then it's like.

289
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:38.679
max: no, I do not. I don't have anything figured out. But anyway.

290
00:40:39.885 --> 00:40:51.504
max: okay, so this is on the focus. I am running the demo of this. So it's a brand new install just to like show you guys. So I'll also go through. And as we work I'll like

291
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.030
max: I'll like

292
00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:57.520
max: coming out.

293
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:00.720
max: I see the problem.

294
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:08.060
max: I'm also on a new user account on the Mac. And they've really hopefully disabled. Right? Click. I think.

295
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.049
Jennifer Loh: Is this on desktop and app like mobile app.

296
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.450
max: And everything. Yeah, it's on every they're like.

297
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:20.140
max: So this is made by a company called Omni Group. And they are like.

298
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:24.009
max: first class, like apple citizens like they're like, they're like

299
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:45.559
max: great widgets, like on every platform, like best practices, like they're really great. They're like they're and they've been around for it's very, very old, mature software that's been around for decades. They're like, beloved old long time, Mac developers. So I definitely trust them. I've been using this since college like, it's been around for a minute.

300
00:41:46.228 --> 00:41:55.551
max: Okay, so this is Omni, focus the on the left. Here. You've got these little tags. And these are like our big areas.

301
00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.910
max: so inbox

302
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:05.239
max: inbox is where we're going to quickly capture stuff. So I'll just make a couple here and we can see how this looks. Right? So

303
00:42:06.456 --> 00:42:09.520
max: review inbox 0 talk

304
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:13.380
max: for the techstars, folks. Okay?

305
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.480
max: And that's going to go. We'll just leave that there for a second.

306
00:42:18.893 --> 00:42:28.289
max: Let's see, buy Kitty litter and that one. Okay, so let's put some dependencies on that in a minute, because that one I need to be a target to do.

307
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:34.060
max: And let's see, I want to read, reread

308
00:42:35.215 --> 00:42:36.090
max: by.

309
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:45.030
max: Actually, it's really I don't really want to read flow. It's actually, I want to like, read the books from the chat.

310
00:42:46.127 --> 00:42:56.279
max: From the Gtv. Talk. So what I'm writing down right now, this is a real one that should really go on my actual to do list. But the the idea here is

311
00:42:57.103 --> 00:43:15.880
max: I just saw in the chat when we were talking, people were putting book recommendations. And I wanna go. I wanna document those and go read the books. So I'm just writing it down to remember, and we'll break that out in a second. So the inbox is just like this is basically like the the to do app on your iphone right? It's just like a list of things that can be done.

312
00:43:16.255 --> 00:43:19.539
max: If you check it, it's done just like that.

313
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:29.079
max: in here is like a little editor, so I can put a note in here. So this is just a note to myself. So these are

314
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:34.439
max: in the zoom chat, right? So that's just like contacts or information to whatever you want.

315
00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.589
max: and then each you can see each task here. It can have a project

316
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:42.481
max: and a tag and

317
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:45.039
max: I want to change

318
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.960
max: something. Here.

319
00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.200
max: let's add.

320
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.059
max: I don't know. I don't think you. I don't know if you guys can see this.

321
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.855
Lilliana Robinson: We can't see whatever pop up.

322
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.080
max: Changing.

323
00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:21.830
max: There we go. I changed the set in the settings of Omni focus. I added, these extra little fields in here. Right? So so okay, so let's look at the properties that a to do item can have. It can be in a project. It can have a tag. A tag is is another word for dependency tag. Okay, tags can be anything you want. This is what's cool. Omni focus could do whatever you want. I like it for doing like a getting things done system like I was talking about. So the way I personally use tags is, I make them my dependencies. Right

324
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.099
max: here we go. So send

325
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:26.300
max: Liliana

326
00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.890
max: puzzles. Okay? So

327
00:44:29.315 --> 00:44:36.470
max: tags, I have 2 here. So this is going to be a I need to get Liliana's address. So this is going to have like sub.

328
00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.389
max: So let's let's do another one.

329
00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.070
max: So it's actually like email.

330
00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.940
max: Loiana, and get

331
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.980
max: her

332
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:46.380
max: address.

333
00:44:48.359 --> 00:44:49.099
max: And

334
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:55.499
max: what I'm going to do is drag this under this task. So it's actually a nested. It's actually like.

335
00:44:55.540 --> 00:45:02.209
max: just became a little project, almost like it's like a dependency. So first I have to do this, and then I can do that right.

336
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.800
max: So this one is going to get a tag. This is like a mailing task.

337
00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.630
max: meaning like I have to like, have

338
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:11.189
max: stamps or something I have to like. It's involved in like sending mail.

339
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:16.470
max: This is one of my dependents. That's how I think about it because I send a lot of packages and stuff out to people.

340
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:19.920
max: And then this one is like, I actually need to talk to Liliana.

341
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:28.469
max: So I'm going to do. I'm going to make a dependency for Liliana, because I can't do that on my own. I need her for that. So she becomes a dependency.

342
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.499
max: Okay? So the other fields that we have here are

343
00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:36.999
max: defer until this little feature called defer until this is the Mo.

344
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.620
max: This is the most special thing in Omni focus. I don't really know of other to do

345
00:45:42.710 --> 00:46:03.240
max: list software that is quite set up like this. And this is like a for me a like a life changingly cool feature, which I will we will get into in a second, do due date. Everyone is familiar with that, and then repeat, so this is how you do like recurring tasks. And this is like such a good little editor. Can you guys see this? The little editor in here. The picker. Okay.

346
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.280
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, we can, yeah.

347
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:11.900
max: It's such a ro robust picker you can do. You can do like repeat it every Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

348
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.250
max: you know, one week

349
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:17.530
max: until you know, from the deferred date, like, it's very, it's super robust.

350
00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.540
max: Okay.

351
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:25.180
max: so let's go. Now, let's keep looking down those. So that's inbox. So we just captured a bunch of stuff.

352
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:27.019
max: So now I can see

353
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:30.860
max: projects. So let's do, let's make a couple of projects for ourselves.

354
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:34.679
max: So a new project is going to be

355
00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:38.729
max: techstars. Gtd, talk. I know I need to get that ready.

356
00:46:40.042 --> 00:46:44.129
max: Let's make one for like clean my office. I need to do that today.

357
00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:51.439
max: and anyone have a project they want that would be helpful to like, break out like an example project. Just to write down.

358
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:59.249
Jennifer Loh: Do you use omni? What focus for personal or work, or both?

359
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:05.569
max: Everything for me, because it's only me on it. There's no sharing, it's everything. It's all. It's everything. It's like work.

360
00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.620
max: stuff for my daughter like.

361
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.530
max: Do the dishes water the plants?

362
00:47:11.483 --> 00:47:16.130
max: shopping everything. It's like any. It's what I need to do with my time during the day.

363
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.300
Jennifer Loh: Okay.

364
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:27.090
max: That's how I like it. But you don't. You know some people prefer totally, you know, like Church and State, and I like I just like it, cause those are all that's my life, like I have to do all that stuff.

365
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:28.120
Jennifer Loh: Right.

366
00:47:29.067 --> 00:47:33.369
max: Anyone have a little company project they want to throw on here. Someone volunteer.

367
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:36.139
Jennifer Loh: Financial model.

368
00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.739
max: Make. That's so good. Make a financial model.

369
00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:46.530
max: Okay?

370
00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:59.030
max: Nope, yeah, okay, great, that's projects. Let's look at projects real quick. So I'm gonna open up. So there's this other bar here. This bar is like all the metadata. So like, let's look at it here real quick.

371
00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:10.530
max: This bar shows all the same metadata as here. It's just broken out into another panel, and there's all the options right? You could put notes, the defer date, the tags, the project. This all

372
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.470
max: should be basically familiar.

373
00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:18.659
max: So projects have another really cool piece of metadata, which is project, type.

374
00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:24.620
max: project type, and there are omni-focus offers 3 different kinds of projects.

375
00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:33.140
max: So this is a parallel project. A parallel project is a project with tasks that can all be done at the same time. So clean my office

376
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.839
max: clemat. Actually, Clem, I,

377
00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:38.330
max: Texas. Gtd, talk.

378
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.130
max: What's a parallel project?

379
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:48.650
max: Let's just say clean my office as a parallel project, meaning there might be 20 things right. Organize my books, take out the trash.

380
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:57.270
max: whatever buy this thing. It doesn't really matter what order. It doesn't matter to the success of the project. What order I do those things in? They can really be done in any order. So that's parallel.

381
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:12.220
max: Make a financial model we're going to get into like. We'll break that out into tasks. But I can already tell you that is a sequential project, meaning you have to do. Step one before step 2 like you can't unlock the end until you've done the beginning. Many projects are like that.

382
00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.709
max: and the last one is single actions and single actions are like.

383
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:26.949
max: I kind of use it almost exclusively for something like a shopping list where it's like, you don't even need to do everything you just need to do some of it, or it's just like one off like, Do this, do that? Okay?

384
00:49:28.531 --> 00:49:43.700
max: Another option is complete. The project of the last action. So that's when it's all done, just go ahead and complete the project. So this is, let's get into the financial model. Actually, I'm going to make my Gtd talk a sequential. I'm going to set it to sequential meaning. I want to do everything in order. Okay.

385
00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:50.880
max: so first is, actually, I have a project. I have. An item which is review inbox 0. Right? So let's put that in

386
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:55.589
max: Techstar's Gtd talk. And now here it is. Right.

387
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:58.350
max: Then there's write up my notes.

388
00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:06.070
max: Then there's install a vanilla omni focus trial to demo.

389
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:07.580
max: And then there's like

390
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.859
max: I don't know like, get the zoom link.

391
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:14.550
max: 10 min before the talk.

392
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.567
max: Okay? So that's the project that's like,

393
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:23.759
max: you know, whatever that's abbreviated. We can all imagine a project with all the steps in order like that, right?

394
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.480
max: So

395
00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.969
max: I need to make a perspective.

396
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:34.020
max: Give me 1 s. I'm I'm gonna I have a little pop up here and I'm making a perspective.

397
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.700
max: So I'm setting availability.

398
00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.499
max: So what I made is a little

399
00:50:54.810 --> 00:51:06.889
max: these things on the sidebar, right? These are just sort of like filters of like how I'm looking at my my to do. It's just different ways of filtering and seeing the items you have to do, and I just made one for myself here called available, and this is now

400
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:08.760
max: showing me

401
00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.629
max: only what's available to do right now.

402
00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:29.160
max: So if we look in that in my little talk, right, the only thing available for me. Because, I said, this project is sequential meaning. It has to be done 1, 2, 3, 4 in order, and only in order. The only thing available for me to do right now is review the this inbox 0 talk.

403
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:37.710
max: and what that means is I can't write my notes until I've reviewed that this is useless to me. I don't want to see. Write my notes because I can't do it. I at first I have to watch the talk right?

404
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.929
max: So when I look at available like when I wake up in the morning, and I'm like, what am I going to be doing.

405
00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.020
max: Sorry.

406
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.090
max: Tag this. Okay, there we go.

407
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:58.570
max: I don't want to see. Write my notes. I only want to see review the talk. So this is a reflection of what's available for me to do

408
00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:04.999
max: right now. So now let's say I wake up, and the talk isn't for another couple days, or whatever, and I don't even want to see this.

409
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.590
max: I'm going to say, defer this

410
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.210
max: for 2 days.

411
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:12.939
max: and now it becomes unavailable, and I don't even see it.

412
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.450
max: It's out of

413
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.200
max: it's out of my brain.

414
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:24.829
max: But I know in 2 days, when it becomes when that timer comes down and it becomes available again, I'm going to now see it again on my available list.

415
00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:27.250
max: Are you guys

416
00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.430
max: with me?

417
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:34.220
Lilliana Robinson: So when you moved the task out of the inbox to the project, did it stop living in the inbox.

418
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.169
max: Yeah, so it moves. So

419
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:43.229
max: this is a setting you can change. But in Omni focus it never like disappears things. It only does things on

420
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:52.570
max: refresh, meaning like when you close out of the window. And that's so, you don't. I think the idea is to prevent they don't. The software is never going to show you things changing and moving

421
00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:54.879
max: in real time.

422
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:58.049
max: To not make it look like your things are disappearing.

423
00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.200
max: Essentially.

424
00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:02.249
max: Yeah, you can change that in settings. I believe.

425
00:53:03.395 --> 00:53:03.820
max: So.

426
00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:09.943
Lilliana Robinson: So then, when you 1 one more question, Max, when you have the non sequential project, so the parallel project.

427
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:15.299
Lilliana Robinson: do all of those things just show up in your available, since it's like you can do them all.

428
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:24.550
max: Yup. So let's look at that. So clean in my office. Take out the trash, order new pens from the Japanese pen store.

429
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.610
max: What else do I have to do to clean my office.

430
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.160
max: organize my books?

431
00:53:33.459 --> 00:53:38.649
max: Yeah, good enough. Okay. So those are all the things I need to do to clean my office today. Right?

432
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:41.930
max: So right now, if I go to available.

433
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.729
max: those are all showing me that I can do them today.

434
00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:49.799
max: If I go back into projects. And I go. You know what?

435
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:55.190
max: I really don't feel like cleaning my office today. That's gonna wait until tomorrow. I can go defer until

436
00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.560
max: tomorrow.

437
00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:16.749
max: And now, when I go to available, it's all got. It's not even there. I'll just it will come back to my. I know I know it's gonna come back tomorrow and I can. But so I can like get it out of my head. But I'm it's I'm just made a decision. I'm not looking at this today, and you can even get as granular like if you if I wanted to, I could be like, don't show me this until 5 pm, like, I'm actually going to do this after work today.

438
00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:24.819
max: or maybe app like, right? So like after bed, so like, my daughter goes to sleep at 7 so like app. Show me, just show me it after 7 30, you know. Show me it after bedtime. So

439
00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:25.936
max: those are

440
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:37.699
max: that's how you use that. And what's cool is because I these are all in a project, if I it all, it inherits right? So if I defer it, everything in the project inherits that

441
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.670
max: deferral. If that makes sense.

442
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:49.189
max: okay, let's do a couple more of these. So this is gonna be target.

443
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:50.030
Alejandra Guillen: Question Sorry.

444
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:51.110
max: Yes, yes.

445
00:54:52.464 --> 00:54:54.959
Alejandra Guillen: So a a project?

446
00:54:55.080 --> 00:55:01.620
Alejandra Guillen: What's your expectation for when to finish a project? Do you build projects for the week? Do you build projects for a month.

447
00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:17.029
max: Yes, so I have some projects like, I really do legitimately make a project that's like a shopping list for the grocery store, just because it's where I like to write it down, or I make a project for like clean my office. And that might be one that I'm going to get done in an hour. I just need a place to write it down and like get it out of my brain.

448
00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:25.769
max: So a project could be something that I'm going to do in in and in 30 min. But I also have projects, and in omni-focus that have been there for years that are like.

449
00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:34.839
max: launch my company right? Or something like that. I don't know if that's like best practice, but like it's up to you, it's just. It's like how you want to see things and how you want to organize them.

450
00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:36.940
Alejandra Guillen: Thanks.

451
00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.820
Lilliana Robinson: And then do you just not have a due date on those? So they just get to sit there, and they don't show up and available.

452
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.210
max: Yeah, so due date. So let's talk about due dates for a second. So

453
00:55:45.380 --> 00:56:02.950
max: the way this is again, I'm just giving you my opinion about this, and it's not you don't have to do it like this. But so like due dates to me, I have a complicated relationship with due dates. I'm curious. If anyone else has ever had this experience of like, I'll make a little list for myself, and I'll put a due date on everything, and I'd be like that's gonna be done on Tuesday, and that's gonna be done on Wednesday.

454
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:25.659
max: Then, at the end of the week all I have is just a huge list of overdue things that I didn't do, and they're all screaming at me. And so I I have just stopped using due dates myself. I don't stick to them. They don't help me. They stress me out, and I find them like I find, like I'm lying to myself. I'm like, I will do this by this date, and I just don't do it. So I don't wanna build a muscle of not trying to exercise a muscle of like disappointing myself.

455
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:46.159
max: So if I, on the rare occasion I so here's what a due date means to me. A due date means to me like it will have like horrible consequences for my life if I don't do this by this date, so a thing that will have a due date for me is like, renew my driver's license like, I better get that done by that date, or I'm gonna like, go to jail for driving without a license, right? So like, if it has a due date. That's like

456
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:58.650
max: red alarm like it must get done. It's like really serious. If it's like I really want to take out. Remember to take out the trash today. That doesn't get a due date. That's just what I would do. So we'll get into this as like

457
00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:04.039
max: I can show you this. So how many focus is this other thing which is flag? Right? I just flag it.

458
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:08.899
max: And that's how I decide what I'm that's my intention of what I'm going to get done today is

459
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:10.430
max: what's flagged.

460
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:16.134
Lilliana Robinson: So you don't even look at the available tab. You just.

461
00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:23.580
max: I do? I do. I look at available tasks? Yeah, yeah, I do use that. That's how I like. So what I do in the morning is, I look at the available tasks.

462
00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:29.600
max: and then I go through. And I, I'm not doing all this today. But like, what can I get done today. Okay, I can get Liliana's address.

463
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:31.660
max: I'm going to buy Kitty Litter.

464
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:46.709
max: I'm not making a financial model for my company, but I'll take out the trash. Those are my 3. If I do those 3 like, I could be like, Okay, I like, did some chores today. And then I can just see those I can get rid of everything else. And I can just see those today. That's like what I wanna get done today.

465
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:47.480
Lilliana Robinson: Got it.

466
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:56.870
max: So it's like I'm making like I'm starting with, like, what's everything I can get done. And then I'm picking like. Here's the 5 that I can call this a good day if I did those 5 sort of.

467
00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:02.610
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, we have 3 questions. The first one, yeah, go ahead.

468
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:11.860
Lilliana Robinson: Do you want me to read it to you? The first one is from snow. It says for me, deferring tasks, often collects a bunch of tasks and dumps them to me at once. How do you manage that?

469
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:20.780
max: I go through and just defer them again. If I get like a bunch of stuff, if I'm like, defer everything until Monday, and then it's Monday, and I'm like.

470
00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:40.579
max: Oh, no, it's the consequences of my own actions. And now everything is undeferred. I just go through and pick more and defer again. Or I try and get some things done, or one of my favorite things in life is deciding that something isn't actually important, and deleting it off my to do list and going, you know. Upon further reflection, I actually don't wanna do this, and I just delete it. It's pretty nice if you can do it.

471
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.670
Lilliana Robinson: Very powerful.

472
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.990
max: Yeah.

473
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.940
Lilliana Robinson: Mark, what about you?

474
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.670
Snow Lee / Runbear: Thanks.

475
00:58:45.548 --> 00:58:55.729
Mark Kirzhner: One of my problems is using task list on a on a mobile device. I believe this this app is also shared on your mobile device, share, share the same data.

476
00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:09.850
Mark Kirzhner: And so when I'm working, my mobile is is closed. If I look at the Whatsapp or something, it can distract me for for really long periods of times. If I check something, on Youtube, I I have some

477
00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:19.320
Mark Kirzhner: some extension that blocks everything from Youtube. I see only the search bar. Otherwise I'm I'm stuck for hours in the middle of doing something important.

478
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:26.569
Mark Kirzhner: So so the question is, how do you do it on your mobile with this app, and not being distracted.

479
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:37.640
max: So I don't. I'm the worst pro I mean. I spent an hour on Tiktok last night, like I'm the worst person to ask about this like I love being on my, if I love to be on my phone in my bed.

480
00:59:37.917 --> 00:59:41.662
max: But or I don't love it, but I do it all the time. But

481
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:47.409
max: I there's an app I really like. What's the one that blocks everything but the search bar.

482
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:51.399
Mark Kirzhner: I'll check it. I'll put it in the chat.

483
00:59:51.400 --> 01:00:00.229
max: So there's one that I've been playing with that I really like, and it's called one. Sec. One sec. And it's for iphone and what it does I can show you.

484
01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:12.430
max: So you pick the apps. You want it to run on, and it uses you have to set it up with shortcuts and stuff. But you're all smart, you'll figure it out. But so basically, look at what happens. Right? So I'm going to open Twitter, or it's X, the everything app

485
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:16.500
max: and what it's going to do, it's actually not.

486
01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:23.839
max: Let's see, it shouldn't allow me to open twitter. Oh, there it goes! So it actually puts this all it does is it puts this timer on.

487
01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.890
max: and it, I just says, like, Take a breath, and it takes 10 s before I'm allowed to see Twitter.

488
01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:32.170
max: and I just have to sit here and wait.

489
01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:45.099
max: and then I have it programmed to show me, hey? Instead of doing Twitter. Here's a link to the kindle app where you could like. Read a book with your time, and I have to say like for me, like I find myself like going on like Twitter Instagram, whatever those like

490
01:00:45.110 --> 01:01:04.340
max: horrible mind prisons when I'm like bored for 10 s, and I'm in an elevator or like whatever, and sometimes just making myself wait those 10 Si like sober up. And I'm like, Oh, I don't actually wanna yeah, Twitter, like, I actually wanna live a good life. So sometimes, and then amazingly, let me see if I just closed it out

491
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:14.540
max: 1 1 s like, check this out. So it has these statistics on it right? So it know. So here's what it does. It looks at how much time every time I open twitter.

492
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:19.699
max: This is so depressing. Every time I open twitter

493
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:22.349
max: I spend.

494
01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.700
max: does it? Say?

495
01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:36.470
max: I don't know. I spend it knows how much time I spend on average on Twitter, and then it looks at the number of successful interventions, and it will tell me right here, this app has saved me 6 h on Twitter.

496
01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:47.999
max: 8 h on Tiktok. God! That's suppressing, and 3 h on Reddit, which is great like, I'm so happy to have that time back that like. So anyway, that's a pitch. That's that one.

497
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:48.460
Mark Kirzhner: I would.

498
01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.440
max: What you add I don't know. I'm sorry. I just got excited about that. But

499
01:01:53.853 --> 01:02:00.690
max: okay, any should I? Is this, do you guys want to keep seeing how many focus is this helpful to keep walking through this.

500
01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:02.750
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, yeah. There are 2 more questions. Then.

501
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:03.770
max: Yeah, let's do it.

502
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:05.980
Lilliana Robinson: Fabian, and then there's one in the chat.

503
01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:21.219
Fabien | Positive Finance: Hey, Max? Thanks, boys, where? Where do you draw the line, I guess, between your company's system, like base camp pickup, and so on, and where you use only focus to avoid like duplicate entries or subtask projects, and.

504
01:02:22.007 --> 01:02:23.970
max: Yeah. So I take so like.

505
01:02:24.604 --> 01:02:41.680
max: I have many different companies and collaborations with people. And I want, I I don't know about you guys, I'm on notion a lot that's like the new one that everyone likes to use. So, unfortunately, what I do is I at the end of a meeting, or whatever I have to take the to do list items from the shared one from base camp or notion.

506
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:44.900
max: and I copy and paste them into omni-focus myself.

507
01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:53.119
max: and the reason is, I just I just want to decide for myself what I'm going to do. I don't want someone else to tell me what to do with my time, so

508
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.020
max: you can make it. I think there's.

509
01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:01.959
max: I think, if you ask 10 people that question, you get 10 answers, but that's how I do it, for personally, from myself.

510
01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.759
Fabien | Positive Finance: Yeah, yeah, trying to figure out that. But yeah, thanks.

511
01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.690
max: It's it's not great like. I don't love the

512
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:25.610
max: fractured like every having information everywhere like it really, actually like, I feel the same way about chatting with people like, I never know where I talk. I all the time I'm like, where am I talking to this person? I have 9 apps, and it's like, Are we in like Dms? Or what is it, you know? Like.

513
01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:26.150
Fabien | Positive Finance: Team.

514
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:29.519
max: Same with to dos. I'm like, where is that thing I need to do so

515
01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:31.139
max: personally for me.

516
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:38.919
max: If it's an omni focus, I will pay attention to it and do it. And if it's not an omni focus, it's like someone else's problem. It's like, I'm not paying attention to it.

517
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.670
max: Thank you. Yeah.

518
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:46.679
Lilliana Robinson: Do you ever like? Write down your things in in the wrong place, like on a post it, or like somewhere else? Because.

519
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.440
max: Love. I have.

520
01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:48.100
Lilliana Robinson: We're.

521
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:49.679
max: I I mean

522
01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:56.030
max: I have full. I have so many like I have nothing but note, like my entire desk, is just

523
01:03:56.050 --> 01:04:09.780
max: random scraps of paper, or I write things down. I come home. I take things out of my pocket, and it's like, it's like, it's like, Wow, like I have stuff everywhere, but that's like it has to go into omni. If I'm really want to do it, it has to go an omni focus. It has to.

524
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:16.634
Lilliana Robinson: So is there like a Si like, I'm looking at my ghosts around, too. Is there like a system where you put it in, or like.

525
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:38.740
max: There and I type it. I don't. I open. I like open that. I sit at my computer look. So I was at a thrift store, and I got this restaurant check pad, and I was just using it as a to do list and just writing my stuff down on it. And then it's like here. And I just sit down on my computer and I sit and type it in Omni focus. Because if I don't, it's gonna I'm gonna lose it. If it's on a little piece of paper like I'm definitely gonna lose it. It's going in the washing machine. Probably.

526
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:44.219
Lilliana Robinson: I see. So it's just like, you know, the importance of it. So you make sure to write it down. There's not like a.

527
01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:50.060
max: Try to like it. Yeah, I try to write down everything, and then it has to go into omni focus. So like

528
01:04:50.200 --> 01:05:06.689
max: the sort of the best case scenario is to type it right into omni focus for me. What's my favorite is to type it right in Omni focus in my computer. And there's the Omni focus is a sort of like hot key. You can push, and it does a little pop up, and you can just quick capture, or whatever which is cool, but like

529
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:24.730
max: I also like little pads like I like my little tiny pads of paper, and I personal style. I love paper and pen, and I like thinking with paper and pen. And so then I just but then the and the downside is like, you know. Then you have to sit there after the meeting and type my notes into me focus. But you know, that's whatever that's life.

530
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.510
Lilliana Robinson: Sounds like it's a muscle. Yeah, like, you have to get used to that.

531
01:05:29.006 --> 01:05:31.489
max: Yeah, yeah, I guess, yeah.

532
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:37.079
Lilliana Robinson: A bunch of people in the chat are asking, How do you handle delegating tasks, and how do you delegate without disappointing.

533
01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:37.510
max: Okay.

534
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:38.000
Lilliana Robinson: To do like.

535
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.241
max: Let's talk about this. Alright.

536
01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:46.939
max: let's go into the financial model. That's a one where we can do delegation. This is the best. This is where this is like the best.

537
01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:48.320
max: This is so cool.

538
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.849
max: Who said, financial model is that Jennifer.

539
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:54.529
Jennifer Loh: It was J. Lo, yes.

540
01:05:54.530 --> 01:06:02.419
max: Will you tell me like we don't actually need to get into making a financial model, but I don't even know what a financial model is, could you? What are the to do? Items.

541
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:07.249
Jennifer Loh: Okay, need to figure out the metrics for the financial model, like the leverage.

542
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:11.209
max: What does that? What does that? What do you do to figure out? What does that mean? You have to have a conversation with the team.

543
01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.505
Jennifer Loh: Oh,

544
01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.250
Jennifer Loh: yes.

545
01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:26.630
max: Okay, so let's just make that a project. So here we go. So here's how I would think about this. So I would write down the big idea, which is like, figure out the metrics

546
01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:29.540
max: for the model is that it.

547
01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:30.140
Jennifer Loh: Yeah.

548
01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:44.770
max: One of the. Here's another good trick. By the way, of how I'm writing this down. So I'm repeating the use of the phrase financial model where I didn't just say, figure out the metrics, I said. Figure out the metrics for the financial model, even though it's in the financial model project.

549
01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:58.279
max: And the reason is, later I might see this out of context. And it's gonna save me a little cycle of thinking to see the whole thing written out. So I know exactly what we're doing. So this actually has a sub task which is meet

550
01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.180
max: with the team to discuss

551
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:08.599
max: metrics. And then there's probably another task which is like schedule a meeting with the team right? So there's like reach out

552
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:12.410
max: to the team to schedule a meeting.

553
01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.129
max: and then there is. Hear back from Team

554
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.109
max: Member Want, who's on your company? Who.

555
01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:21.160
Jennifer Loh: Yeah. And Lisa.

556
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:23.689
max: So hear back from Sergei.

557
01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.790
max: Hear back from Lisa

558
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.529
max: about next metrics.

559
01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:29.570
max: meaning.

560
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:34.230
max: okay.

561
01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:35.440
max: So

562
01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:40.036
max: meet with the team to discuss metrics. I can't do that until we

563
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:55.740
max: yeah, until we schedule the meeting. So first I have to. So the next. So in order to do that, first, I have to reach out, and then I have to hear back from everyone.

564
01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.629
max: So this is, O,

565
01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.419
max: so this is how this looks.

566
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.969
max: So this is going to get

567
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:04.460
max: a tag of Lisa.

568
01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.380
max: And this is going to get a tag of

569
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.660
max: surgeon.

570
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.060
max: Okay.

571
01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:11.560
max: so

572
01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:18.450
max: and so, this project is actually a sequential. It has to get done in this order.

573
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:28.430
max: and this project is a parallel, because it doesn't matter whether I hear back from Lisa or Sergei what order right? I could hear back from Lisa or Sergeant any order. So this little Mini project is

574
01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:32.079
max: all at once, and this is in order it's got to be.

575
01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:34.519
max: This has got to get done like this right.

576
01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:35.539
Jennifer Loh: Right?

577
01:08:36.089 --> 01:08:36.629
Jennifer Loh: Okay.

578
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:38.080
max: So

579
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.470
max: What's available in this project, if I go to available.

580
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.420
max: is only

581
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.570
max: oh, I set that up wrong.

582
01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:59.510
max: Here we go, so it's only reach out so it should be. Only

583
01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:19.930
max: reach out to the team to schedule a meeting. That's the only thing that can get done right now, like. I can't hear back from Sergei because I haven't emailed Sergey yet, and I can't make the metrics because we haven't had the meeting. So the only thing on my plate is reach out to the team to schedule a meeting. So now I'm gonna write my email and say, Sergey Lisa, we gotta meet about the thing. Fill out this form, whatever you guys do.

584
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:24.580
max: Great! I'm I'm done with my work. I did my part and I emailed them right

585
01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:28.400
max: now I have a delegate task now I have a dependency.

586
01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:32.410
max: I have to hear back from Lisa, and I have to hear back from Sergei.

587
01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:38.319
max: so I don't wanna hear? I don't care about this. I already emailed them. It's not my problem today. But I'm gonna give them until Monday.

588
01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:40.679
max: So I'm going to defer this until Monday.

589
01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:48.020
max: and I'm going to flag it because it's important to. I need to hear back from them. So what's cool is now, on Monday morning

590
01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:58.350
max: this thing is gonna pop up. And I'm gonna be like, Oh, did I hear back from Lisa? Did I hear back from Sergei? And if I didn't, I'm gonna email them again and say, Hey, guys, gotta close loop on this. I didn't hear back from you.

591
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:02.220
max: This is an unbelievable superpower

592
01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:23.949
max: I had. I will just to share like one story with you. I was doing for the puzzles I was doing customer service for the I was answering all the customer service emails from the puzzles. And I kept hearing. And I was hearing from users, from people. And they would email. And they'd say, Hey, there's a problem or the art is peeling off. It's delaminating from the cardboard. This is like a huge red flag for me. Something is wrong with the manufacturing.

593
01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:35.609
max: So I emailed the factory rep in China. And I was like, sent them a picture. And I was like, Hey, one of our customers emailed us, what's up with this. What happened I didn't hear back. So I make a to do list item, and I go in one week.

594
01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:40.210
max: hear back from the guy in China, and I hadn't heard back from him. So I email him again, right?

595
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:42.440
max: And he says, Let me look into it. And I say.

596
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:51.229
max: look into it. I feel like that's like buying time. So I go in one week. Remind me again, hear back from. So I just have this thing come up every week. I emailed this guy every week

597
01:10:51.290 --> 01:11:06.030
max: for like a year, and and I didn't let him off the hook until and every time we met about something, or he wanted some new business, or we're talking about the contract, or whatever I'm like. Hey, what's up with this one thing? Because I it's like a superpower like. I always remembered this one little like it's like a

598
01:11:06.130 --> 01:11:28.110
max: like a broken nail, you know. It's like it was like I was always there like I just I never could forget it, cause it was in my omni focus. And I and I, we did get to the bottom of it. It was like there was like water was getting into some of the packages during shipping or something, and it's fixed. But like later, that guy was like, How did you like. He's like, how did you do that like he's like, I thought for sure. You just forget about that, and we'd move on with our life. But like you, just.

599
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:48.950
max: he was like, you're like a dog like you just like wouldn't let it go like you just kept asking and asking and asking, and like I'm trust me, I'm not walking around in my life like thinking about that. It's just it's in my thing. And so it reminds me to do it so it will make you so tenacious to like. Have a deferred thing that keeps popping up and popping up and popping up like you'll never forget. It's like it just makes you

600
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.940
max: like

601
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.410
max: you're like the Terminator. So like.

602
01:11:52.910 --> 01:12:08.779
max: because you just know what I'm talking about. There's like so many things in life where you're like. I'm not gonna deal with this. That person's definitely forgetting. Gonna forget about it, right? Or like, I'll just no one's gonna remind me about this like you will never forget. You will just keep going and going and going and going, because we'll always remind you of it. So that's how I deal with like

603
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:19.950
max: deferring out is like I have the meeting with the person, and then I write down for myself, I go like it's not. I can't control, if, like, I'm so like, let's say it's like.

604
01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:33.400
max: I couldn't put on my to do list. Lisa emails me back about the meeting because I can't do that. That's not my task. I'm not Lisa. I can't make her do it. Sorry, Lisa. I don't mean to. If you're here. I don't mean to.

605
01:12:34.199 --> 01:12:36.350
max: Pick on you or whatever but like it's like,

606
01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:59.899
max: did you guys, does that make sense like you can't write something down that you can't do so. You can only write down what you can do, and what I can do is hear back from her. That's my responsibility is to hear back, and then like, do the next action. And if I don't hear back it's not getting checked off, and I'm never gonna let Lisa's never gonna hear the end of it? It's gonna be like, why don't you reply to my email? What's going on bumping this thread, putting this thread on top of your inbox just have to be like so tenacious

607
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:07.429
max: good for sales, good for all kinds of things like you will just like, never, ever, ever

608
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:10.090
max: forget one of those little annoying things.

609
01:13:11.426 --> 01:13:19.130
max: So let's just say, now, Lisa emails me back some dates. Sergi emails me back some dates. So that's done. So right. So now, what's available?

610
01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.859
max: Meet with the team to discuss the metrics. We have our meeting, and I can check that off. And now

611
01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:29.999
max: it's I have to write. My, I don't know what the deliverable is. Right. This should really be something like.

612
01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:37.089
max: Send the Google Doc to the team. It should be like a thing that could be done right like, circulate the Google Doc to the team with

613
01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:49.699
max: the first draft of the metric, something like that right? And now we can be done with that. And now this project itself make a financial model actually becomes available. There's no remaining tasks.

614
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:53.500
max: And now I can click there. And we're done. That project is done.

615
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:56.179
max: Project itself is complete.

616
01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:01.520
max: And that's why that's like the power of having projects that can like be completed.

617
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:04.950
max: So having

618
01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:10.460
max: def defer right? So it like pops up. And then suddenly, it's like, Okay, you gotta deal with this again.

619
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:16.050
max: Defer it pops up. You gotta deal with it again. It's so it's so. It's huge life changing.

620
01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:26.360
Lilliana Robinson: So do you wanna yield to like, or try to stay on the side of having projects that you can get rid of, and not just things that like, sit there and you keep filling.

621
01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:39.150
max: Correct. I think this is an idea in in Omni focus. Is like, only put things on your to do list that that are to do's so like, what is it to do? It has to be a thing that could be done, like.

622
01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:42.599
max: be like, achieve happiness and inner peace

623
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:47.830
max: cannot really go on your to do list because it can't be done. It's like, an ongoing life project.

624
01:14:49.616 --> 01:14:55.679
max: I don't always do that. I have. I have. Listen. I have a project in my personal one that's like

625
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:57.010
max: my house.

626
01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:04.729
max: That's never done right. It's just. I just need a place to put that stuff, but it's like best practice is like, only put things on that can be done

627
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:06.240
max: completed.

628
01:15:07.645 --> 01:15:16.664
max: I'm happy to make some more example projects and keep like going through this or and I should say one more thing is

629
01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:40.279
max: I'll share again. I'm gonna share these notes. But the setup that I'm showing you where I have that available perspective. That's like a custom perspective. And the instructions for how to set that up are in this video. I recommended the Mac Sparky Omni Focus Guide. So I'll link that out to everyone, and he'll just show you like. Here's how you set that perspective up and and so on, and so forth. So

630
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:48.000
max: I think we're past time. So I will stay. I let me just double check.

631
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.320
Lilliana Robinson: We have 10 min left.

632
01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.209
max: Oh, we do. Okay, cool. So let's do questions. And then do.

633
01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:53.819
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, there are 2 things for you.

634
01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:54.170
max: I'm.

635
01:15:54.170 --> 01:15:55.240
Lilliana Robinson: So Nelson.

636
01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.580
max: I can hang out and talk if people want to as well. So.

637
01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:58.650
Lilliana Robinson: Thanks.

638
01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:06.769
Nelson Mitchell: I? Thanks for answering that delegate thing that is always a bugaboo, and I love your approach there so I love that.

639
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:22.149
max: The main. The key thought technology for delegate. I've had very complicated, very, very, very sensitive and complicated delegations, like I've like had to like delegate up to like important people and things like that. So I've had very sensitive, like, delegation system situations in my life. And

640
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:30.889
max: yeah, yeah, it's just like it's the way I think of it is. I will only write something down that I can do. I'm not going to write something down that it's not my

641
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:35.999
max: like. I can't write something down that's like someone else is going to do. And sometimes all you can do is be like.

642
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:41.040
max: hear back from this person. And so you just have to write down, hear back from this person, because it's the only thing you can do.

643
01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:52.280
Nelson Mitchell: So I have 2 questions for you. We talked about you. You just touched on evergreen project, and how the mentality is that you only want to have project, you can actually complete right? But like.

644
01:16:52.330 --> 01:17:00.650
Nelson Mitchell: if there's something in your life, it's like evergreen, like, I don't know, like like you said, like working on the house. Is that an appropriate use of the tag?

645
01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.929
Nelson Mitchell: Like to just like tag something as like out so like when you're thinking about.

646
01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:18.460
max: Listen like tab when you say, like appropriate use, like, I just wanna be clear like I'm not. I'm not selling anything, and like I don't even barely have. I'm like hanging on by my fingernails myself. So like don't just don't do it. I'm just sharing. I'm just saying

647
01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:23.540
max: I'm just trying to share, like how the best, the least bad way I've figured out to do it.

648
01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:45.029
max: I think probably the most popular use of tags is like exactly what you're talking about is like, you wanna see all the stuff for your house. And there it is. I I can also tell you, like the way in the book getting things done like they recommend doing it is, that is, to think of, you know, whatever tags or dependencies as like blockers, things that are outside of yourself, meaning like it has to be the night. To do this. I have to be in this

649
01:17:45.140 --> 01:18:12.229
max: specific location. I have to be home to do this. I ha! Blockers, I need to be on that call with this person. I need you write external dependencies that prevent you from doing the project right now, whatever it could be. What's an external dependency that prevents you from doing it right now? That's a tag, right? Cause you're you're you're like, what's blocking me. I even have a friend who has uses tag. This is an interesting one. I have a friend, you I do not do this, but I have a friend who uses tags, and they write

650
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:23.940
max: high energy and low energy, and so they have some types of tasks that can only be done when they're like, Wake up in the morning. Have the cup of coffee, and you're like full of energy, and you can like do it, and that's like.

651
01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:41.530
max: I don't know, like writing a sales email. You know, it's like, you just have to be like ready to go. And they have other things that's like low energy. And that could be like data entry where it's like, I'm only going to do this if I'm sleepy or on an airplane or something like that. So those are interesting ways to think of blockers, too, is like, what's your own energy

652
01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:42.900
max: to bring to it.

653
01:18:43.710 --> 01:18:47.808
Nelson Mitchell: Awesome. I one other question. I'm sorry to pile them up. But

654
01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:55.269
Nelson Mitchell: Do you schedule time on your calendar to go through your little bits of paper, and go through all your systems and.

655
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.650
max: I do?

656
01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:56.970
Nelson Mitchell: Oh, are we on the grasshopper.

657
01:18:56.970 --> 01:19:01.290
max: So I forgot this key thing. So ami focus. So check this out.

658
01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:10.519
max: So omni focus has this little thing called review. Everything is reviewed right now. But basically, how do I let me see? Can I make something? So I need to review it?

659
01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:16.220
max: Let's just make this reviewed like yesterday.

660
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:18.119
max: No, hang on, that's May.

661
01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.689
max: Let's just make it overdue. Okay, great.

662
01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:30.259
max: So look. So I'm I mean, I'm in techstars. My, my, this is the project. For like this, talk right like, prepare this talk right? And let's just say, I, wanna

663
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:39.690
max: how often do I want to review this talk? Personal preference. How often do you want to be reminded of it for something that's like time sensitive like I've got to get it done by this deadline. I might want to review it.

664
01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.410
max: Yeah, just every one week.

665
01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:48.600
max: Okay, that's pretty aggressive for review, like reviewing it every week. But like, yeah. So now

666
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:54.760
max: I have a little one under review, and it's telling me I I need to review this project

667
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:58.440
max: meaning like, What's it's that's like, take a look, think about it for a second like.

668
01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:11.720
max: is this everything I need to do? Are any of these things stale? Have I changed my mind so I can go through and be like, okay, you know what? I really don't need to deal with the zoom link. I already have that. So I'm gonna just take that. I'm not even gonna I'm just gonna delete that.

669
01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.050
max: Then I'm done and I go, mark reviewed.

670
01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:19.759
max: And what's cool is now I can see the next review will be on May third.

671
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:39.600
max: so it pushes. So now in a week it's going to remind me to review it, so I don't schedule it in my calendar, but I do use the review tool and omni focus. And I and in the morning I wake up and I, omni focus tells me what I need to review. I have some projects I review every week, some I review every day, some I review, every month, I have some I only review. I have one project in omni focus called like.

672
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:43.130
max: I think that right now I'm calling it like

673
01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:57.270
max: idea, like ideas for the future or something. And it's like where I write down like crazy company ideas or something like that. And that one I just review once a year. It's just like, is this something I wanna you know, stuff I don't. Wanna, you know, like, Oh, I should

674
01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.260
max: talk, you know. Whatever like.

675
01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:03.879
max: Buy this thing or start, you know, whatever crazy ideas for the future.

676
01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:05.240
max: But yeah.

677
01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:08.410
Lilliana Robinson: So what does review mean? Like, we're just looking at it.

678
01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:23.160
max: Yeah, means like, look at the like. So what what I do during a review is like, I'm looking at the project, and I'm trying to get the whole picture of it in my head. I'm like, No, okay. So like it starts with, is this project still important to my life? Do I even want this project

679
01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:26.990
max: in my life? Right? So if if I have a whole project for, like

680
01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:36.049
max: you know, whatever like buying a bicycle and go to the store and research it. And you know this and that, and then I decide later, like, you know what? I don't even really want to own a bicycle.

681
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:42.980
max: Great. That's the purpose of the review is to be like, I'm just dropping this project. It's not I. I've just changed my mind. So the first thing in a review is like, is this project

682
01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.270
max: support what you want to do in your life?

683
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:59.799
max: Then I'm looking at the individual tasks, and I'm like, is it complete? Is everything I need? Really does this reflect everything that needs to be done in the project? And then I'm going to go through the tasks and be like, are any of these like stale or wrong? Or do they need an update?

684
01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:17.779
max: But the idea is like you, you never wanna feel there's this like great freedom of like taking everything out of your brain. And you have a little contract with yourself of like it's in on me. It's in my to do list. I won't forget it. It's written down, but part of that is like to fulfill that contract for yourself. You can't forget it. You have to remember. You have to look at it at some point. So the review is like.

685
01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:24.839
max: I promise I won't forget this. It's not just going into a black hole and disappearing like I will review it. I will look at it

686
01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:27.329
max: so I would do a review.

687
01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:46.419
max: I try to do a review. I wake up in the morning and I try to make it the for before I get into my email or anything else, I try to open up my to do list. And I review my tasks. I pick what I'm gonna do for the day, and I try to make my own decision for myself of like, what's the story of the day like, what am I trying to get done? What what life am I gonna have today?

688
01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:48.629
max: Then I get into everything else.

689
01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:54.674
max: And then another question. Sorry to this is a long answer

690
01:22:55.050 --> 01:23:08.419
max: Another question was about Calendar. I also use a calendar, and it's really serious for me. If I put something on my calendar, it's like there's no like. I don't put things on my calendar that I like remember to take out the garbage like the calendar, is like.

691
01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:16.609
max: I have to have this thing happen at this time, where it will ruin my life. It's like serious appointments, like real real stuff.

692
01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.020
max: Pick up my daughter!

693
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:23.010
max: Whatever like it has to be, it's like real on my calendar. Otherwise it has to go somewhere else.

694
01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:37.289
max: cause the worst is, you open up your calendar and you have a bunch of like bullshit that you don't really need to do, and you can't even tell where your next appointment is like. I don't like having like extra things in my, that's this is my personal taste, but that's for me. That's what works.

695
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:39.819
Lilliana Robinson: At the point. Doug, what about you?

696
01:23:42.764 --> 01:23:48.429
Doug Rogers: Yeah, I just wanna that audio note to transcribed inbox to do. Item.

697
01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:51.150
Doug Rogers: is that using? Like apple shortcuts.

698
01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:59.534
max: Yeah, I just made a shortcut. So basically it triggers a shortcut so you can have this button right in the set system settings

699
01:24:00.666 --> 01:24:17.300
max: you can set this button to do all kinds of things, and one of them is run shortcut. So I made a shortcut for myself. That opens up a text transcription. And then, when I'm done with the transcription, it sends it to Omni focus and omni focus has really nice. What do they call it X. URL

700
01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:21.369
max: callbacks. It has really good. Yeah, URL, schema support for.

701
01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:23.050
Doug Rogers: Oh, lights. Okay?

702
01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:36.000
max: It's it's in the shortcut system. So you can then take that transcribe text and follow a URL schema to just send it straight to Omi focus. So when I talk, when I use that and I talk into the phone, it goes

703
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:38.470
max: right and omni-focus. There's no extra step.

704
01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:40.640
Doug Rogers: Could you share that.

705
01:24:40.810 --> 01:24:42.299
max: Yeah, I could share that. I'm happy to.

706
01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.210
Doug Rogers: I think those are shareable that'd be awesome.

707
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:50.830
max: It is. Yeah. Great idea. Let me. Okay. So now I have to put this in my real omni focus. So

708
01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:57.280
max: remember to share my shortcut for Ios.

709
01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.760
Lilliana Robinson: I'll send this recording to you, Max, so you can see the chat and you can go back and get everything you want.

710
01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.569
max: Okay, I'm definitely not doing that. So I'll have to.

711
01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:09.910
Lilliana Robinson: But you made a to do for you to look at the books.

712
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:14.089
max: Yeah. But I mean, I mean, I'm gonna write them down right now. I'm not re-watching them.

713
01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:14.619
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, my!

714
01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:16.280
max: But listen myself. Talk for an hour.

715
01:25:17.416 --> 01:25:21.359
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, so we're at time. But Liam, Max said, he has extra time, so he can.

716
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.850
max: Yeah, I'll I'm happy to stay in chat, and also, if

717
01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:34.679
max: I don't want to take anyone's time. But if there's any like parents who want to have a quick like parent chat, which is a sub problem I would love. I would be very so. I would love to hear

718
01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.700
max: any advice or thoughts.
