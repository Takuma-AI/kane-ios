### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Dan: I want to make sure this is conversational. So anytime you guys have questions really jump in. I will say that you know one of the things I remember when I was going through techstars. Neil had other mentors, and they would say things, I would sometimes think, Oh, I want to try that exact method. And I realized over, and they would say, Oh, the world has changed.
- Dan: And you guys know the world has changed. When I started this, Tiktok was not a thing AI was not a thing. But now it's a thing. And so it's important to think about this world as how do I create the mindset or the mental model of how to approach problem solving rather than I'm going to copy the exact tactic. Right?
- Dan: so then we tried a different approach, or try to get them to talk to you on a messenger. And we were using just Facebook messenger and then try to get on a phone call right? Because you're you're just trying to get customers and so in this scenario
