### Frameworks & Methodologies

- David Ambler: and the data shows you like, you know, basically, almost all companies have raised on a safe compared to other choices here. If they're raising less than 2 and a half, I think, as you, as you go above that number. And and really, even as you approach 2 to 2 and a half.

### Key Insights

> "Mike Pestana: They work about the same. But the key differences are one. It's not debt. It's actually a security unto itself that converts into a preferred stock of the company at your price round, and there's no interest, rate, or maturity date on it, so a safe can in theory stay outstanding forever if you never do a price round."

> "Mike Pestana: So a lot of people just close over it. So your lead investor for your seed around may just say, Wow, it's maybe like a $1020,000 safe like, who cares? Let's just close, anyway. It's a small amount of risk. But there are some investors who will say, no, you have to go out and get that signature, and I've never seen a company not close because of a signature on a safe. But I've seen things get delayed, and a delay is is, you know."

> "David Ambler: I will say, even investors, that I work with a lot sometimes mistake kind of what the what the purpose is of a discount versus valuation cap. I always think of a percentage discount is really downside protection, and the valuation cap is really upside protection for the investor. So if you have, you know you were going to do a round at, you know, 10 million bucks. But, like man, you guys killed it. And now you're going to do a round"

> "David Ambler: at 250, pre. Having to convert having the valuation cap, and there is really kind of protection from them from that runaway upside versus the percentage discount like. No matter what happens, they're always getting a discount. Let's just say it goes down from what their expectations are. They're still getting a discount relative to the seed investors, because they obviously took on more risk. So the valuation cap is sometimes, you'll see, saves that. Just say."

> "David Ambler: and we've modeled this before for companies in terms of like what's beneficial. The reality is like there's always going to be triggers that change the result that you don't know. Like, for instance, the post money safe, you know, if the round option pool size is 10% versus 15% has a massive change"
