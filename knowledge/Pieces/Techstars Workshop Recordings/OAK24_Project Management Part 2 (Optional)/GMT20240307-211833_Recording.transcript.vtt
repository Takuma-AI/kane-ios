WEBVTT

1
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So send canva, send other invites any other steps. or is it onboarding really inviting them to all these systems?

2
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.689
Valeria Brenner: The onboarding is inviting them to all these system systems and then walking them through the to do list I have for them. And yeah.

3
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.810
Valeria Brenner: okay, so it's like.

4
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.810
Valeria Brenner: by the way, I do typically with my answer in terms, it's asynchronous where, like they have their to do list. And they come to me for questions.

5
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:44.760
Valeria Brenner: And then, like we have like a standup weekly meeting where I kind of check in, give them progress like. And I give them feedback and like move

6
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:55.540
Valeria Brenner: the internship in the. So I'm gonna stop here. I think you see where this is going. But I want to go to another to do on your list. But before that. Just so, you know right here

7
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:04.059
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what I would do if I were you is I would write this out in excruciating detail. and the reason being is that the test for you needs to be?

8
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:13.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If someone else had to step in on my behalf to do this because something comes up in my life that's important to deal with, either for my business or for myself personally.

9
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.630
Valeria Brenner: would I be preparing someone else to do this effectively?

10
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.530
Valeria Brenner: Right? So the more you do that level of documentation

11
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as you start to scope out your work.

12
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:37.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the more you develop the breadcrumbs and the framework for a stronger overall organizational system for documenting you. All's responsibilities and steps. And the more you realize as CEO,

13
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how little of this you need to be doing as you start to grow in scale.

14
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.580
Valeria Brenner: Yeah.

15
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so it becomes a game of how can I do start doing less? I can free myself up more to do some of the important strategic work. I need to be doing.

16
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Bob.

17
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.439
Bob Van Dell: Thanks, man.

18
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.419
Bob Van Dell: I wanna play a little bit of a contrarian or devil's advocate.

19
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.270
Bob Van Dell: Yeah.

20
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.850
Bob Van Dell: the one of the things I've read and kind of internalize over.

21
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:17.410
Bob Van Dell: I don't remember where it was exactly was the idea of using things like user stories. If folks are familiar with what a user story is as a evocative document.

22
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.880
Bob Van Dell: as opposed to getting really detailed and

23
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:44.190
Bob Van Dell: robust, and and flushing out things as if you know, somebody who wasn't there could pick it up. But it would depend on folks having been part of a conversation, and then, whatever you put it into whether it's base camp or J, or whatever this evocative documents purposes to evoke memories of what had happened in the conversation. Those additional details. But.

24
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.479
Bob Van Dell: It

25
00:02:45.500 --> 00:03:09.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: depends on specific environments for that to be a value. Add keystrokes, maybe. But just a potential alternative. But you do have to have a lot of things set up to make it work. But I've seen it work pretty well. I have to. Yeah, I agree with you. So I don't know if that's contrarian, I think that's additive. Right? So this isn't what I'm demonstrating. Here is one way to think about it, not the only way. Right? So I'm with you on that, David.

26
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.799
David Akinyemi (he/him): Yeah, II guess. Question around, how do you see the overall to do list? Changing as she goes into this detail?

27
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:36.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  David, let me show you at the end of this one with this example for thrift ship, because I will hold me to it. If I forget. Please remind me, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna share my screen at the end of hilarious demo here, and I'll show you what I would do next

28
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with this to-do list.

29
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.540
David Akinyemi (he/him): Thanks.

30
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.240
Valeria Brenner: Cool. Part of

31
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:56.529
Pardo Walter: yeah. I just wanted to add, I love that the origin of a lot of your feedback and like structuring originates from like a computer science engineering background, because it deeply resonates with me. And it just makes me digest all of the instructions and the information so much more quickly.

32
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.520
Pardo Walter: Pardo, have you heard of the peanut butter and jelly exercise? I have not

33
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:14.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: okay. Got it real quick. So this is where it came from now. Just so, you know. So one, Jason 3 taught me this technique a long time ago, because this is how he thinks and makes us to do using his own company base camp. But also

34
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I taught programming for years. And one of the things that I taught the kids

35
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

36
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:31.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if you know what I'm talking about now, so if you have anybody do this, so any of you all, if you think like, right now in your head, think in your head. How do you make a peanut butter and jelly

37
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.770
Pardo Walter: right?

38
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:47.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then, if I have. If I gave you a piece of paper and a pen, and I had you write down the steps to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you'd probably say, like, you need to get some bread. You need to get some peanut butter. You need to get some jelly, and then you need to put it all on a sandwich and eat it right or have it.

39
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But there's so many other steps that go into it. If you're teaching, let's say a computer

40
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or a robot how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

41
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.790
Pardo Walter: They need to understand the construct of a knife.

42
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:11.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They need to understand where the refrigerator is if the jelly's in there, if it's somewhere else, if the peanut button. So the implications and the detail around how to make the sandwich color the context.

43
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.720
Pardo Walter: Absolutely. That's kind of where I got it from. Yeah, very much appreciated. Thank you.

44
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Man, no problem. Antonio.

45
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:28.390
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: we have 2 questions. The first one. So this is doing much greater level detail details that what I did and I and I like it.

46
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:53.380
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: II was wondering, as we go through these level of details I would like to replicate the same thing for my team, right? So I would like to assign team members to each of these tasks, so should can I. Can I reconcile the 2 list in one list instead of having the CEO list? And then the team list, my friend, we have only just begun. That is the whole point of this. We're starting with you all the Ceos, because you all are at the top

47
00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:00.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of the chain right now, when it comes to what work needs to be done. But I'm going to show you what it looks like to disseminate it to the rest of your team.

48
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because now that Valeria has all these granular to do hopefully across all the ones that we're looking at. But we just did one example.

49
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:27.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What she will be able to do is instead of she goes. Oh, well, actually, maybe I don't need to do this. Maybe there's an intern already amongst the ones that I'm bringing on that has already demonstrated a high level of potential and capacity, and maybe I can have a quick chat with them, send them these tasks and say, Hey, I sent you some to dos.

50
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:40.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I put in a lot of really detailed instructions on what to do. I could really use your help because I have another really important thing to take care of today. Any chance you could knock this out. Let me know if you have any clarifying questions. and then she could have one of her interns on board the rest of her interns

51
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and save yourself a half a day.

52
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:51.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's the kind of thinking I'm trying to get everyone into the spirit of, because you can do more with less if you take the time to break things down

53
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so that other people can share the load with you.

54
00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:18.729
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah. And the second question I had thank you for that to clarify is. And the second question, just for my mental organization, I like to have different projects going on within the company like software development, hardware development. And then within each of them be very specific. So is it okay to name the group like very short, as projects are going on within the company.

55
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:37.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and that instead of doing like a long description of the group, whereas the more details in the individual tasks within the group. Oh, my friend, yes, yes, of course it is so. The notion here really is that every to do list that I make just so, you know, like no, I would never name a to do list the name of my company.

56
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:51.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm doing this for the sake of everyone, seeing all of this work in the same place right now, for the sake of this exercise. But what I want you to literally understand is that the name of any to do list should be based on a desired outcome.

57
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and the reason you do that is that once you complete the steps on that to do list, you should be able to get rid of the list.

58
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:08.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The most dangerous thing that people have are infinite to-do lists, like big boxes of categories of stuff that you just keep throwing stuff into. But it just stays there forever.

59
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:20.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's no bueno. So what I strongly prefer is to always have a to do list that I create, that I can complete mark done and start anew with a new project or new thing to get done.

60
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:29.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which is why, in base camp the hill charges design so that every to do list you make becomes a dot that you move over the hill.

61
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because once you're at the end you get rid of it, and you add a new.

62
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I'll show you kind of what that looks like in a second, Christy.

63
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.740
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: I'm just so. This is

64
00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:50.719
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: really takes us to the next level, because II feel like we had a to do list we break. I break it down among the team members. But now I'm able to specify.

65
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:58.089
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: like in like deeper details on what gets done, so that it's easier to delegate. So

66
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.410
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: I have a scenario like we. We just sign a new customer.

67
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.950
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Do I mean the the but to do group

68
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:25.069
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: the customer, and then all the different tasks, because it's like invoicing onboarding. All these different things could be a sub task. And so the way the group works can you do sub groups? Or are they just sub to do lists?

69
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:38.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I will make sure that that point is made clear before I send you on the breakout groups, because you're all gonna take a Rev. At this, after I do a few more examples. I got you all right, Valeria. So

70
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:51.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you said that if there was one thing that you got done as thrifship as a company the next week. It's onboarding your interns. Help me understand why, that's the most important thing for your business is success.

71
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.990
Valeria Brenner: I guess it's

72
00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:11.350
Valeria Brenner: hmm good question, I guess. Suppose, like the Jbt. Interviews are up there as well. But like the thing that I'm like most looking forward to is having that additional help with marketing and stuff. And so maybe it's not the most important, but it's the one that I'm most excited for.

73
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:27.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, it was a trick prompt for me just to be clear, because I would argue that you are directionally correct, if not, spot on with your instincts and what you're looking forward to the most, because. having a solid team to work with makes all the difference in the world for so many things.

74
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:33.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's gonna affect a lot of aspects of your business, especially if you make great choices who you want to work with. Right?

75
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:46.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you know, there was a time where you could consider someone like a like. We call them associates. But you know, a lot of people would say that Sophie and Liliana, 4 and a half years ago.

76
00:10:46.210 --> 00:11:03.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or 4 years ago, when we started our first class together for Techstar, Chicago, you could consider them interns. They were in college right? So like in a way, they were interns, but they ended up being some of the most important people that I ended up working with, who are, who felt me do so many great things. There were so many years for so many founders.

77
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:13.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So these people could be that for you and for thriftship right now. So team team team is what it's all about. So I would make a case that that is the most important in some respect.

78
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So not to give you a hard time. But I just thought I'd offer up that that balance.

79
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:24.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But it's curious to hear you say that Jtb. Is important, but if you don't get Jtb. Done like done next week. If you make no progress on it.

80
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:37.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's not the end of the world. It's not ideal cause. You can get a lot of support from us in the next week, especially in person with the founders, but I would say that from a triage standpoint you might have the right instincts on what to prioritize.

81
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.310
Good.

82
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:43.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So give me the second most important task, is it J, Dbd, or something else?

83
00:11:43.190 --> 00:12:09.439
Valeria Brenner: Yeah, the Jptd, but also it's important for them also something that I look forward to like. I had my first one today, and I like was on the call with with Kate afterwards, and I was like smiling from ear to ear because I was like, Oh, like shit. I did like I did fine. But afterwards everything in me was like, I wanna go back in like I wanna message them like to ask more questions.

84
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Jtb, Dd. Interviews. It's like your job beat you done.

85
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.800
Valeria Brenner: It's all good. It happens all the time.

86
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:29.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Make sure to create force diagrams in. J, Btd, yeah, job speed is done. That's cool.

87
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:36.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you see where where I'm going with this, though. So I want to see you scope out one more and maybe maybe we can have the room help.

88
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if it's not complete, 6 Jtvd. Interviews. What is it? Y'all?

89
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What are the steps underneath completing that? You all know this because you're all doing it together?

90
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:54.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Any takers? Are we doing it in the chat. Let me check the chat statement, the timeline and the forces. Right?

91
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.610
Nelson Mitchell: I think that was the 3.

92
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, it's 6 Jtvd. Interviews so like there's a lot to think about.

93
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:09.330
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Well, find, find find the people to interview, I guess, and contact them, schedule it.

94
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.680
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: coordinate with your co-founder to do the interview

95
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.590
Valeria Brenner: and with the text, nurse team.

96
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.570
Valeria Brenner: would that be? Yeah. So

97
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so we're starting with the desired outcome

98
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:32.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right now, what you're saying is the label right? 6 Ktbd interviews. How do we know it's done?

99
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:40.900
Valeria Brenner: So I should have like 10 total. Oh, okay, then that'd be the to do is underneath it. So

100
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.450
Valeria Brenner: of 6

101
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.060
Valeria Brenner: scheduled interviews.

102
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.370
Valeria Brenner: Oh, yeah, it's good.

103
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.020
Valeria Brenner: I guess. 6 completed

104
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.520
Valeria Brenner: course. Diagrams

105
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.460
Valeria Brenner: X.

106
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:08.310
Valeria Brenner: They like.

107
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.460
Valeria Brenner: Send calendar invites for the meetings.

108
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.460
Valeria Brenner: Max.

109
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.790
Valeria Brenner: Okay, Sophie.

110
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.050

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, what do you want to call that

119
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:04.439
Valeria Brenner: 10 customers? And the way I do this on notes is, go on strike

120
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.850
Valeria Brenner: and look at the most recent

121
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.280
Valeria Brenner: payments

Valeria Brenner: that week.

123
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:24.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So so let me let me let me slow us down for a second here, so reach out to 10 customers what you relabeled this as but what I'm hearing you say is.

124
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:31.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you need to like you? Do you have 10 customers, or how many customers do you have that? You're gonna message to get these interviews from?

125
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.150
Valeria Brenner: I would choose 10 customers from this list.

126
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So okay, so choose 10 customers from your, from what list?

Valeria Brenner: From just like, choose 10 customers from recent strike transactions.

128
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:57.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, there we go. Now Jason comes from a recent trip transactions. And then in the in the sub group, we're saying, How do I do that? How do I

129
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.059
Valeria Brenner: go to bed.

130
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  

131
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:09.409
Valeria Brenner: It's almost like we're creating chat. Gp prompts

132
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.080
Valeria Brenner: and pull the customer

133
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.390
Valeria Brenner: ids.

134

Neal Sáles-Griffin: Here we go. And then what do you do?

135
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.750

136
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.010
Valeria Brenner: go to Admin Portal.

137
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.800
Valeria Brenner: see what the customer Id

138
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.160

140
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.329
Valeria Brenner: and then I reach out to those people.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:49.080
Valeria Brenner: got it reach out to them. Yeah, Instagram, using the following prompts.

142
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:57.089
Valeria Brenner: which I actually have on a different notes. App. Because I am not very disorganized. I'm very disorganized.

143
00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.869
Valeria Brenner: Where is it?

144
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're not judging

145
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.380
Valeria Brenner: he

146
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.140
Valeria Brenner: big hi name

147
00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.709
Valeria Brenner:  all this context is making me so happy

148
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.179
Valeria Brenner: and then

149
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.490
Eek.

150
00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:28.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I love this copy. You wrote to introduce yourself to ask the customer to talk to you. This is really good. It's very warm.

151
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:33.399
Valeria Brenner: that is, that's the that's the vibe that the company tries to get bubbly.

152
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay. this is great. So go ahead and click, save

153
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:48.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I won't belabor the point. But like click on one layer up like, click the 6 Jtvd interviews, or, you know whatever? Yeah, that. So now we have this list. 6 Ktbd interviews

154
00:17:49.790 --> 00:18:05.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: have 6 completed fourth diagrams, 6 Jtb, statements. I think there's a lot of cleaning up to do in this list to make it like properly reflect all the steps in a very like clear and concise way. But do you understand what direction we're headed when it comes to the level of specificity and granularity? Excellent.

155
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:22.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So thank you for hearing me appreciate you, Hilaria, for being our our volunteer distributor. Yes, no worries. So we'll do one more example, and then we'll do breakouts real quick, and then, and and make this real for everybody. So who wants to be the final

156
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.209
Valeria Brenner: test subject? Well.

157
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: maybe a different flavor of tasks.

158
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: no way. Oh, oh, Antonio, let's go alright. Let's get it.

159
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We'll do one tap. We'll do one tap. We'll make it quick.

160
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think you're muted

161
00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.799
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: alright. Let me share it

162
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:49.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:56.420
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med:  all right? You guys see this?

164
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yep.

165
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.130
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: okay.

167
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.249
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and yeah, wait. What does that mean?

168
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:19.910
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: What funding you securing? What funding are you securing by March fifteenth the the 20 K.

169
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:28.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, you don't have our money yet. What's happening?

170
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:43.549
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Well, we got a a bit delay delay because of of the we had to convert into an ink from Llc. Yes, yes, that happens. Is that the most important thing to get done in the next week, or there's something else.

171
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.290
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I think the most important is the Jtvd. Interviews.

172
00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So if you don't get 20 K. In the next week. You're fine. Is that what? I'm here?

173
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.239
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I'm fine. Yes, okay, that's good. I mean, we can delay

174
00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:06.429
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: definitely. I want to get. We want to get a Gtpd interview alright, since everyone can relate to these steps. I want to see how you think about it. So click complete. Jtb interviews

175
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and show us what steps do you have in mind?

176
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:19.310
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Okay? So under notes. Click. Nope. okay.

177
00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.199
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: yeah. You see where it says, No, right there. Yup.

178
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then, like you can do numbered or bullet.

179
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:32.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we'll click on the boot the number thing or the bullet thing on the there you go. Click one of those. Yeah.

180
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:38.440
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I'll to. I would say 5 more

181
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.319
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: neurofeedback therapies.

182
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How do you find them, though?

183
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:57.790
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med:  so contact them contact through websites through their websites through their portals. Wait. So you just have a list of them somewhere.

184
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.069
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: We do have a list. We haven't contact all of them.

185
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, got it. So there's so basically in brackets, I would put link to list

186
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:15.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of Nfb therapists like, Go here, go through the list, choose the one like. How do you tell someone to choose which ones from the list?

187
00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? So you have to almost open that up further

188
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:28.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to make it. Can I link this to my Google drive. It's on a Google drive, just anything. Yeah, yeah. You don't have to do right now. All I'm saying is, put a place forward.

189
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:33.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I put a bracket into a link to you know lists of Nfb therapies.

190
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:47.810
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: It is possible to to link my my own personal Google drive correct, I mean, so you can link anything in here for everybody to know if you highlight something. And do I think this works? Can you highlight it and do command K,

191
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.099
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it should be the the link to function. But if you click the link

192
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:58.560
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: icon as well, it should work.

193
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:06.990
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Okay. So then, what's next? So you have the list? Right? You're looking at it. I select, select, select, and call

194
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.079
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: 5 neural feedback

195
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.610
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and a pist.

196
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How do I know which ones to pick.

197
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.399
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: How do I know? What?

198
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How do I know which of the 5 to pick from the list

199
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.320
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I would suggest the first 5?

200
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Why?

201
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:27.900
Hmm!

202
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:44.110
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med:  What do you mean? Why is there an order, or is it just like you can just pick the first 5 and then make the next 5, and if I pick 5, how do I show you that they're the ones that I'm talking to versus the other 10, I see.

203
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.300
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: well.

204
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:57.069
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: we have a list, and we don't know. I mean, we really need to contact all, all of them, because we don't know which one are doing remote neurofiba therapy and which one they're not. So

205
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:06.690
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: so there's some. There's some data refinement with the information you have about them that you need to update. Yeah.

206
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.720
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: remote therapy.

207
00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.210
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med:  because that's the target we're looking for.

208
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:19.090
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And then schedule. Ask? I mean, ask.

209
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.290
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: ask them if they are willing

210
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:29.490
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: willing to interview. And

211
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:52.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: okay, this is a great start. Now, this list is gonna get longer, and there's gonna be more going on. But what I wanna stop and just stay here as we go, is the reason like, if, because it feels almost unnecessary at the stage to be the specific, especially writing it out when you, as the human behind the scenes, trying to execute a startup with so many things going on, could just get this done.

212
00:23:52.270 --> 00:24:01.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll complete 5 Gc. Interviews. I know the steps to take like I can figure this out. I can use my brain and just get it all done, and I'll mark this off. I don't need to like. Lay out all this stuff.

213
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:10.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But what this is affording you is a peace of mind about not having to think anymore about all those things that you eventually need to do.

214
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And again, like I said.

215
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:19.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: things come up all the time for y'all that you don't anticipate, and then important priorities end up falling by the waist high.

216
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's one of the best things in the world to have a team you trust.

217
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:30.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and if you have other people you get to work with. What's cool is that when I have too much going on and I'm trying to get something done.

218
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:41.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll reach out to a team member or to the group and say, Hey, is anyone available for a few hours? Did they actually need some help with something? Someone raises their hand and I go. Hey, here's it to do. I intended to get done, but this came up.

219
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Can you do this for me

220
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:49.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so someone could set you up for success to get these jobs to be done. Interviews done on your team. Antonio should neat if it comes to it.

221
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.780
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, alright.

222
00:24:52.110 --> 00:25:05.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let me do one last thing. So thank you for for demonstrating that one more time. So you're seeing where I'm going with this. There's a lot more to to be done there. But I'm going to go ahead and show you all one last step before we break off into groups to to do this for everybody

223
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:11.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright. So let me go back and share where we're at with the CEO base camp.

224
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let's use their ship. Were you at their ship?

225
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:29.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There we are okay, we're here. So normally, what I would do is the to do itself. I'm gonna just copy this because I'm gonna butcher it.

226
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's put it in the same place. Ceos, right here

227
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: gives me 2 to do list of the same name.

228
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So this is, I think, a new one.

229
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So what I would say is malaria.

230
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:56.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and CEO feels is fully on top of her goals.

231
00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:09.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  week one of tech stars. you know something like that. And then what I would say here

232
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:19.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is, I would end up creating a few other things. So I would make all of these to do that you have with headliners the actual to-dos. And I wouldn't use groups at all.

233
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So complete. Website. Edit.

234
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:28.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What are the technical goals paths that you need to get done by the end of the week bill area.

235
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.329
Valeria Brenner: So wait. Wait. Say that again. Technical cool. So I'm gonna get rid of all this.

236
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.640
Valeria Brenner: Okay? Good. Yeah. I. So

237
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:49.630
Valeria Brenner: with completing the website edits, I started putting it in like, I made it its own group. And then I like started adding, like what to do within that. And so if you go on like the QA. Page like I've already started kind of

238
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:59.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what is success with all things tech by the end of next week at the highest level, is the marketing page.

239
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.710
Valeria Brenner: Okay.

240
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Marking pages shipped

241
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:12.430
Valeria Brenner: is not shipped. Just that Redone refined. I guess it'd be better. Yeah, yeah.

242
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.010
Valeria Brenner: it's related to it.

243
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:20.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So complete website edits is is what we want to say there, okay, what else?

244
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:28.130
Valeria Brenner:  have the test environment for the app, be ready and so start playing with it.

245
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay.

246
00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what else?

247
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.520
Valeria Brenner: Just on a technical level?

248
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, I just wanna know, like, like at the highest level possible.

249
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:50.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What you want to have done, cause I'm about to show you all one other technique for how I organize to do the base camp that I think you'll enjoy for the use base camp or not.

250
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.719
Valeria Brenner: So then I wanna have 10 total jobs to be done. Interviews. Then

251
00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.149
Valeria Brenner: 10 Jtb. Is done by end of next week. Yeah, jbt's actually.

252
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.710
Valeria Brenner: And

253
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.480
Valeria Brenner: that

254
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.140
Valeria Brenner: I guess

255
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.390
Valeria Brenner: I wanna be in the beginnings process of like a uiux redesign.

256
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What does that mean? How do we know it's done?

257
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:29.459
Valeria Brenner: I wanna know, like, how we know it's done. So like complete website edits is a bad name.

258
00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:32.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What? How do we know the website is for complete?

259
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:41.960
Valeria Brenner:  all the stuff in the to do list for website edits is done, which means, and then what happens? So all the stuff is done. And then what's the result?

260
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.330
Valeria Brenner: Result is a. but

261
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:58.210
Valeria Brenner: the website looks different. And so do you when your website is done? Do you ask anyone for feedback wants to chip?

262
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.080
Valeria Brenner: Yeah.

263
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Who

264
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.840
Valeria Brenner: my customers?

265
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:09.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, you want them to give you feedback on your website when you've shipped it? Or is there a middle step? There?

266
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:14.359
Valeria Brenner: There's a middle step. Oh, yeah, the middle step is like talking with my tech co-founder. And then I do

267
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:28.269
Valeria Brenner: one customer who's like, I've developed like a professional friendship with her. And so like, I could send it by her before you go live. Yeah, cause she uses it the website regularly, and she's a customer. And she's a friend.

268
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.520
Valeria Brenner: Emily.

269
00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:30.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: okay.

270
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: ship website, edit ship

271
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: completed

272
00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:41.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: website edits to Emily for feedback.

273
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right?

274
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:55.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's I would say something like that, because now I know, have I done that or not? Because if I haven't done that, I know the website is aren't done. But it's a step past it that guarantees that I've actually completed stuff.

275
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay? So test environment for app is ready. How do we know that one's done

276
00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.099
Valeria Brenner: a if I'm like actually

277
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:25.849
Valeria Brenner: being able to like test the environment. So that means that Max has, like, completed all of the things on his to do list for the last like week. So what step do you take when it's actually done? What do you do in the test environment to test that work. QA. So I guess the end goal of that would be then to have a list of things to give Max feedback on.

278
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:30.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, so send Max list of

279
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: edit

280
00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:36.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or feed, or was it feedback? You said, or, yeah, feedback

281
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the Max list of feedback on

282
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:52.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: test environment? Yeah, there we go. Now, it's ironclad, right cause that implies that the test environment is up because you've already come up with the feedback based on being in it, that you need to send to Matt.

283
00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:58.400
Valeria Brenner: That's how you think about a top level outcome as a CEO when you're scoping out your work.

284
00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right, let's do the last one, and Jtvd interviews.

285
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How do we refine this one?

286
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.420
Valeria Brenner: So I feel like at the point. I should have some. I should do the was it called like

287
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:28.030
Valeria Brenner: conglomerate, the clustered yes, and have my clusters kind of defined. I should kind of get a feel half clusters defined, and then make a an agglomerated, or there was like a word for it, timeline. And what do you do with that information? Once you have those clusters, send it to you guys.

288
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay? So SIM

289
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:37.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Jtvd clustered from 10 interviews to text our team.

290
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:43.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hello. those are th. Those are the types of top level tasks that I like to work with.

291
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:50.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  Alright. So here's what I would do on top of this, though, because I believe we have a thrift ship project that I'm a part of right.

292
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: can I? Can I go here? Is that okay?

293
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:58.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, what did I do? And I'm gonna go here. I'm gonna go to thrift ship

294
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:03.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the project. Yeah, I'm gonna go here and you have to do is in here right?

295
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:12.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is interesting. So watch this, everybody. You got to pay careful attention. The thrush has its own project. We're in CEO, CEO of the top level. Alright.

296
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:14.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We have these 3 to dos.

297
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:21.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Here's what I would do with with these 3 to do. So I'm gonna take this one right here. Ship completed website edit to Emily for feedback.

298
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And now

299
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm going to go to thrift ship.

300
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I'm gonna make a new list. And I'm gonna call that list

301
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: ship complete a website edit samily for feedback.

302
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:42.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Here we are. So and I'm going to copy this location. And I'm going to go back to that original list.

303
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:50.139
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And right here in the note. I'm gonna paste the link to that list.

304
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because here I am, a CEO. I can't do everything all the time.

305
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I'm managing the top level tasks at my company

306
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:09.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? This is for me to make sure it gets done. However, maybe I have interns or other people on my team help me with the rest. So in this project. Actually, let me do one more thing. I'm going to copy this location.

307
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm gonna go down there.

308
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:15.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And for this overall list I can also have a description.

309
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So edit details.

310
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm gonna put a link to my CEO project right here.

311
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:35.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So now I can jump back and forth between this major to do as a CEO, and then the subgroup lists of all the tech steps that need to get taken. But let's give me a couple steps for this. The first 2 steps you need to take.

312
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.240
Valeria Brenner: I categorize and break down the QA. Section

313
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:51.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Q&A section categorize and breakdown. Q&A section. How like would it tell me more?

314
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.639
Valeria Brenner: So? We have like a page for QA.

315
00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:09.440
Valeria Brenner: Marketing website, and so down and make it easier to find things. And I'll just always have to search or scroll. So it'd be like categories would be questions on billing questions on printing labels.

316
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay?

317
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:24.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that that what you're starting to say goes into the notes. But what you started to say there in the beginning, I wrote down is a little bit more detail for that stuff, right? And then you have like another step, too. So all I'm saying is that you're gonna lay out all these steps.

318
00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:35.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You're gonna add more details to these to dos. And then you have this list for someone to do, whether it's you or someone else. And as a CEO, you're monitoring at the top level all of the things that need to get done. And it's linked

319
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:42.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to a separate place where that work is actually going to live and get done. But at the top level you can manage it from here.

320
00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:52.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's how I'm able to jump to a different project with a different set of to-do's that are far more granular than at the top level to to do something track up.

321
00:34:54.409 --> 00:35:08.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So, for example, here with the Ceos, if you wanted to have a lot of fun. If you guys wanted to go crazy. you could track and set up the hill chart across all the companies at once. so you can choose to do list the track. We didn't done anyone but thrift ship.

322
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:21.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  we also. I guess. Yeah, we could have done another one. But the thrift ship is now on the hill chart. and let's just say that, like you're making progress because we just laid out here to do so scoped

323
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:27.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: initial set of goals and to do for week one.

324
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I could notify all y'all, but I won't, because that would be rude.

325
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:42.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but that's the progress that we're making right now for one of the companies when it comes to getting over the hill with scoping out your goals, and to do for tech stars in Base camp.

326
00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But that's where it creates this like kind of cascading system.

327
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:59.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Where, actually, that's that's your other 2. This I'm trying to find my old one at the top. There it is hilarious. Ceos, fully on top of her goals. Are we going to tech stars? Boom! Boom! Boom! Here they are.

328
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's how I would think about it. It's rough and tumble here, but hopefully, I've given you all enough context

329
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:17.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to know how to go do this yourselves for like 1520 min between, you know, we're gonna pair up the companies or create some breakout rooms. But I want you all to all. Give this to go

330
00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in some way, shape or form, where you're breaking down your steps that you wrote in the Space Camp List right now

331
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:30.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then. What we'll do at the end is we'll go back. We'll scan through it. We'll see if a few people had some breakthrough moments, or some people already felt what they had effectively scoped it out.

332
00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:37.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll have a few people volunteer and share, and then we'll we'll wrap up for the day. But any questions before we break into that

333
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.480
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: quick question, Neil.

334
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:48.140
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: What's the difference of the way you lay this out versus just duplicating a to-do list.

335
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:55.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the to do list that I showed you at the top level is in a different project.

336
00:36:55.770 --> 00:37:04.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Then where thrift ship, you know, a subcast would be with the rest of the team. But think of Valeria, and like, let's just say, like a Co. Founder.

337
00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:10.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or someone else that she's working with, where she's trying to scope things out at the highest level. This is what Liliana and I do.

338
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We have a project where she and I are only in.

339
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:27.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and we're kind of coordinating all of the major goals and outcomes that we have for our team to get done. So we lay it out there at the top level. And then we create sub lists in each of the respective projects that our team members are in

340
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to make sure that they're actually getting the specific granular steps done

341
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:46.669
Valeria Brenner: so one of like my big CEO tasks is like, Get my interns on boarded. And then in the base camp project I have with my interns. I have like, and it's linked to that for me to reference. But then all of those like

342
00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.769
Valeria Brenner: things are in there. Okay, exactly.

343
00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:54.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Mark.

344
00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.139
Mark Kirzhner: And what can I do if a my CEO is not in the meeting right now.

345
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if your CEO is what

346
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.490
Mark Kirzhner: not in the meeting.

347
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.929
Mark Kirzhner: so what I can do is I can. Is is the list in here or no?

348
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:20.110
Mark Kirzhner: II have a screenshot of the list. Yeah, the list is, is there. Yeah, definitely. So what I can do is I can copy the list into your project. Okay.

349
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:24.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah. So just have me do that when we start and create the breakouts.

350
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's the what's the name of the project

351
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:29.110
Mark Kirzhner: for you? Yeah.

352
00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:33.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: okay, let me spell it. Oh, I found it. I found it.

353
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm going to copy this into the Cicada project.

354
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.229
Mark Kirzhner: Amazing. Thank you.

355
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Done. It's in there.

356
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All good. Okay? Any other questions.

357
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.029
Andy - Lexir: Sorry, Neil, of the same issue.

358
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Andy. Yeah, I'll see you on the jump.

359
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Happy to do it. Happy to do it. Thank you.

360
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. Sophie, are you here?

361
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.620
Sophie Davis: Yes, I am. Are we ready for breakouts?

362
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:07.530
Sophie Davis: Yes, we are. So we're gonna have any questions about the oh, go ahead. Sorry

363
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you're good.

364
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.460
Sophie Davis: Yeah. We have some questions.

365
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.830
Sophie Davis: Yeah, same thing here. It wasn't in the list.

366
00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, you're not on the list.

367
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.190
Pardo Walter: Why not

368
00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: let me see here

369
00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.980
Sophie Davis: while Neil is doing that? Who else has a question.

370
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.490
Marcel, go ahead.

371
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:56.969
Marisel Polanco: Can you? I didn't. I need the same thing. Is that okay? Yeah. Sorry. I think he's here, but he's under the weather. So I'm gonna like

372
00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.370
Marisel Polanco: they charge.

373
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, Carl, you're not in the CEO group.

374
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:11.049
Pardo Walter: Pulling it up right now, let's see 20 tech stars. Oakland. Part. By Jpm, CEO's

375
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:23.270
Pardo Walter: actually, I am sorry about that. I was looking somewhere else. Yeah, no worries, no worries. You just need to make the list there. Yeah. Got it? Okay? Who was the other one that I needed? All done here.

376
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Marcel? Marcel got it?

377
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. Do we have a gift? Gram list.

378
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.489
Marisel Polanco: Oh, yeah, we do. We do. Okay? So I'll send this over. Yup. I got you. Thank you.

379
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.849
Sophie Davis: Okay. I think we're ready

380
00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:55.309
breakout rooms now. Each person. There's gonna be 3 people in breakout rooms. Each person has about 10 min to speak.

381
00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:08.139
Sophie Davis: Please keep your own time. We'll probably come up short on time, or excuse me. Well, make it make it make it. I would say we we should cut the time down so like make it, I would say, like 5 each

382
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:19.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool. That would be 5 min 5 min per. And then what you also do is each person takes 5 min. You're sharing your screen. You're trying to scope out the task.

383
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:26.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The other 2 folks are helping you along the way they're asking you questions. They're challenging you, and then you rotate

384
00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:33.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but the notion is that we're all trying to build the muscle and get into the exercise of being more specific and granular with what we think are working.

385
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:57.499
Sophie Davis: You one thing to notice, that you may be in a room full of with some bots or AI, not takers, so I'll be reviewing those and removing them from your breakout rooms. Should you want that anyway, I'm creating them now, so you should see a pop up to join breakout rooms.

386
00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Nelson, you should go first. I'm sure you have a lot to add and share

387
00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.670
Nelson Mitchell: alright. That's good.

388
00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:12.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Teach the young folks something.

389
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.489
Nelson Mitchell: Oh, no.

390
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.260
if you

391
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:29.680
Sophie Davis: do, you all see the pop ups so you can. If you don't, you can click the there's but on the bottom. Right? There's 3 horizontal dots, I believe when you click that you see breakout rooms.

392
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.360
Hmm, yeah.

393
00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:37.660
Sophie Davis: Some people see some people don't.

394
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.130
Great.

395
00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.500
Okay, give me 1 s guys, I'm just gonna be

396
00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.290
Sophie Davis: removing the box

397
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I removed to

398
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:02.910
Sophie Davis: Oh, thank you.

399
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think they understood the assignment.

400
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:31.010
Dan Ponomarenko: Everything that I heard today. It's kind of validate the idea that I did everything right.

401
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:42.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That was my goal, I said at the top, I was like, if you're already doing this, this is gonna support and reinforce that you're on the right path. Right? Yeah. Mark, what's up? What do you like, clickup? Then?

402
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:55.099
Mark Kirzhner: Nearly. Is there any way to to move a bunch of tasks to to a specific sub-task, if I have already a bunch of them together.

403
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let me let me show you now I can show everybody

404
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so let me go to your list.

405
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's it's in the. It's in the actual company project, isn't it?

406
00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:08.809
Mark Kirzhner: Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm there right now.

407
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, 1 s. Let me see if I can demonstrate that

408
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:24.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright. So I'll show everybody another cool, base camp hidden feature for those bold enough to try. Let's do this.

409
00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:34.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's see here. Alright, Mark, can you see my screen?

410
00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:35.140
Mark Kirzhner: Yes.

411
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright. So you're you're saying this? Right?

412
00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:45.480
Mark Kirzhner: Yeah. For for instance, all the J, 2 JDVD interview. So at least to move all of them.

413
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.530
Mark Kirzhner: Yeah.

414
00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We like that.

415
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:58.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Click, one hold shift and then click down to where you want, just like a lot of other things in life like text editing.

416
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's pretty cool. It's pretty intuitive.

417
00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then you just drag the whole group.

418
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:08.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's a lot of really cool, like, little tiny attention to detail.

419
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:18.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like, yeah, I don't know if you all notice, like I can do. Like the jump. I can jump to anything here. There's a little command, J. You do command J. You can jump to stuff. It's pretty cool.

420
00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:22.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's a lot of shortcuts, little Easter eggs and stuff.

421
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.640
Mark Kirzhner: Where did you jump or

422
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:33.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: command? J. You can jump to pretty much anything in basis like a quick. It's like spotlight on on a Mac.

423
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, pretty cool.

424
00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:45.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So we're gonna wrap up. But before we do, I'm curious to know, overall for that session you just had with each other. Did anyone have any

425
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: thing to share any quick wins, any

426
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:54.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: valuable insights, anything you want to demonstrate, particularly with particularly, Well, Antonio, and then, Valeria.

427
00:45:55.550 --> 00:46:04.790
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: yeah, just so later, it's on something you said before, which came up also on the on the our group, our yeah. So how to organize the groups

428
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:26.150
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: right? Under, aware, it's much better to do it more actionable. Which is basically, this is the project that I need to be duck that needs to be done rather than by departments like hardware engineer engineering hardware's development. Right? It. It's like, make make those groups actionable. So we can remove them. Once we are done correct.

429
00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:31.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 100%. Yeah, because if you create categories for lists. then it's an infinite list.

430
00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:41.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You can always add stuff to. And I really, really don't like that. Personally, I like marking things done. I like moving on to the next thing that needs to be done

431
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:49.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: rather than this kind of static messy. You know somewhat ambiguous labeling that we often offer buckets into.

432
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:50.820
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Thank you.

433
00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, Kelvin, or actually valerian. Then, Kelvin.

434
00:46:54.670 --> 00:47:17.170
Valeria Brenner: I was just gonna say, like, I'm glad I offered to be a guinea pig cause like experiencing it. Live, help me understand him more. And then, when me and Arthur were in the breakout room together, I was just essentially like rubber, ducking to him, explaining it out loud, and then through that process like it started to make more sense to me, and that ended up being helpful, like. I was glad we did the breakout rooms cause. Then it

435
00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:31.449
Valeria Brenner: kind of just forced us to both try to explain it back and forth to each other. And even though, like maybe, my explanation didn't make that much sense to him like him, explaining it back, made it make more sense to him and me, explaining it back, made it made more sense to me. And so that was, that was, yeah.

436
00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Do you all know what Valeria means by rubber ducking?

437
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:40.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Is that a familiar phrase for some of you? Right. It's another programming term which I'm sure part of would appreciate.

438
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:56.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But rubber duck debugging. I'm all about rubber ducks. It makes a huge difference when programming and also other things. So that's another good noteworthy one. Another principle in programming that this is inspired by is the dry principle.

439
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Dubai. No dry. How to dry up your code.

440
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:13.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Nobody, somebody don't repeat yourself. Heck, yeah, that's exactly right, like, I really don't like. So when II run programs right. But you let's say you do a task

441
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:23.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's something that you'll need to do again. Someday. if you break down all the granular steps now for the task. Even if it's done. you can go back to it and reinstantiate it.

442
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:31.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You can create a new version of the task and go. We did this before already. Here's the recipe. Maybe you need a few tweaks, but this is already it, you know, a templated, if you will.

443
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right, Kelvin.

444
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:45.679
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: Yeah, thank you very much. For the session. There were lots of eye opening things. At at a point. I was wondering whether it is by design that base camp. Do not have

445
00:48:45.760 --> 00:49:00.019
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: time allotted to some of the, because it's just the day. And let's say you have a lot of tax during a particular day, if you want to actually put time frames on it. There are no.

446
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:02.550
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: Oh, okay, okay.

447
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:09.839
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: And I also, E, initially, I was found finding it very hard, because I noticed

448
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:29.190
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: the entries appeared. How you enter it, for instance, if you add something on the fourteenth, and I, you enter another 10 on the 11. But then I discovered you can actually move it up and down. You can reorganize it as you see fit. Yeah, it's really flexible. It's really very nice. Thank you.

449
00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:39.319
Tunde IO: Yeah, thanks, Neil. Was just a quick question around prioritization. Is the current only way to prioritize kind of how you organize it on that kind of

450
00:49:39.320 --> 00:50:00.119
Tunde IO: let's go list. Or is there a way that you can, for instance, mark something as high priority? If that is the thing that's cause. I think initially, when you guys speak into malaria, we're talking about what is the most important thing for you to achieve this. Listen, next week. Is there a way that you can, for instance, mark, something is high priority. So that is the thing that you go to, or do. You just have to kind of organize that on your

451
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:10.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's a great question. So you can do it. I am actually like low key against this affordance. But yes, the answer is, yeah.

452
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:22.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if you go to my assignments in base camp under my stuff, if you click my stuff and you go to my assignments. You have the ability to like, put things up. Next

453
00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:31.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to basically say, this is the high priority for me. So you can do that. I don't actually use it, because I prefer to demonstrate

454
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:39.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: prioritization based on due dates and the labeling of the tasks and lists themselves. But you can most certainly do that

455
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.490
Tunde IO: cool. Thank you.

456
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:47.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yep. cool. So with a couple minutes left, I don't really have much more to say.

457
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:59.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I'm actually more interested if you all have any feedback for me, because I've only done this workshop 3 times. This is my third time doing it. It's still rough, like II like. II stopped to work out the kings and figure out the most effective way to make it

458
00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:09.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: palatable and and meaningful for you all. But at the very least. I hope it was directionally correct in supporting you and helping you think about organizing your work properly, so

459
00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:15.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we can either end a couple of minutes early. If you want to linger and give me some feedback, or have anything to say about it, that'd be awesome.

460
00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:19.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But other than that, I think. Take some time to digest

461
00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:26.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the the new schedule that Liliana laid out, and let us know what questions you have about next week. I guess the last thing I'll say is.

462
00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:32.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm going into the Oakland offices and getting it prepped. It's in Oakland office.

463
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:52.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it's still green, meaning like we're still figuring out a lot of things. So it's fine. It's functional. The Wi-fi works. But there's still a lot of like it's gonna need a lot of love. So we're working on a plan to get you all support on ways to make the office the best it can be. But I'm like getting shipments, and you know, I haven't hiring past Rabbit to build Ikea furniture and stuff like that kind of fun.

464
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

465
00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:58.069
Matthieu Bonnard: cool and help people.

466
00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:03.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll put something to work no problem. Whoever whoever's Andy will activate it.

467
00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:05.310
Matthieu Bonnard: I like those

468
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:16.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, Richelle. And by the way, we're good, we're at time. Y'all so get out of here if you need to get to work. Otherwise, I'm hanging for a little bit until you get tired of me. So. But thank you.

469
00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:18.239
Matthieu Bonnard: I hope it was helpful.

470
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:19.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

471
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:33.660
Rochelle Dai - PairAnything: Yeah. So during the breakout rooms we spent a long time. Doing the whole copy paste the link on the CEO, one versus the company base camp. So it's wanted to repeat again, like the grant, or like, what's the goal there?

472
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:43.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yep, so usually. What you'll have with the team is, you'll have a separate project where they're getting all of the specific work done, and at a high level, either as a CEO or as co-founders.

473
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:55.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You're looking at things at a bird's eye view, because you have a lot of other things that you're also managing like you're not gonna put the to-do that you need, like your early hires, to do in the same place that you're probably running your fundraising process.

474
00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:02.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for example. So I would have a fundraising project to go. I need to raise a million dollars by June of 2024,

475
00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:10.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then I'd have a separate project or I don't know, completing, like, you know, product development

476
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:19.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: work or something like that. So you'd have different spaces for different types of work. And then at the top level, you're trying to manage the project across all those spaces.

477
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:28.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You need almost like a master place to like, oversee everything you have going on, and then sub projects or groups where all their work actually lives. More granular.

478
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:45.499
Pardo Walter: Got it. That's actually how I was trying to model it since that it's quite easy to do it through Jira. But that's how I was trying to model it for base camp using those tags like everyone else has been using. So is that is that ideal, or do you recommend some other format?

479
00:53:46.120 --> 00:54:06.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Iii it is ideal for me, like again, like we're at the we're at the stage now where it's like. Kinda now it's like, choose your own adventure. I see each of you have a different preference for how you want to organize the information. But so long as the system makes sense and has enough, where, when you click through, you get the detail, you need to understand what needs to be done.

480
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:22.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Go crazy, you know. Come up with the structure that works for you. Great, great! And if I'm repeating this stuff that you've already gone through, I missed like the first 45 min ahead of. I don't care meeting this morning, so it's fine. It's not a problem at all. Yeah, II love, but I don't know if you can tell. But I love this stuff.

481
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:34.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, like, this is the closest to programming. I get to get right now, if I don't get to write as much code and build apps as much. So I get to deal with these systems. Yeah, right? Well, that's great to hear. Cool man. Yeah.

482
00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:40.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Barra, I'll stop recording now we've we've wrapped.
