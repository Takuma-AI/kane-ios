## Overview

This comprehensive workshop introduces SF25 founders to the Demo Day format, venue details, and expectations. The session emphasizes Demo Day as a community milestone and networking opportunity rather than a traditional funding event. Through live pitch examples and detailed Q&A, the workshop demonstrates how Techstars' innovative 6-minute format (1-minute pitch + 1-minute video + 4-minute Q&A) maximizes audience engagement while creating valuable video assets for ongoing business use.

## Core Philosophy: Demo Day Reframed

### Demo Day is Just a Day

**Reality Check**:
> "Demo Day is just a day. This isn't the 2010s anymore. You won't be in a huge arena. It will not make or break your business or funding plans while Demo Day is a great opportunity to start a conversation. Checks don't get signed on the table at Demo Day anymore."

**True Value**:
> "The real value comes with this video asset that you're going to get at the end and the conversations that you're able to start... the huge sort of endgame of Demo Day is that you get this really clean, nice video that you can use for customer acquisition and fundraising for months or years to come."

### What Winning Demo Day Looks Like

**NSG's Definition**:
> "Demo day will solve no one's problem with your business, with your investability. There's no aspect of Demo Day that will save you or help you. It will simply be a reflection of where you stand today and how you're doing."

**Winning Metric**:
> "The person who wins Demo Day has the most follow up calls that contribute to their ultimate goal, post Demo Day. So the person who wins Demo Day is the person who's able to leverage it for business progress after the day is over."

## Venue & Event Structure

### Google's Product Launch Venue

**Location**: Google's product launch venue in SF at One Market Plaza
- **Capacity**: Around 200 people
- **Auditorium**: Professional AV setup, full filming capabilities
- **Green Room**: Available for founders to spread out and relax
- **Reception Space**: Two rooftops with city and Bay views, full bar, great food

**Event Timeline**:
- **3-4 PM**: Guest arrival and networking
- **1.5 hours**: Presentations (back-to-back)
- **1+ hour**: Post-event networking with dramatic "NFL entrance" moment for founders

### Guest Management Strategy

**Friends & Family Limitations**:
- 1-2 friends/family per founder (swappable between team members)
- Non-professional invites are limited due to venue capacity
- Professional invites prioritized for business development

**Professional Invitation Strategy**:
> "We are inviting mentors. We are inviting investors, but we really do want to invite the people who are most valuable to you... So we can fill the audience with people who matter to you."

## The Secret Sauce: 6-Minute Format Innovation

### Origins of the Format

**COVID-19 Catalyst**:
> "We had to abruptly within like 5 or 6 weeks pivot to a virtual demo day, right unplanned. And what we learned from that data across all of the techstars demo days and programs is that the attention span when you're looking at an online experience like dropped off dramatically."

**Attention Span Reality**:
> "It was a 10 min pitch, and it was like at 3 min you'd have a dramatic amount of drop off... once we moved back to doing in person demo days and events it that that didn't really change."

### Format Components

**1-Minute Pitch**:
- No slides, spotlight on the founder
- CEO presents (expected)
- Must be extremely well-practiced and clean
- Catch attention immediately

**1-Minute Product Video**:
- Can swap order with pitch (most go pitch-first)
- Reusable asset for landing pages, customer acquisition, fundraising
- Some companies still using Demo Day videos 1.5+ years later

**4-Minute Q&A**:
- Talk show style director's chairs
- EIR joins to lend legitimacy and facilitate conversation
- All questions are scripted (but feel natural)
- Answers should be bullet-pointed, not word-for-word scripted

**Single Slide Background**: QR code and essential business information visible throughout Q&A

### Why This Format Works

**Engagement Benefits**:
> "People are less likely to be on their phones. They're more likely to make it to the end of the presentations, and they're more likely to ask you good questions after the fact compared to the the previous model."

**NSG's Validation**:
> "It's almost hard to believe that it's scripted because the way it comes off is as if you're having a live conversation. Which is a really cool kind of structure that we kind of experiment with and have chiseled down to this."

## Pitch Development Framework

### The 3-Takeaway Rule

**Memory Limitations**:
> "I scheduled a follow up like I super like them. That's literally all I remember. So they had like 8 or 10 points that they wanted to make... but people at Demo Day won't be taking notes at your demo day, and they will only remember, like 3 or 4 things from your whole set."

**Strategic Focus**:
> "What we really want to do with you guys is, make sure that as much as possible. You're focused on like 3, possibly 4 main takeaways and make sure they're the right ones... You have a lot of control in, like what your 3 points are and what people remember."

### Essential Structure Elements

**Big Opening**:
> "You need to get people's attention really, really fast... You're fighting against people's phones. You're fighting about against people's decision on like when to get go to the bathroom."

**Call to Action Requirement**:
> "Please please answer the hard questions, and own up to the hard questions and be forthcoming with challenges that you've had... I will not let any of you get on stage unless you've clearly thought about this."

**Specificity Requirement**:
> "We're looking for strategic investors in Xyz space. Come, chat like you... There's a level of thinking there where you're saying I know exactly who I want on my cap table. I know exactly the kind of expertise I'm seeking out."

### Signal vs. Noise Principle

**Content Discipline**:
> "Everything that doesn't directly contribute to those 3 takeaways for your main audience is bloat, and is a distract distraction, and it's not worth delivery. So 4 great minutes is going to be substantially better than a bloated overdone like badly paced 6 min set."

**Word-Level Precision**:
> "You should be able to go like through your pitch line by line at the end, and every word should be necessary. So you want everything to contribute to your 3 main goals or as like data to support them and make it more memorable."

## EIR Collaboration System

### Selection Process

**EIR Choice**:
> "They pick you a couple of weeks before Demo Day, we sit down and they get to choose the folks that they want to work with. So that way you land with someone who really wants to help you tell the story of your business and and cares about your success."

### Q&A Strategy

**Scripted Conversations**:
> "The questions are scripted but the answer should be as organic and natural as possible, so we suggest most people keep their answer scripts at a higher level, more bullet points versus like scripting out every single word."

**CEO Evaluation Focus**:
> "One of the things that investors tend to look for is, does the CEO seem like the kind of leader that could go the distance with this business? And this is the opportunity to set the stage for for that impression."

## Preparation Requirements & Timeline

### Daily Practice Discipline

**NSG's Formula**:
> "I would recommend, it's like brushing your teeth like you're gonna carve out at least 10 min per day, ideally 30 to minutes to an hour a day. If you do that, that can remain consistent."

**Consequences of Procrastination**:
> "If you don't do that. And you put this off until later. It's gonna take up a disproportionate amount of your days towards the end of program. And you're gonna be really stressed out."

### Success Data Pattern

**Version Control Documentation**:
> "The founders who have the best outcomes and pitches the demo day are the ones that have literally a whole list of version control of all the recorded pitches that they have, that they've been practicing."

### Demo Day Week Requirements

**Final Week Schedule**:
- **Weekend before**: Arrive in SF for final preparation
- **Demo Day morning**: 9 AM full dress rehearsal in Google venue
- **AV Practice**: Microphone and audio system testing
- **Continued Practice**: 1.5 hours additional practice time in venue
- **In-Person Requirement**: Full week presence expected

## Example Analysis: Live Pitch Demonstrations

### Jake (Zest): Cooking Education App

**Pitch Highlights**:
- Clear narrative from customer problem to solution
- Strong metrics: 130K account activations, $0 customer acquisition cost
- Effective positioning: "culinary school if culinary school was cheap, hilarious, and you could do it from your couch"

**Q&A Strategy Analysis**:
- EIR pushed hard on competitive differentiation
- Founder addressed virality concerns directly
- **Revenue Context**: 3-4K MRR (took 6+ months post-Demo Day to close funding)

**Ankur's Critique**:
> "The answers weren't as insightful as I as I've heard him speak about it actually, more recently... I'm actually really glad. The Eir pushed back on a couple of the responses he had, because the Ir, I think was like nailing it actually by being like, okay, other people do this stuff like, what is the further thing?"

### Mercha (Cicada): Music Revenue Platform

**Pitch Strengths**:
- High energy opening with audience singing
- Clear problem statement: musicians earn only $20K/year despite Taylor Swift's billion-dollar success
- Seamless transition from pitch to product demo

**Video Execution**:
- Perfect narrative continuation from pitch
- Demonstrated multiple revenue streams clearly
- Maintained consistent tone throughout presentation

**Ankur's Assessment**:
> "No fat on any word, any sentence that's great... there's a clear narrative like his words ended exactly where the product picked up like the product video picked up."

**Carlo's Counter-Perspective**:
> "I thought Jake's 1 was a lot more precise, like everything that was being shown in the app was related to like a customer problem. I felt like this. One was more of like a there's a whole lot of features that we have."

### Burhan (Rhonda AI): AI Dental Receptionist

**Pitch Excellence**:
- Personal story opening: co-founder's father's dental practice
- Specific problem quantification: 30% missed calls, $40K receptionist salaries
- Live product demonstration: unscripted, unedited AI conversation

**Revenue Traction**:
- Pivoted during Techstars (month 1)
- 6-7 weeks to build and deploy with first customer
- 5 clinics signed, $36K ARR, $7.8M pipeline

**Audience Education**:
> "I think he absolutely murders it on customer education, or like audience education about sort of enterprise structures that people might not be familiar about. I knew nothing about Dsos until they started doing this."

**Funding Reality Check**:
> "Despite having really quick, impressive product development, all of that, he actually didn't close, and he had to sit down sign more customers get his Mrr up, and then was ultimately able to close a couple of months ago."

### Snow (Runbear): AI Integration Platform

**Strategic Number Omission**:
- Mentioned customer growth (15 to 66 companies)
- Listed impressive customers (BCG, Laser Away)
- **Deliberately omitted ARR/MRR figures**

**Andrew's Observation**:
> "I don't know if I missed it, but I didn't hear a lot of numbers. Did he give his AR, Mr. Or anything."

**Strategic Effect**:
> "Makes me curious. Right? Gives you a reason to want to go talk to him."

## Production and Asset Development

### Video Creation Guidelines

**Professional Standards**:
> "We recommend you take a much more professional approach than like simple screen recording, if you can. So yes, this basically becomes a product demo video for you."

**Voice Quality Requirements**:
> "Please do not use AI voices. It is like a cheese grater on the audience's ears... AI is great. But you don't want to subject an audience to that at at this moment."

**Storyboard Process**:
- Dedicated session for each company to present video concepts
- Peer and mentor feedback on narrative structure
- Balance between aspirational vision and current capabilities

### Alumni Support Network

**Resource Access**:
> "Once you find a kind of model that you like, you can reach out to alumni who've had similar models, and you can be like, who is your animator? Who I really liked this? Who did this part?"

## Storytelling and Emotional Impact

### The GiveForward Legend

**Historical Context**: First-ever Accelerate Labs Demo Day (pre-Techstars acquisition)

**The Setup**: Nervous customer (Jessica) briefly introduces herself, runs off stage

**Desiree's Narrative**:
> "Jessica was born with some sort of birth defect. She's had a ton of health issues all over her life, including a heart transplant... Her whole family went in for testing, and thankfully. Her sister was a match, and was willing to donate a kidney to save her sister."

**The Crisis**: Family couldn't afford $35,000 surgery, insurance wouldn't cover it

**The Solution**: GiveForward's medical crowdfunding raised money in under 2 weeks

**The Impact**: 
> "Everyone was like holy shit, she'd be dead, but that would get forward like, what are they doing? This is killer like she's there on stage because of get forward."

**NSG's Reflection**:
> "By far the most memorable one of all time. Still, to this day, because she had this person like clearly, who needed help and and wasn't comfortable, and then found a way to get on stage and basically say, like, Look what I'm about to talk to you about enabled this person's life to continue."

### Modern Application

**Emotional Framework**:
> "Even if you're not literally saving lives, you can find a way to pull on this strategy and make yourself memorable through human stories and focus on like the emotion in your jobs to be done."

## Readiness and Approval Process

### Demonstration Requirements

**NSG's Standards**:
> "There are approval mechanisms for your readiness for Demo Day. and it's more of a privilege than it is the right to be on stage. So you have to earn your slot and your spot by being prepared and demonstrating that you are prepared."

**Quality Gate**:
> "We won't put you on stage if it's gonna make you look bad... If your business isn't ready. There have been situations where companies haven't presented."

### Feedback and Iteration Process

**Basecamp Video Chain**: Collaborative feedback system for pitch videos
**Alumni Mentorship**: Access to previous cohort members for guidance
**Multiple Perspectives**: Team, mentors, EIRs, and pitch professionals provide input

## Anti-Patterns and Common Mistakes

### Pitch Competition Mentality

**Rubric Reality**:
> "Try to ask for a rubric. And like, See, are they judging based on like the best business best presentation skills? They rarely know what they're judging based off of, and it tends to be like a vibe based thing."

**NSG's Judge Experience**:
> "It's never the rubric. It's never like whatever they say the criteria is. It's, however, the people the judges feel about the companies afterwards when they have that debate and conversation."

### Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Narrative Lock-In**:
> "Once they start with a pitch, or like a certain narrative, they can't switch it up, and that that puts them in a bad spot."

**Early Experimentation Value**:
> "I definitely definitely recommend you working on this sooner than later... You kind of get locked in or settled into what you're used to, what you're getting comfortable with rather than running a few experiments."

## Networking and Follow-Up Strategy

### In-Person Only Policy

**No Streaming Rationale**:
> "The reason we do the video that you guys distribute after instead of the streaming is because that forces people to get in touch with you. If they're interested, they need to contact you to get access to your video."

**Connection Creation**:
> "You'll like, have their contact details, and it forces a follow up where there wouldn't otherwise be one."

### Post-Event Protocol

**Attendee Information**:
> "We will make sure afterwards, you know, who was in the room, and then who we think you should follow up with as well if you didn't get a chance to speak to somebody."

**Follow-Up Assets**: Professional video recordings and networking contact information provided

## Success Metrics and Expectations

### Realistic Outcome Framework

**Not a Fundraising Event**:
> "Demo day is not a fundraising event... It's some nice visibility, but you need to have the strong business foundation. You need to have a really tailored pipeline like the whole idea of. Oh, like Demo Day is gonna close. My round is just not correct."

**True Success Indicators**:
- Quality follow-up conversations aligned with business goals
- Video asset utilization for ongoing business development
- Network expansion and strategic relationship development
- Improved founder confidence and presentation skills

### Long-Term Asset Value

**Ongoing Utilization**:
> "There are companies who graduated a year year and a half ago, who still have their Demo Day product videos on their landing pages. To this day."

**Versatile Applications**: Customer acquisition, fundraising materials, website assets, sales tools

This comprehensive Demo Day format walkthrough establishes clear expectations while emphasizing preparation, authenticity, and strategic thinking. The session demonstrates how Techstars' innovative format balances entertainment value with substantive business communication, creating valuable assets that extend far beyond the single Demo Day event.
