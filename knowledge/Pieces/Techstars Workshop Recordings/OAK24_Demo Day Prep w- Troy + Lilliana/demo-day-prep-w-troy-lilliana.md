## Overview

This foundational workshop launches Demo Day preparation season, providing Troy Henikoff's proven methodology for creating compelling presentations. Troy shares his framework developed from years of coaching Techstars companies, emphasizing story structure, signal vs. noise principles, and strategic networking. The session includes analysis of a legendary 8-minute Routific demo day pitch and live pitch practice with real-time feedback.

## Key Themes

1. **Goal-Driven Presentation Design**: Every element must serve a specific objective aligned with desired outcomes
2. **Signal vs. Noise Excellence**: Eliminate all filler - every word must earn its place
3. **Story-First Development**: Structure beats slides - narrative coherence creates memorable impact
4. **Strategic Networking Approach**: Demo Day success measured by follow-up meetings scheduled within 48 hours
5. **Low-Fidelity Prototyping**: Start with objectives and black text, refine story before beautification

## The Fundamental Demo Day Strategy

### Redefining Success Metrics

Troy establishes the core measurement for Demo Day effectiveness:

> "If you think of Demo Day as a game, the company that gets the most meeting scheduled in the next 48 hours, 48 hours from now, the company that has the most follow-up meeting scheduled is the company that won demo day."

**Success requires planning for**:
- How you deliver your pitch, video, and interview
- Strategic room networking during cocktail hour
- Coordinated team effort to help each other

### The Collaborative Advantage

> "If all of you cumulatively say we're going to help each other. So when someone says, Oh, I really liked, what was that company that was doing that AI thing that was with the camera and like, Oh, let me introduce you to them... you're all going to get more meetings."

**The networking multiplier effect**: 24 companies helping each other creates exponentially more opportunities than individual efforts.

## Visual Distinction Strategy

### The Color Coordination System

Troy emphasizes a practical but crucial detail:

> "Someone should pick royal blue. Someone else should pick neon yellow. Someone else should put red someone else, so that it's easy for the investors to both remember the colors and what they saw on stage, and who they want to talk to, and they can spot you in the crowd."

**Chicago implementation**: Companies signed up on Google sheets for T-shirt colors to ensure no overlap.

**Lilliana's flexibility note**: "If you're the person on stage, what some founders have shared is like they feel more comfortable dressing more fancy like they wanna wear a suit, or they wanna wear a dress. Have your team wear the T-shirt... or have the T-shirt under your suit jacket."

### The Growth Geeks Example

> "I'll never forget when growth geeks, which was a growth hacking company they had like these bright pink shirts. And he's like, Yeah, we got the bright pink. We're the easiest to spot. We're the growth hackers like standing out is important, cause you have to stand out from the crowd."

## Presentation Objectives Framework

### Goal Clarity Across Different Pitch Types

**Elevator Pitch Goal**: "To intrigue them to get them interested to get the next meeting, to get them to say, Hey, can we talk about this more."

**VC Pitch Goal**: "If it's your first pitch, it's to get the next meeting again, because, you know, nobody writes a check after one meeting."

**Demo Day Goal**: Generate maximum follow-up meetings within 48 hours.

### Understanding Pitch Competition Dynamics

Troy's critical insight about judging criteria:

> "Pitch competitions do a crappy job of this, too, because I'm a judge at a lot of these, and I'll show up, and I'll be asked to be a judge on first thing I do in the meeting ahead of time, like, how are we judging them? They're like, I don't know. The best pitch wins."

**The strategic question**: "What is the criteria? What is the rubric? Because if you don't know the rules of the game, you can't win the game."

## Three-Part Demo Day Structure Strategy

### Component Objectives (Flexible Ordering)

**1. Verbal Pitch (1 minute, no slides)**
- Goal example: "Get their attention and convey how big this market is and why I am amazingly fit to be the CEO"

**2. Product Video (1 minute)**
- Goal example: "Give them context. Make them believe this is the best product in this market. Here are the 3 reasons why."

**3. Q&A with EIR (4+ minutes)**
- Goal example: "Sell into objections that I've been getting when I talk to mentors and investors"

### Pre-Coordinated Q&A Strategy

Troy reveals the coaching approach:

> "You get to, with the EIR, think you know this but your mentor, and you will coordinate. What are the questions to be asked? And so, if you need to sell into market size, you're going to have your mentor ask, hey? You know this doesn't feel like a very big market. Why should I be interested in this?"

**Strategic sequence**:
1. Address common objections systematically
2. End with call-to-action question
3. Create opportunity for direct investor engagement

## The Story Structure Methodology

### The Power of Narrative Logic

Troy's process for ensuring coherent storytelling:

> "When I review pitch decks for people, I will first just write down the objectives of every slide, and it's like an outline of a story, and it better make sense."

**Bad example**: "Big opening great market. Go to market strategy, big market. We're gonna sell a lot... you are bouncing back and forth. It makes no sense."

**Good approach**: Smooth, logical flow where each section builds on the previous.

### Opening and Closing Connections

> "If you tie the beginning, the big opening to the ending and tie it up in a bow, or you refer back to it. It just makes it feel really cohesive. Think about those movies where the opening scene ties to the closing scene. And you're like, oh, that's how it all fits together."

## The Three-Point Maximum Rule

### Cognitive Load Management

Troy's daughter test methodology:

> "When most people think about creating a deck, they put everything in. I am going to put everything in... And the problem is that your audience doesn't have the attention to remember or the ability to remember 10 things... My daughter loved demo days, and when we were practicing for demo days and stuff, she said, what companies did you hear? What, what did they talk about? And if they talked about 10 things I'd only remember 3 of them, but they might not be the right 3."

**The solution**: "Only give me the 3 that are the most important."

**Decision framework**: "What are the 3 points that if they believe these 3 things they're going to want the next meeting."

## Signal vs. Noise Principle

### The Radio Tuning Metaphor

> "In the old days car stereos used to have a little dial, and you would turn the dial to tune the frequency, and it would be staticky. And then you start hearing a little music, a little music, and when you got it right in the center. The most part you had the most music and the least static. That was signal versus noise."

**Application to pitching**:
- All signal, no noise across all components
- No filler words or unnecessary content
- Punchy content over time-filling

> "If you only have. If you have 8 min to give your pitch, and you only have 6 min worth of content. Make it 6 min worth of punchy content. Do not have extra words. Do not have Filler."

## Low-Fidelity Prototyping Process

### The Black Text, White Background Method

Troy's slide development methodology:

> "Every slide starts with black text on a white background. No special fonts, no special images, just black text and a white background, and each slide at the bottom of it, we typically use the notes section of a slide had the word objective, and what the objective of that slide is."

**Rules**:
- One objective per slide maximum
- No slide without clear objective
- Story logic must flow through objectives alone

### Avoiding Frankenstein Pitches

> "The worst thing you can do is take a bunch of slides you've already built. Say, I want to get this cool pie chart. I want to get this cool bar graph... and you put them together, and you have what I call a Frankenstein pitch. You have the head from one the body from another. It's horrible."

**The alternative**: Build story structure first, then find supporting visuals.

## Memory and Performance Psychology

### The Objective-Based Approach vs. Memorization

Troy's teaching on avoiding the "3-year-old ABCs" problem:

> "The people who try to memorize every single word get stuck... what happened was the same thing that happens to a 3 year old doing the ABCs. They get stuck. They're like A, BCDE, FGH, [pause] a, BCDE, FGHI, HI, and they keep rewinding and starting over again."

**The solution**: "Having a series of objectives. I got to talk about the market size. I got to talk about customer acquisition... You don't have to memorize every single word."

### Stress-Testing Performance

Chicago L train practice story:

> "One of the teams was practicing... they went on public transportation on the Chicago L. They were like on the red line or something, and they had people like just a train full of car, a car full car full of people, a train car full of people, and just started giving their pitch... if you can give your pitch on a moving train car with people you don't know and people heckling you. You've got it down."

## The Routific Case Study Analysis

### The Master Class in Execution

Troy presents Mark from Routific as the gold standard, emphasizing the transformation:

> "Mark, who is the CEO here... is a total nerdy, introverted technologist. He was scared to death of getting on stage. He was on the main stage at the House of Blues in Chicago with 500 people in the audience. He did an amazing job."

### Key Success Elements Demonstrated

**Opening Strategy**: "Have you ever seen a UPS truck make a left hand turn?... Well, let me tell you that's bullshit."

**Personal Story Integration**: Moving from industry myth to personal founder story seamlessly.

**Show Don't Tell Execution**: 
> "There are almost 0 words on this deck, and you will see that the deck. The images are reinforcing what his words are. They are not duplicating."

**Emotional Resonance**: Customer story of Alex at Local Libations - specific, relatable, outcome-focused.

### The Development Process

> "We followed the path that I showed you. We started with black text on a white background slide. Everyone had an objective. We refined it, refined it, refined it. That process of refined. I met with him every day for 30 days."

**Practice intensity**: "He practiced it and practiced it to the point where it was just he could have done it. Standing on his head. He could have done it on the L. Train."

## Adaptation to New Demo Day Format

### Troy's Format Evolution Journey

Initial skepticism about Neal's innovation:

> "Neil told me he was going to do this new format like I don't know. 3 years ago, 4 years ago, whatever it was, and I was so skeptical, and I went to that demo day, and I sat in the audience, and I was like... I walked away thinking, wow! That was pretty good."

### Audience Engagement Benefits

> "With the mix up of a personal message that's delivered with no notes and no slides... 1 min. Boom, Demo. Oh, that's cool. Then I got a bunch of questions in my head as the audience member. So boom! A bunch of those questions get answered in this format with the EIR, and then I go to the next one it because of the variation it made it so much easier to sit through and to watch."

**Lilliana's data support**: Virtual demo days showed people stopped watching traditional 10-minute pitches at 2-3 minutes. New format maintains engagement throughout entire event.

## Practical Implementation Timeline

### Immediate Action Steps

**Tonight/Tomorrow**: 
1. Define big picture objectives for each component
2. Create low-fidelity prototype with objectives
3. Begin story structure development

### Daily Practice Protocol

> "You should be trying to get that kind of input every single day for the next 30 days. Anytime you have opportunity to to get someone to give you feedback on the pitch, you should be doing it."

### Managing Feedback Complexity

**The Mentor Whiplash Problem**:
> "You're gonna get mentor whiplash. You'll have some people tell you to turn left. Some people tell you to turn right... it's your job to not just say, Okay, I should turn left. But to say, Why do you think I should turn left?"

**Solution**: Understand reasoning behind feedback, maintain consistent thread.

## Live Practice Session Insights

### Mircea (Cicada) Case Study

**Opening strength**: "The average US Musician makes less than $20,000 per year in total income. And yet Taylor Swift earned over 1 billion dollars on her latest tour."

**Troy's feedback on overcrowding**:
> "You tried to stuff too much. Oh, and we did this, and we did that. And we did this. What were the 3 points you were trying to make."

**Recommended restructure**:
> "Musicians are musicians because they love to make music, not because they're good businesspeople. That's why they hire managers. The problem is, the managers don't know what to do... Cicada partners with managers to help managers do their job better."

### The Movie Trailer Principle

> "You don't need to tell the whole story... You want people to walk away from that conversation... being like, I want to learn more. If you've told me everything, I don't need to learn more... you want them literally to be like, show me the demo I want to see how this thing works."

## Strategic Books and Resources

### Made to Stick Recommendation

> "There's a really great book called Made to Stick. It was a New York Times bestseller about 10 years ago it was Orange, with duct tape on the cover. It's written by the Heath Brothers... I would strongly recommend get a copy of made to stick and read through it."

**Why it matters**: "They talk about how, when you tell a story, it helps you, it helps your ideas stick with the audience."

### The Emotional Impact Principle

> "People don't remember what you say nearly as much as they remember how you made them feel, and if you have the kind of business that can give people goosebumps when they talk about it. It is incredible... People will remember you."

## Meta-Lessons for Founders

### Consistency Over Perfection

> "What's most important is that you have a single thread through each one of these events... Thread for the pitch, a thread for the video and a thread for the QA. And that it's consistent, sharp, and tight."

### The Art of Conciseness

Samuel Clemens quote application: "I would have written you a shorter letter, only I didn't have the time. It is hard to be concise, and there is an art to it."

### From Nerdy Technologist to Stage Presence

The transformation possibility: Mark's journey from terrified introvert to compelling presenter demonstrates that excellent pitching is learnable through systematic practice and proper methodology.

## Key Takeaways for Implementation

1. **Start with objectives, not content** - Define what you want to achieve before crafting how
2. **Practice the 3-point maximum** - Force prioritization to essential messages only
3. **Build story logic first** - Narrative structure before visual design
4. **Eliminate all noise** - Every word must serve the objective
5. **Plan for networking success** - Demo Day victory happens in follow-up meetings
6. **Coordinate visual distinction** - Stand out through simple color coordination
7. **Stress-test performance** - Practice in difficult conditions builds confidence
8. **Tie beginning to end** - Circular storytelling creates memorable cohesion
9. **Show don't tell** - Demonstrate through examples rather than explanations
10. **Embrace the new format** - Variation maintains audience engagement better than traditional approaches

The workshop establishes that great pitching is systematic craft, not natural talent. Troy's methodology, proven through dozens of successful Techstars companies, provides founders with concrete tools for transforming complex businesses into compelling 6-minute presentations that generate meaningful investor conversations.
