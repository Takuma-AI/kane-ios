WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yeah, I don't know. Alright, so are we ready to talk about, presentations?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Yes, so let me start recording. Okay, guys, so let's see. 2 weeks ago we walked you through the demo day format.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So you guys are all ready and we told you in 2 weeks that we would start prepping. This workshop always marks the start of like our demo day prep season.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Okay.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So after this workshop. It'll be expected that you guys start working on it. What Troy talks about today and Troy is actually gonna come back.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
At least twice for each group to dupe pitch practices with you guys. So he'll want to see a delta in the time between each of those.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So he's super generous for this time. Try always says this for our founders, which I'm very grateful for.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But today we're going to just start from the ground level, like what is even expected, what to Gemma Day pictures look like?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What did they used to look like? What is best practice now? So I'm gonna hit it over to Troy and then we'll pepper in at the end with your objectives.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then we'll pepper in at the end with your objectives, going out of this workshop and what's expected from you in the coming weeks.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Great. Alright, thanks, Olianna. So, so the 1st thing I wanted, I do want to talk about this is I originally created this presentation for the old style demo day pitches and we're going to see one of those old style demo day pitches.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And because I think it sets the bar very high for you. And I think if you understand what it took to create that.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That you will find that it will and if you follow the process when you're creating your 1 min pitch it will be so much easier than what you're going to see in this 8, nine-minute pitch, right?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Because a 1-minute pitch is much, much, much easier. But some of the concepts are still very, very relevant and very, very important.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So think of this as a little bit general and then we'll tie it to what you're doing for demo day here.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So I need to share my screen and sound and video because we're going to have some of that and I will share my screen.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And then I will go into this. Alright. Creating great presentations. So the 1st thing you have to be very clear of is what is the goal of the presentation.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And it is different depending on what you're doing. Right? If you're doing an elevator pitch, what's the goal?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
That was a question.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
He's them.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Get a follow-up meeting or

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Yeah, it's too intrigue them to get them interested to get the next meeting to get them to say, hey, can we talk about this more?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Right? A VC pitch. Well, you may think the goal is to get a check. The goal is usually if it's your 1st pitch, it's to get the next meeting again because, you know, nobody writes a check after one meeting.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Demo day pitch. So what is your goal at demo day? What do you want to achieve?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
How do you know if you had a successful demo day?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You get file meetings.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I guess.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Yeah, it for most of you who are raising money. It's about follow-up meetings and so literally when I would coach the companies at Techstar Chicago.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:10.000
When I was running it, I said, listen, if you think of demo day as a game. The company that gets the most Meeting scheduled in the next 48 h during the next 48 h, 48 h from now, the company that's the most follow-up meeting scheduled is the company that won demo day.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And that means you have to plan for that both in how you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:28.000
How you deliver your pitch in your interview and your demo video. And you got to work the room. Cause that stuff just doesn't happen automatically to use one of my favorite words.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I see some of you laughing. It doesn't happen automatically, right? You gotta really work the room and you've got to make a commitment that you are a demo day.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Yeah, you wanna celebrate, but I got news for you. You can celebrate with your friends the day after.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Demo day when there's networking after the presentations you are working that room and you should each be helping each other.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So when you're talking to potential investors or angels that you know, ask them questions like, hey, which of the companies did you like the best?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Who did you think was the most interesting? And if all of you cumulatively say we're going to help each other so when someone says oh I really like what was that company that was doing that AI thing that was with the camera and like, oh, let me introduce you to him and you'll drag him over and bring him over.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
What about that one with the trading and those bars? That was real. Oh, let me introduce you.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And if you're all working the room and helping each other. You're all gonna get it.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
You're all gonna get more meetings. And so really is important. While we're talking about this, I'll throw something else out there that I don't know if will lay on a covered before not.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But are we gonna we're gonna have all 24 companies pitching at once, correct?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Yes. Followed by.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:59.000
All right, so it's hard. Yeah. So it's hard to stand out. And so one of the things that will make it easier for the investors, if you all Each have a uniform and by uniform I really mean a t-shirt But you know, most people have a t-shirt with a particular color, but you should try to coordinate between you so you don't have 5 teams that all have royal blue

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:15.000
t-shirts. Right? So someone should pick Royal Blue, someone else should pick Neon. Yellow, someone else should put red, someone else so that it's Easy for the investors to both remember the colors and what they saw on stage and who they want to talk to and they can spot you in the crowd.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So literally at Chicago, we used to have a little sign up sheet and everybody would sign up on a little Google sheet of what color their shirts were going to be for demo day.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And I'll never forget when growth geeks, which was a growth hacking company, they had like these bright pink shirts and he's like yeah we got the bright pink we're the easiest to spot where the growth hackers like standing out is important because you have to stand out from the crowd.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So that's a little aside. So demo day pitch.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Cool.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
No, that's it. On that I hadn't shared that with you guys. If you're the person on stage, what some founders have shared is like you guys.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:58.000
If you're the person on stage, what some founders have shared, what some founders have shared is like they feel more comfortable dressing more fancy, like they want to wear a suit or they wanna wear a So like someone should be recognizable or have the t-shirt under your suit jacket or whatever it is.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
This isn't a requirement, but the people that do it, I think it a lot more engagement because you're easily recognizable in this hundreds of people, you know?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Yup, and even if like if I were doing a demo day pitch, I'd be comfortable wearing a t-shirt.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But if I didn't want to wear a t-shirt, I'm 1 wear sport code, I'd wear a sport coat over my very brightly colored t-shirt that matched all of my teammates.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It was distinctive from everybody else. So that would be my style, but you can do it however you want.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So demo day pitch, the goal is. To stand out and to get those next meetings. By the way, pitch competitions.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So many people enter pitch competitions knowing I want to win the 5 grand. I want to win the 20 grand But they failed to ask.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
How is the pitch competition being judged? What is the criteria you're using to pick the winner?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And by the way, pitch competitions do a crappy job of this too, because I'm a judge at a lot of these and I'll show up and I'll be asked to be a judge.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000
The 1st thing I do in the meeting ahead is I'm like, how are we judging them?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They're like, I don't know the best pitch wins. Like best pitch. Does that mean the one that was design the best?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Does that mean the one that has raised the most money already? Does that mean the one that is likely to raise?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Is it the one I want to invest in? Is it the one? That had the best compelling story like you have.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Those of you who are going to be in pitch competitions, I strongly urge you. When you sign up, the 1st thing you should do is communicate with the people running it and saying, what is the criteria?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
What is the rubric? Because if you don't know the rules of the game, you can't win the game.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So, all right, that's pitch competitions. I'm seeing there's a bunch of chat messages and I'm not really keeping up with them because I'm alright, you guys.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
You're good, I got you. Everyone's calling, Yeah. Okay.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So I distracted them, sorry. Oops. So, I'll just put that off to the side then.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Okay, structure for a great pitch. So you know you want to stand out. And you know you want to have the most meetings afterwards.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And the format here is that you're going to give a straight-up pitch. You're going to have a video and you're gonna have an interview.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I suggest that you have a very clear objective. For each of those sections. And you don't have to do them in any particular order.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Usually the interview is 3.rd Usually people open up with their pitch and they say, hey, and now look at a demo.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But you could start with the demo if you need that context and then go into your pitch. In your pitch, In this particular case, doesn't have slides.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
You have one slide that's up behind you, correct?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
During the pitch there, no, there's no side. It'll come up when the EIR goes.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Just block.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
There's just a, there's just a, okay, so it's totally blank. So it's, it's a verbal pitch.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So. But you want to have a really clear objective. What are you trying to do with the pitch part?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
What are you trying to accomplish with the demo part or the video part? And what do you try to accomplish in the interview?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And for example, generically, this isn't specific to any company, but Maybe in the Pitch part, I really want to get their attention.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And I want them to see the potential for how big of a problem this is, how big of a market it is, and why I am amazingly fit to be the CEO of this company and to take it.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Take it to be a giant company. And then in the demo, I want to give that context. I want them to believe that this is the best product in this market.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And here are the 3 reasons why. And then I'm going to use the Q&A. To sell and to many of the objections that I've been getting when I talk to mentors and investors.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:05.000
People say, well, your market's not big enough. So then let's in the Q&A have the person and you get to with the Q&A, I think you know this, Your mentor and you will coordinate what are the questions to be asked.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And so if you need to sell into market size, you're going to have your mentor ask, hey, you know, this doesn't feel like a very big market.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Why should I be interested in this? And then you talk about how big the market is. And then the next objection that you continually get when you're pitching.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And you sell into that objection. And then of course you want to have him give him or her give you a question that allows you to close tightly sell and ask people for input.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Action is for them. So it's really important to be superintentional. Now let's talk about a pitch and again this is a little more generic.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I think it still applies to what you're doing here, but this was designed more for the more traditional demo day pitch.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So you gotta have a big opening. Here's the deal. You've got 10 to 15 seconds to get people's attention or they're on their phones.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So, my strong advice. Is do not open with. Hi, my name's Troy Henakoff.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I'm the managing director of math venture partners and I'm so glad you all came here. Thank you.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I just wasted 15 seconds. They are bored and they're on their phones. So you have to open with something that's gonna get their attention.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:25.000
There are a number of techniques to do this. You could say something surprising that they don't expect.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:41.000
You could talk about a giant problem that's really compelling. You can talk about a big dollar amount a big market there are a lot of different ways to do this But literally we're going to We're gonna go through the slide process.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I know you're not necessarily doing slot. You're not doing slides when you're pitching, but you should still think about it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
In terms of if you had a slide up there. My 1st action and maybe you'll be practicing with little 3 by 5 cards.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
You have an objective and the 1st objective has got to be get their attention.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:07.000
The next thing is that when you're giving a pitch One mistake that many entrepreneurs make is Like I gotta throw everything in here, but the kitchen sink.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I am gonna put everything in. I'm gonna talk about my go to market strategy. I'm gonna talk about my team.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I'm going to talk about customers. I'm gonna talk about unit economics. I'm gonna talk.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And the problem is that your audience doesn't have the attention to remember or the ability to remember 10 things.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And so what would happen, I tell this story, my daughter loved demo days. And when we were practicing for demo days and stuff, she said, what companies did you hear?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
What did they talk about? And if they talked about 10 things, I'd only remember 3 of them.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But they might not be the right 3. Right? Think about it. You have 3 most important ones.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You'd want me to remember when I was at the dinner table telling it. But maybe I remember the 3 least important to you.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And it's very easy to solve for. Only give me the 3 that are the most important. And the way I think about that is if I am able to land, if being if the audience hears that this is a giant market.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000
That I have great margins and I'm already getting traction. Are they gonna be interested? Yeah, maybe that's right.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Again, I use generic terms. The more specific you are, the better. But I wanted it to be particular.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So I want you to be particular. So, you know, for your business, think about what are the 3 points that if they believe these 3 things, they're going to want the next meeting.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And that's what you want to put. You only want to make those 3 points. Please close with the call to action.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
When you do these pitches, the call to action is probably come talk to me. Seek me out.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I wanna meet you. You know, I don't know what the rules are around specifically asking for investment.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I'll let L Lianna and Neil and the team take care of that. And then this one, frankly, I stole from David Cohen.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Show don't tell. To the best that's why we have the video the demo video I can tell you about my great product, that you want, but it's not gonna feel real.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:19.000
One of the biggest reasons for doing the demo video. Is to make it feel real. Literally, that could be.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Your objective of the demo is that they feel that this is a real product with real customers. It's really hard to do that with words.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
What's your idea.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
It's very easy to do that. Video. Huh?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I think we had someone not muted. I got him.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:53.000
All right, so show don't tell. And then this last. Piece is well it's not next last piece of stories or what may make things stick so it's very hard to remember a bunch of facts But it's really easy to remember a story.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
There's a really great book called Made to Stick. It was a New York Times bestseller about 10 years ago.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
It was orange with duct tape on the cover. It's written by the Heath Brothers.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
One of them is the professor at Stanford and the other one. I forgot what he does. It's an awesome book.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And you have time now. You have 30 days till demo day almost. I would strongly recommend Get a copy of Made to Stick.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And breed through it. It's not a textbook, it's fun, it's full of stories, and they talk about how when you tell a story, It helps you, it helps your ideas stick with the audience.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And then I love this quote. Which is people don't remember what you say nearly as much as they remember how you made them feel.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And if you have the kind of business that can give people goose spots when they talk about it. It is incredible.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000
It is really impactful and people will remember you. God, I want to talk to that company that was doing that thing, saving lives.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I want to talk to that company who was doing that thing that, you know. My family would have needed or.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
You know, it's gonna take people out of poverty or whatever the whatever the emotional thing is.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000
If you can get a motion. It's incredibly, incredibly powerful. So. Signal versus noise.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Do we have any engineers in the audience? What does this mean? Signal versus noise.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Getting the most important message out outside of the clutter.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Yeah.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Making it stand out more outside of the clutter. Yeah.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Okay.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Yeah, I'm, I'm gonna very much date myself. But in the old days, car stereos used to have a little dial and you would turn the dial to tune the frequency.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And it will be static. And then you start hearing a little music, a little music, and when you got it right in the center, the most part you had the most music and the least static.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:08.000
That was signal versus noise. When you are talking, when you're giving your pitch, when you are giving your video demo.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:20.000
You want all signal, no noise. This goes for, you know, any kind of pitch you're doing, whether it's a demo day pitch, whether it's a pitch competition, whether it's a VC pitch.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000
This isn't like writing a book report in 8th grade where you need 4 pages so you're going to put a bunch of filler in.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:36.000
If you only have, if you have 8 min to give your pitch and you only have 6 min worth of content, Make it 6 min worth of punchy content.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Do not have extra words. Do not have filler. Hit the 3 big points you want to hit, reinforce them appropriate close with the call to action you're done.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Any excess words, any excess noise will be a distraction. Signal versus noise. That's why I have it in such big font.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000
But the most important thing I said stories are what stick is that you get the story right. And here's my process.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:15.000
For getting the story right. And I would do this for both. Your video, which you're gonna script with potentially slides and maybe video however you're going to do it.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And your pitch itself, your pitch itself, you're not going to actually have slides, but I would think about it as index cards.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000
You will not use the index cards on stage, but when you're 1st practicing, you could have a series of index cards that are like, oh, 1st I want to get their attention.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Next I want to talk about the size of the market. For those things are, And we start when we build a pitch and I'm going to show you a video of a live pitch from Techstar Chicago.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:57.000
They all started with this simple process. Every slide starts with black text on a white background. No special fonts, no special images, just black text on a white background.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Each slide at the bottom of it, we typically use the notes section of a slide, had the word objective and what the objective of that slide is.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
If you don't have an objective for a slide, you should not have it and you should not have more than one objective per slide.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
So we'll go through some examples, but the objective may be. 1st slide maybe get their attention.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Next slide maybe. Show them it's a giant market. The next slide might be show them we have an unfair advantage in customer acquisition.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
The next slide may be we have an amazing team, but each slide has an objective. And this does 2 things for you.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000
One is it helps you tell a story. If you read just the objectives, they should tell a nice logical story.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:51.000
2 is it helps you as the one presenting to know what the objective is? And it's easy to talk to an objective if you have it and you don't have to worry about memorizing every single word.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.000
If I know the purpose of this slide is to talk about how big the market is, I can come up with some words on the fly that talk about how big the market is.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And if I know the purpose of the next slide is talk about a customer acquisition, I know I can come up with those words.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000
I have to memorize every single word. The people who try to memorize every single word. Get stuck.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:22.000
We had one of them who got stuck. At demo day in San Francisco in January. And what happened was the same thing that happens to a three-year-old doing the ABCs.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
They get stuck. They're like, 80, CDFG, h.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:36.000
BCDE, FGHI and they keep rewinding and starting over again because that's the only way they get in the pattern.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.000
You don't want to be that three-year-old on stage. Now the person who did it at demo date played through the audience was supportive.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.000
But it was because she was trying to memorize every word and when she skipped one word the whole rhythm was broken.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
This is why you're much better off. Having a series of objectives. I got to talk about the market size.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I got to talk about customer acquisition. I got to talk about having bullet points basically. By the way, at this level, there are no pictures, no graphs.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000
We're gonna throw out these slides, low fidelity prototype. Like we're gonna, we.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
The worst thing you can do is take a bunch of slides you've already built. Say, I want to get this cool pie chart.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I want to get this cool bar graph. I want to get this. And you put them together and you have what I call a Frankenstein pitch.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:28.000
You have the head from one, the body from another. It's horrible. It really is. And so you don't wanna have a Frankenstein pitch?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:37.000
You want to have a well organized logical pitch.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Yep.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Can I add in here? Try. Is there asking like, we don't have slides, do we?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Well, while you don't have slides for your pitch, you have one slide for your QA.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
This is also relevant when you're building your investor slide deck as well as for this pitch.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:06.000
So I highly recommend you doing this to build your one-minute pitch, whether on a Google Doc or Google Slides, like Troy is saying, like, plan out your objective for each segment of the pitch, there will be multiple segments like 4 or 5 within that 1 min so that you know that you're hitting on each thing.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000
So start with that storyline outline, even though we're not going to have slides, just black text white background so you can click through.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And then you'll always be able to have these anchors when you fill it in with text like Troy is saying.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:28.000
So this is extremely relevant whether you're doing a full pitch deck or not. And it sounds like, There's just another question. Try.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Go ahead.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
And I'm all. Sorry. And I'm also trying to give you more than just how you do this deck.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:42.000
I want you to have a skill of being able to present anywhere, any time. I'm going to be presenting in front of What are we gonna have 4, 500 people, something like that?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
I want you to be comfortable presenting in front of that sized crowd anytime in the future of your life.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And this is kind of my formula for how you do that.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
And then.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Yeah, and even when you think you can, you can't. Cause like Troy saying, like when you see all those people, it's a completely different circumstance than practicing in your room.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Yeah, and like in one of the last tech stars we had in Chicago. One of the teams was practicing.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
So it's really good. If you can give your pitch while you're distracted, you know you can give it anywhere.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:17.000
And so they had their pitch, they had it nailed, and they went on public transportation on the Chicago L.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:36.000
They were like on the red line or something. People like just to train full of car, a car full of people, a train car full of people and just started giving their pitch and then some people who were there were heckling them their pitch and then some people who were there were like heckling them and their teammates were heckling them and their teammates were heckling them and their teammates were heckling them and if you can give your pitch on a moving train car with people you don't

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
know and people heckling you, you've got it down. Alright, the last piece of this is yeah, there is a video of it.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
The last piece of this is that there, it's so important that you create a story.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I'm coming back. 2. The book made to stick. Create a story.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:04.000
So what I will do When I review pitch decks for people. I will 1st just write down the objectives of every slide.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:13.000
And it's like an outline of a story and it better make sense and I can't I just did this last week for someone at Kellogg and literally it was like.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
You know, big opening, great market, go to market strategy, big market. We're gonna sell a lot.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:29.000
I'm like you are bouncing back and forth. It makes no sense, right? Because they went from market to size a market to selling to size a market again.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Like you want to have a smooth flowing story. If you have a smooth flowing story. Everything is going to tie together.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
People are going to remember it. It's going to make logical sense and they're going to like you.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
And the other part about a story, and you're going to see this in the video that you watch in a second.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Is if you tie the beginning the big opening to the ending. And tied up in a bow, or you refer back to it, it just makes it feel really cohesive.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Think about those movies where the opening scene ties to the closing scene and you're like, oh, that's how it all fits together.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Right? So I'll give you some examples. So this is, you know, keynote here I have on the bottom huge objective, huge potential market.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
So I have a title, yep.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Try before you move in here. I think Antonio had a question on the last slide. He's had his hand up for a bit.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Oh, I can't see hands up and stuff.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
No, not. I got you. Let's see, I get.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Oh yes. So just to follow up with the question, what Liana was saying, how can you use this structure for the 1 min pitch?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:40.000
So it sounds like from what you were saying, Okay, We can in a way like build 5 slides like one with a big opening.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:50.000
3 slice for the 3 key takeaways and one slide for the closing, closing thing would be a good preparation to the 1 min pitch having these 5 slides that we can visualize.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And talk off of it.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Yeah. A 100%. I think if I were doing it, I would probably have 5. Or so index cards so that I have them portable and I can just thumb through them because all they're gonna have is on them really is an objective and maybe some bullet points.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
But I would be starting to practice with the index cards, and then I would put the index cards away and be able to deliver it.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:27.000
And if on your index cards, if you're visual like I am, maybe you have a little icon for each one that helps you remember what the objective is or a visual graph or whatever it is but yes you would I would absolutely create a story.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Like this even for your verbal only pitch.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Okay, so This is what it looks like when you're doing it in a DEC. You start out, you can see there in the speaker notes I wrote huge, or objective, huge potential market.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
So my objective, you can convey how big this market is. I put a title on the slide in black text with white background.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And then I'm like, oh, I think I want a bar graph. For the market size from 2,01020, 20, actual projected.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I don't do any more than that. It's only black text on a white background. If by the time I'm done with this, I decide this is what I want, I will probably have changed that.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Oh, I don't want a bar graph. I want to like, I really want a pie chart and I want, no, I want a photograph of someone in the stock exchange and at some point when I nail it.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000
I will then make this slide beautiful. And if I know that what I'm trying to do is show there's a huge potential market.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:46.000
There are a lot of different ways I can show that. But if I'm if I am indeed showing it's a huge potential market, I don't have to worry about how it relates to the other slides because it will because each slide has an objective and if I meet the objective on each slide I've got a great story and it's awesome.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
And so this is what I mean when I say low fidelity prototype. No more than that.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:59.000
By the way, when you get to the next stage, if you're building this for, for instance, you know, a traditional pitch competition or a VC deck.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
When you get to the, do I really want it to be a pie chart? What I would do to make the little fidelity prototype is that go to a whiteboard.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Take 10 seconds and draw a pie chart, take a photo of it off my phone and paste the photo in here.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
I don't want to spend any time dealing with tools and making things fancy until I know, oh, the pie chart doesn't look right.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I think it should be a bar graph. And then I can take a photo of a bar graph that took me 10 seconds to plug it in.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Oh, that's better. That conveys it better. And then once I have that low fidelity prototype and it's right, then you make it look beautiful.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Alright, we're gonna watch a pitch. This is a company that was in Techstar, Chicago, 2,015.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I think it was 15. And I want to tell you. At Mark who is the CEO here.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I want to tell you a little bit more about how we created this. So he is a total Nerdy, introverted, technologist.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:05.000
He was scared to death of getting on stage. He was on the main stage at the House of Blues in Chicago with 500 people in the audience.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:13.000
He did an amazing job. There are 2 key elements to his having done an amazing job. We followed.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000
The path that I showed you, we started with black text on a white background slide. Everyone had an objective.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:30.000
We refined it, refined it, refined it, that process of refined, I met with him every day for 30 days as I did with each of my companies, we put a lot of time into this.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000
And at the end of the process we had an amazing pitch. And he practiced it and practiced it.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
To the point where it was just, he could have done it standing on his head, he could have done it on the L train, he could have done it anywhere.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.000
And you will see his delivery is awesome. There are no extra awards. I want you to pay attention to the elements.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Big opening, how he finishes, how he tells a story. And, I'm gonna just let it play.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
It is much longer than you guys have for this, but I want you to get an idea of what, how good a pitch can be.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:11.000
The one last thing I want you to pay attention to is When most people think about creating a DAC, they put a lot of words on the deck and then they read the audience the words that are on the deck.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:19.000
They're almost 0 words on this stack. And you will see that the DAC, the images are reinforcing.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
What his words are. They are not duplicating. So I'm gonna hit play on this, Lilian.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
If you could just yell over the sound and make sure you can hear the sound, cause I can't see you.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
But if you could just let me know that you can hear the sound when it starts, that would be great.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Okay.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Okay. We can hear it.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Have you ever seen a UPS truck make a left-hand turn? You might have heard that UPS is so obsessed with efficiency that their trucks are forbidden from making left hand turns.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Well, let me tell you that's bullshit My name is Mark, founder of Ratific, and I'm not here to bullshit you.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:12.000
I'm here to tell you a true story of Alex, the CEO of localization. One of the 42 customers currently paying for rotific.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:22.000
They deliver 100,000 bottles of bear across the city of Austin every week. Alex's job is to make sure all his deliveries are on time.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000
And to do this, he used to spend 2 h every morning manually planning his routes with Excel spreadsheets.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Then he and his team zigzagged across town racing to get everything done. While I covered every stop, Alex knew there had to be a more efficient route for his trucks.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:53.000
But he couldn't figure it out. His logistics has become such a bottleneck that Alex was forced to turn down business.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
So how did he solve this? Did he buy more trucks? Nope. Did you avoid left hand turns?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:11.000
No. Alex was smarter than that. He Googled route optimization and found us. Let me show you how rotific changed Alex's world.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:31.000
This morning, Alex took his list of 57 stops and dropped it into ratific. And by the way, with 57 stops You already have 40, quartz or vegetarian possible permutations, each of which represents a delivery schedule for likes.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
The routing problem is considered one of the hardest problems.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
In computer science.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Okay.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Troy, I think we lost your network.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Shall we take a break?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Thank you.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Yeah, I'll be back in a second.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
No.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
That's a lot of permutation. Yeah.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
It was just getting good.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
I know. It is good.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.000
See what he means to the slides like adding on to what he's saying and not like there's almost no text and it's really well done.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Yeah.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
This is a great example. Try shows it's that program.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
But so Lilian, you said that we're not gonna have as lights behind us when we do.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Please.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:44.000
No, this is the old way of doing things. Roy shows this video because it's still a great example for some principles, core principles.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
What happened?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
So you'll see we'll talk about it at the end. But this also you guys might give full-on pitches for investors and so it's still good to be able to Yeah, we lost your network.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
It.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Man, and then I, and then I dialed it man.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
So on the, so you're invisible right now, that's super cool.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Alright.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
There you are.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Well, there we go. We were on the permutations.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Like the Excel.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Alright, do you want, you want me to try again?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Yeah, can you fast forward to where he has like the. The number of permutations.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
That's where.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Yep. Yup. Let me see if I can do that. Alright, I've got a share again.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:40.000
And Make sure I'm sharing with sound, optimized for video.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Have you?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
We can hear it.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Tillion possible permutations, each of which represents a delivery schedule for Alex. The routing problem is considered one of the hardest problems in computer science.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Our proprietary algorithm can churn through these permutations and generate an optimized schedule in seconds.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Next, Alex dispatch those routes directly to his driver's smartphones. We made route optimization that simple.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Show don't tell.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
We helped Alex reclaim 2 h of his work day, which he now spends growing his business.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:30.000
What's more, we cut this driving time and fuel consumption in half. This allowed Alex to serve more customers.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Without buying more trucks or hiring more staff. In fact, Alex tells us that he has now doubled the number of deliveries he makes every single day.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Is that amazing. I get really excited about this. You see, my story started 7 years ago when I wrote my thesis on advanced route optimization algorithms.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:01.000
But instead of publishing papers, I want to apply it to the real world and make real businesses run more efficiently.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
So I assembled a team. A team that is not only strong on product and design with Andre, Stefano and Jonathan.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:22.000
We also have 16 years of sales and marketing experience between Andrew, Suzanne and me. When I was a consultant, I built routing systems for large corporations.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:33.000
And along the way, I learned something interesting about the industry. Let me share it with you. Even though UPS, Fedex and the US.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Postal Service have invested billions of dollars to build route optimization in-house. They only account for 6.5% of the delivery market.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:37:01.000
They have large corporations that can afford to pay consultants to implement enterprise writing software, but even if you take all 300 of the largest fleets in America, they still only account for 18.5% of the market.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:15.000
So what about the rest? These are the 350,000 fleets with 4.5 million trucks on the road and almost all of them are still routed manually.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:23.000
They desperately need route optimization. And rotific is built to meet exactly this need.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Now, in the past, there have been a handful of companies who tried to go after this market.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:37.000
But as soon as they gained any sort of traction, they were immediately acquired by larger enterprises. Their product and team were absorbed.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And their focus shifted up market, leaving behind a big hole. Rightific is the only solution dedicated for the masses.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
These are some of our customers who already cannot live without us.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000
We have a simple revenue model. We charge $39 per vehicle per month. That's nearly $500 a year.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:13.000
All right, customer has 8 vehicles. They pay us almost $4,000 each year. We've learned that the cost us $952 to acquire a customer.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
The acquisition cost is paid back within 4 months.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Now, the only thing we need to do is step on the gas and get the word out. Here's how we go to market.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
We have 3 different approaches for 3 different segments of the market. For small fleets, we rely on SEO and ads.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:43.000
For fleets between 10 and 50 vehicles, the meat of the market, this is where we focus on direct sales and marketing efforts.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:54.000
For larger fleets, we rely on channel partner integrations. Channel partners are awesome. They give us access to large plates and they do the selling for us.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Varnigo is a great example. They've integrated our API into the Vonicle platform and that's how we got national accounts like Goodwill and Habitat for Humanity using every day.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:17.000
In the last couple of months, we've gained a lot of momentum with channel partners, and we're very excited to be partnering up with these brands.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:27.000
And with these 3 approaches, We've grown on average more than 25% every month since the beginning of this year.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:41.000
This is just the start. Of our journey. We're on a mission. To make route optimization accessible to every local delivery business.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:54.000
We are empowering people like Alex to operate just as efficiently as UPS. What we want to do is forbid them from making left-hand turns.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:05.000
My name is Mark. We are atific. Come talk to us if you'd like to geek out on logistics.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Alright. So, hopefully you all have a sense for what a good pitch can look like. I'd love to hear your comments on this uniotific.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
What did you like about it? What did you not like about it? What did you take away from it?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
What did you learn from watching it? Bob.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:33.000
This guy had a fantastic narrative. I feel like He walked me through any potential questions I might have.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And broke down the answers to the questions before even asking them. In a way that talks to multiple different audience types, whether they're data driven or they're more emotional and how they decide.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
And I think his gestures, his hand motions and the way he delivered it, the pacing.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Supported the narrative he was telling and the sequencing very well. I think A plus plus. Yeah.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Yeah, so I want a couple of things I wanna, I wanna. Double down on there is I want to translate this to what you guys are doing.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:14.000
So if this were demoed a pitch, the way you guys are doing it. He would have opened up with the market and the problem.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:32.000
In his verbal pitch, probably told a little story. He probably would have had a video that would have showed how effective it was the trucks zooming around all the couple of those how their MRR is growing, whatever, that little, demo of how it worked.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:39.000
And then in the Q&A, we would have asked him questions that would have let him reveal his unit economics.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And its revenue growth and tied back at some point to the story that he told when he opened. Like you could have executed this whole thing as a pitch 1 min verbal a 1 min video and then 6 min or whatever you have 6, 7 min of QA.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
It wouldn't have been the same, but the ideas are the same. And this is why I wanted to use this.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Valeria, you had your hand up.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Yeah, I was just gonna echo all what Bob said, but then also add on like, you mentioned at the beginning, like tie it all back, close that loop and he did that with the left hand turn.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Yeah.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Like it, it Beautifully finished the story and then ended it on a light hearted note and I just did a really good job.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Yeah, Mal?

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Yes, some related thinking. It's part question. I'm curious when we get down to this 1 min format, cause I think he did exceptional job with cadence.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:41.000
I think it was so smooth. I think it felt really I'm curious in a minute how challenging that becomes to not be too fast, not be too slow, things like that.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Yeah, so I think that the team at Techstars has some videos of people who've done a really good job of it with the 1 min pitches.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
And Lilianna can you will you be able to share some of those from historical ones?

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Okay. Yeah, we already shared them and it sounds like some of you might have missed our session 2 weeks ago, but 2 weeks ago we had like a hour and a half session where we showed about 8 examples.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:13.000
So if you missed that, make sure you go watch the recording of that. It was called demo day format walkthrough very important because we showed you our top ones.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Yeah, and by the way, a couple people have pointed out that Mark did such a good job in his speaking skills.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:28.000
In his pacing. Some things he slowed down for when they're really important other times he talked really fast when he got excited He changed his volume.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000
It makes it so much more interesting for you to follow. And again, I will, I Mark's a great guy.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:44.000
I still stay in touch with him. We email, whatever we talk once every 6 months. He is a total nerdy introverted guy.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Like he is that guy who did his master's thesis on route optimization for real. So.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Anybody can do it if you practice enough. And you have the benefit of only having to practice for the 1 min pitch.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:07.000
The video is gonna run by itself and the Q&A you have to practice your answers, but that's a much easier format because the EIR is gonna be prompting you.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
So, Bob, you have another question.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Yeah, I think it's aligned with what you said in response to my earlier comments, but also with what you just said.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:29.000
I'm a little bit worried about the difference of effectiveness between what I just saw and having a different format where we do have a QA sort of fireside chat style at the end personally.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:37.000
I feel like what I just saw is fantastic and what I would love to have us be able to do From an impact perspective, I don't know if we'll execute as well.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:51.000
But I'm curious what your thoughts are if you have any data that says. The sort of QA format we're going for will or may not be as effective as what we just kind of witnessed.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Trey, do you wanna?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Yeah, so I'll tell you my

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Huh?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Yeah, I was gonna say take it and then I have some data too.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Yeah. I'll give you my take. So Neil 1st told me he was changing the, I am very biased.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
I like the 8 min pitches. There were some tech stars cohorts that in other cities that were doing four-minute pitches.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I didn't think 4 min was enough to get your case across. We had, I believe the Texter, Chicago, we had the best pitches I will put.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Scientific. I've got a dozen other ones that are equally good. I'll put them up against anybody.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:31.000
And Neil told me he was going to do this new format like, I don't know, 3 years ago, 4 years ago, whatever it was.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
And I was so sceptical and I went to that demo day and I sat in the audience and I was like.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:46.000
And, I walked away thinking, wow, that was pretty good. And I'll tell you what I liked about it as someone sitting in the audience.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:59.000
You know, when we used to have 10 pitches in a row. It was hard to keep the attention level to 10 good pitches that were all similar in format, a person speaking, a bunch of slides.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:07.000
You know, then we went to 12 companies. You're gonna have 24 or something like that that are gonna be out there up there on demo day.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000
And it just gets hard to stand out and it's boring to see 24 pitches in a row.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:29.000
But with the mix up of a personal message that's delivered with no notes and no slides like my name is Troy and I'm here because I am so excited about my new company I cannot wait to show you a demo of what we're going to do.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
We are going to take over the world, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 1 min.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Boom, demo. Oh, that's cool. Then I got a bunch of questions in my head as the audience member.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000
So boom, a bunch of those questions get answered in this format with the EIR. And then I go to the next one.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.000
It because of the variation, it made it so much easier to sit through and to watch and I felt like I learned more about the entrepreneurs and what drove them.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000
And so I actually am pretty biased. I like this new format. I didn't think I was going to.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Well, Leon, you said you had some data.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Yes.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
I remember when you were skeptical. So one, it helps scale. Like Troy said, I don't want to be redundant because I said all of this in the other workshops.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:18.000
It's just stop me, Bob, if you've already heard this, but With scale, it would be almost impossible to have everyone just sit through 10 min pitches for 24 companies and we have scaled.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:26.000
So we used to have 10 companies and then we had 12 and now we have 24. So it just We started this before we even knew we were gonna scale like that.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Like we started when it went from 10 to 12. And the data that we shared was when we had to switch to virtual for COVID in our very 1st one, we started doing virtual demo days where they would record these 10 min pitches and we put it out on a platform and share it.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:53.000
And then when we started seeing, we did that 2 times. And what we started seeing was people stopped watching the pitches at 2 because we had this software where we could watch and see when people pause or whatever to help with engagement.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Like we couldn't really track what people thought or whatever to help with engagement. Like we couldn't really track what people thought of the pitches without that.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
And then people just didn't watch the whole pitches, like we couldn't really track what people thought of the pitches without that.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
And then people just didn't watch the whole pitches for like any of them. So that's where the idea sparked for me and Neil and Brad to think about this.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
And like that's kind of the data-driven approach where people stopped watching it and don't want to come to demo days.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:16.000
That have 10 min pitches anymore. They're much more engaged when you have like a very versatile set on stage.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:24.000
And the whole point is to get to that meeting where then you will do the full pitch and we have part of the data room curriculum that helps you build your pitch.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
It's the last module and that's where you'll do this whole thing. So it's not like no one will hear any of that.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
More engaging to even have that door open. Because if we just do it boringly, you're not going to get that next meeting.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:37.000
So I hope that's helpful, Bob.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Yeah, I think what I kind of not hearing specifically, but I guess I can infer it is that also by having folks not stop watching a video.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:55.000
That means getting to that second meeting and actually converting on receiving pitches and receiving funding. The data should then also show the new.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Is at least as effective in terms of the point of pitching in the demo day and being able to raise is that what I'm also hearing?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Yeah, and people were seeing a trickle off of their attendance. So when we came back in person, people were not as interested in coming to demo days at all. So when we came back in person, people were not as interested in coming to demo days at all.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
They had just tired of the format in general. As interested in coming to demo days at all. They had just tired of the format in general.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
So our peers in the other cities that were doing the old format, we're not getting the numbers that they normally did.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:33.000
And we were hitting consistent numbers of hundreds of people. So they started asking us and other people started adopting it and I can give you a list of other people who adopt it too if you want to talk to their founders but basically it started catching like wildfire around tech stars because they just couldn't get people to come to their events.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
So that's what ended up happening.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Awesome. Thank you.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Back to you, Tray.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Alright, I think so. I want to talk about what next steps are. So we're gonna be, best way that you can have an awesome pitch.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Is by developing that story, iterating through iterating through it's only 1 min, you're going to have trouble getting everything you want into 1 min.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Samuel Clemens, famous quote is, you know, I would have written you a shorter letter only I didn't have the time.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:15.000
It is hard to be concise. And there is an art to it. But you should be starting right now.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Like literally tonight tomorrow with I want to think about why 1 min pitch. I would open up the slight tool of your choice, PowerPoint keynote, Google slides.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:32.000
I'd be putting an objective on the top of each one. You could use no cards if you want, but getting that pitched on.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000
What are the points I want to make? And nailing it. Now wait, I realized I put the cart before the horse.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Before you do that, You should have a big picture of objective, which is what do I want to accomplish with my 1 min pitch?

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
What do I want to accomplish with my video? And what do I want to accomplish with my Q&A?

00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Look clearer you are on the objectives, the easier the rest of the task will be. And it's okay for you to spend a couple of days just wrestling with what do I want to accomplish with each one of those pieces because the clearer and more concise you are on those, the easier each task will be.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:16.000
And then we'll break it down to the next section. So once you know what you want to accomplish with your pitch, you do what I just said.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Once, think of a slide as a chapter of your pitch. One slide for each one. Probably be 5, it could be 6 or 7 objective, maybe a couple bullet points, black and white.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Done. Think about scripting out your demo, your video demo. What do you want to you know what you want to accomplish?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
So do the same thing with it with bullet points. It don't have to be slides, everyone do, but bullet points.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:49.000
You're telling a story with your video. Nail that and then you're going to have the opportunity for 4 or 5 questions to nail the last part, which is usually selling into objections.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:00.000
And this is the next step and the team at Techstars is going to help you along with check-ins and having you having you do certain pieces, please follow their lead here.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:10.000
I have some time on the calendar where I'm going to be coming and checking in and we're going to do some pitch practice where you're going to literally give your 1 min pitch.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
And then I'm going to give you feedback and say, oh, this was really unclear. What if we said it this way?

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:18.000
What if we did whatever? I don't have time to do that with you every day for the next 30 days, but you should be trying to get that kind of input every single day for the next 30 days.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:30.000
But you should be trying to get that kind of input every single day for the next 30 days. Anytime you have opportunity to to get someone to give you feedback on the pitch, you should be doing it from here forward.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Because the more times you execute it and the more feedback you get, the better. But it's up to you.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000
This is just like mentor madness. You're going to get mentor whiplash.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:45.000
You'll have some people tell you to turn laughs, some people thought they turn right, some people tell you go up, go down, and it's your job.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000
To not just say, okay, I should turn left, but to say why do you think I should turn left?

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Why do you think I should turn right? Why do you think I should go up? Why do you think I should go down?

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Because only you. Can make the ultimate decision about what the right approach is. And if you took everybody's feedback, you'd have a Frankenstein pitch again.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.000
You'd have the arm from one the head from another, the body of a 3.rd So what's most important is that you have a single thread.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Through each one of these events. I'll call them the pitch, the demo and the Q&A, a thread for the pitch.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:27.000
A thread for the video and a thread for the Q&A. And that it's consistent, sharp, and tight.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Questions?

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Yeah, why don't we pause here for questions. And then we're going to do a fun activity.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Good, I like fun activities.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Any? That's what we always do. It's a surprise. For you.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Any questions? Okay, well you can pop them in the chat while this is going on. What we like to do at the end here is that this workshop is your kickoff.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:02.000
So in order to help you know where to start, I like to take the end of this and while we have choice time just on the spot quick 10 to 15 seconds.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Trial of a pitch without thinking too much. For the sole purpose of you not having a blank page. So I will take volunteers.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000
I'm gonna be nice today. Usually I just call on people. But we're gonna take volunteers.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Mutra, I can always count on you to go first.st I really appreciate it. We're gonna just go for as long as I'll stop you at a minute because some people when it's not planned will ramble which is fine if you only have 10 to 15 seconds that's good if you get to a minute, which is fine. If you only have 10 to 15 seconds, that's good.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.000
If you get to a minute, that's also good. Troy will give you quick feedback and then you can watch this recording and transcribe it so that at least you have something to start with.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000
If you don't want to go at all today, you can want your classmates to at least get an idea.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:50.000
So remember, don't start by introducing yourself. Start by trying to grab our attention. Have 3 things you want us to get about your business and try to end with some sort of call to action.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:56.000
It's okay if you don't get to all of that because you're just doing it off the top of your head, but I appreciate the brave cells who have raised their hands.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
So, Troy, did you want to add anything else or do you wanna just start?

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Nope, go for it.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Amazing. Okay, Maria. Whenever you're ready.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:17.000
The average US musician makes less than $20,000 per year in total income and yet Taylor Swift earned over 1 billion dollars on her latest tour.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Cicada helps musicians make more money from live music. We have already. Okay, acquired 38 paying customers in 12 countries and during Texas, we just figured out that the primary distribution method for our product and the primary decision makers in the business are music managers.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Therefore, we are now in talks with some of the world's largest music managers, including people who work at red light management and, people who manage, TikTokers with over 1 million views.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Okay.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000
In order to implement the KATA into their live performances. We help musicians get paid for artists for sorry for products and services at live concerts.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:10.000
And we help audiences foster a deeper sense of community with their beloved idols. That's Dakota. I'm talking to me after the show.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:22.000
We've already raised $200,000 prior to, this event and we are now kicking off our next fundraising stage in order to bring this to the biggest music and venues in the world.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000
That's amazing. That was about a minute 5 seconds.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Cool.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000
So that was really good for off the cuff. I do think that you got a lot wordy.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000
You should go back and watch this. This has been recorded. You tried to stuff too much. Oh, and we did this and we did that and we did this.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000
What were the 3 points you were trying to make?

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:57.000
People are using it. We are. In talks with important customers. And, it solves a big problem, but it's also 2 a and my wife is leaving the next room without the door.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
So I'm trying to be go ahead.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Okay, alright, so I would try to tighten that up a bunch. I think that your opening was amazing Right?

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Okay.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.000
So the opening was the average musician makes $20,000 a year, yet Taylor Schiff made over a billion dollars last year.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Why is there such a big discrepancy? We're going to help solve that. Now, I would probably have gone into something I probably would have gone a little different tactic.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000
I would have said musicians are musicians because they love to make music not because they're good business people.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:36.000
That's why they hire managers. The problem is the managers don't know what to do. Let me introduce you to Cicada.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000
So Kata partners with managers to help managers do their job better and make more money for musicians. And you don't have to explain everything.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:54.000
You want people to walk away from that conversation or that presentation being like, I want to learn more. If you've told me everything, I don't need to learn more.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:01.000
I don't need to pay attention to the next thing. But you want them literally to be like show me the demo I want to see how this thing works.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.000
And so if you just give them enough, it'll be great. And I think you're off to a good start.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:17.000
But everybody should think about this. You don't need to tell the whole story. Right? The example I give people is But it's sort of like the trailer to the movie.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000
When you go to the movies and you see those previews, you've all seen the trailers.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:30.000
The good ones are the ones where you see the suspenseful plot. You see the cool special effects, the sexy co-stars, and you're like, damn, I gotta go see that movie.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.000
But you've also seen one where you see the suspension fly, the sexy co-stars, the cool special effects, and how it ends.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000
You know, like, oh, I know how the movie ends. I don't need to go see it.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:46.000
You were trying to create a trailer. You want to leave some intrigue. You want to, you want them to be like, I need to learn more.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:54.000
And so in your sequencing and your pitch, You want to leave them with God, I want to learn more, so they will pay attention to your demo.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.000
In the demo, you want them to be like, I want to learn more so they'll listen to the Q&A.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:07.000
And in the Q&A, you want to touch on enough of it that it feels real, but leave them wanting more so you get the meeting.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Okay. Thank you so much.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000
I thought that was a very good 1st pitch. All right. Who's next?

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Alright, Brian, let's go.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Alright, can you guys hear me?

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Yep.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Awesome. So Rhonda is an AI receptionist for dental practices. Every day there's over a million Americans that are due for a dental appointment.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:37.000
The vast majority of them don't actually end up looking to point over the dentist. Second thing is about 30% of phone calls coming into a dental practice are messed by receptionists. The bottleneck here is being capital.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000
How many receptions can I get to make outbound calls and pick up inbound calls.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000
That's why we built Rhonda with Rhonda. You can answer 100 calls at once.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000
And it directly introduces your practice management system. The best part, Rondo works 24 7 every single day.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:58.000
She doesn't take a vacation and she doesn't take any breaks.

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000
That's what patch.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
That was good. That was 40 seconds. So you're almost all the way there. Try.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Yeah, so it was good the media thing that comes to mind is why dental practices that seems like a small TAM.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Like it seems like if this thing works, why is it unique to dental practices or why is this problem unique to dental practices?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And, So I, and maybe it's okay to have that if you answer that in your QA.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:34.000
It's interesting. The other thing I didn't like and I think this goes, this is really important.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You, you put the problem out there that they're over a million people, whatever your number is.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:47.000
There are a million people who should have a dental appointment and aren't making one today. So the problem statement was about the consumer.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:01:07.000
But your customer is the dental practice. And that's who's paying you. And so there was a disconnect for me because I if if the consumer were paying me that would have made sense but the dental practice is paying me and so I think I want to come up I want to state the problem in terms of the dental practice.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
So if, and I'm going to make shit up, my numbers will be all wrong, but you could say something like you know.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Dental practices are struggling today. There's high overhead and they need patients. They need the patients to come in for the regularly scheduled practices to make ends meet.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Yet, there are over a million unscheduled people who don't have scheduled than appointments.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Rhonda is our automated AI assistant who's going to help solve this problem. How does she do it?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
There's never a busy line. There's never an unanswered phone call. There's never an UN responded text.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Rhonda proactively whatever blah blah blah so I would orient if you're going to have a problem statement, it should be a problem for the person who is paying you, who is your customer.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
No, I think that's a great feedback. Definitely already state that problem.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And, yup. Yup. And these things apply to all of you, right? Many times people don't understand who the customer is, right?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
The classic one is people would say years ago would say, oh, who is Facebook's customer? And people would say, oh, it's all the people on Facebook.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Well, now it's really the advertisers, right? The advertisers who pays them.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:27.000
The people are actually the product. You and I are the product. And so it's really important that you 0 in on these things because it will make it easier for the audience to understand that problem solution and to tie the together.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Make sure you really are crystal clear about who your customer is. Why they are paying you, what is the job to be done?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Let's go to the next one.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Alright, Snow. Thank you.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Yeah, thanks. That was great.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Okay.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Hey. Yeah, so everyone uses Chechnya. But only a few people use it for work in the right mode.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:08.000
So think about where your staff spend most of your time during the work. So that's the place where the HTTP or AI co-pilot should live in integrated too.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:16.000
So, rumba, there helps, companies. To use Chechnya in their workflow.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And we already have more than 50 paying customers including BCG. And laser away. The leaders of the companies, leaders of our customers succeeded in introducing cutting edge.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Technology into their staffs. Improving their work, work performances. We believe that.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Most of the companies more and more companies will utilize AI co-pilot for their workflows and we are the one who can help them.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
That was good.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
To utilize it. Much better in their workflow. We are looking for discussing, further investment with you.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
So please reach out to me.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
That was a little over one minutes now.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Okay.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
So Snow, I have no idea what you do. I think you're a consultant. I think you're a consulting firm that comes in and does some consulting and tells them.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Where they should use chat GPT what do you actually do i'm guessing that's not what you do

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Yeah, so yeah, that's correct. We are providing the service. No code service so that non-technical people can create, no code service so that, non-technical people can create custom, chchPT in their workflow.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So give me a concrete example. Give me a use case.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:43.000
S they can build people team at AI assistant. Who can answer. Before they, answer to the people.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:53.000
So they can create AI assistant in their Slack or Microsoft teams. So that they can do some work.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Instead of them.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
You have real customers. Right, so I think, you know, do you want him to explain like a real use case?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yes, how's PCG using this?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Oh yeah. So PCG is running their pilot program with us. So they built some.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Hey, AI assistant who can answer to answered questions in the slack, which their customers, their clients living in.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So they have 500 people in one select channel asking bunch of questions to the BCG people the AI comes up and they built AI using Plugber to answer that kind of questions.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Alright, I'm gonna make stuff up, but I think what you're doing.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And you're your Fortune 5 Hundreds or big companies or your enterprises or your customer, right?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.000
But, yeah, we have, but our major target is meat size enterprise. And so if, around.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Yeah.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Okay, mid size. Okay. So let me let me make something up, but let me try.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Come mid to large mid to enterprise size companies have vast warehouses of data. About their customers, about operations, about how they work.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:30.000
But they've been previously inaccessible. So, they have humans who answer, whether it's the HR department, whether it's a research department, whether it's as part of the sales process.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Imagine a world where an AI agent was trained specifically on the data that's within your enterprise. So that it could answer anybody's question accurately, quickly.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And efficiently. That's what rumba is. We take the data that the, and then I would go into a very specific use case like HR, for instance.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000
You know, at BCG, make, use a real one, but it BCG, we have trained run bear.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:16.000
On all of the documentation around human resources, benefits, health insurance, 400, and onek and all 98% of employees questions are answered through slack instantly by run bear.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:25.000
It saves BCG money. It makes their employees happy and it gets accurate information out. We make companies more efficient.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I don't know. I got to work on it. But does, is that sort of what you're doing?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Actually, our focus is more on about integrating, the AI into the Slack rather than building the AI itself.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
But Totally I get that what you mean.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:57.000
But make it concrete and make it so it's very clear why a company wants you. When you, the description you gave and go back and listen to it in the recording if you want it really sounded to me like you were a consultant.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I see.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
So, all right, let's go to next. We're gonna have to go faster because we're gonna try to get to everybody and I have a hard stop in 20 min.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Thank you.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Alright, Jayla.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Oh wow.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Okay. There are nearly a hundred 50 trips booked annually. And people are going to top destinations around the world.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And destinations like Rome where you go to the call CM and there are lines out the door. And during our time at Techstars, we found that most of our travelers actually a want to avoid these crowds and want to have more immersive and cultural experiences.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:52.000
So introducing Travis, a regenerative travel platform that makes it easier for people to find and book immersive cultural experiences that that are good for people and planet.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:05.000
We believe travel can be a force for good and it is time for change. Tavares, gives you access to unique, immersive experiences that allow you to fully engage with.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Destinations no matter where you go.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
That was 1 min.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Alright, so let me take a pass at this one. I'm going to make up numbers again, Something like Travel is a 2.7 trillion dollar industry globally.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:33.000
For most people going on that cruise or going to Cancun and going to Disneyland is totally fine.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:43.000
But for the top 2%, there's a small segment, 2% of the population really wants to do something different and wants to have an impact on the globe.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:52.000
It's that and then we got to do the math about 2.7 trillion times 2% which I think is 54 million it's that 54 billion dollars market that we're going after.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:00.000
For the people who want something unique. Travis is the tool that gets them that unique vacation that not only is different, but it's impactful.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
We're sensitive to the environment. We do blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:11.000
We are for the 50. We're doing this for the 54 billion dollars. Market of people who want to do something, who don't want to travel with the masses.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I like that.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:23.000
So I tried what I tried to do is make clear that there is this giant market. And even if you're only 2% of the giant market, it's still a really big market, right?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And I do believe travel is over a trillion dollar market a year. It's that big, literally, so these numbers will work.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And then talk about how you're different. Be polarizing. Like it's great if you want to go to Cancun on a junket.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
That's not our customer. Right, our customer, and it'd be great if you use concrete example.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Our customer wants to spend 8 days in the rainforest than Costa Rica. Picking coffee beans and you know.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Hanging out with the Howler monkeys. Whatever but make it be some you know make it be very clear who your customer is and what they want and then implicit whether you want to say it or not.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:07.000
One thing I was reluctant to do, I almost said, oh, the top 1%. I was like, Oh, boy, you're gonna get labeled with the like 1% or kind of thing.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:19.000
But it really is catering to people who have more money or more looking for unique experiences. And you have to figure out how to say that without feeling too elitist.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Or maybe you want to feel elitist. It's up to you. Yeah.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000
The regenerative, help with that try since it's like they give back to the community they're going to, you know.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Yep.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
The wherever it's it won't seem as elitist because it's like people trying to do good.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Yep.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
So you guys should all watch back this recording. Because Troy has basically done the pitch for most of the you.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
So I would watch it back and write it down and then iterate.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I want to be clear. Hopefully I've given you some outline. You can always make it better.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Like, I mean, I've had, I get 60 seconds about while you're talking about it.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Alright, is Dan next?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Yeah.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Yeah, so unfortunately there is no background music that I wanted to start the opening but everybody knows the song of David Bowie under pressure.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Yeah.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Right? So, basically that's my opening thing like as I imagine it's right now and I'm start from Pressure over, half of, web agencies and digital specialists and over 3.5 million digital specialists on worldwide.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Leave under the pressure of mason deadlines. While working on web projects. And that apps.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:50.000
But these allows you to. If it allows you to collaborate visually while you're working on the websites.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:03.000
And eliminate miscommunication all over communication while you're doing that. With VS. Customer on average half of the time just eliminate this process.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:21.000
So, we're busy already have 600 accounts and customer love us This customers and 115 countries all all the world.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
That's 1.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:31.000
It's a 6.5 billion. Dollars industry. And we're here to raise 1 million dollars but there is no pressure.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Good, Andy. So I would say like that.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I like I so Yeah, so the fact that you're under pressure and you did the but we have no pressure is a good way to put the book ends on it.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:49.000
That was awesome. Are you like Canva for websites?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Okay. Right.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Pretty much. Yes, so you can collaborate on live web elements. So it, it reduce that miscommunication with the words when you actually can.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Okay, so you didn't you I don't think you did a good enough job of highlighting what the actual problem was.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And who your actual customer is. And you know you open up with some big numbers but you know imagine if you opened up with something like and again my numbers are all wrong.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:25.000
But, you know, last year in the US, the average website cost 175% of how much it was quoted and took 4 times as long to develop.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
That's because they weren't using us. What's it called?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Web visual.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Yeah.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Yeah.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Web video. That's because they weren't using Web what?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
What?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And yeah.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Oh, are you gonna have trademark issues with Visio?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
No, we don't. We already registered it.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Okay, anyway, that's because they didn't use web busio You see, Web Vizio makes the.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Yeah.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Takes the communication portion of building web. Product building websites completely out of the out of this out of the equation because everybody sees the same thing at the same time.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I don't know how your product actually works, but you need to set up the why there's a problem and how you solve it which was not clear to me at all.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Okay.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And I just kinda had to make up like, oh, is this Canva for? For websites but and it's also can't be for every website so the narrower you get and the more concrete of the use case you have the easier it will be to imagine.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So this is probably for marketing websites or maybe it's for e-commerce websites or maybe it's for, you know, blogging websites.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I don't know, but it probably isn't for all 3. Right? You probably have a niche that you do really, really well.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And so I would focus on what you do. What the specific problem, why these things cost more and take longer and how you solve that problem.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Okay.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Is what I focus on. Okay, Philippe.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Alright, whenever you're ready.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Believe.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Yeah, I hear sorry about that. Okay, so surely you have had to renovate a space in your home and found yourself hesitating over the purchase decision overwhelmed by the disorganized and overload offer of home decor products.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Online in a highly fragmented and poorly personalized ecommerce market. This common frustration directly impacts the main company of our clients.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:32.000
The retail e-commerce business. Who continue to struggle with low conversion rates and high chopping caravan rates in an addressable market worth over 90 billion US dollars.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:48.000
There's all this challenge we created Go House and I power platform that integrates seamlessly with retailers e-commerce automatically categorize their products in the variety of styles with high precision and immediately offers personalized product suggestion for home decoration to their customers.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:57.000
With Walmart until in just 4 months we capture over 7,000 users and achieve an impressive conversion rate of 3%, double the 1.5% of the market.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I am Felipe, cofounder and CEO of Go House and we invite you to join us in our mission to make home decoration accessible, affordable and sustainable for everyone.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
That was exactly a minute. It sounds like you've done that before, Philippe.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Yes, sometimes.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
If

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Yeah, no, that was pretty good. That really was pretty good. But if I were to try to redo that, I think I would take a slightly different approach.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:30.000
That I would identify that there is a giant market. By the way, I don't, little aside, this is for everybody.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:45.000
You started out with you've probably done a home renovation project before I don't like starting out with something like that because what if I haven't I'm like no I haven't I don't you don't know anything about me I'm getting defensive automatically Right?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
That's why I don't like asking the audience a question either as an opening. It can work.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000
But it can also backfire. So I would rather state a fact that nobody can take sides with.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Home renovation is, is a, you know. Whatever it is, 750 billion dollars marketplace in the US.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Boom. Fact. Big market. You could then say that, you know, the top 5%.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Have access to home decorators who make it easy, make the process easy. They come to you and they show you lay out 5 or 10 choices for every decision you have to make and they come to you making it easy.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Unfortunately, most of us can't afford that. Until now. Let me tell you about our AI home decorating solution.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.000
It does the work of the home decorator. But it does it at a fraction of the cost. And it does it more efficiently.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000
It's not biased by commission rates that it gets from various manufacturers. It's not biased by its own taste.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000
It asks you a series of simple questions, gets a sense of your taste, and learns with every interaction.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:00.000
What you like and don't like so that it can more quickly get you the right product at the right price, helping you save money and save time.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I made all that up, but I think it's directionally what you're doing, right?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Yeah, great. Yeah.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:19.000
So I thought yours was pretty good. Think about the way I you know, think about some alternatives. So for everybody, once you get something you like, It's still valuable to test other approaches.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And you're basically A, B testing and then asking people. Did that resonate better? Did that hit hard?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:38.000
What were you confused about? But I would have made the analogy that your product does the job of the designer at a fraction of the price and does it better because they have access to every product.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
They are not biased and they get smarter with every interaction with you.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Alright. I think. Valerie will be their last one.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Yeah, so but I think we can fit 2 so Antonio and then We have 8 min left.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
So.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Oh, okay. Let's go, Antonio, you're up.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Oh yeah? Okay. I lost 40 pounds last year. Thanks to better nutrition, more feasible exercise and better stress.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Management. My Apple Watch, my smart scale helped me in this journey to announce my physical well-being.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000
There is not such a thing today. There is no such a viable today to measure my mental wellbeing.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Yet we rely on most of our daily activities. On our minds. With 27% of US adults so stressed that they cannot function every day.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Anyway, we are building the 1st wearable device for continuous monitoring or your stress and anxiety. Hey, where's EG wearable measures your brain waves in our pattern painting new neural, mural coach, AI, AI, neural coach, provides actionable feedback to announce your mental well being every day.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000
We have a working prototype. We are raising our C round to help us cut these wires.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:03.000
And aware empowers individuals to take control of their mental wellbeing and lose their weight.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I think your approach is right. I think you can do better with word selection, but I think the approach of opening up with and you know you opened up you spent too much time in my opinion on your 40 pounds.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:25.000
You know you can you what if we said something like you know, physical well-being is a multi, you know, a bazillion dollar market, trillions of dollars.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Wait losses at the front of that. I should know. I worked hard and I lost 40 pounds with the last year with the help of my Apple Watch and my Fit bit, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:47.000
But what about mental well being? That has been unaddressed until now. Here is our device that does mental well being through brain waves, blah, blah, blah.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I think that approach is really, really good because you're basically taking an existing known giant market. And you're taking an existing known giant problem.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:07.000
And you're borrowing brand from the big market that this is going to be big market and I think it's a really convincing pitch.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I think it's awesome. Alright, Valeria, you're up.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Thank you.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Alright, there are over 25 million small businesses that exist in run entirely through Instagram. They post pictures of the items they want to sell and talk to customers and do the entire checkout process using Instagram's direct messaging feature.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:33.000
It's extremely inefficient for businesses to rewrite the addresses they receive into shipping websites.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Income Strip Ship, a dedicated shipping solution that cuts these times down from an average of 2 h to 30 min for every 10 packages.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Since launching in 2021 we've helped over 1,800 small businesses ship out over 130,000 packages.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Today we're looking to make some connections and have that next talk. Feel free to reach out.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Okay, 35.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Hmm. Oh my god, so short. Why does it fly by so quickly? Oh.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:15.000
No, that was very good. You were very concise. I know exactly what you do. And the question is, So I have little nitpicks.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Not a number, is they?

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:26.000
You know, you did the, you did 2 h down to 30 min for every 10 packages like why not just Yeah, why not just say we cut the time it takes to prepare and ship a package down by we cut it by 75% Right?

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Cause that's, I think that's how the math worked, right? We cut shipping, we cut shipping and preparation time by 75%.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Allowing and then you have to give the so what allowing those businesses to spend more time on what they love.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Finding great products, marketing them and dealing with their customers. Right. So, I mean, generally, I think it was very good.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:58.000
It was super clear. I know exactly what you do. I liked it.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Thank you. Thank you. How would, what would I do with the other, I guess, 25 seconds other than the so what?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Well, you have to decide.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Yeah.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Okay, so you said something about 1,800 customers So investors. Are really looking for a trajectory.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:29.000
So the slope of the curve is more important than is where you are at this point. Because let's say you had 2,000 customers 6 months ago and you have 1,800 today.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Should I be interested in you? Oh, no. But if you went from 0 to 1,800 in 4 months, I'd be ecstatic.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Huh.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Right? And so I don't know what the actual slope of your trajectory is and whether you talk counted in customers or bad packages.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Or revenue, but you know to be able to talk something about the trajectory and something about where you're headed.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
How long have you been doing this?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Since March of 2021.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Okay, so you have been at it for a little while. What do you have a compounded growth rate for this year?

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Like what does your growth rate been in the last 4 months of this year?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Oh, right now we're not focusing so much on growth. We're focusing on fixing a leaky bucket.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Okay.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
So making our funnel more efficient and we have been like touching on that. So do you think that would be like a better story to tell?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And then maybe because we are planning like a high growth phase starting like right around demo day because we're fixing that leak.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Okay.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Yeah, everybody plan. Everybody plans a high growth phase. You have to, it's better to, again, if you can show it, prove it, don't tell it.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
So, Lilianna put something in the chat. You can always, you know, take that time and use that in your video.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:46.000
So you have a combined 2 min between your pitch and your video. If you only use 40 seconds in your pitch, you can use a minute 20 in your video.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Gotcha. Okay.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So it's not wasted. Alright.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Alright, that's a lot to think about. Thank you, Joy.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Of course.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Okay. We'll do closing that from you Troy. I think Bob has a quick thing and with 2 min left.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Yeah, I think you guys are getting it, right? There's a pattern here. This isn't rocket science.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:14.000
It's about clearly stating your problem, this isn't rocket science, it's about clearly stating your problem, making sure the audience identifying your problem, making sure the audience identifies with the problem, making sure the audience identifies with the problem and understands who your audience identifies with the problem and understands who your customer is with the problem and understands who your customer is and understands.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:22.000
How you're solving the problem, not all the details, but oh, that makes perfect sense. If I were selling stuff on Instagram, I wouldn't want to spend 2 h.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Why I want to reduce my time spending packaging and shipping stuff because that means I can do more time like making that clear and then leaving them wanting for more and the things that will want them for more things like if they understand you have a great trajectory if they think you have a great future, etc.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Will be back. I forget the day. I think it's either next week or the week after.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
It's yeah, it's different for port and starboard. So Tories gonna come separately for each of you.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Alright.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
So I don't remember the date. Do you have a quick question, Bob? Try us to leave in 1 min.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
No, I was gonna pitch our CEOs driving, so I was gonna give it a shot.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Got it. Do you wanna?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
But it We're at time.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Alright, I got to jump. But you guys are welcome to stay and Lilian is welcome to give you feedback.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Yeah, I'll give you that. I have time.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Awesome.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I apologize. Alright, I do have to jump. I'll see see you all later.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Yeah, See you later. Thanks, Try.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Thank you.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Lilly, can you go back through the colors again? Because we have a lot of black shirts.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Over here.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Yeah, so I said you guys shouldn't have like black, white and gray. That's like, how are they gonna find you in a crowd?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000
This is just my

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
That's my personality.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I'm just saying, like, why are you even wearing branded shirt? Like, you should just wear like snazzy outfits at that point, you know, like dress, dress dapper.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Like the whole point of wearing the t-shirt is that it's like bold and almost like obnoxious because you're like tech founders and people you want them to find you in the crowd and you know there will be lights and like different color lights and it'll be more dim than outside and it'll be hard for people to find you.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000
So that's like the whole point. I want it to be very clear that is just a recommendation.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Troy usually says that during this session, I actually stopped openly. Requiring it after like the 1st 2, times because I realize that like a lot of people are more comfortable wearing other things.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Some people just wear something really bright and it's like a dress like some of my female CEOs have worn like bright pink dress or something and they're like come find me you know and I'll be in the pink back there whatever it is like you just want to be able to be seen Oh, someone you you saw Shelley's she wore an apron because she was doing a baking company.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Someone else wore scrubs because they were doing medical supply company, you know? So it's like, you just want to be recognizable.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:47.000
That's the whole point. It doesn't matter as much about the t-shirt. But for all of you putting black and white, I think that's kind of besides the point, even if it's not your actual branding, like you might wanna make t-shirts just for demo day, you have about 3, 4 weeks.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.000
You could probably get some in. To Oakland by that time, just a suggestion. But Bob, the floor is yours.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I wanna hear your pitch.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Alright, I'm still in this format from, so. For many Americans a 400% APR is the only credit product available to them through payday loans.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Worse than that, they're unable to be underwritten by financial institutions who see them as too high risk.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And untrustworthy. In addition, since 2019. More than 19% of the US population has moved below the 700.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Vantage score in credit bands and so even fewer people are having an opportunity to participate in the economy.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Wouldn't it be great if we could eliminate not only bias but also improve the performance of underwriters and in the credit space.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:30:01.000
The prime provides AI powered underwriting as a service to financial institutions, credit unions, and other fintech companies to increase profitability, reduce bias, improve consistency, and lift up all the boats.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
For all of us.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
That was 1 min. Okay, cool. You got the perfect timing. I think there's a lot to do here.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.000
So that was a really good 1st pass. So for yours, it's really easy for your to just get like super like people's eyes.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Over because of how Much jargon there is, you know, it's deep financial terms and all of that and you want to keep everybody's attention even the people who know what you're talking about I still want to keep their attention and I want them to know how meaningful this is.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Like it's not just another fintech like you have a mission and sometimes I've heard Vincent talk about it like telling an actual story.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Maybe you don't have to go into an actual story, but something like like we really believe everybody is everyone should be have access to alone or like something like that you can tell a story like there was this person who I don't want to make up a story because I don't want to be offensive because I don't know your customers but like Someone who isn't able to afford a loan and like could have had this

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000
life but they couldn't because of the problem that exists. We believe that shouldn't be the case.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I want to be careful because they're not your customer. Like I know your B twob. So it would be like much more trying to sell the mission.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:24.000
As an attention grabber in like a sentence at the beginning, but I think that's worthwhile because I don't want people to not get it in the 1st 10 seconds that you're on mission driven fintech because that's what makes you guys different.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:36.000
That's what makes people's ears perk up because most fintech are just like the moneymakers and you guys are different because you have this other angle which is extremely like So, So I want that to.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Hopefully we also make money. Yeah.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Yes, and you'll get to that because you had the rest of it. I'm talking in the 1st 10 to 15 seconds to even get them on your like on your page.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Is there something you can think of as like a hook?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Oh yeah, totally. I got a bunch of those like how many folks can't cover a unexpected $300 emergency like a flat tire, car repairs or, the number of folks who have mispriced debt who can't participate like what body of opportunity exists there, but also the amount of decades old underwriting practices where bias and discrimination are still prevalent because it's a human

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:30.000
making a decision at the end of the day. Wouldn't it be great if we can improve the consistency and fairness in decision making and open up the economy to folks who have been excluded.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Before

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:43.000
All of that was so interesting. So like obviously you can't take half the pitch to say all of that, but like I saw everyone's heads nodding like that was extremely engaging and also tells us a lot more about you.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Like there's a lot of storytelling there. A lot of the meat and potatoes should come during the Q&A.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:57.000
You should think of this as like you're trying to give people the movie trailer so they sit to watch the film which is the next 5 min, the 1 min video, four-minute Q&A.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
That's when Vincent can start just like lighting on fire with all of these numbers where it's like, look, here's the market size.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Here's what we're doing, you know, all of that. This should be a lot less of that.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
You could pepper in one or 2, but it's should be a lot more. What you just said.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Yeah.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000
That was gold. Just now, in my opinion, when you come to pitch for Troy in a couple weeks, he might hate that and then you can iterate again.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:28.000
But that's the whole point, right? We want a bunch of wads of paper thrown on your office floor because one at 1 point will get the perfect pitch.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Thank you.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Thank you. Cool. Okay, thanks for staying after everybody. I'll sit for like 4 more minutes if anyone has questions, but thanks for your engagement.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Remember that now you want to go and start iterating on your pitch. We're gonna start having sessions where we're practicing.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Next week we're going to talk about your demo day video and at least have some sort of like storyboard to walk through.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:52.000
So just start working on it. Async you can send us stuff. Just know this is the kickoff so now it's expected that you guys in the background are starting to iterate on this stuff and we're always here to help.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Great work and thanks to that
