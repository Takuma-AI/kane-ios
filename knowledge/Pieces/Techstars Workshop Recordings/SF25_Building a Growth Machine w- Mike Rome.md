Based on the workshop content, founders will learn:


### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Chris Wong: Hey, Mike? Chris, CEO, co-founder of legalese we're selling to law firms, and what we're doing is streamlining the time tracking and invoicing generating process. So for lawyers, they spend about 12Â HA month jotting down what they do and then putting it into their invoice. It's pretty detailed. So we're using AI to streamline that entire process. So they don't have to do that. Reduce it to about an hour a month.
- Mike Rome: And it's also just an underutilized way to try to scale your business. So that's another one. A lot of these principles come down to process over tactics. I know it's tempting to pull up your Twitter feed, or Linkedin feed. And someone's talking about the latest and greatest thing. Maybe it's me. And you're kind of like, you know, you kind of just do
- Mike Rome: whatever the new thing is. Whoever's screaming the loudest right? You kind of take that thing and ultimately end up throwing a lot at the wall in terms of tactics, and there's a process for growth. And you want to make sure that you don't put like the tactics

### Key Insights

> "Chloe Lannert: and it's all really solid content. But, Mike, if you want to talk a little bit more about your background and your main focuses. Just primarily centered on growth. But this workshop is always a founder favorite, because it's so like it gets down to the philosophies of growth. And just how to think about it. Within your team.

And so we were like, I think we can just build the agency together that we always wanted, but never could find as in-house operators. So I spend"

> "Mike Rome: it really stuck with me, because, you know, I think one of the most important things to get get right about growth from the start is growing. Something new is hard."

I think that the startups that don't make it oftentimes are surprised by the constant shitstorm that a startup is, and I think it goes a long way, just building a culture that sort of expects it right? Because even the best startups that's really"

> "Mike Rome: So that's really what this 1st principle is about. I think some of the attributes of great growth cultures are companies that let small fires burn. It's 1 of my favorites again. Easier said than done. Everyone wants to say they let small fires burn, but I'm sure you guys have always been there. You want to fix every little thing you can, and oftentimes the perfects, the enemy of good enough, and I think the reality is is whether you're a pre-seed startup or you're a post series.
