### Frameworks & Methodologies

- NSG: It's just data like Chloe said. So just take it all in because it is real. It is what someone actually thinks. And so every now and then, they might actually have something valid to share with you. So just be able to like, take all that in and process it, and don't let it get to you. And if you ever have any issues processing that kind of tough love, I can help, because I'm usually a pretty good like buffer and and hype man, for founders that tend to, you know, have have struggling moments like that
- Chloe Lannert: This is a relic from Liliana. It'll feel like this, but make sure you leave time to process and sit with things. Decisions rarely rarely have to be made super quickly. Decisions made in haste are rarely good decisions. So
- Meg Hall: That they followed, because that's usually way more informative than the final outcome. So they're probably might even have like similar different outcomes. But there, if you follow their logical step of like, you know, 3rd step is different. And you're like, all right, I'll do the 1st 2, you know. I guess it's

### Key Insights

> "Chloe Lannert: feedback. Some is going to be great, some is gonna be not so great as always. Keep an open mind. Everything is data. It's your business."

> "NSG: Chloe, Chloe, can we like unpack that line so don't develop a confirmation bias. I don't know if you want to elaborate. I'm happy to back you up. But I think that's really important to spell out"

> "NSG: They're not gonna like your business. They think you're gonna fail. They think you're doing everything wrong. You've made these mistakes like, what were you thinking? Or you know, they're gonna say, weird stuff like that. And it's not always gonna feel great. But if you have a thick skin, and you develop that armor."

> "NSG: It's almost like you're on our team. And I love this because we actually do do that. So whenever there is glaring feedback that could be concerning and timely meaning like this. This founder isn't showing up properly to meetings, or they're presenting themselves in a way that is either inaccurate or inappropriate, and they should correct it to get more value from their future conversations. We will go and and jump in, but I'll do that on a case by case basis help each of you out. Yeah."

> "Chloe Lannert: sit down and look at all the data together. And we're also going to give you an exercise at the end of mentor madness. When we give you that feedback to help you prioritize and understand what needs to happen next, what hypotheses are the most important to test further, what action items need to need to happen now, what can be for later. So we have resources available for all of that"
