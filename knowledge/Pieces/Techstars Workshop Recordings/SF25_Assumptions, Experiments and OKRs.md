### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Sylvia Bouloutas: and and do based we can do based on these hypotheses. So in the next slide. Here is a kind of really understanding the before and after so you can have a really kind of simple simple framework here where? It's, you know, because you observe that individuals
- Sylvia Bouloutas: great. So I'm sure you guys have all taken science classes at some point in your life, and if this reminds you of anything, it definitely reminds you of the scientific method. I was like a huge science nerd. So I've
- Sylvia Bouloutas: struggle, you know, with finding vet appointments. I believe that an AI chat bot like will reduce customer frustration, and I'll test it by a simple Mvp. Chatbot tracking engagement right? So that that's kind of the framework right? And I think we've seen time and time again. That like this is how we find the found, you know, successful founders in our program really think is that they're not really. They're not assuming. But they're following this framework, and they're able to

### Key Insights

> "Chloe Lannert: They've put this together by interviewing tons of program teams, tons of founders, figuring out what the key weak spots are, and putting together some core features that they want founders to have contact with early in the program. So we've made some edits, and we've adapted the core stuff a little bit. But this is pretty baseline. It's stuff we'll be coming back to throughout program and customizing a little bit more as we go on."

> "Sylvia Bouloutas: a lot of stuff that I think is such an important part of the accelerator and a huge skill to build kind of as a founder. So everyone can see the the presentation correct. Okay, cool. So, okay, this is a huge skill that we want you to to develop as a founder is kind of this. Really, you know, specific ability to separate assumptions from reality."

> "Sylvia Bouloutas: And you know, every company is really built on a series of guesses. It's like who your customers are, how they're going to behave, and what will make them buy something. But really, you know, we've seen time and time again, it's so important to not just kind of guess blindly about these assumptions."

> "Chloe Lannert: For folks who have done the goal setting packet. Looking at your riskiest assumptions. Test that we had you do in. There is a great place to start key things that you're operating as if they're true. But you don't actually have validation yet."

> "Ankur Toshniwal: growth in the web data economy that even if other people get a little bit into the space, there's going to be even more that needs to be specialized in that we will always be able to find it, and that there isn't going to be like one winner amongst this entire market that's going to just completely dominate. And we're like shit out of luck. So, but that is an assumption, though. Yeah."
