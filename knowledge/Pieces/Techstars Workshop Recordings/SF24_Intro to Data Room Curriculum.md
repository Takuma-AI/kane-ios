### Frameworks & Methodologies

- George: Yeah. Well, we try to like have it. Maybe I mean just a glimpse of it, maybe earlier, like, if we want to do something like Jake did or like an extended research. Yeah, this one is not a competitive analysis, this is a market analysis. So we just give you tools to generate the probable size of your market from a bottom up. Approach Tam, Sam and Tom.

### Key Insights

> "George: well, this is it? And then you never touch it again. That's like your business. No, it's not set in stone. It's it's a workable document. The data room is the same thing. So everything that you're putting in the data room some of the things you might not be able to like completely finish right now, because you're too early or you don't have the right things to put in."

> "George: so feel free to check out each other's. The only thing is that you're sharing a lot of confidential data. So this is gonna be a trust system. We've never had an issue. But just be aware that this is stuff that is only shared with you guys so it should not be shared outside of this folder. It's only for you guys."
