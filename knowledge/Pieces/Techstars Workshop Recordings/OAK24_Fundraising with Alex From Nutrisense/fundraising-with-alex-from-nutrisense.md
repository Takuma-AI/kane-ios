### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Alex: switching to a person at a certain point of your fundraising process.
- Alex: and the approach is slightly different, depending on how much money you're raising, and it gets, you know, can be easier, more complex, depending on how big of a check they're looking for. And what's what level of sophistication of investor you're speaking to.

### Key Insights

> "Alex: Sure awesome. Yeah, as as everybody who comes to text ourselves. You know what happens here, what happens to text ourselves? We had a bunch of stories. So we're like, never told this to anybody. But I'm gonna tell you guys nothing. Nothing crazy like that here. So feel free to record."

> "Alex: Cool. Let's get going. So this this used to be an important decision, probably left, though, now. But you know, are you doing this remote, or are you doing with the person during Covid all of fundraising was remote, and we actually raised remotely"

> "Alex: based on your idea and based on their custom. Believe in you as a person so less than a million bucks you, you know you can. Finally, it's always nice to have somebody putting in a larger check like at least, you know 100 200 k, so you can say, Hey, this person is leading the round, but at least not strictly necessary. You can just collect a bunch of space from folks and say, Hey, this is enough."

> "Alex: again, when it comes to organization in around this size the timing and organization is a lot more important. So we'll get into timing in a little bit, but really just doing like"

> "Alex: and you really do need at least one large commitment to get others to move. Also, there's a lot more diligence that's required, and a lot more kind of proxy trust that you need to get so having a proper lead here is important. It does not have to be an institution lead. It can be a family office. It can be. You know somebody famous. If you take a check from I don't know Sam often, or something like that right?"
