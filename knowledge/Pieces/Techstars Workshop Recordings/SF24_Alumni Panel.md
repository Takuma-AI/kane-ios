## Core Concepts

Based on the workshop content, founders will learn:


### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: and got huge responses to that. And it was just. It was just fun for me to kind of process it that way. So at the end of every week. I sat down, and I went through it, and I made a list of all the people that I want to thank and mentioned in it as well, but just also really vulnerably went through how the week was and what we're going through as a founding team and as a baby company. And
- Kevin Kaspar: and so we had the idea, following the recipe, that you will all be given the Jdbd method of also interviewing artist managers because they are the ones responsible for handling the actual business of the musicians that we stock with our customers.

### Key Insights

> "Kevin Kaspar: December of 2023 in our text, our Chicago city program, our final one that we did so. It's very special. I I pride myself. I always remembering exactly what program every founder went off the top of my head. So why don't we do, Andrew? First? st Why don't you tell them about yourself and maybe. Yep."

> "Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: On the outside. So I always felt like Brand is super important early on, and not just brand, as in a pretty logo on a pretty website or things like that, but like the design, thinking of it all, and like the consumer in the forefront."

> "Kevin Kaspar: It's so good. It's like one of my favorite things to read on. Linkedin is her diaries of a brand person from tech stars. It's really, truly like so many great insights, so many learnings. But also, Lisa, you forgot to say that at the very beginning, when you're like I don't know if it would be a misfit. I was like, you need to do this and show people like show startups. That brand is important. And then we're gonna write a book about it."

> "Andrew Penner | Milo: that was just kind of the culmination of everything and and something I'll never forget."

> "Kevin Kaspar: And then for these guys, we went and got dog toys. And we're having to throw a dog. So you'll see what we can find for you guys, Andrew. Okay, harder question. I remember in week one you were one of the founders that came to us and said, I already know, Xyz, I don't need to go to whatever workshop I'll let you tell the story. I I'm calling you out because I think that out there are always people that feel that way."
