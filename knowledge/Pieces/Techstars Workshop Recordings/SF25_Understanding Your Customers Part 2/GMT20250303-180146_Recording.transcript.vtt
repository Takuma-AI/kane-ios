00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:24.220
Chloe Lannert: Yes, okay, thank you all for filling out the class roster form. Everything looks good there. I think I've got everyone. If you have any additional part-time participants who you'd like on basecamp. Please let me know, brio. I got all of your folks and a couple other people, but if you haven't communicated with me about part-time participants, I think. May also sent me

2
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:34.789
Chloe Lannert: their people. Just let me know in a base camp Ping or on email, and I'll get them looped into the project. Number 2.

3
00:00:35.140 --> 00:01:03.709
Chloe Lannert: Full time participants. Make sure you fill out those welcome kit forms. We are coming up on the deadline for fulfillment, to be able to cover those. So get in those requests as soon as possible to make sure you actually get that swag. Number 3 retreat registration, putting out another boost there. If you can make the time to be there for the weekend. It really is an incredible experience that we want to share with you all. So I've got 11 people registered at the moment.

4
00:01:04.017 --> 00:01:07.400
Chloe Lannert: But if anyone can make the time there, please do. Yeah.

5
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.340
NSG: Oh, did did Chloe freeze.

6
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.380
Chloe Lannert: I.

7
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.250
NSG: Oh!

8
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.989
Chloe Lannert: I'm here. I can. I can hear you.

9
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.259
NSG: Oh, you're back now. You froze for a hot second. There, all right.

10
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.149
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, Andrew, what's up?

11
00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:35.620
Andrew Fernandes: Yes, you guys mentioned to clear next week. Because we're gonna have a lot of techstars sessions. When we're gonna know the exact schedule for that. We want to plan. Accordingly.

12
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.820
Chloe Lannert: Today.

13
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.320
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, program schedules for weeks. One through 4 will be out today in a Google calendar.

14
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.550
Chloe Lannert: So now that we've got everyone's emails from the class roster. We can share that around

15
00:01:50.224 --> 00:01:57.459
Chloe Lannert: and then goal setting packets. I've seen a few more come in today. I'll get time with you scheduled at some point today.

16
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.679
NSG: Cut out again, didn't she?

17
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.460
NSG: Yep, alright, we'll we'll we'll troubleshoot that. I'll have her write up the rest. I'm just gonna do it. Live jump right in. So oh, Chloe.

18
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.390
NSG: we we lost you again. So I think you should write up whatever else you were gonna say, and then we'll let you sort out the the lag issue

19
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.290
NSG: all right. Well, good to have y'all back.

20
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.449
NSG: I think some of you heard from our Jake session on Friday that

21
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:52.140
NSG: for the 1st time ever I didn't even make it through part one of jobs to be done yet when we were getting into it last week, which is a good thing. So I spent the weekend refining a few things, consolidating some stuff so that I could make sure we get through the rest of the content today. In prep for our last session tomorrow. So I can do a live demonstration of some interview techniques.

22
00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:03.410
NSG: So before I start, though. 1 1 thing I wanted to say is what we're gonna accomplish before the end of this time is I want to have at least some of you. Talk the group

23
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:32.289
NSG: through what you submitted over the weekend, and last night, with respect to your screening criteria and learning objectives, because if I can do some live feedback and editing, and we do it as a group, it should be applicable to everyone else to go back and do one more iteration of it before I give it a once over, and let each of you know whether I think it's ready. But we're in a great place as far as what you all have done so far. It was fun to see everybody wrestle through interpreting

24
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.220
NSG: what jobs means and what resources there are, and who the authors of those resources are.

25
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:47.140
NSG: because one tricky thing with this which makes it so confusing is that there are multiple different people who like, I guess, claim the methodology

26
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.420
NSG: which I've never had to actually like, address or talk about fully, because after the 1st day I explain who

27
00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:02.050
NSG: created it, as far as I know, and and what that journey looks like. But someone shared a resource. I forgot who it was, and it was the Anthony Olwick jobs to be done book

28
00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:10.659
NSG: which is a a slightly different variation of this technique than what I know and and and can teach

29
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:28.489
NSG: but all is fair in love and war. So I just thought you all should know like there's many ways to do this, but at the end of the day. We're asking the same questions and getting the same insights. So were there any questions before I pick up right where we left off last time talking about the milkshake.

30
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.159
Antoine: I guess if you can, if you can share the handbook that you were referring to. Maybe you've done it already, and I missed it.

31
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.489
NSG: Well, what's gonna happen after the session today

32
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.649
NSG: is I'm going to instantiate A to do list in every single company basecamp.

33
00:04:47.990 --> 00:05:04.959
NSG: So each of your base camps will have the actual step by step, prescription with links to all the resources I'm referencing. It's all well like thought out. So, Antoine, what I sent you all as a message on Friday to complete as an assignment was just kind of like a little teaser.

34
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:15.459
NSG: But basically we'll go back from when I 1st started talking about this all the way through to the point where you have a 2 h meeting with me, and you'll know, step by step, exactly what to read and what to do. Does that make sense?

35
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.280
NSG: Yeah. So no worries on that front. You will get everything you need.

36
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:22.690
NSG: I'm seeing Chloe's update here.

37
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:32.140
NSG: Team members, base camp welcome kits. All this stuff she updated you on handbook is demand side sales, one on one. Yeah, cool. All right. Good announcements. Thank you, Chloe.

38
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.570
NSG: Anything else. Any other thoughts, comments over the weekend, reflections on Jake's

39
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.990
NSG: workshop or session, any feedback for him?

40
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.469
NSG: All good cool.

41
00:05:45.950 --> 00:06:02.129
Meg Hall: The demand side. Sales book. The. I looked it up on Amazon, and it obviously won't get to Hawaii before I leave. Is there like? Do you know, if I there's a way to like, can I? Can I ship it to the office, or is there a place in person. I can buy it.

42
00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:05.640
NSG: Chloe, is your mic working again?

43
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.999
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. Am I? Am I here?

44
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.760
Meg Hall: Yeah, yeah.

45
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:30.830
Chloe Lannert: Beautiful, so you can ship things to the office. Address. If you want to get a head start. The audio book is a good place to start. You can get that on like Kindle, or whatever we do recommend that everyone has their own, their own physical copy, because there are some diagrams in there that are pretty important to take a look at. But

46
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:38.689
Chloe Lannert: I know. Okay, I'll look and see if I can find an audio book link, because I know a bunch of our people have done the audio book before.

47
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.500
Meg Hall: Yeah, I checked on audible last night and couldn't find it.

48
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.880
Chloe Lannert: Okay. I'll dig a little bit more.

49
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.470
Meg Hall: Okay. Thank you.

50
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.290
NSG: Alright, we're back.

51
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:59.079
NSG: That was really slick on my part. I zoom had the thing where I had to restart zoom in order for it to work, and I figured I would do it in time for Chloe to finish her comments. That was good.

52
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.500
NSG: perfect timing, cool.

53
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:09.229
NSG: Alright. Let's jump back in. So I don't even know if we fully got to the product team. Here

54
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:17.989
NSG: we were talking about what to do with the milkshakes, and we were pivoting, and I think Mark pick things up and was talking about what he would do to change

55
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:25.950
NSG: Mcdonald's strategy with respect to product is that where we left off. Guys, I think that is cool.

56
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.450
Antoine: That's right.

57
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.640
NSG: So oh, sorry! Go ahead, Antoine!

58
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.589
Antoine: No no yes, yes, yes.

59
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:38.339
NSG: Any final thoughts on the very 1st intro to Jtvd with Clay and Mcdonald's

60
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.840
NSG: cool.

61
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.419
NSG: So has anyone read the innovator's dilemma, any chance?

62
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:56.659
NSG: Nineties. Eighties, something like that. Okay, so I talked about this a little bit. But yeah, the whole notion. Here was

63
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:04.610
NSG: the note, the the idea of being disruptive as a startup, is pretty cliche, and has been for a few decades now.

64
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.399
NSG: But I highly recommend for the business nerds

65
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:20.240
NSG: to consider actually understanding the origin of the term which came from Clay, and he built upon this when he released competing against luck. So I don't have founders read this book.

66
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:46.169
NSG: But if anybody wants to go as deep as possible about the kind of the research and the academic side of this framework in theory, and how it was applied to larger businesses. This book goes into it, and I think, without explicitly naming him. Not only Clay, but Bob Mesta, who conducted the mattress interview that you all listen to, and who I'll talk about a lot during this time is also featured and involved in this

67
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.690
NSG: cool.

68
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.779
NSG: So you all have some exposure to the timeline.

69
00:08:52.830 --> 00:09:05.159
NSG: we've talked about a little bit with jobs. But I think between this and the next resource, I'm going to talk you guys through. If there was only one thing that you retain from the next hour and a half, it's what we're about to talk through.

70
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:26.700
NSG: So when you are conducting your customer interviews in the jobs to be done. Format. What's really important is that you keep in mind as you're going as you're having the conversation. I have a blank version of this timeline in front of me, and there's different templates I can share with you. We have them in the to do's, and you can look up your own or design your own online. But the whole idea is that

71
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:45.080
NSG: there's a moment, a switch moment. There's a moment of either a purchase of firing or of activating a user or customers behavior that you're orienting your conversation around. So as you're having these conversations. You're unpacking the phases that the customer is going through in time leading up to that point.

72
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:55.300
NSG: So too often, I think a huge mistake that founders tend to make when they do. Customer discovery is they're spending time evaluating

73
00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:03.070
NSG: post purchase sentiment as opposed to pre-purchase causal inputs.

74
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:15.010
NSG: So we're trying to actually understand what activities, behaviors, inputs, what were the chain of events that led to the person activating a certain state of search

75
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.710
NSG: and or purchase and decision making.

76
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.470
NSG: So you'll find like it's not like

77
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:39.439
NSG: completely like crystal like this, but in an eerie way, more often than not, there's usually one to 3 events that occur leading up to a purchase decision. And almost always the consumer is going from a 1st thought that could be years ago, months ago, sometimes weeks ago.

78
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:45.230
NSG: But it leads into these like these phases pretty seamlessly by and large.

79
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:53.299
NSG: Most people tend to evaluate only like the deciding through to the buying part.

80
00:10:53.470 --> 00:11:00.660
NSG: But there's usually way more going on underneath the surface. And you all kind of gathered that through the mattress interview demonstration.

81
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:23.280
NSG: So this is one thing that I'm gonna make sure that all of you all like submit as you conduct each interview, because one thing that helps me when I'm kind of helping you do, the analysis of them is to look at the timeline and forces for the individual, and then we do a composite as well of the 10 to 15 interviews that you do where we have like a more consolidated version of this.

82
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.920
NSG: So that's time.

83
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:31.960
NSG: The other component is now going to be the forces of progress. So there's 4 quadrants here.

84
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:41.070
NSG: the push, the pull, the habits, and the anxieties. So the pushes are the most common, the ones that you all know the best. They're the ones that activate

85
00:11:41.290 --> 00:12:02.850
NSG: a problem, you know, like, I'm reacting to something I need to make progress. My tire popped. I need to replace it. I need to get a new one. Now, when you think of pull comparatively, that's more of an aspirational energy. That's what's drawing someone towards a better way of of living or thinking. So from a b 2 b context. When I think about.

86
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:21.289
NSG: you know a business problem that can come from from top down, or be all types of things that are very obvious and on the nose a pull is more of this makes me better, even if what we are right now is okay. So there could be a combination of those forces at play. And then for habit and anxiety.

87
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:33.880
NSG: these forces, when you start to categorize these when you're conducting your interviews. And you're sensing someone talking about a habit or an anxiety that's usually something that keeps them in their way of doing things

88
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:51.679
NSG: right? So you're you're gonna plot something like, we don't want to switch operating systems, or we're not interested in adopting new software, even if it makes us more efficient because we've been burned in the past because we've hired other things that have been problems that we've had to that have gone away. They've been too early stage startups, and they're too finicky and unreliable.

89
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.710
NSG: So when you have these different forces that you're kind of categorizing.

90
00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:04.409
NSG: this part of it is done. Post interview, whereas the timeline is what I am actually documenting while I'm interviewing.

91
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.139
NSG: So this is kind of a 1, 2 punch.

92
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.479
NSG: So once you've done the interview. Usually they take 20 to 30 min.

93
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.800
NSG: You spend another 10 to 15. You always bury in

94
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:27.230
NSG: debrief time into each of your jobs to be done. Interview like sessions that you schedule, and the debrief is usually with at least one other person. You don't want to do it on your own ideally, because you want to have somebody to talk through things with.

95
00:13:27.735 --> 00:13:31.500
NSG: That's when you start to plot the forces. And you ask yourself, what did we hear?

96
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:45.779
NSG: And you start to categorize them, and you have debate. Sometimes there's nuance, and they might fit into more than one category, and you have to decide which one is more appropriate. That you would categorize a certain aspect of the conversation or anecdote or quote.

97
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.119
NSG: But ultimately, what you're looking for is energy.

98
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:59.319
NSG: You're trying to find that emotional energy of what's in their story. So usually, what happens in the timeline when I'm having these interviews is something really interesting will come up

99
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.209
NSG: that they'll get animated about. There'll be more motion, or it'll seem more significant. And I'll zoom in

100
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:21.040
NSG: just like when I'm doing video editing or something like that. And you zoom in on the timeline. You zoom in on their story, and you get them to unpack even more details and elaborate. So this interview technique isn't going to be easy and not everyone's going to be good at it. But over time all of us will become more proficient together.

101
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:48.620
NSG: And then, lastly, when I talk about energy, there's like a few dimensions to it. So there's social, functional, and emotional forces that are all at play with each person that you're going to speak to, and with that in mind they all matter, and they all have different degrees of importance depending on the circumstance. So social is going to be, how it affects other people, and how others might see me at this company, or in this context. Does this make me the hero? Does this make me the villain?

102
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:58.020
NSG: If I hire this software to make this progress? Will it eliminate jobs. Will it make my job better? Will it make me seem like I'm I'm more awesome. Or is it gonna replace me?

103
00:14:58.686 --> 00:15:05.459
NSG: Functional? Does it actually do what it says, it will do reliably and well, and then emotionally, which is

104
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:18.750
NSG: probably one of the most powerful components here is, how does it make me feel am I more empowered? Do I feel like excited? Do I feel like I'm going to get more done because I've hired this as opposed to what I was doing before.

105
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:39.909
NSG: So this also maps over to some company company systems. So a lot of the times, the supply side thinking is like rampant, especially early on with techsars, companies, and founders in general. So I do my best to like, pull you guys back towards the demand side way of framing and thinking about these things because there's

106
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:52.789
NSG: ultimate tension between product led growth and thinking. That product and quality product is going to be your saving grace. I actually still believe that, but with more nuance with respect to how you actually frame it to the customer.

107
00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:13.509
NSG: And then the timeline that we talked about maps over time to larger company systems. So if you think about, you know marketing and sales, and how you get people through the funnel and pipeline that maps to the 1st thought, to the passive looking, to the active looking in the timeline for jobs. So you're literally

108
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:28.320
NSG: A as A B as primarily b 2 b businesses. You guys are going to be advantaged, I think, by already thinking in this way and documenting what you're learning about your businesses and your customers this way, because over time, as your business evolves into a full fledged thing.

109
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:34.500
NSG: these processes track, and the part that I haven't had

110
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:53.439
NSG: as much pleasure to do that. I think this class will be relatively unique, and letting me execute is the firing interviews and the post consumption. Is it working? Because what I saw on the base camp thread from you all over the weekend were a lot of people trying to interview interview your existing customers and understand what's working, and what isn't. So that, like

111
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.120
NSG: last phase of this timeline is well primed for that.

112
00:16:56.905 --> 00:16:57.359
NSG: Cool.

113
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.620
NSG: Any questions about this before I move on.

114
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:01.980
Ankur Toshniwal: Yes.

115
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:09.479
Ankur Toshniwal: I am curious about so like, you know, I guess it's like specifically for for us, I guess in this case.

116
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.000
NSG: Okay.

117
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:25.680
Ankur Toshniwal: we have a lot. We have a lot of people who've used our product tried our product, and like a handful who've paid for it what and and so I think we can do a lot of the these activities, I think, for previous users and previous interviews.

118
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:32.610
Ankur Toshniwal: I am curious if there's a version of this that works for like scoping out hypothetical users

119
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:43.020
Ankur Toshniwal: right? Like being able to be like, Hey, I know it's that's kind of like Meta. But the idea there, the the objective of that is like is there a way to think about

120
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.570
Ankur Toshniwal: potential?

121
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:50.989
Ankur Toshniwal: You know customers, or is really the only way to go talk to them, because I feel like the hard part about it is like.

122
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:56.520
Ankur Toshniwal: if you try and talk to everyone you wait to kind of finish this, and you're kind of like rent. You kind of like, you know.

123
00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.860
Ankur Toshniwal: you know, spraying and praying versus like, Hey.

124
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.070
NSG: If you talk to people, you're spraying and praying. But if you imagine who the people are, you're not.

125
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:21.760
Ankur Toshniwal: Oh, well, what I mean is like, if you, if you talk to people to wait to do this analysis right, or to to like, or to to wait to get some kind of breakdown of the thing like, what's the process of deciding who to even talk to you, I guess? And does any of this apply to? Is there some process to that as well.

126
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:29.070
NSG: Oh, yeah, there's a process to it. And we're gonna that's what we're talking about today. That's what I mean. If I do my job. You'll know that by the end of this call.

127
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.369
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, does does any of this apply to that? Or this is purely like on post

128
00:18:35.252 --> 00:18:38.910
Ankur Toshniwal: conversation with with like conservation.

129
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.789
NSG: Yeah. Yeah. So the the power of this technique

130
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.620
NSG: lies in reality, and not in any land of hypothetical.

131
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.490
NSG: So like the notion of like imagining who a user might be and doing.

132
00:18:51.630 --> 00:19:03.480
NSG: having conversations about potential behavior as opposed to actual behavior is something that I am actively campaigning against. Here. I'm trying to basically teach you away from from taking that approach.

133
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:09.089
NSG: Now, if that's what you do. Still, that's all good. But I'm going to show you why you'll benefit

134
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.800
NSG: from analyzing actual behavior, whether it's 1 of your customers.

135
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:19.400
NSG: or whether it's someone who's hired an indirect or direct competitor

136
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.669
NSG: to what it is that you're offering.

137
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.100
NSG: That's what this is all about.

138
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.589
NSG: So, Ankur, what you're what I think, what you're getting at is what I think

139
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:52.600
NSG: is rampant right now and always has been amongst early stage founders and startups, and every now and then a brilliant person has enough intuition and personal experience to still be effective at what you're saying. Right? They can. They can almost imagine into it what the market needs. I did it myself, you know, when I when I started my business, and I tapped into some. I hit a gold mine

140
00:19:52.970 --> 00:20:02.589
NSG: with respect to demand, and like it went viral and top of hacker news all over the world. People heard about my business and all that stuff, and that's great. But that's not something that's easily taught.

141
00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:07.790
NSG: And instead, this is a more scientific, I think process for actually uncovering demand.

142
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.420
NSG: You follow.

143
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:09.990
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah.

144
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:20.339
NSG: Yeah. But but look I, I do want you to hold me accountable, though, Ankar. So if I don't actually address what you're asking me about by the end of this call. I need you to call me out, because I'll make sure I do it.

145
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.230
Ankur Toshniwal: Sounds good.

146
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.799
NSG: All right.

147
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.100
NSG: Any other questions about this before we move on, because I'm going to switch into a different story here.

148
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.650
NSG: All right.

149
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:35.210
NSG: So I just thought I'd show you that I hung out with clay. He's super tall. I'm not that tall, so there's that

150
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:45.090
NSG: And oh, yeah, I think I'm only mentioned this to people who left. He sadly passed away a number of years ago. But when I had the chance to meet with him

151
00:20:45.130 --> 00:21:09.729
NSG: he was actually helping me prepare for a few activities, and one was implementing jobs to be done for startups. Here we are, live and living color doing it because he worked with mostly large companies. But also I got involved in the political arena. Briefly, which I'll tell you a much deeper story about, but he was assisting me a little bit in thinking about how to apply jobs to be done within the realm of municipal governments.

152
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.460
NSG: Anybody know who this guy is?

153
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.599
NSG: Does this face look familiar to anyone? Has anyone seen a video yeah podcast of somebody?

154
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.169
NSG: What's what's his name.

155
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.600
Trina Das: Bob Moistley.

156
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.135
NSG: That's Bob. Yeah, this is Bob. So Bob is

157
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:35.020
NSG: the co-creator of the jobs to be done. Framework. He's the guy whose voice you heard when the mattress interviews are being conducted.

158
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:44.369
NSG: and I have the privilege of sharing a story that is not very commonly shared. Because I know it because I heard it from Bob himself over many years.

159
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.340
NSG: And it starts with these 2 things.

160
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.370
NSG: Does anybody know what these are?

161
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.550
NSG: Specifically?

162
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.700
NSG: What are these?

163
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.129
NSG: Don't speak up all at once.

164
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.539
Chloe Lannert: About Mars, Bars.

165
00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.800
carloscaglia: Honest Nick, as well.

166
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.399
NSG: Oh, which one is which.

167
00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.269
Ankur Toshniwal: Nickers in the bottom.

168
00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:22.990
NSG: Alright, this is great. So Bob was a self-taught engineer.

169
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:30.559
NSG: Was at University of or Michigan State University, and also spent some time at Harvard.

170
00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:41.010
NSG: But when he graduated he's from Detroit. So he's involved in a lot of different companies, especially car companies in the auto industry. But one of his friends was working at Mars, based in New Jersey.

171
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.099
NSG: and they brought on Bob early on. This is like, I think, in the nineties

172
00:22:46.613 --> 00:22:57.629
NSG: to assess the situation because they had these difficult competing products. And Milky Way and snickers were kind of neck and neck and trying to figure out

173
00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:01.309
NSG: whether they wanted to move forward with these products. And how.

174
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.959
NSG: So I'm gonna give you a little video here of one of the

175
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:14.430
NSG: very top I can't remember was Super bowl, commercial or not, but I know it was a very prominent commercial, because when I was a kid I saw it. But here's where the brand stood at the time.

176
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.140
NSG: Can I hope you enjoy that snickers?

177
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.360
NSG: Let me see if, can you guys hear this?

178
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:26.620
NSG: Can I.

179
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.159
Chloe Lannert: You enjoy.

180
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.160
NSG: That snickers

181
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:41.019
NSG: happy peanut! So over chocolate, covered mountaintops and waterfalls of caramel.

182
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:53.319
NSG: prancing new good in the meadow, sings a song of satisfaction to the that's right.

183
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.460
NSG: Alright! So debrief! What did we hear there?

184
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.830
NSG: What's the ad team doing with this commercial?

185
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.740
NSG: What are they selling? Who are they selling to Carlo.

186
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:14.659
carloscaglia: I'm describing the product, just the product and what goes into it, and that kind of selling to

187
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:29.449
carloscaglia: to people who are snacking on it for a moment of joy, and otherwise maybe not that satisfied with with what they're doing, I think if it was positioned out now, it'd be very funny because people would just see the satire in it, but probably back then it was like, he's a corporate

188
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:37.700
carloscaglia: cubicle office job person. And let me just tell you about all the sweet things in here to sweeten up your otherwise dull day.

189
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:43.019
NSG: Right? Right? Okay, that that's that. I I love that interpretation any other comments

190
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:50.080
NSG: cause. They spent a lot of money on this commercial. So I I'd be curious to know if people could actually figure out what's going on and what the job of it was.

191
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.389
NSG: Well for Bob and for us.

192
00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:12.470
NSG: We weren't quite sure, either, so I remember seeing that, and like not really

193
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:25.170
NSG: wrapping my head around who it's for what the energy was, why, it mattered, and nor could they. So sales are struggling. They're throwing shit at the wall. They're trying to figure out a way to make it work, but it's not quite landing.

194
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:31.449
NSG: So Bob leaves the Mars Factory, New Jersey heads way back to Detroit, and on his way back

195
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.220
NSG: he finds his way in an airport.

196
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:43.219
NSG: Now this is where I think it gets really fun. So he is a strange guy, and growing up, his mom gave him a 3 foot rule.

197
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:49.320
NSG: and the 3 Foot rule meant. If he's within 3 feet of someone he can have a conversation with them.

198
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:56.150
NSG: So he found himself in line at a kiosk at the airport, and he saw somebody purchase a snickers.

199
00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:18.310
NSG: so he literally followed them to their gate, observe their behavior, and eventually struck up a conversation to unpack why, they bought the snickers but before that, what he observed this person do is sit down, open up his laptop, devour the snickers bar within about 90 seconds and start typing out some emails. And what the gentleman told Bob was.

200
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.810
NSG: If I,

201
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:28.640
NSG: you know, want to sleep on the plane and take a break. I need to power through some work right now, and I just needed something to hold me over makes sense.

202
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.729
NSG: But now the question came, What about Milky Way?

203
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:41.480
NSG: So Bob went back to the same kiosk. He observed for a while to no avail, and then.

204
00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.650
NSG: when he had a conversation with the person working there

205
00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.439
NSG: realizes they're not flipping any milky ways.

206
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.879
NSG: So when he goes back home

207
00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:59.330
NSG: and he's still puzzling with this issue and looking at the data from the Mars Company and like trying to figure out what's going on. He had a conversation with his wife.

208
00:26:59.819 --> 00:27:06.480
NSG: About like, who's buying milky ways, and and why he can't find anyone in any of these stores who are doing so

209
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:12.500
NSG: turns out she grabs a stool, goes to the kitchen

210
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:22.779
NSG: steps on it, reaches to the back of a cabinet above the fridge, grabs a bowl, pulls out the Milky Way. It says, I eat milky ways. I just don't want you to know about it.

211
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:28.030
NSG: So when he goes back and he looks at the data, it turns out that the competitive set

212
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.810
NSG: for a snickers bar is fundamentally different than the competitive set

213
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:42.460
NSG: for the Milky Way, and they found this out over a series of deeper research and analysis and interviews, but ultimately, just like play with the milkshake.

214
00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:50.110
NSG: Bob with the Milky Way and the Snickers Bar became a very, very important insight for a business that they had contracted with.

215
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.949
NSG: So this is what came of it.

216
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.260
NSG: But yeah, oh, my God!

217
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:58.720
NSG: Oh.

218
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:11.390
NSG: Mike, come on, Mike, what is your deal, man? Oh, come on, man, you've been riding me all day. You're playing like Betty White out there. Ask out what your girlfriend says. Baby eat a snickers

219
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:12.990
NSG: better.

220
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.840
NSG: Hi, I'm okay.

221
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:22.550
NSG: That hurt. You're not you. When you're hungry, snickers satisfies.

222
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.440
NSG: Does anyone remember this campaign?

223
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:44.800
NSG: Yeah, okay, welcome to the party, everyone. So this is what happened with with Bob and Jobs. So Clay and Bob like in these weird, different parts of the world. We've got Mcdonald's. We've got snickers. The irony of, you know Clay bringing up snickers in his talk as well. But what ended up happening is, is

224
00:28:45.430 --> 00:29:01.669
NSG: the the campaign succeeded now. It's not all dedicated to that one insight, but that, combined with a lot of other things, led this company to fundamentally reshape how they think about their competition, and how they identify the needs of their consumers.

225
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:19.709
NSG: So that was like setting off a really cool, like timeline chain of events. And I'll probably have Bob come, speak to you all about the full story, and give you even more of the of the background here. But I know it begs the question like, here we are in Texas, our San Francisco AI companies all B, 2 B.

226
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.979
NSG: What the hell are we talking about? Candy bars for?

227
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:23.550
NSG: Right?

228
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:44.360
NSG: So for me, what's still important about telling you all the origin of these frameworks is because you still get the language and processes of the general idea of tracking consumer behavior and demand. And the domino effect, the chain of events that undeniably cause problems. So I'm going to throw a few more terms at you all here, and then I'll get into some things that I think will help summarize

229
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:54.270
NSG: the deeper dive, resource and book of demand side sales, one on one and then I'll give you a few tips and techniques about how to refine your screening criteria before we get into that.

230
00:29:54.490 --> 00:30:23.819
NSG: So one important nomenclature that we have are big hires versus little hires. So when we talk about a big hire, that's the actual purchase, the little hires are all the other things that customers tend to do with your product or service along the way, and sometimes those become features and separate products in and of themselves. So one really good additional case study for this that came from jobs early on was, is anyone ever use the product? Nyquil?

231
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:34.560
NSG: Okay. So Nyquil is like a cold medicine, right? So it helps you sleep. And also, you know, work on, you know, if you're if you're feeling sick.

232
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.050
NSG: That was the original product.

233
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:45.150
NSG: Couple. Other products came out of it. So turns out that there were people that wanted to

234
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.239
NSG: have cough syrup to be less sick.

235
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.260
NSG: but didn't want to go to sleep.

236
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.620
NSG: They quill turns out there were people who weren't sick

237
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.230
NSG: but wanted help going to sleep.

238
00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.160
NSG: Zql.

239
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:28.380
NSG: So these forks of behavior weren't just already known by the people who made the original product. They had to observe and understand what trade-offs people were making by still hiring the same product to do subpar aspects of the job that they needed to be done. So when you have those different forks for your product or feature set, when you're observing how your users or customers are consuming your product. Keep in mind what those little hires are, and you might need to make flags of that, especially those of you that are doing.

240
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.519
NSG: you know, post purchase interviews with your existing customers.

241
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:58.400
NSG: And the other thing that's really important here, as you think about framing. This is refining your situation, but with context. So when you add a lot more detail to what's going on, sometimes almost too much detail, it allows you to strip away things, whereas I think if you speak in a too high of a level and too broadly, and you try to categorize people before you understand the individuals you're leaving out a lot of important distinguished, you know, insights.

242
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.109
NSG: So the context here is going to be key.

243
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.039
NSG: When I want something to eat.

244
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.910
NSG: Grab a snickers.

245
00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:11.440
NSG: Not quite right you. When you want something to eat. There's a lot of different things that you can do

246
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.800
NSG: to address this.

247
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:18.530
NSG: So how might I refine the job of a snickers bar that goes beyond. I want something to eat.

248
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:26.569
NSG: This is right now an exercise for you on your screening criteria definition. This is what I'm trying to help you learn how to do

249
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.750
NSG: so for snickers, is it when I want something to eat? Or is it something else.

250
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.090
carloscaglia: Something else.

251
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.370
NSG: What is it?

252
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.490
NSG: Give me something. Let's add some more context.

253
00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:49.160
Trina Das: City.

254
00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:56.940
carloscaglia: Well, snickers at that point was just positioning. The the product is like, it's not just about, you know.

255
00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.690
NSG: Think about when I want something to eat like you've had a snickers bar before, right.

256
00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:01.400
carloscaglia: No.

257
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.269
NSG: So when you want a snickers bar, is it when you want something to eat? Or is it some other context.

258
00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:09.169
carloscaglia: No, it's another context. When you feel like you gotta get pumped up for something where you gotta put.

259
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:15.649
NSG: You want to get pumped up. Okay, I like that. So maybe when I'm trying to move quickly.

260
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:18.810
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, they've got.

261
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:19.500
NSG: Better.

262
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.570
Ankur Toshniwal: Trying to reframe it from like a candy to a snack.

263
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:33.119
NSG: Well, I'm just trying to be honest with who needs a snickers right now. And why? Right? So I'm in a rush. I want something to eat. That's the snickers, or is there more? We can do.

264
00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:34.640
Ankur Toshniwal: I'm hangry.

265
00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:40.050
NSG: I'm hangry. Okay, I'm starving, right? I'm really, really hungry.

266
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.630
NSG: I'll give you one more

267
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:50.199
NSG: when I'm in a rush. I'm starving. I need something I can eat with one hand while I'm on the go, and I'm not sure when the next time I'll be able to eat is

268
00:33:51.740 --> 00:34:11.170
NSG: so what I'm here to tell you is that all of most of you for your screening criteria that you submitted to me over the weekend are in categories, one or 2 up here. You're either when I want some to eat or when I'm in a rush. I want something with how well you've described the situation that your users in for? Why you'd want to talk to them or interview them. It's not enough to say I want to interview my customers.

269
00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:24.029
NSG: or I want to interview people who fit into these categories or have these titles. You have to give us a lot more color for who they are. Why, you want to talk to them specifically and not just everyone who fits into that category.

270
00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:35.109
NSG: There's a subgroup of people. There's 10 people you want to talk to that fit a certain profile where, given their context and situation, it's going to tell you more about a much larger group of people that you want to get to know

271
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.980
NSG: hopefully, this is starting to make sense.

272
00:34:41.989 --> 00:35:08.699
NSG: So the notion of a job story like a user story, is the idea of focusing on the context and the causality and the motivations as opposed to what we tend to do, which is make assumptions use a lot of our subjectivity. Implement, you know, personas and a lot of our ideas of what we think customers are and what they need and what they want and what we've anecdotally heard. But we haven't done the proper assessment

273
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:13.530
NSG: to compare and contrast data across a normalized set of screening criteria.

274
00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:26.309
NSG: So these demographic things they can be helpful and important, but it doesn't explain why Peter ate the snickers 30 seconds to buy and eat something that's going to stave off hunger for 30 min is what?

275
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:51.139
NSG: So just know that like while the demographic information you still need to capture and keep track of, and once you're larger and at scale, and you can use this large data set and these insights and surveys to get valuable information at this stage of the startup. Most of you only have a handful of customers. So you're gonna have to do something else to get gather the insights you'd need to double triple and 10 x those numbers over time.

276
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:58.000
NSG: So few principles that I'm going to extract from the book to save you all time from having to, you know, read the whole thing right now.

277
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:21.729
NSG: One is people buy for their own reasons. So it's not just your product or service. It's their progress. We've talked about that, you all being the bridge. The other thing that I really want to push back against is when people shrug their shoulders, and you kind of give up on the why, you know, you either think it's common sense, or you kind of take it for granted. Sometimes when you're in interviews, you tend to fill in the gaps.

278
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.689
NSG: and they'll say like

279
00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:40.880
NSG: language or a word that makes sense to you, and you'll just kind of take their word for it rather than asking them to unpack it and explain more about what's going on. So down to the action level of, you know, the the causal reasons for why someone does. A certain thing is really really important to obsess over

280
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.500
NSG: and then ultimately, the struggle creates demand. So

281
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:51.730
NSG: the idea is that like, if they're not struggling like, if it's an easier purchase or nice to have

282
00:36:51.970 --> 00:37:08.159
NSG: while you can gain insight. Still you will gain far fewer than the people who actually had to go through a painful moment. So the people who have more energy, the people who are in need of the most progress amongst your customers. So you have a group of users or customers, and some

283
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:15.479
NSG: had their hair on fire, and others experienced like a mouth inconvenience, and you had to do more to convince them to get over the line.

284
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:22.649
NSG: you might be inclined to understand the ones that you had to do more to convince, because there's probably more of them to secure.

285
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:30.709
NSG: But the ones who are the smaller group that have more of a burning need might be better to serve early on as your beachhead. For this reason.

286
00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:51.540
NSG: so we talked about who to interview. And one thing that I like to do is I assign a customer success story you all. I didn't ask you to do this, but just knowing the base camp to do list that I'll activate for you. This assignment will be in there. The notion is that before you go about your interviews. Talk about what you think success already looks like for your

287
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.079
NSG: persona, for your imagined customer, and what you already know.

288
00:37:55.549 --> 00:38:03.640
NSG: And then, when you break that down? You can answer these questions, what problem are they facing? How does it impact their lives? Why is it significant? Yada? Yada.

289
00:38:04.124 --> 00:38:33.209
NSG: but I'll move forward to this other section, talking about current solutions. So when you think about indirect and direct competitors, we've talked a lot about food products now. But we need to switch over to your context. It's really helpful to, I think, borrow the language that Clay shared in his milkshake video, which is in language that you can understand. What job are you hiring this to do and think about the last time that you hired something different to do the same job.

290
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.610
NSG: That's the key question for many of you.

291
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:47.120
NSG: So the folks that you interview who are your customers who are doing something before, if you can find out what they were doing before and what the purchase story was for that product compared to yours. That's gonna be gold.

292
00:38:47.540 --> 00:39:00.760
NSG: So your initial scoping interviews for the screening criteria that you all shared that could actually help you further refine it. So sometimes, when I start off with the jobs to be done, interview at this stage with these cut with you all.

293
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:18.040
NSG: you'll realize that you think you're going into doing a round of 10 interviews. But you do your 1st one or 2, and then you'll learn. You need to switch it up and refactor your criteria, refocus it because you almost had it. But it wasn't quite the right subgroup of people to talk to or the right learning question.

294
00:39:18.553 --> 00:39:30.579
NSG: I also enjoy this process because it's creative. It can seem really annoying and hard to find people who fit even more specific criteria. But it's certainly doable and if you don't have

295
00:39:31.026 --> 00:39:50.919
NSG: customers to interview, and instead, you need another way to do it. There's a few other tools that we can share with you all that'll help you identify users who fit that criteria. There's a website called Respondentio, that we tend to recommend, that allows you to include certain parameters of criteria, of who you want to talk to and how to find those interviewees.

296
00:39:51.480 --> 00:40:16.049
NSG: So we talked about learning objective. So you all kind of know about how that goes. So I'll skip over that part and jump to screening criteria. But again, it's the people who have the most energy that you should be targeting first.st So when I pull up the basecamp thread at the end of this and talk through what you all have shared. I'm curious to know if we can refine this in in real time, because there's going to be a group of people

297
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:22.799
NSG: that are nested within the group you defined, that are the most fervent, the people who are like shut up and take my money.

298
00:40:23.164 --> 00:40:32.550
NSG: So those are the folks that we want to talk to 1st and get to know first.st because by understanding their energy it could bleed over into insights for the larger categories.

299
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:50.020
NSG: So remember, 100 people is not what we're trying to do. We're trying to do 10 10 to 15 is is more than enough for this. And then the other thing that I think Ankar was asking about before. So excuse the language here. But one thing I I heard from Bob was bitch and ain't switching.

300
00:40:50.200 --> 00:41:00.459
NSG: So the idea is that if someone's dissatisfied with something and they're complaining about it that's worth noting and paying attention to. But if they haven't changed their behavior or switched out.

301
00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:26.749
NSG: still, not quite what we're looking for at this stage. We want people who've actively fired or hired something to make real progress as opposed to people who are signaling either dissatisfaction or complaint, or, you know unhappiness now, again, as founders of businesses where you have to run customer service properly important to pay attention to that energy. But it's also important not to be too flippant, and to change

302
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:36.440
NSG: priorities as a business or just features or kowtow to certain things until you've actually done the work to understand what's really going on, and whether there's an actual problem.

303
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:47.749
NSG: So again, not about demographics. And I have a few examples to kind of, remember, you know how to compare the screening criteria. So here's a screenshot from demand side sales that, I think summarizes it really. Well.

304
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:59.329
NSG: So what I saw are certain demographic categories from some of you. Right? So college students with busy and stressful schedules. Okay, that's decent. But college students who started going to therapy within the past 6 months

305
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:05.230
NSG: gives you an even better version of who you want to talk to with more context and specificity.

306
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.490
NSG: Do you understand the difference?

307
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:17.000
NSG: So I'll talk through the other 2 so clinicians who treat a specified condition versus clinicians who have recently hired an assistant to better treat the condition.

308
00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:24.239
NSG: So again, anchor on the higher the moment of purchase the action that they took and based on the action that

309
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.870
NSG: completes the profile.

310
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:54.519
NSG: Maybe one or 2 of you got this right, I think when you submitted for those who submitted in the thread. But again, this will be the key thing to go back and look at, and I'll drop this in somewhere, in all these slides for you all to have access to forever. And then, lastly, people who are curious about cryptocurrency or crypto, curious people versus people who recently bought their 1st crypto. So it's always making a real purchase, not the hypothetical notion of having an issue or fitting a certain profile.

311
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.190
NSG: Ankar, is this helpful.

312
00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:58.970
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah.

313
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:06.719
NSG: And then for all of you, since we're all b 2 b here, businesses don't buy. People do.

314
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:29.579
NSG: So. Understanding the decision maker and some of the other layers of influence for the decision maker, like many of you, probably also have to deal with the champion or activate a champion within your your workflow. Is going to be key as well. It's really really painstaking sometimes for B, 2 B, because businesses are sometimes hard to navigate and get people to talk to you.

315
00:43:29.953 --> 00:43:48.529
NSG: And if you have to talk to multiple different, you know, stakeholders that can take up a lot of time. So the advice that I have there for those of you in that situation are to focus on the ultimate decision maker as a priority and then work your way through the chain of some of the other parties that are involved along with the actual users.

316
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.970
NSG: So, to summarize the process.

317
00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:58.030
NSG: we frame the learning questions which you've done. We've identified who we want to screen as potential recruits. We'll refine this today.

318
00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:05.019
NSG: You conduct those individual interviews 20 to 30 min each with a 10 to 15 min debrief, 10 to 15 of those

319
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.569
NSG: you do the debriefs

320
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:24.259
NSG: you do an analysis of patterns. This is where it gets a little fancy. So there's a lot of ways to do the analysis. But the very simple way is to look at all the data, start to combine and cluster, and based on the clustering. You have a conversation to draw, certain insights that have implications for sales, marketing, and product.

321
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:31.390
NSG: You do a detailed of the jobs to be done. So you all saw this with Jake from zest on Friday, where he has a write up

322
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:51.480
NSG: for why people leave, why people stay what people hire. So all of you eventually should have some sort of company document. So as you bring people into your business, you can explain to them. Here's what we do. Here's who our customers are. Here's how we serve them. And here's the process that we go about to continue learning and and painting a better picture of our evolving customer base.

323
00:44:52.490 --> 00:45:06.420
NSG: And then, lastly, implications and opportunities for prototyping. So my, this is my favorite part, but this is like the candy at the end. This is like dessert at the end of the meal. This is when you get to go. Okay, we have all these insights we did all the work. Let's do all of the good things with it.

324
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:12.860
NSG: One very simple test here is to once you have your detailed jobs to be done in insight.

325
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:21.140
NSG: Go to your homepage and ask yourself, are we addressing the job to be done with how we introduce ourselves to people when they land on our website.

326
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.979
NSG: So that's 1 very simple exercise. But a much deeper one is going to be

327
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:33.690
NSG: major product, overhaul different prioritizations and changes, different bets that you'll make on certain sprints of of key features that you want to build out.

328
00:45:34.229 --> 00:45:42.900
NSG: Yeah, a lot of a lot of people have pivoted their businesses entirely after having gone through this journey with us and doing the job. Speed on analysis.

329
00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:51.089
NSG: The way you need to think of yourself as you're conducting. The interview is kind of like you're either a detective or a journalist.

330
00:45:51.540 --> 00:46:00.929
NSG: So the notion here is not. You're an entrepreneur. You're a CEO, you're a founder, and you're you're a business that's not our job. In this context, our job is to discover.

331
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:13.759
NSG: So we're not here to sell or promote our product. We're not trying to cross promote you know, an acquisition play here or a double dip instead, we're extremely disciplined and focused that we are researchers

332
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:31.399
NSG: in this context. Now, it will be tempting. Because you, when you hear their stories as you're doing the interview, you're gonna go. Oh, man, they really need my my product, or if it's an existing customer, you're gonna say, Oh, man like I can make this one change for them, and it'll be fine, or I can explain how that works and why it's a problem, and then they'll be better off.

333
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:36.499
NSG: I beg you to fight the urge to do that, and instead make a note of it.

334
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:46.730
NSG: and either at the end of the call, when you're done with your interview, or as a follow up address, all the things that you want to put the CEO or founder hat on to talk to your customer about.

335
00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:48.420
NSG: Okay.

336
00:46:50.020 --> 00:47:06.019
NSG: I have this problem. Every single program I've run where I have founders. And when I look at their data, and I look at the interviews and the Transcript, and I see them very slowly but surely starting to talk about and promote themselves on the call rather than redirecting their focus back to the customer.

337
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.289
NSG: Now, sometimes you have customers that are so good.

338
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:16.170
NSG: They love you. So they want to talk to you about their ideas for what they think you should do or where they need your help.

339
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:46.129
NSG: That's okay. And it's important to be gracious about how you handle that. But you should remind them, hey, we're talking to you for this reason to gain these insights to find more people like you, and to better understand your needs. I'd love to address that, either at the end of the call or in a follow up. But I wanted to stay on. Course here. There's language like that that you can activate that's really respectful to your users. That is really important to just maintain, so that you focus on the insights you want to gain as opposed to

340
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.369
NSG: business sales, progress or customer service.

341
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.329
NSG: Does that make sense

342
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:59.220
NSG: alright. Everyone's with me. I got it good. Alright! See a few other things. Why, I use it. There's a few really cool like

343
00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:24.439
NSG: organizational leadership aspects to having jobs to be done integrated into your business. So one it allows for distributed decision making. So it really helps everybody on your team understand whether we're actually doing the right thing or not? Are we working towards the job that needs to be done for our customer? There's so many businesses at this stage that don't have alignment with everybody on their team for what they're there to do and who they're serving, and what ultimately defines success.

344
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:28.339
NSG: So having this is like super helpful at that level.

345
00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.080
NSG: directing our resources in the right way.

346
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:41.779
NSG: are we prioritizing and spending our time on what ultimately matters for our customers and for our long, like long term, success as a business or not having the jobs, insights, reinforces this in a big way.

347
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:57.220
NSG: It's also inspiring to know that you're actually delivering on what your customer actually needs. It's a very empowering thing. Good culturally activates a lot of really, really exciting kind of reflections as a team. And then ultimately, you're measuring the right thing.

348
00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:11.240
NSG: So you're focused on developing kpis and metrics that are around customer success as opposed to maybe some things that are either, you know, lagging indicators or vanity metrics which founders tend to do early on to make things look good for investor narratives.

349
00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:22.799
NSG: So this gives you a lot more punch and substance when you're talking to people about what actually works and what your customers actually care about. And and I find Vcs tend to struggle

350
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:36.999
NSG: to actually think of what these are for companies. So it's on you, the founder, the expert in your industry and business to educate investors and other stakeholders about what's important to measure about your customer success and other aspects of your business.

351
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:43.719
NSG: So here's a cool visual. I found many years ago that I think summarizes what I just tried to describe to you all really succinctly.

352
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:50.470
NSG: You interview people who switch from one thing to another. You understand their decision making. And you analyze the forces that made them switch.

353
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:55.870
NSG: That's a very, very oversimplified version of everything. I'm trying to get you all to do

354
00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:16.280
NSG: cool. So we talked about learning objectives and screening criteria. I want to go through it. But I have combined the you know another lecture to kind of skip through this part. But ultimately, what you're gonna do is you're gonna look through your customers eyes. You're gonna see what they see you're gonna hear what they hear. And then you're gonna understand what they mean.

355
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:22.769
NSG: So before I go into you all screening criteria as the kind of culmination here. Any questions so far

356
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.140
NSG: got it all right. Keep going.

357
00:50:33.229 --> 00:50:47.719
NSG: So how do we find people to interview? So I mentioned a few resources and ideas. Do any of you all have any concerns or qualms right now about how you might find the folks that you defined in your screening criteria to interview.

358
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.119
Trina Das: Yes, I am.

359
00:50:56.154 --> 00:50:57.059
Trina Das: Hi!

360
00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.390
NSG: Yeah. Go ahead.

361
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:21.929
Trina Das: Oh, can you hear me? Okay? So I am actually interviewing like radiologists and lab technicians right now. But I'm not really able to reach out to the decision makers of the lab, though we are able to pitch them our product. But to get them to sit on an interview is like really tough.

362
00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:24.360
Trina Das: So I'm not sure how to do that.

363
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.869
Trina Das: So I'm actually able to interview the users.

364
00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:47.950
NSG: Right. So that's fair. I think there's a few options you have. One. I'm not sure to what extent this would be kosher, but it's also helpful to incentivize people to have conversations with you by respecting their time. So one strange enough thing that seems to work is something as simple as an Amazon gift card.

365
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:59.170
NSG: But there are also a few other platforms that help you identify folks that fit that criteria so these 2 platforms. And then there's a few others that you all could probably find tend to work

366
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:25.529
NSG: both for B, 2 B+B to C identification of people to talk to what's great about this group is that I think the majority of you either have customers or on the cusp of having a customer. Which means that I would highly recommend you. Start there if you're not sure where to start but just be careful if you end up using a recruitment platform to make sure that you're very specific. And you like, take extra caution with defining your screening survey.

367
00:52:25.905 --> 00:52:38.330
NSG: Because leading questions tend to send you down the wrong path. People tend to misrepresent themselves, and they'll say that they are or have done something that they haven't if you're not specific enough.

368
00:52:38.673 --> 00:52:43.230
NSG: And the reason being is, you know, these are sometimes paid, and it's worth it.

369
00:52:43.707 --> 00:52:53.479
NSG: But when it comes to the interview itself, make sure that you, you know, include open, ended questions for that survey, and identifying the, you know, screening the recruits.

370
00:52:53.690 --> 00:53:09.820
NSG: And then you can also use your personal networks, which is my favorite way of doing it. So I tend to, you know, identify people on Linkedin or I have a short list of people who I know are connected to folks who fit the criteria, and I'll ask that group if they have anyone that they can refer.

371
00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:21.989
NSG: So it's a lot easier to find people in your network who are related to the problem. But screening for their actual behavior can be tricky. So be really careful to not be too loosey goosey

372
00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:39.590
NSG: about who you're talking to, and think something counts as kind of like a jobs interview, even though it doesn't like they almost purchased it, but they didn't, or they use it for a second, but then they dropped off. Or you know, there's there's all these like weird little corners you could cut with this criteria that I try not to do if you can avoid it.

373
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:44.539
NSG: So, as far as framing the interview itself.

374
00:53:44.680 --> 00:54:10.060
NSG: I think going back to the forces and motivations, make sure that they're also in the right, like time that they are grounded at the right timeline because sometimes when you interview people, and it's been 5 years since they made the purchase. You're not going to get the same insights from someone who bought it 3 months ago or 6 months ago or a year ago. So be really mindful of what situation they're actually in, and whether they're they'd be a good fit to unpack information from

375
00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:41.490
NSG: and then I'm calling it an interrogation. But it should feel more like a casual conversation depending on your behavior and style as an interviewee. You're going to have to develop the right technique here, but it can be really tricky. So just know, like, even with the mattress interview, right? It almost got a little too detailed at a few times right where it felt like he was being annoying with the level of specificity he was asking for. I think this may have come up already, but we talked about the specificity of the milk.

376
00:54:41.907 --> 00:54:44.980
NSG: I what was it? The milk? What kind of milk

377
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:54.699
NSG: he bought in in Costco before the mattress. Right? Do you all remember, or can you think of why, he asked, what kind of milk he bought when it's not even related to the mattress.

378
00:54:55.050 --> 00:55:00.660
Meg Hall: Cause. He wanted for that guy to be back in like the the mindset of like where he was that day.

379
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:02.100
NSG: Yeah.

380
00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:14.559
NSG: so these techniques, these interview techniques that I, you know, we're we're learning through this framework. The the origin of them actually came from Bob, having exposure and training through

381
00:55:15.113 --> 00:55:20.479
NSG: believe it was the FBI so literally like this is how like

382
00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:42.619
NSG: actual investigators like conduct, you know interviews, and these are some of the techniques that go into it. But it's the same thinking and then so that's part of it is being mindful of keeping things like a casual conversation. So you're being really friendly. But at the end of the day you're still getting the information you need. The other part of it, though, is humility. So making sure that you know that you're not smart enough to know

383
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:55.169
NSG: what they're thinking, and this is one of the biggest hurdles I tend to try to overcome in working with founders over the years, because you built a business in a category because you know it, and you care about it.

384
00:55:55.360 --> 00:56:12.390
NSG: So it's only natural for you to project your insights and knowledge onto the situation, and how you're analyzing and understanding it. So to the extent that you can mitigate or reduce your own personal bias with your knowledge, and instead focusing on understanding them

385
00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:22.029
NSG: the better off you'll be when it comes to unpacking the insights, because your knowledge isn't going anywhere but gaining insights from them. That's a fleeting opportunity, because you're not going to have a chance to interview them every time.

386
00:56:23.575 --> 00:56:39.119
NSG: Just another simple stated belief about causality. You have to assume. Nothing is random, even if there is such a thing as randomness. Your job in this context is to assume that there isn't, and that I can find out as much as I can

387
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:42.159
NSG: that are causal inputs for what's going on here.

388
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:50.600
NSG: And so long as you have that belief baked into the process, you're gonna get more insights than the folks who tend to fill in the gaps inappropriately.

389
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:56.449
NSG: All right, trade-offs, trade-offs to making progress. So

390
00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:01.009
NSG: what are they willing to give up in order to get the thing that they want.

391
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:05.000
NSG: It's not enough to just have more of something.

392
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:28.839
NSG: And the understanding of those sacrifices and compromises is one of the big tips when you're conducting these interviews. So really making sure that you have the right language, and you're arming yourself with the right kinds of questions that put you down the path of understanding what they were willing to do before, or what they were giving up, or what concessions they made to tolerate the existing behavior until they hired your solution.

393
00:57:30.449 --> 00:57:44.710
NSG: They'll tend to tell you in the interview. Oh, well, here's why I did this, or I know I did that, or maybe one of you in the past week purchased something, and when you talk to a friend significant, other, or someone else about it, you told them. This is why I bought it.

394
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.010
NSG: and you have full confidence that you know why you bought that thing.

395
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:49.810
NSG: I guarantee you.

396
00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:59.539
NSG: If you run the process and you have someone else ask you a few more questions about what went into your purchase. More will be unpacked. That you weren't immediately thinking of in your head.

397
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.160
NSG: It happens to everyone. It happens to me every day.

398
00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:19.819
NSG: and I think understanding that is going to help each of you have a much better process and empathy for the people you're talking to, and not give them the benefit of the doubt that they're telling you the truth from the onset, because everybody lies, even if they don't intend to.

399
00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:23.659
NSG: I bought this product because it's important to be healthy.

400
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:30.410
NSG: for example, right? And it's like, Okay, well, what do you mean by that? And when you start to unpack what people mean.

401
00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.020
NSG: there's something

402
00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:40.790
NSG: where people are almost willing to lie to themselves about what's going on, or their their reason for doing something or purchasing something.

403
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:51.436
NSG: So you have to be mindful and empathetic that that will happen. And in. And we're not going to be judgmental at all. We're just curious to understand what might be going on. But I'll give you a

404
00:58:51.950 --> 00:59:01.705
NSG: a very strange example. So I was conducting these switch workshop jobs to be done. Interviews like 10 years ago in Detroit with Bob, and we had a woman who was

405
00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:05.479
NSG: who had purchased a set of storage from crate and barrel.

406
00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:15.220
NSG: and we were unpacking. Why, she bought the storage units, and it turns out that she purchase them

407
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:21.420
NSG: unbeknownst to her husband, and had them moved in and installed

408
00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.459
NSG: while he was away at work.

409
00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:33.209
NSG: They have kids, and from discussion, what we learned from these interviews was that

410
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.600
NSG: what she really wanted was to see her kids.

411
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:45.829
NSG: in the evening, while she's preparing dinner in the living room, and she wanted the toys to be stored in the living room adjacent to where she could see and hear them.

412
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:52.609
NSG: turns out that her husband did not want to do this, and instead wanted the kids toys to be in the basement.

413
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:56.189
NSG: because after a long day of work, when he comes home.

414
00:59:56.350 --> 01:00:02.160
NSG: he wants more peace and quiet in the living room, and to just focus on having a family dinner.

415
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:09.630
NSG: As we were conducting this interview and unpacking more and more of the story and getting more color, it became really clear to us

416
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:12.380
NSG: that they were having marital issues.

417
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:22.630
NSG: and it went well beyond the notion of the product itself being purchased because they were having a deeper debate about whether they wanted to be around their kids

418
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.050
NSG: during the evening.

419
01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:27.920
NSG: So I have to say, you have to use your power for good, and you have to know

420
01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.820
NSG: when to switch it up and when to pull back.

421
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:35.679
NSG: because I've had a few times where I've done jobs to be done, interviews where you get a little too close to the sun.

422
01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.089
NSG: like I've literally had people cry.

423
01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:51.500
NSG: you know, on the call. So just know that, like you have to be really, really respectful and mindful of the human interest here, because every now and then you'll get deep enough where you're in, even in b 2 b, someone's like, I just don't want to lose my job.

424
01:00:52.310 --> 01:01:02.950
NSG: you know, like, this is the cover my ass kind of purchase like I don't even. It's not even about what it does fully. It's more about the fact that by having it, it covers something that's deeper and more emotional for me.

425
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:10.199
NSG: So just be mindful of all of that. All right. A few more tips for the interview itself, and then we'll get into you. All's submitted work.

426
01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.689
NSG: Have more than one person on the call.

427
01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.390
NSG: Very important. The reason being is that you want one person who's the driver

428
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:21.510
NSG: and the other person who's the notetaker and navigator.

429
01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:51.369
NSG: So what helps with this is that one of you is really, really focused on what questions you're asking and how you're driving the conversation. And the other person has the ability on the back end to kind of be mindful of the timeline as they fill it out identify things that you haven't asked questions that you still need to go deeper on insights that are still missing, or really interesting thing that we like. The interviewer who is driving may have glossed over, but the other person that that's helping you might be able to illuminate and say, Hey, check this out, or actually, we should go back to that

430
01:01:51.704 --> 01:01:59.930
NSG: you can also fight with each other, which is good, meaning, not arguing with the interviewee themselves, but instead, you all disagree about something that you heard

431
01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:06.009
NSG: like. No, I actually think that they meant this. No, what I heard is that. And then you look at them and go. What do you? What what did you mean?

432
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:13.880
NSG: So it gives you a little bit of a buffer to have more of a dynamic unpacking of insights from the person that you're having a conversation with.

433
01:02:15.611 --> 01:02:19.628
NSG: It's also essential that you record the call.

434
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:28.479
NSG: we, you know, there's all types of tools. If you all need to help each other with that. Let me know, really important, that you do this. Ask for permission. It's almost never a problem.

435
01:02:28.984 --> 01:02:45.109
NSG: Most of the time. They don't even think about it. Don't think it's a big deal. You have to give them assurance that it's not going to be used for any other purpose than your research and your interviews, and that their information will be kept confidential. But yeah, other than that, you should be able to have that insight, and it's really important, because

436
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:50.289
NSG: once you do your debrief, you'll end up having a conversation with whoever you were in the interview with.

437
01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:53.960
NSG: and people tend to disagree on what you heard.

438
01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:05.859
NSG: Well, I heard this, or I think they said this, and they're like, Okay, well, let's go back and listen, let's verify what we heard. And if for some reason the interview itself and the recording of it isn't enough, what do you think you should do next

439
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:13.930
NSG: any thoughts.

440
01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.720
NSG: What do you do if the insights from the interview? Still leaving a begging question, there's something missing from the data that you want to capture.

441
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.780
Meg Hall: Just email them afterwards.

442
01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:32.390
NSG: Follow up exactly like, call them back. Say, Hey, we. We just have one more question to ask you or send them an email. Follow up just to clarify one more thing.

443
01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:41.300
NSG: It's amazing to me how many people don't do that so really important that you know that it's not a big deal to call someone back just to verify something that you heard

444
01:03:42.725 --> 01:03:57.500
NSG: phone more important than video. So I like, this is also counterintuitive people like to have video calls, especially because it feels more personable with your customers and whatnot for jobs to be done. Interview absolutely, not much more effective to be by phone.

445
01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:14.610
NSG: You're not worried about what someone looks like. You're not reacting. They're not reacting and worried about how they're coming off to you. It's more focused on the actual story and chain of events, and less focused on some of the more distracting elements. There's also an extra added benefit, because it's going to be 2 of you on the call.

446
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:21.270
NSG: If your video mute off, that means that you can make gestures to one another.

447
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:45.810
NSG: you can have a separate conversation. You can react to something that's happening on their end, unbeknownst to them that could potentially help you dig deeper and gain more insights as you go. You can go on mute and like comment about something, or go ask about this next or this is really interesting. So it's a really good collaborative means as well, and and I just honestly like frankly like, prefer phone for the most part, unless it's a more. You know, a session like this.

448
01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:54.800
Ankur Toshniwal: 1 1 question about that. So I think it makes a lot of sense after like kind of thinking about it. Sometimes

449
01:04:55.460 --> 01:05:01.560
Ankur Toshniwal: it's not. I don't know. Like if someone asked for it or for like a video call, and it would be just like awkward to like

450
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.440
Ankur Toshniwal: not put your video on right like, if they have it on. Or do you just kind of like, say that upfront.

451
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:21.979
NSG: Ask like, Hey, like, you know, we we prefer to do this video off. I think it'll allow us to just focus on the conversation, and you know there's there's a lot of ways to do it honestly, but it shouldn't be too big of a deal. Now, if it is important to them to be on video if that would make them more comfortable.

452
01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:27.470
NSG: do it, you know, like, get the progress. But I think by and large you should default to no video.

453
01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:41.299
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, just to give an example. I know, it can be kind of awkward to do video off with the assumption that everything is video on these days. How Jake does it on his calls is he'll join the call camera on.

454
01:05:41.300 --> 01:06:01.960
Chloe Lannert: Give the spiel about the research and what he's trying to accomplish like talks through the learning question a little bit, and the the moment they're trying to interview around, and then he'll say, me and my co-founder are going to go camera off, so we don't lead you with our faces. You're welcome to keep your camera on. Turn it off, whatever but he, like blames himself, and is like, I don't want to affect.

455
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:12.269
Chloe Lannert: You. Got like your opinion and your responses with my face, and then it's a really quick. Everyone goes camera off. You still have the moment of connection face to face. But then the interview is done. Camera.

456
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.570
Ankur Toshniwal: Appreciate it. That's really helpful. Thank you.

457
01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:16.279
NSG: Solid. Thank you, Chloe.

458
01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:17.330
NSG: Very good.

459
01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:39.109
NSG: alright. Few more things. One. We talked about taking notes again making sure that you're taking real time notes is key. A lot of people prefer handwritten. It seems to work a lot and and and really good for a lot of people. I'm actually a not handwritten person because I hate my handwriting. So I tend to do mine. I tend to type it out. But either way.

460
01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:40.740
NSG: whatever works.

461
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:54.110
NSG: and then ultimately the debrief. So timeline Jtvd statement, a list of you know the forces of progress. Malas, you're going to learn about that. MALA. Stands for more about less about.

462
01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.200
NSG: That is a way for you to plot what they're

463
01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:08.249
NSG: energy and needs were more about as opposed to what they were less about. So what were the trade-offs here? So you're literally like mapping out the contrast? In the energy.

464
01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:20.689
NSG: So for your 1st interview, just to give you a little brief, like kind of overview here. You got this from the mattress interview, too. But you introduce yourself like Chloe just said what Jake does.

465
01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.319
NSG: Thank him for taking the time to talk to. You ask for permission to record.

466
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:43.480
NSG: You set expectations. No, right or wrong, answers we're gonna ask very like a specific hyper. Detailed questions, you know. Forgive us for that if you can't remember something that's okay. And also, this is the other important thing, because customers tend to ramble. Interviewees tend to talk for a while about a lot of stuff, and they get really excited to do it.

467
01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:56.959
NSG: Be mindful of that. You're gonna potentially interrupt them from time to time, and it's not admit out of any disrespect, but more so. Just there are times. I want to interrupt you, to clarify something, or to make the most out of your time.

468
01:07:57.230 --> 01:08:11.779
NSG: so you make sure you do it in a respectful way. But be mindful. This will be important when it comes to making things sufficient, because I I have heard a lot of anecdotes and stories of founders that feel so bad they don't want to cut their customers off and end up having an hour long interview.

469
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:28.699
NSG: Right? And that's not a good use of most of you. All's time. Every now and then, if it's going good and you like it, run with it. I have had founders. Tell me examples of interviews that go along, and they end up, you know, interviewing somebody that becomes a customer and stuff like that which is cool. But just make sure that you have organization around the process.

470
01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:34.269
NSG: By the way, Claire was, I'm not monitoring the chat. So if there's anything in there that's important, feel free to bubble it up.

471
01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:34.669
Chloe Lannert: Yep.

472
01:08:34.994 --> 01:08:44.730
NSG: Again. Focus on energy. Walking. You know people through their day when they purchased it, the moment of purchase working backwards, getting the context and the story around it.

473
01:08:45.090 --> 01:09:08.390
NSG: and and then also a few other examples of like comparative questions here. So why do it virtually? Why not get into your car and drive to the doctor. That's very specific. So if you ask one question that could be seen as generic, but you follow up with a few other refining elements to it. That's great. People tend to, unfortunately, in interviews. Just ask a vague

474
01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:16.959
NSG: question without giving more narrow specificity or context, and that could limit where the customer goes with what they have to say to you.

475
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:32.059
NSG: as far as what they say in response, like, oh, something was fast or installed fast. It installed fast in just under 2 min. The last program took 5 min to install. So if all you hear is it installed fast? Follow up. Okay, well, what do you mean by fast

476
01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:39.899
NSG: as fast 10 min, 5 min, 1 min. So always asking probing questions that give you more context

477
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.449
NSG: to all those dimensions of functional, dimensional, functional, emotional and social dimensions. That's gonna be key.

478
01:09:47.825 --> 01:09:51.600
NSG: I bought this new laptop. And it's really good. Well, what do you mean by good

479
01:09:52.084 --> 01:10:06.480
NSG: so the energy and the inflection in their voice, and the the the volume, the way that they say something could even give you more insight. That's noteworthy and worth making note of but just making sure that you don't accept

480
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:12.240
NSG: things at the face, and you've unpacked and zoomed in, and all the right areas that you've identified. Energy.

481
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:36.480
NSG: Why don't you know how much RAM you got versus? I mean? What's RAM, anyway? You know what I mean. So you're trying to level with them. You're trying to almost be conversational as opposed to antagonistic or critical, because every now and then you might question them in a way that could be either judgmental or interpreted as such without your intention. So this is more just like practice language for you to think about how to do that.

482
01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:43.290
NSG: Why were you at the doctor as opposed to? I've got a personal question, and if you don't want to answer it, it's okay.

483
01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:45.359
NSG: But why were you at the doctor?

484
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:56.929
NSG: So there's a way to like go about asking for more sensitive information that's very mindful and respectful to keep them open and comfortable, sharing that information with you. So

485
01:10:57.090 --> 01:11:25.500
NSG: for you all, I think this is actually going to be really key for some of the b 2 b examples we have, because every now and then you're going to ask about something going on in work, and they're not sure what they can say or not say. So each of you all will have to use your own domain knowledge to know what's kosher, and what would be comfortable to frame something as or what they'd be willing to share. I'm thinking about legalese in particular, right? So that's a really good place where there's going to be some nuance with Chris, and how you approach. You know, having conversations with folks about how they're spending their time.

486
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:31.770
NSG: Given that sensitivity. I tend to see that with finance, health, and legal

487
01:11:32.176 --> 01:11:40.760
NSG: as as the big categories where there's even more like resistance. But once you overcome it, and you get good at it. It's like a walk in the park.

488
01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:44.940
NSG: Few more left. Never argue with them

489
01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.860
NSG: like, I said. Argue with each other.

490
01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:53.029
NSG: So this is another reason to have someone else on the call with you, so that you all can kind of play good cop back cop

491
01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:58.990
NSG: as you conduct your interviews, and when it

492
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.020
NSG: you really care about digging in in an area.

493
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.840
NSG: But they're not opening up

494
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:11.509
NSG: right. They're they're closed, or they feel like they have nothing else to say, and you've kind of hit a crossroads

495
01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:18.599
NSG: find another way to get there, but don't push in the exact same way, and just repeat yourself, or ask the same kind of question.

496
01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:19.900
NSG: So

497
01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:38.090
NSG: sometimes understanding and unpacking either a trade off or a comparison, or like Clay said again. Think about the last time you made the same, you had the same need, but you made a different decision or choice. What did you do? Find other ways to move them along the timeline than just sticking with the same set of questions.

498
01:12:39.413 --> 01:12:52.109
NSG: Be really careful going back to what Anker asked about before not to provide any hypotheticals or generalizations. So one question that you all probably have asked in your entrepreneurial career of a customer is, would you?

499
01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.410
NSG: Would you XYZ.

500
01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:04.829
NSG: Are you willing to? XYZ. All of these notions of what they might do in the future as if they're an expert on understanding their own consumer behavior.

501
01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:22.280
NSG: you know, rationally and completely and logically, absolutely not. We make so many irrational logical decisions. Outside of the bubble of the context. So making sure you get all the context to understand that is key. The forward looking conversations are better left, for

502
01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:29.679
NSG: you know Qa. And solution interviews later, when you're trying to test your product. But that's not what we're trying to teach you right now with this

503
01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:58.340
NSG: again, like I said, they're gonna you're gonna have some enthusiastic customers. They're gonna praise you. They're gonna respond with kindness. They're, gonna you know, like they're gonna talk to you about what they love about you, and they're gonna be so grateful. And they're gonna want to help you sometimes to a fault. But you don't want them to do that you want them to be honest with you about what's going on, and not just glaze over what problems might be, because they don't want to either offend you, or all in all, they're happy, so they don't want to talk about what's wrong.

504
01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.390
NSG: That's not what you want here.

505
01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:05.410
NSG: even if it's uncomfortable or embarrassing to hear from a customer about what the what the issues are with you.

506
01:14:06.173 --> 01:14:11.170
NSG: So again, if you catch yourself thinking, that makes sense, stop and ask more questions.

507
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:17.549
NSG: Don't just fill in the gaps with what's in your head about what you already know we call this playing dumb.

508
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.529
NSG: So the idea is that like?

509
01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:23.730
NSG: Even if you know the answer, or what they're about to say, act like you, don't

510
01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:53.710
NSG: ask them to explain it. Ask them to unpack the language of what they mean by something, even if in your head you're like nodding like, Oh, yeah, of course we've seen this before. Don't leave it to chance. Make sure that they explain their version of it, because every now and then language from customer interviews translates into actual marketing sales, copy. It goes into the emails, it becomes the reframing of how we talk about our product or service and how we like sometimes we don't want to.

511
01:14:54.070 --> 01:15:01.089
NSG: you know, cheat and like use a high value concept. So like zest, for example, likes to say that the the Duolingo for cooking

512
01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:25.670
NSG: that's that's tricky, right? Because everyone's saying they're the uber for pets, or the whatever for dogs, or everyone's using some big company to explain their smaller company and not why they're going to be a big company someday. But I think it's really important to use more of your customers language as opposed to your own injected language, and I bet more than half of the people on this call if I pulled up your company website and I asked you, did the customer say that, or did you.

513
01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.870
NSG: It's coming from somewhere else.

514
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:48.339
NSG: So also, like there's moments of disagreement right? Or they'll be really terse, and they'll clam up. Or maybe the person isn't particularly talkative or conversational that tends to happen sometimes in these interviews. One way that really helps open them up is you can repeat what you think you heard?

515
01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:50.980
NSG: All right. So here's the story I have so far.

516
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:58.870
NSG: one really really creative thing or slick thing that Bob taught me as well is. Sometimes you can repeat the story

517
01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.680
NSG: and intentionally get a detail wrong.

518
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:09.710
NSG: So share something that you don't think is correct, like, based on what you you heard and make. Oh, no, that's not what I said, or that's not what I meant.

519
01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.019
NSG: And all of a sudden they now they're even more engaged and like interested in like refining and correcting you.

520
01:16:16.212 --> 01:16:19.589
NSG: But again, product related questioning is

521
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:33.740
NSG: what you all are gonna like. Be very tempted to do. You're gonna start asking about your features, your product, your app, what works, what doesn't certain aspects to it? And again, remember, that's not the point, at least at this phase, and that you'll have a chance to ask them that later.

522
01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:42.340
NSG: So here's a little cheat sheet of some of the questions that could potentially be asked to trigger the interview. But I will say this with a caveat.

523
01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.810
NSG: You should not go in with a script.

524
01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:54.290
NSG: You should not have a set of premeditated questions that you're going to go through and make sure you ask each person that you interview.

525
01:16:54.790 --> 01:17:01.120
NSG: Does anybody know why anybody guess why? I don't think you should have a script or premeditated questions.

526
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.049
Ankur Toshniwal: Probably not listening to them

527
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:12.840
Ankur Toshniwal: like, if you're not like following their like, their train of thought might not follow your particular script, which means you're not actually listening to them. You're just kind of.

528
01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.050
NSG: Exactly. But it's tempting at first, st right? Though, anchor, because, like in your head, you're like, well, I have a normalized data set.

529
01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:25.419
NSG: If I ask all of my same interviewees the same set of questions. Then I'll get really valuable information, because I can compare and contrast right.

530
01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:37.650
Ankur Toshniwal: I think that's why it always makes a difference when, like like, when someone when you actually care about the problem like you're like really engaged versus giving someone else's script. You just can't get the same results.

531
01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:41.210
NSG: Completely agree. So the whole notion of

532
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:46.730
NSG: having a casual friendly conversation with someone to get to the actual insights

533
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:54.899
NSG: is in at at odds with the notion that I have a set of premeditated questions that I'm going to make sure I go through like a checklist.

534
01:17:56.100 --> 01:18:08.250
NSG: So trust me when I tell you that I've done jobs interviews with probably over a hundred different, you know, products or companies. And you know, I've observed and have drawn experience from Bob, who's done over 3,000.

535
01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:13.620
NSG: And given that experience, we're relatively confident

536
01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:16.299
NSG: that you don't like. If you're good. At this.

537
01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:19.730
NSG: the notion of having premeditated questions is, is nonexistent.

538
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:30.700
NSG: so get good at it or refine it, and we're ha! I'm happy to work with you all on this, and you know each of my team members are also trained with jobs and can join you guys for some of those conversations, too.

539
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:36.110
NSG: I heard someone's voice, but I'm not sure who spoke up.

540
01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:48.179
Ankur Toshniwal: Oh, I I was. I was just saying what would be cool is if there was some software out there that could just take that organic conversation and map it directly to a rubric you already have, like.

541
01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:51.490
Ankur Toshniwal: Hey, yeah, someone build that. If this.

542
01:18:51.920 --> 01:19:05.249
NSG: Well, you know, I'll myself a little bit. I'm actively working on what you're describing, right, and I know what you're describing has also already been in part developed in house with with Bob and and team. That being said.

543
01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:14.940
NSG: we have not and will not get close to the level of effectiveness of you humans

544
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:28.409
NSG: talking through the insights at this stage. Maybe it'll happen someday, and it could happen sooner than later. But I will say what I'm trying to get you all to do with this framework right now is one of the few things that you can do

545
01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:33.949
NSG: that isn't as easily replaceable with technology today.

546
01:19:34.810 --> 01:19:44.989
NSG: So you all have an advantage. If you want to leverage this of still understanding the human interest, side context and causality at the early stage of your customers

547
01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:53.149
NSG: that's going to give you a disproportionate, unfair advantage given. How many people are trying to do less to understand their customers today?

548
01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.300
NSG: Antoine.

549
01:19:56.450 --> 01:20:00.520
Antoine: Free tip, do 3 or 4,

550
01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:07.679
Antoine: and then feed them and generate 50 or 100 through a Gen. AI. System.

551
01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:17.589
Antoine: You will, you will see kind of vectors of variability versus vectors of consistency.

552
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:33.579
Antoine: And but but kind of the important thing is, do 3 or 4 on your own, because that that gives you a level of insight and a level of ability to then kind of pass what is generated that's going to be

553
01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.030
Antoine: very helpful.

554
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:42.469
NSG: Or do the whole process manually, and then try to train something to do what you did, and see what happens.

555
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:46.290
Antoine: Yeah, yeah, no, I'm I'm just. I'm just. I'm not saying not to do the whole process.

556
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:46.860
NSG: Yeah, yeah.

557
01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:50.209
Antoine: Saying like you you need, you know the-the-

558
01:20:50.820 --> 01:21:07.469
Antoine: I mean there, there's there's value in in in everything. But but I I do. I do wonder what what it will provide to to just kind of generate a little bit of viability, because that's that's the one issue with this that you go very deep.

559
01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:21.009
Antoine: and then you transfer the extrapolation to how much you can extrapolate from these X number of deep discovery discussions. And and there's there's ways to kind of

560
01:21:21.646 --> 01:21:23.593
Antoine: match or kind of

561
01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:35.520
Antoine: Get a sense of how much you can extrapolate or not. And I I suspect that there's there's a lot that can be do with the done with the Gen. AI. On on that.

562
01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:44.160
NSG: We'll see. I'm curious, and I'm excited to learn more from you all. I would just encourage you not to make any. Don't! Don't. Don't take any shortcuts here.

563
01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:54.290
NSG: It will not serve you. I I guarantee it, and I think the the further down this path you go one way to know that you're doing it right

564
01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:58.959
NSG: is by interview 8, 9, or 10. You all heard Jake mention this on Friday.

565
01:21:59.450 --> 01:22:01.919
NSG: You start to predict what they're going to say.

566
01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:19.230
NSG: So. That's when you know you're cooking when you've done it right is you're starting to have the interviews. And you're like, Oh, okay, they're sliding into this job now, like, okay, they fit into this category. Or this is what's going to happen. So it's a really magical moment when you've done that because that actually tells you that you've done it right

567
01:22:19.630 --> 01:22:24.980
NSG: when you basically start to fill in the information as you're going. And as you hear them speak

568
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:29.920
NSG: so. It's a really cool moment, Anthony.

569
01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:48.990
Anthony De Silva: Yes, hey? Yeah. Just going back to the screening criteria. I was wondering if it's okay for us to, I guess. Like talk to some people from Group A, we're already our customers. And then some people from group Brc, that might be using a competitor's product.

570
01:22:50.540 --> 01:23:01.640
NSG: That's fine. But those are separate. Those are separate initiatives. Okay, so don't treat that like, that's all one jobs to be done process because it isn't

571
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:09.870
NSG: your screening criteria for your existing customers who hired you for a reason with context is different than the group that are competitive products

572
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:12.079
NSG: which might be different than the firing group.

573
01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:21.040
NSG: So it's really important to keep those like kind of data sets separate because you're gaining different insights from them that you're gonna compare later.

574
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:22.130
Anthony De Silva: Yeah.

575
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:25.250
Anthony De Silva: Cheers.

576
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:39.239
NSG: If it were up to me, I would recommend choosing one and going deep first, st and then transferring over to another category rather than trying to grab bag different, you know, context or screening criterias at once if you can avoid it.

577
01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:41.780
Anthony De Silva: Okay.

578
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:44.570
NSG: Aria.

579
01:23:46.200 --> 01:24:05.090
Paria: Yes, thank you so much. For the great information you shared with us, Neil. My question is more very like simple one. Actually the point that you mentioned about like, when you are going to the like to the like details, it's better to have the camera in the offline mode, and just to talk, not make any

580
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:21.520
Paria: kind of any impact on the like, you know the answers. So when you're interviewing, and if you want to like. You are kind of. You start with the like broad scale, and you narrow down your questions and go to the details right? But how should I know? Like.

581
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:49.910
Paria: because people are different sometimes, if you make a lot of so much details, questions from your like customer there, maybe they will be like kind of a little like frustrated, or they don't feel comfortable to to share those type of very much detailed information. And and if I don't see their kind of facial impressions. How can I decide? Shall I proceed with the like more details? Or should I stop here? This is the boundary where I have to stop.

582
01:24:50.240 --> 01:25:19.770
NSG: That's a great question. Yeah. So it'll ultimately be on you to like, feel out how to do that effectively in your own way. Right. Each of us have certain personalities and and styles. But that being said, I think you'll just have to trust me for now that not using video is gonna better serve you to do that. I believe it will. But you'll have to find out. So nothing is gonna replace reps here for all of you like you're gonna have to get into the field and start having conversations, and the 1st ones won't be good.

583
01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:39.250
NSG: It it'll be that like you're gonna stumble over your words. You're gonna say the wrong thing. You're gonna ask the wrong question. You might get nervous, like all those things will happen. And that's okay. My ask is that you throw up a few interviews for sacrifice, and be willing to be wrong or be bad in order to get good, that's all. It's gonna take, though. But you'll get there

584
01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.890
NSG: all right. Neural defend.

585
01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:54.639
Neural Defend: Yeah. Hi, Hi, Neil, I am Shiva here. So right now, we are dealing with one of the client. Okay, so we are kind of educating, and we are kind of creating some awareness about the defects.

586
01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:13.790
Neural Defend: You know. So the client is more you know, surprised. And their system can be, I mean, defeated by the default kind of attacks the thing is like they are more into the problem, and they not talking about how we are. How, as a neuro, different solving the problem.

587
01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:22.559
Neural Defend: So is this any kind of concern because they understand the problem after we showcase, you know, after we after we proved.

588
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:30.990
Neural Defend: And they are more completely into that the problem statement only. And we had only limited conversation on the product.

589
01:26:31.702 --> 01:26:39.659
Neural Defend: And Apis. So how can we? And I just want to know what is the situation of

590
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:44.839
Neural Defend: what is the mindset of the client, and how we can leverage this?

591
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:48.220
Neural Defend: Or are we going the right way?

592
01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:52.950
NSG: So what you want, you want to get more product insights from them than what you've received so far. Is that what I'm hearing.

593
01:26:52.950 --> 01:27:03.270
Neural Defend: No, no, yeah. See? they want to integrate our product. Let's assume that. And they were talking about the problem. Only the problem statement only. But they are not

594
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:04.100
Neural Defend: not paying you right.

595
01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:06.760
Neural Defend: What Neil.

596
01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.879
NSG: They're not paying you.

597
01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:10.399
Neural Defend: They're not not paying us so.

598
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:22.160
NSG: So so my thought would be what you're doing right now with them is fine, like what you're trying to learn, because they haven't paid you. So there, there's not again bitch, and ain't switching right. What I want instead is for you all to interview

599
01:27:22.330 --> 01:27:34.019
NSG: people who have hired an alternative that like neural defend like there's you have competitors. It's a crowded space. Who are some other people that businesses like the one you're dealing with have hired

600
01:27:34.170 --> 01:27:44.689
NSG: and interview them about their purchase decision to go with those companies and those services. Once you unpack those insights, you don't have to do a jobs to be done. Interview with your potential customer right now.

601
01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:54.169
NSG: You can get insights from these other people who've already hired companies like neural defend, and you can apply those insights to better serve the customer that you're trying to close.

602
01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.389
Neural Defend: Does that make sense?

603
01:27:55.390 --> 01:28:02.169
Neural Defend: Okay? Next next question, it makes sense. Actually, the next question is, what if we can't able to find any companies

604
01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.440
Neural Defend: that hired the similar product like new.

605
01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:06.580
NSG: Think that's going to happen.

606
01:28:07.810 --> 01:28:08.700
Neural Defend: Are you gonna let that.

607
01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.440
NSG: Happen.

608
01:28:11.490 --> 01:28:16.780
NSG: There's no one. There's no one else on earth who's ever bought anything like neural defendant. We were studying that we could get in.

609
01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:17.870
NSG: you know, contact.

610
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:20.099
Neural Defend: No, no, of of course they are. They are.

611
01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:20.590
NSG: Okay. Then.

612
01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:21.240
Neural Defend: Join.

613
01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:22.450
NSG: That's the

614
01:28:22.450 --> 01:28:30.029
NSG: so. That's the hunt, though. Just see like this is. I'm so glad you asked. This is the most important point that I want to make during this call for all of you.

615
01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:32.820
NSG: Your competitors.

616
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:34.400
Neural Defend: Hmm.

617
01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:37.739
NSG: Most of them are doing what you're doing.

618
01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:49.829
NSG: which is hoping that they get it right. They're hoping that the the few questions they ask the surveys that they run. The internal conversations and brainstorming of their team

619
01:28:50.050 --> 01:28:52.899
NSG: is all leading into them, making the right product choices.

620
01:28:53.750 --> 01:29:03.739
NSG: There's this uncomfortable path that I'm trying to get you specific 10 companies. The special few to do that most people in your situation will not do.

621
01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.310
NSG: which is the uncomfortable job of having

622
01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:12.829
NSG: non sales product, related conversations with high potential customers

623
01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:16.850
NSG: and unpacking their actual decision-making process.

624
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:21.890
NSG: and what trade-offs that they're currently going through for their struggling moments with their business purchasing decisions.

625
01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:28.530
NSG: So if you all find those people, however uncomfortable, annoying, and difficult it will be. Not only is it good

626
01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:30.620
NSG: proving ground for your.

627
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:36.260
NSG: you know, strength and fortitude as founders who need to fundraise from very, you know, dismissive Vcs.

628
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:41.189
NSG: But it's also going to be really helpful when it comes to your sales, strategy and process and confidence.

629
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:50.819
NSG: So again, like as uncomfortable and as difficult as it might be to find people who fit the right, very precise screening criteria that I've now coached you to define.

630
01:29:51.210 --> 01:29:54.279
NSG: The more specific and the better you do it. Now.

631
01:29:54.520 --> 01:30:00.579
NSG: the more time you'll save, and the more your mind will be blown. I literally got off a call right before this with the founder, who's

632
01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:18.980
NSG: I think he's got 750 k committed on a 3 mil. Round, but he's more excited about the jobs to be done insights he has now than ever before, whereas in program he literally told me this. I hear this from a lot of founders like, I wish I listened to you in program, Neil. I didn't take it that seriously, but now I understand how important jobs to be done is

633
01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:32.920
NSG: like, I've heard that from like, I can't tell you how many companies and founders. So literally, this is the call in session where everyone's kind of like, either passively listening or they're like, Yeah, okay, maybe. Or I'll try, or whatever. I'm not sure how effective this is gonna be.

634
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:41.730
NSG: And then a year from now you'll come back and I'm gonna replay this call at some point for one of you when we're doing one of our little strategy sessions. It'll be great.

635
01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:43.780
NSG: Chris.

636
01:30:46.030 --> 01:31:12.840
Chris Wong: Yeah, I was kind of going in a little bit deeper into that. The question on finding competitor like the direct and alternative competitors. I guess one of the things we struggle with is we're we're going after law firms and for our direct competitors they'd be the automated timekeeper. Using AI, but indirect alternatives would be like manual timekeepers, so manual in the sense of, you know, going and in hearing a time, and then and then entering manually their descriptions.

637
01:31:12.890 --> 01:31:26.920
Chris Wong: I don't know. It's it's a little bit hard to find who's using the direct competitors products for us right now, because, you know, we, we can go online and look at their website and see who's like commented like who did well or who who likes their product.

638
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:43.129
Chris Wong: But from there it's kind of hard finding these law firms. So that's the one thing we struggle with, and I don't know if there's any insights there trying to find these direct competitors? Or should we be really focusing on just kind of manual alternatives? Yeah, this might be a specific, too specific question. But that's the one that we're facing right now. Yeah.

639
01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:44.979
Ankur Toshniwal: Can I ask a question to you.

640
01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:46.689
Andrew Fernandes: We have the same same thing.

641
01:31:47.030 --> 01:32:01.760
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, I I have a question. Maybe you can help us with that, too. So is there? Maybe instead of like a direct competitor is there like a particular workflow or process that defines it? That's like an aggregate of maybe a couple of different things.

642
01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.180
NSG: Who.

643
01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:03.959
Ankur Toshniwal: Right? Like the problem again.

644
01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:04.570
NSG: Yes.

645
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:13.870
Ankur Toshniwal: We under. We we know this exists, too, for what we're solving as well, but we're having trouble putting an exact finger on it. We're kind of going through that same thing. I think, Chris, where it's like.

646
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:17.240
Ankur Toshniwal: we know people do this. We've watched them do it.

647
01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:25.749
Ankur Toshniwal: But to define it, and to put a specific individual product on it is tough. But sometimes I think what we're trying to do is like.

648
01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:35.679
Ankur Toshniwal: define the workflow rather than a particular individual product. I don't know if that exists, for you know, legally as part of it, but

649
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.950
Ankur Toshniwal: that'd be worth.

650
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:37.720
NSG: Go ahead, Chloe.

651
01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:40.250
Chloe Lannert: What are they paying to solve?

652
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:47.400
Chloe Lannert: So, Neil, correct me here? But the process, and, like the starting point, can be different. As long as they're paying

653
01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:51.270
Chloe Lannert: for something new to fix their problem.

654
01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:55.060
Chloe Lannert: I'll I'll let you add more detail. But

655
01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:58.815
Chloe Lannert: the only issue that's standing out to me with those

656
01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:18.469
Chloe Lannert: situations you're bringing up? Is are they paying to change something? Did do they have a switching moment that you can run the interview about? If they do, I think you're set. But if it's just collecting details on their existing manuals process, then you don't have the hiring moment that'll actually lead to to new insights.

657
01:33:18.930 --> 01:33:25.350
NSG: I couldn't agree more, Chloe, that was very well said. The struggling moment is the key to anchor yourself around Chris and Ankar and others.

658
01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:39.349
NSG: regardless of of what the tool is, whether it's indirect direct, whether it's an amalgamation of tools and resources on your side or Chris on your end. If it's hard to navigate in to find which. Firms have hired those specific tools.

659
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.309
NSG: That's the hunt

660
01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:46.289
NSG: that is actually the good part, like, I know it's annoying. But I gotta say, think about it.

661
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:50.859
NSG: Who else on this earth will have that information other than you?

662
01:33:51.400 --> 01:34:01.540
NSG: Right, if you're able to actually find out who these people are, in whatever creative ways you need to, who the customers are of your competitors. But if there's a way for you to figure that out by God, do it

663
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:24.559
NSG: because all of a sudden you're going to know why different tools are being hired for actual reasons rather than the super boring founder matrix of here are all the features that we have that they don't and look investor. We're better because we do more. That's the most generic and most commonplace thing I see from everyone, and I'm not trying to be too antagonistic about it. But, like, do better.

664
01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:30.840
NSG: you know, like you guys should be able to educate your investors, your stakeholders, and your team

665
01:34:31.090 --> 01:34:40.719
NSG: on what the actual nuance differences are not just of your feature set, but of the needs of the consumers that you all are best equipped to serve as opposed to the ones you're not.

666
01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:45.939
NSG: I saw a bunch of people on mute.

667
01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:51.220
NSG: Come at me, Carlo.

668
01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.209
carloscaglia: I was. I was just thinking, hmm.

669
01:34:55.730 --> 01:35:01.821
carloscaglia: I mean, because it's not question. But like crystal, like we've been in very similar situation, cause we?

670
01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:10.560
carloscaglia: We're going almost against very manual processes. And then we kind of go against traditional advertising agencies. So it's very hard for us to figure out. Once

671
01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:19.010
carloscaglia: a brand is with an agency until it's too late that they've committed like a yearly spend to it. And so around this one we've kind of, I guess, found

672
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:25.279
carloscaglia: 2 ways that one of them, if you're fighting against like a manual internal process, is literally just understanding, like

673
01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:31.230
carloscaglia: how much of a pain it is because you can quantify time, and you can relate time to money.

674
01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.070
carloscaglia: But then you just understand, like

675
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:43.070
carloscaglia: the pain that goes into it, and they'll like that face would be like, oh, I just spent so much time looking for this, or like, you just have to filter through an excel. And you're like, okay. Well.

676
01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:49.350
carloscaglia: you realize that? Yes, it's the time. But it's actually just the mental drain that the spending behind that one

677
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:52.139
carloscaglia: and then the other times is sometimes if you just

678
01:35:52.320 --> 01:36:11.830
carloscaglia: reach out to the law firm in your case, not positioning that as a sales message or a sales pitch, but like just saying, I'm working on this. I'm not trying to sell anything. I just wanna find out a few things. Most people actually, really responsive to that. And they just want to help and then they'll give you the information that you need. Really.

679
01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:14.619
carloscaglia: that's 1 thing that we saw when we were getting started.

680
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:19.960
NSG: Super, helpful Anthony.

681
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:29.799
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, I guess not to. I don't know the complication of this, but, as you're aware, you know, we have a nuance, and

682
01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:40.270
Anthony De Silva: who our customers are. Our customer is the home buyer who's paying for it. But you know, sometimes the realtor is like, Hey, I need an inspection like X date for this customer.

683
01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:45.860
Anthony De Silva: So they're the ones who's placing the order or on the customer's behalf.

684
01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:48.600
Anthony De Silva: And we

685
01:36:49.020 --> 01:37:00.769
Anthony De Silva: I didn't identify the realtor as our repeat client, because they're the one they have multiple homebuyers, and they're the ones who are routing the order to us. So as we think about this.

686
01:37:01.450 --> 01:37:07.590
Anthony De Silva: would they all fit into that group a of the customers who are

687
01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:12.289
Anthony De Silva: like we should interview? Or would they be like in 2 separate buckets?

688
01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:17.960
NSG: It sounds like 2 separate buckets, unless.

689
01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:23.209
NSG: like, like, what? What do you think the overlap is between those 2 groups.

690
01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:30.390
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, I think, like, in terms of the progress that they're looking for is like

691
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:37.529
Anthony De Silva: to find out the issues of the home and then to renegotiate the deal and close the deal.

692
01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:42.709
NSG: But it sounds like they have different underlying motivations for what they want.

693
01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:53.060
NSG: Okay, so I would. I would separate those 2 out in in that case, unless, as you start to have those interviews like. So one example of what I would do tactically is, I interview one of each

694
01:37:53.490 --> 01:38:01.710
NSG: and feel it out and go. Okay, this is more similar than different. Or there's a clear difference in how this is going. And then you kind of kind of build off of that from there.

695
01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.620
Anthony De Silva: Got it? Thanks.

696
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:08.610
NSG: Andrew.

697
01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.719
Andrew Fernandes: I think. Carlos said. It can be better to ask for

698
01:38:17.442 --> 01:38:40.570
Andrew Fernandes: feedback or input on on certain questions rather than frame as a sales call, which I agree. Does anyone have tips on how best to do that to increase response rate? Because something I found particularly in the finance space, which is a lot of what we're targeting people are like, I don't have time for this. I don't care what this is. So how do you frame interest calls

699
01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:48.059
Andrew Fernandes: in a way that'll increase response rate. Obviously, being able to provide value is one. But any anything more specific.

700
01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:53.999
NSG: Carla, were you gonna say something?

701
01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:58.619
Anthony De Silva: Andrew. What kind of finance force works were you looking for?

702
01:38:58.990 --> 01:39:00.180
Anthony De Silva: Specifically.

703
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:02.299
Andrew Fernandes: What kind of finance folks.

704
01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:05.950
Anthony De Silva: Yeah, because corporate finance investments or like.

705
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:16.909
Andrew Fernandes: Yeah. So we're largely going after the trading space. So largely quantitative trading primarily in particular, people in data strategy teams at those firms.

706
01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:44.239
Alex Nativelle: I don't know if that's gonna be really helpful for you. But what I found is that if you generally come from a place or like, I'm building this company. I really want your insight. It's gonna be very short. This is not a sales call, and maybe try to incentivize like, like, let's grab lunch. It's on me, or coffee on me, or, you know, like some kind of small gestures, and then really make sure that afterwards you send them a lot. It's

707
01:39:44.490 --> 01:39:46.250
Alex Nativelle: usually working really. Well.

708
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:51.070
NSG: Like that's not like a hack or something. But yeah, just generally coming from the herds, you know.

709
01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:53.189
Alex Nativelle: And people usually love.

710
01:39:53.610 --> 01:39:59.310
Alex Nativelle: They're like, Yeah, go for it. So sometimes it works no finance or others. But.

711
01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:03.530
Andrew Fernandes: It's oval.

712
01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:08.590
NSG: Meg, I noticed you on mute. Did you want to add something.

713
01:40:10.592 --> 01:40:11.918
Meg Hall: Nothing right now.

714
01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.360
NSG: Okay, cool.

715
01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:22.620
NSG: Alright? Yeah, that that's all helpful. I I think that's that's good advice, Andrew. On top of that. Strangely enough at any level. Turns out

716
01:40:23.770 --> 01:40:25.750
NSG: people really dig Amazon gift cards.

717
01:40:26.803 --> 01:40:36.180
NSG: So when in doubt that works, strangely enough, I've never had to do it. But many and many of my founders reported back on that being affected so

718
01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:43.319
NSG: cool. Alright, I'm gonna wrap up here, and then I want some of you. Whoever keep it in your mind. Now, whoever's willing to share

719
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:53.289
NSG: your screening criteria that you submitted in the thread elsewhere, or are willing to bring up and talk through. We'll do a couple of examples to to close out of refining it together as a group.

720
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:58.510
NSG: So once you do your 1st interview, you'll do more, Antoine. Sorry.

721
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:02.330
Antoine: No happy to share.

722
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:07.024
NSG: Okay, got it? Yeah, yeah, we'll we'll we'll activate you first.st Great so

723
01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:12.380
NSG: as you're doing your interviews, patterns start to emerge.

724
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:16.029
NSG: Something tempting is going to happen after you do 3 or 4 good ones.

725
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:18.509
NSG: You're going to want to stop

726
01:41:19.130 --> 01:41:22.440
NSG: and take what you've learned and immediately get to work.

727
01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:31.800
NSG: You're already gonna have an idea. You're already gonna get excited about what you've learned. And you already think you're gonna know what you need to do to address what you've seen.

728
01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.489
NSG: It's really exciting when that happens. But

729
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:38.940
NSG: I just really want to emphasize how important it is for you to stay the course.

730
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:45.159
NSG: stick to the process, get to the 10 to 15, interview like over the line

731
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:47.280
NSG: before you take that next step.

732
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:51.250
NSG: have conversations and discussions with us, or amongst your team, or both.

733
01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:59.010
NSG: because so many people get trigger happy as soon as you realize that this works and you're learning things that you never known before.

734
01:41:59.150 --> 01:42:04.259
NSG: and those insights could become super exciting and infectious very quickly.

735
01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:15.830
NSG: And because you've it's it's it's likely that you really haven't experienced anything like this for your business yet where you know this much about your customers, and the more nuanced aspects of what would be really, really beneficial to them.

736
01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:21.070
NSG: So just stay the course and be disciplined about it. I trust you you will be better off for it.

737
01:42:21.889 --> 01:42:39.269
NSG: Once we do the clusters then we turn them into a few jobs to be done. Statements like you saw with Jake's write up. We have a framework for this that we'll share with you as well, but you'll ultimately walk away with 2 or 3 different jobs that your categories of customers are hiring you to do.

738
01:42:39.690 --> 01:42:43.930
NSG: and you'll have to come to this really important decision point of.

739
01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:46.369
NSG: do we do all 3 jobs.

740
01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:48.789
NSG: or do we focus on one?

741
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:55.869
NSG: Do we siphon off the customers that we could still keep or get more of.

742
01:42:56.180 --> 01:43:06.869
NSG: because we think we can do a better job or have a better time, or do a better job for these customers in this subgroup instead. So you're gonna have to make some difficult and uncomfortable trade-offs potentially.

743
01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:30.610
NSG: or you could try to do it all. But that's a risk as well, unless your product is already accidentally addressing multiple different jobs without you changing anything about it for those different subgroups of users. So there's a lot of nuance thinking that gets into product development that will activate going into month. 2 of techstars but month, one for me. What I have to offer for you all is implementing this framework

744
01:43:30.710 --> 01:43:37.900
NSG: deeply, so that is ingrained and embedded into the DNA of your company in perpetuity.

745
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.970
NSG: So

746
01:43:40.360 --> 01:44:04.729
NSG: again, this will become a foundational source of truth for you all. It'll hopefully encapsulate the essence of everything you've learned. There's a part 3 that I'm going to get into tomorrow, which tells a few more actual stories, my own and a few other examples that I think will bring this over the line and finish the job, and then we'll do a live demonstration of it tomorrow as well. But that's the content for today.

747
01:44:05.157 --> 01:44:11.230
NSG: Antoine has raised his hand to offer up the 1st screening criteria. But before we get into that.

748
01:44:11.610 --> 01:44:16.209
NSG: I want to make sure that what I just covered is understood and

749
01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:22.500
NSG: process properly. So, what other remaining questions, thoughts, insights, reactions. Do you all have? Because

750
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:30.519
NSG: people tend to go back to this and wish that they had dug deeper.

751
01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:35.760
NSG: So I just wanted to give you all space to like. Talk it out with me a little bit more, if need be.

752
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:41.067
carloscaglia: Did you see this as like

753
01:44:41.710 --> 01:44:44.860
carloscaglia: a 1 off? Or should you have a sort of like

754
01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:56.519
carloscaglia: repeat schedule like maybe you do them. I don't know. Once a year, every 6 months, every quarter like it feels like something as you evolve. Business changes, everything changes so it feels like if you keep it as a 1 off.

755
01:44:57.570 --> 01:44:58.230
carloscaglia: there's not much.

756
01:44:58.630 --> 01:45:00.460
carloscaglia: But or is it fine to give it as a 1 off.

757
01:45:00.630 --> 01:45:07.059
NSG: Yeah, if this is a 1 off approach for you. If any of you all treat this, what I'm I'm trying to teach you as a 1 off.

758
01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:08.949
NSG: I have failed. You

759
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:17.980
NSG: like I have. I have fundamentally like, messed up my job by not demonstrating to you how important it is to continuously learn about your customers.

760
01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:21.229
NSG: so I don't care about the label.

761
01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:22.440
NSG: The credit

762
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:39.570
NSG: like you don't have to call it jobs to be done like none of that matters to me, and it shouldn't matter to any of you, either. Those are just labels for things. What matters is that I know my customer and what they need. And I'm continuously learning about what's important, about keeping them happy, retaining them and getting more of them.

763
01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.890
NSG: That's what matters for each and every one of you.

764
01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:45.300
NSG: I'm hoping that this process

765
01:45:45.870 --> 01:46:00.679
NSG: you take seriously enough to understand the benefits of why you'd incorporate it into some sort of normal cadence, Carlo, so it could be monthly. It could be quarterly, it could be every 6 months. It's all dependent on the nature of your business and your situation right.

766
01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:20.799
NSG: I can imagine, optifab given the types of customers that you all have, it might be a longer timetable for you to do rounds of jobs to be done. Interviews given that the manufacturers that you're dealing with probably take a long time to get on the phone with and deal with and whatnot. But there's some of you that have businesses where you could, because you have so many recurring, and new customers coming in

767
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:25.580
NSG: have a more frequent schedule for getting Jtb. Insights or customer discovery work.

768
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:29.089
NSG: But all in all, I love that you asked that question, Carlo, because, like

769
01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.620
NSG: if I haven't said it so far, it should be obvious that this is something that you

770
01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:40.800
NSG: are already doing. I'm just trying to give you a better way of doing it, Meg.

771
01:46:40.800 --> 01:47:03.569
Meg Hall: I think there's 1 thing that I'm struggling with, which is like, you know, it's supposed to be when they hire you right, which, like we have a a buyer that's like at the sea level, right? That typically brings us in. And I almost wanna interview the end users to know like when they come back to us. If that makes sense like and like what they want out of it. Not necessarily like we, kinda

772
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:26.710
Meg Hall: we, we have our assumptions. And like, we kind of know a lot more about like, why the sea level brings us in. But it's like the the end user. What's their incentive to bring us in, and that's kind of I don't know if that's bad, because there's no exchanging of money, but they are going to us for a reason, you know, so like the end users, I almost I get. I get torn. If we should look up the what like interview the end users more.

773
01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:36.040
NSG: Well, that's a different set, right? So so those are 2 very valuable sets of interviews that you should conduct to be clear right? So the the users that you're talking about

774
01:47:36.930 --> 01:48:01.470
NSG: they're struggling, someone's struggling, and they're doing something instead of sales. Play right now. Right? So whatever they're doing, you're interviewing them around that hire. They hired something else to make progress at some point. What was the decision making process for them to adopt that way of doing things. And what were they struggling with? You can do those insights and run that experiment that doesn't take away from you getting to know the C-level people who have to make the decision to make the purchase.

775
01:48:01.770 --> 01:48:02.139
Meg Hall: Those are just.

776
01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:04.060
NSG: 2 different sets of interviews.

777
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:08.780
Meg Hall: And you don't want for us to do like 3 of this bucket, 3 of that bucket, 3 of this other bucket you want.

778
01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:09.700
NSG: Absolutely not.

779
01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:10.680
Meg Hall: 8.1.

780
01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.720
NSG: Yeah, exactly. So. I hope that's crystal clear to everyone.

781
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:26.290
NSG: We're not. This is not a buffet. You know what I mean, where I'm taking different categories of customers, and if I do, 10 yay, no, it has to be the 10 to 15 within a particular screening criteria subdomain.

782
01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:34.510
NSG: That's when this works. It does not work when you're interviewing different types of groups with different situations and struggling moments, 2 or 3 at a time.

783
01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:44.349
NSG: There are a lot of people who Google jobs to be done. And then they try to do what you're just like, what like do that? And then they say, Oh, it doesn't work.

784
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:46.830
NSG: And I'm like, yeah, cause you don't even know how it works.

785
01:48:47.190 --> 01:48:47.980
NSG: So.

786
01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.040
Meg Hall: Got it. Thank you.

787
01:48:52.490 --> 01:49:07.659
NSG: and then the other big mistake that people make is the hypothetical piece, it's like they're interviewing people not around a purchase. But around the idea that they fit their customer profile. So they think they have the problem. So they talk about their thoughts, about a problem rather than their actions of solving it.

788
01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:12.239
NSG: So again, like the whole grounding nature of this approach is

789
01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:20.379
NSG: like, we're interviewing people around causality and actual actions and behavior taken as opposed to hypothetical ones.

790
01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:37.839
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, to be clear. I wanted to make me what I was saying before is which we answered later, was the process of actually picking users I wasn't talking about in the in the actual meeting of like, you know, hypothetical. It was about what you what you answered later. Was like.

791
01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:38.400
NSG: Cool.

792
01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:50.870
Ankur Toshniwal: Process of actually, how do you in the back office? How do me and Andrew? How do you know the co-founding, the the team actually figure out which users to pick, to actually do the interview with and be.

793
01:49:50.870 --> 01:50:03.190
NSG: Understood. Yeah. And and I will do that custom for each and every one of you. By the way, like each of you, deserve a different refined answer on that. And that's my job and our team's job to help give you all feedback on whether you have that right.

794
01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:18.029
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, cause it's just there's a lot of depth. And and wanna make sure we're solving a super neat, like a very painful problem. And and I think the you know, I think we don't. The experience that you guys have is super insightful.

795
01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:27.769
NSG: Yeah, the fancy startup language to it is beachhead, you know, like what? Whoever that early like category, the early adopter, the innovator category. That's what we're looking to talk to first, st

796
01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:31.300
NSG: Carla. I saw you on mute.

797
01:50:34.552 --> 01:50:41.109
carloscaglia: Yeah, just one thing that that popped to mind that work for us. We've got like a new newsletter that goes out every month.

798
01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:45.250
carloscaglia: and I think it's pretty standard pretty easy.

799
01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:50.288
carloscaglia: at least from us to do when we just talk about industry insights. There's nothing promotional like salesy.

800
01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.660
carloscaglia: and obviously, people from our industry sign up to it

801
01:50:54.130 --> 01:51:11.860
carloscaglia: just to see what's going on. And maybe we've never interacted with them. But what we do is that we when they set up to Newsletter, we don't send it as like an automated mail chip is like we send them a human email. And then that gets into like a quite nice personalized email chain. And you just get on a chat with them. Be like.

802
01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.440
carloscaglia: hey? By the way.

803
01:51:13.710 --> 01:51:21.849
carloscaglia: kind of a quick chat with you. Ask a few questions, and you know they've they've already shown interest in what you're doing. But you haven't. You haven't sold them anything you haven't like

804
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:27.680
carloscaglia: been saying, Oh, let me sell you this. I wanna have 15 min discovery call. You've already built a bit of a bridge with them.

805
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:33.560
carloscaglia: And so, yeah, I was just thinking about what you asked before. Both anchor and Chris, and that popped to mind.

806
01:51:34.110 --> 01:51:40.130
NSG: Yes, I love that. You're building community and you're also building a lot of goodwill and trust.

807
01:51:40.290 --> 01:51:49.879
NSG: So then people would are more willing to talk to you and respond to you because of that. And Carlo also. I think you sent me and Chloe a copy of that, too, which is really cool. So thanks for sharing.

808
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:53.169
NSG: All right, Antoine, you ready.

809
01:51:58.300 --> 01:52:00.609
Antoine: Sure, sure, sure happy to.

810
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:16.990
NSG: Alright. So time permitting, we'll do this one. We might do a second one if anyone if if time permits. But what I want to do as a group is. Take a look at what Antoine wrote up as a screening criteria, and then as a group, let's give him feedback and see if there's any way to refine it. Given what we just talked about.

811
01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:22.631
NSG: Do you want me to share my

812
01:52:22.890 --> 01:52:23.270
NSG: I do.

813
01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:28.550
Antoine: Share screen.

814
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:32.370
Antoine: Does that work.

815
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:34.249
NSG: Yep, we see it.

816
01:52:34.610 --> 01:52:37.440
Antoine: Does it look like a screening criteria?

817
01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:40.770
Antoine: Is it good?

818
01:52:41.210 --> 01:52:42.810
Antoine: The criteria.

819
01:52:42.810 --> 01:52:46.450
NSG: So so talk us through it. So so give everybody an overview of what.

820
01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:59.458
Antoine: Okay. So since we have, since we have, like a very few minutes, let's only focus on one. We just have 2 kind of a market segments, educational institutions, and recruiters. Let's look at educational institutions.

821
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:17.062
Antoine: We've we've prospected and sold to educational institutions in France. So we want to go in the Us. We don't we? We think we should go back to people who hire the competing product because we don't have any customer in France.

822
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:19.430
Antoine: so

823
01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:49.169
Antoine: the to me, the screening criteria. It's likely the head of career services, one of their associates, maybe a director. They hire the competing product service to improve how students prepare for job interviews. And maybe we want to be extremely specific about kind of specific products that they've hired. And so maybe it's higher view. Maybe it's you'd be. Maybe it's something else. Higher view being the market leader, you'd be the new kid on the block.

824
01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:56.379
Antoine: and they actually purchased for a system, and that's kind of who we want to speak with.

825
01:53:59.490 --> 01:54:01.059
Antoine: Let me pause here.

826
01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:10.659
NSG: This is really good. Before I offer infinite comments or insights, I'm gonna let the group respond.

827
01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:35.160
NSG: Perfect. Is it perfect? Everyone? There's no other questions feedback. You have on refining the situation by adding context, getting more details

828
01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:40.520
NSG: about who they're interviewing, what they're going through. Why, they hired a career, you know.

829
01:54:41.170 --> 01:54:46.650
Antoine: They don't want to do your job on your behalf. They are just letting you show us the way.

830
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.800
NSG: Everyone's open

831
01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:54.570
NSG: their mouths waiting to get fed rather than you know. Joining me in the kitchen, put some salt and seasoning on there.

832
01:54:54.980 --> 01:55:01.950
Chris Wong: I got a quick question, you said head of career services, and one of their associates is that is there a particular like segment of

833
01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:11.530
Chris Wong: groups there. Because, yeah, it's kind of hard to tell if there's a more specific depart like, I understand the department within the company. But what types of companies, I guess, or types of.

834
01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:14.179
Antoine: Oh, these are universities kind of

835
01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:30.800
Antoine: schools that are graduating people so preparing people for for to enter the the workplace. And to your point. We. What we have a lot of experience in is a business schools. And so

836
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:40.329
Antoine: only they want to replicate exactly a business school and go after the top Mbas and go somewhere there.

837
01:55:40.888 --> 01:55:45.009
Antoine: We might want to go into kind of a

838
01:55:45.770 --> 01:56:15.350
Antoine: slightly different take? Well, at this point. We want to also open it up for discussion. So we prepare it in the context of a discussion, because we we do have a lot of preconceptions that come from the fact that we've talked with 5,150 different services in France, mostly business schools, engineering schools, and a little bit of more general kind of universities, but that's kind of the.

839
01:56:17.850 --> 01:56:18.539
NSG: Are you all

840
01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:24.000
NSG: sharing a lot more context just based on what Chris asked, and what Antoine said than what's written in front of you

841
01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:41.919
NSG: right. I'm hearing engineering. I'm hearing business schools. I'm hearing universities within the Us that we need to focus on now, for as opposed to France, I'm sure that there are subtle differences and nuances to the purchasing process. Decision makers, different titles and roles budgets that they're coming from

842
01:56:42.190 --> 01:57:01.989
NSG: the reasons why they're switching from a a legacy tool or having no tool at all? Did they have another tool that they're switching this with? Or were they doing some sort of manual process before there's so many other details and questions that you could layer in here that might be helpful. But, Antoine, I will say what you have written on its own before adding anything else that we just said is actually quite good.

843
01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:15.789
NSG: So you understood the assignment, and I think you did a great job as a starting point. Everything that I just mentioned that you just mentioned, and that Chris was asking about are ways to further color it. If you and your team at this point think it's helpful to be more narrow

844
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:31.849
NSG: if you don't think it is, and you think what you have here is enough to start having conversations. Then you can very simply start having the interview. And then once you do, you do one or 2 and you go. Wow, okay, we should be way more specific, because we're getting different insights from people who fit too broad of a category.

845
01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:33.220
NSG: So there's a few ways.

846
01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:33.550
Antoine: It's.

847
01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:34.100
NSG: Go from here.

848
01:57:34.100 --> 01:58:00.850
Antoine: Yeah. And and just to go to go your guys's way. One thing and I I don't want to kind of over. I I think it's that's the the I'm so grateful that I'm benefiting from your collective feedback. And so I want other people to benefit from that as well. Just just one thing. That one key question we have is, oh, is it the head of carrier services who makes purchase decision? Or because because French schools are like

849
01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:07.259
Antoine: 2,000 people. Large versus American schools are more like 25,000 people, large and.

850
01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:12.240
NSG: Antoine. Sorry I'm gonna cut you off for one second. I just want to say, in 5 seconds we're hitting the 12 o'clock mark

851
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:24.059
NSG: drop if you need to drop. I'm still here. We can keep talking, Antoine. Thank you for this. I want to respect everyone's time and make sure you all. Don't feel like you're beholden to a call, so drop if you need to hit. We're in overtime.

852
01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:28.709
NSG: Alright, Antoine, you were still saying about the 2,000

853
01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:43.560
Antoine: No, no, I'm I'm just saying there's lots of of assumptions that we want to test but but I for me, it's really already very useful feedback. I'm I'm very kind of. I want to be cognizant of everyone's time.

854
01:58:43.560 --> 01:59:02.730
NSG: This is just a demo. So again, like, I'll go through each of your submissions individually, and I'm going to spin up the to do list that goes through the entire process step by step, piece by piece, so there's no more ambiguity there. But at least we had a few meetings and conversations about it before I hit you all with all of the details and information.

855
01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:11.880
NSG: Alright. Well, for those who I have left. How are we doing was that decent? Was that helpful and acceptable

856
01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.330
NSG: good start to pre-program.
