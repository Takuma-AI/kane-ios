### Frameworks & Methodologies

- NSG: because one tricky thing with this which makes it so confusing is that there are multiple different people who like, I guess, claim the methodology
- NSG: So each of your base camps will have the actual step by step, prescription with links to all the resources I'm referencing. It's all well like thought out. So, Antoine, what I sent you all as a message on Friday to complete as an assignment was just kind of like a little teaser.
- NSG: But basically we'll go back from when I 1st started talking about this all the way through to the point where you have a 2Â h meeting with me, and you'll know, step by step, exactly what to read and what to do. Does that make sense?

### Key Insights

> "NSG: which I've never had to actually like, address or talk about fully, because after the 1st day I explain who"

> "Chloe Lannert: Beautiful, so you can ship things to the office. Address. If you want to get a head start. The audio book is a good place to start. You can get that on like Kindle, or whatever we do recommend that everyone has their own, their own physical copy, because there are some diagrams in there that are pretty important to take a look at. But"

> "NSG: So when you are conducting your customer interviews in the jobs to be done. Format. What's really important is that you keep in mind as you're going as you're having the conversation. I have a blank version of this timeline in front of me, and there's different templates I can share with you. We have them in the to do's, and you can look up your own or design your own online. But the whole idea is that"

> "NSG: completely like crystal like this, but in an eerie way, more often than not, there's usually one to 3 events that occur leading up to a purchase decision. And almost always the consumer is going from a 1st thought that could be years ago, months ago, sometimes weeks ago."

> "NSG: You spend another 10 to 15. You always bury in"
