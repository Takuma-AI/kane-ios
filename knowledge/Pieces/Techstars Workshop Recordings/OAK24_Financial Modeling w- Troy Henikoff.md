## Core Concepts

Based on the workshop content, founders will learn:


### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because to me it all makes sense. I don't need to step by step by step. So if I skip something or something doesn't make sense. Jump in there and let me know and blurt out.
- Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and this process takes 6 or 12 months. It's very expensive. These prototypes cost millions of dollars a piece, and it's very time consuming. It's actually good that it costs. It took 6 or 12 months because Crystal sorry. But you were in the hospital. You had like a broken clavicle and a punctured lung. It took a little while for that to repair. And now we gotta talk you into getting back in the car and test driving. You insist on a big helmet, 5 point seat belts, and a bunch of safety equipment airbags. But we get you in and hopefully the car successfully goes around the hairpin turn at 30 miles an hour.
- Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: This is a very expensive process, and we risked Crystal's life.

### Key Insights

> "Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That doesn't mean this is the most important thing you have to do right. Now, if you have something more important to do, if you have a customer call. If you have an investor call, you have something more important. Put yourself on video, mute and go do that thing and give it a hundred percent of your attention. If you think you can be like replying to email and listening to financial modeling at the same time, you're fooling yourself, and you'll do neither one. Well."

> "Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's how I enforce the no slack, no email rule. And if you want to take notes, take it on paper. It's way more important that you engage deeply, then, that you're taking notes. But if you want to take notes, take notes, I will give you all the materials and in terms. I see. Neil raised hand. Hold on now. I gotta get the chat up somewhere so I can see the chat while you're doing that. Let me just reinforce what you just said. Guys, let me tell you, this is gonna be a brain. It's gonna make your brain hurt a little bit."

> "Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Obviously, it's way easier to make changes on the computer than in a clay model. But much more importantly than that, because the computer knows everything about the car. We can do a simulation."
