So it's on their own volition. The number one reason that people mentor is altruism. They just wanna give back. That's like a super easy one to engage with. The second one is important, for later in this presentation they want insights into technological trends."

But mentors you can find out. Ask them, why are you mentoring? They'll generally tell you, and then you can communicate accordingly, based on which bucket they fall into.
