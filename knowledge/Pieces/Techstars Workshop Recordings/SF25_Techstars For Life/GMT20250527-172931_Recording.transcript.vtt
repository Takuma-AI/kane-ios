1
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.960
Piyush Verma: We put on our websites and stuff like that. Yeah, yeah.

2
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:16.520
Sambhav Mehta: But one of my favorites is a 3 day attraction graph. You can do that. You have a lot of options, yeah, or like customer testimonials.

3
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:26.259
Sambhav Mehta: You can play around with it. But it's just what's gonna be behind you while you're running questions. Some people have done like sort of demo examples of their products.

4
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:38.009
Sambhav Mehta: there's a lot you can do with it. There's something you want to like. Point out while you're doing the Q. And A. You can mess with that, but bare minimum to like just a logo or something pretty important that you want to do.

5
00:21:38.456 --> 00:21:41.890
Sambhav Mehta: And this is all assuming you get a booth for Demo Day.

6
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:56.380
Sambhav Mehta: Okay? And the and the room with the the pillows.

7
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:01.439
Sambhav Mehta: there's an opportunity not gonna lie. So like there's 1 like there's like a this.

8
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.560
Sambhav Mehta: Think of a here

9
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:13.039
Sambhav Mehta: right here. There's a big ass pillow that's super awkward, so like it's like a line of sight.

10
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.919
Sambhav Mehta: It's cut off right here. So he didn't have people not sit in this little stuff.

11
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:29.150
Sambhav Mehta: But that's their that's their room. It's cool, right? They said, like product launch room or something. Yeah, but it's there's an opportunity.

12
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.790
Sambhav Mehta: aren't it? Show them.

13
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.899
Ankit Sharma: Yeah, I am co-founder of trends.

14
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.000
Sambhav Mehta: What you doing here?

15
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.400
Sambhav Mehta: Who is that true.

16
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.899
Chloe Lannert: And is that your co-founder?

17
00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.739
Chloe Lannert: Can you give me a thumbs up.

18
00:22:48.922 --> 00:22:50.248
Sambhav Mehta: Who are you?

19
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.100
Chloe Lannert: Okay, Trini, can you give me a thumbs up if you know Ankit?

20
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.759
Chloe Lannert: And he's supposed to be here.

21
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.839
Trina Das: Yes, yes, yes, I am.

22
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.920
Chloe Lannert: Great. Beautiful. Okay.

23
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.960
Trina Das: I was on mute. Yeah.

24
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.389
Chloe Lannert: Alright! We're getting there. Beautiful.

25
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.540
Sambhav Mehta: Cool, so.

26
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:15.919
Chloe Lannert: Any other questions about demo day logistics, what I need from you. Before you leave the building today.

27
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.880
Chloe Lannert: we feeling good. I will be around

28
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:46.539
Chloe Lannert: ready to answer further questions for the rest of the day. Talk through the guest list who you've got make sure all your friends and family arrive. Please talk to me. If you have questions tomorrow will be much harder for me to like. Sit down and explain stuff. And then on demo day itself. Neil. Thank you for the flag. I'm running around like a chicken with my head cut off. I am like we've got videographers we've got like a bunch of vendors and people. I will be much less helpful to you all on the day.

29
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:53.750
Chloe Lannert: So any like, if you want to sit down, pep talk like I would love to do that ideally today.

30
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.059
Sambhav Mehta: I'll just remember if they don't.

31
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.769
Chloe Lannert: From the Google approved vendor list.

32
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:03.940
Sambhav Mehta: Sucks.

33
00:24:04.865 --> 00:24:11.920
Chloe Lannert: Previous. I I actually can't believe it didn't occur to me to to talk to you about this and I will. I will never be be doing it again.

34
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:18.450
Chloe Lannert: I'm I'm really sorry. I'm I'm genuinely very sorry Google hasn't approved, listed like.

35
00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:21.030
Sambhav Mehta: Typically these 3 people, the 1st one to respond.

36
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.420
Chloe Lannert: Guy did it last year. He did a good job.

37
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.800
Sambhav Mehta: I know.

38
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.180
Chloe Lannert: I mean. Also.

39
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:36.029
Chloe Lannert: you should have a conversation, probably with larger tech stars about that, for, like Cross demo days.

40
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:36.830
Sambhav Mehta: Let's let's.

41
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.970
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, what about?

42
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.400
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. Go to the Google.

43
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.549
Sambhav Mehta: Influence, people.

44
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:49.750
Chloe Lannert: Are they coming? Still there? Yeah, okay, should we tell them about that? Okay, so I have another like, weird update.

45
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.420
Sambhav Mehta: So like a few months ago. I forgot how I got like a old inbound.

46
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:59.390
Chloe Lannert: From somebody. And they were like, Yeah, I work for like this film production company. And we're exploring the possibility

47
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.250
Chloe Lannert: really like doing

48
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:06.820
Chloe Lannert: a new show in Silicon Valley about like the new AI wave and tech companies in the bay. And we talk to you.

49
00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.940
Chloe Lannert: He knocked out on the phone. It was like whatever I took the call.

50
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.940
Chloe Lannert: But as I took the call, everyone's like.

51
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.510
Sambhav Mehta: I had to take the.

52
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.790
Chloe Lannert: Control the meeting because they didn't know what they were talking about.

53
00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:17.130
Chloe Lannert: But I was like, Look like, I've got 10 incredible companies like are doing

54
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.839
Chloe Lannert: coming up. If you want to do a pilot and try something out, like I'm sure

55
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:26.999
Chloe Lannert: ask for their permission. If you guys want to come through and film some other moments of leading up to our demo day like that shouldn't be a problem.

56
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.640
Chloe Lannert: If you guys

57
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:34.250
Chloe Lannert: want to come to Demo Day, it might be cool. So it's a legit like film company, like they've done like. I think Christian Bale's latest film and stuff like that.

58
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:39.710
Chloe Lannert: I looked them up so they're gonna like, if it's okay with you all you have to decide.

59
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.170
Chloe Lannert: And

60
00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:45.489
Chloe Lannert: but they're here. I guess they're coming. Tomorrow they come tomorrow. They would like to be a fly

61
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.970
Chloe Lannert: on the wall around for leading up to dinner day, because

62
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:53.930
Chloe Lannert: this non 0 chance that they decide that afterwards they might be interested in tracking.

63
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:54.560
Sambhav Mehta: Tell your story.

64
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.530
Chloe Lannert: It's and I've seen you all in the mix and building your businesses in San Francisco another elsewhere.

65
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.929
Chloe Lannert: So if you're open to it.

66
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.529
Chloe Lannert: which I think you should be. But no pressure.

67
00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.559
Chloe Lannert: We'll. We'll set you guys up.

68
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.199
Sambhav Mehta: So that they might want to talk to you.

69
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.719
Chloe Lannert: Know you better and just film some of our interactions.

70
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.260
Sambhav Mehta: Sorry, sweet, see.

71
00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.289
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, I think it's.

72
00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.390
Sambhav Mehta: Publicity, like.

73
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.340
Chloe Lannert: This is exactly what happened when I'm in from there, and I filmed.

74
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.539
Chloe Lannert: made. It was like, I didn't think it was a big deal people came. I was like, Yeah, whatever. And I didn't think about them.

75
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.900
Chloe Lannert: And then, months later, like, Hey, we got something real. This is cool.

76
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.539
Sambhav Mehta: Do you need an action? Items from us.

77
00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:31.030
Chloe Lannert: Not yet. They might have like a like a loose waiver of some kind.

78
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:50.880
Chloe Lannert: But I don't know. We'll have to take a look. Yeah, as of right now. None of what they film is going to be like used commercially. So they would go back and get consents if needed. But they've Pinky promised that they're not going to sell the footage, so they don't need to like be approved by Google's entire press team. And if they go back on that. Okay, yeah. And that all came out last week. This is new for us.

79
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.700
Chloe Lannert: too. So okay, beautiful.

80
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.920
Sambhav Mehta: So they're gonna be full on.

81
00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:06.989
Chloe Lannert: I think so. Yeah, I'll double check. They're still figuring out their scheduling, but they're definitely going to be at Demo Day at 2.

82
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.430
Chloe Lannert: Invite himself. If you want.

83
00:27:08.618 --> 00:27:09.940
Sambhav Mehta: Like, if you really want that like.

84
00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:10.870
Chloe Lannert: Okay, thank you.

85
00:27:11.235 --> 00:27:14.520
Chloe Lannert: Think it's great. They've mentioned sort of why

86
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.539
Chloe Lannert: stuff, but also doing little interviews. So they'll they'll probably tap you for for stuff like that.

87
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.070
Sambhav Mehta: Cool.

88
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:21.550
Chloe Lannert: Okay.

89
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.170
Chloe Lannert: So we're almost

90
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:32.819
Chloe Lannert: getting into the deck. There are just 2 more things that are not in the deck that I want to talk about 1st off intros after techstars. Text.

91
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:48.129
Sambhav Mehta: Is moving further into bridge. It's a platform we've used a little bit in the past, but as of literally this morning. We now, like all techstars, founders, and alumni, get pro access to bridge courtesy of techstars.

92
00:27:48.434 --> 00:28:06.420
Sambhav Mehta: It's a platform that allows you to request loan interest within the platform without sharing too many personal details. It's a very easy acceptor. Reject on the recipient side. It makes it really easy to search who people are connected to and find intro pathways based on your it's like what Linkedin should be, or did I use my

93
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.219
Sambhav Mehta: yeah, something happened. Something dropped.

94
00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:15.439
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, just I think you unshared your screen.

95
00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:29.370
Sambhav Mehta: Okay, so courtesy access to bridge is

96
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:43.100
Sambhav Mehta: really cool. I saw. So Grant from flat raise a good portion of his round through intros made on bridge. So it does work. You guys can get on the platform and play around. I'll be sharing.

97
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.749
Chloe Lannert: This like monstrous info doc.

98
00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:59.360
Sambhav Mehta: That they shared about like, how best practices how to use it. But basically what Texters universe should be. We're just not going to be in terms of connecting people across the network, so that lives forever.

99
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.370
Sambhav Mehta: 75, part number 2 techstars. Pro rap.

100
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:24.369
Sambhav Mehta: So this is like alluded to in the slides. But I want to give just like a pretty holistic overview. Techsart has a separate fund for follow on investments. There's going to be this whole sort of reporting situation that you guys are required to do because there's is a stakeholder in your company

101
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:41.942
Sambhav Mehta: has some level of information, right. You need to submit your financials quarterly and moving forward. But there's also a separate form that you fill out to notify techsars of the race, so it can happen at any point during the race. But we recommend filling it out when your round is about half full, because that's what

102
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:50.040
Sambhav Mehta: gets people that that makes the Tech Star Central Team aware that you're raising and that kicks off there

103
00:29:50.220 --> 00:30:19.779
Sambhav Mehta: situation of considering you for follow on. So I believe those decisions are made in around a week. It's very quick. It's very algorithmic. That is where your updating and where they look back at your track record. Are you consistent or easy to work with? They typically don't talk to the teams I've never really been asked about. Yeah. I give them a green green light, the easy checking would be before the following commitment is made. But they it's it's a formality for the most part.

104
00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:40.819
Sambhav Mehta: like what I mean by that is, I've told you I never say anything bad about you. I never say anything negative. That's my promise to my group. That being said, if I do think there's legitimate concern, I'm gonna express that I don't feel that way in this group, and that's not the situation. Every now and then there is a bad actor or a founder that I legitimately will tell. Tech starts like, Hey, like

105
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:46.249
Sambhav Mehta: this doesn't make sense like, I wouldn't recommend this investment. That is extremely low.

106
00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:58.919
Sambhav Mehta: But all this to say, the decision is pretty algorithmic. And outside of that final budget check, we don't get any impact on how that second fund is distributed.

107
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.030
Sambhav Mehta: So

108
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:11.360
Sambhav Mehta: yeah, just making that clear. But right around 50% full is when you want to fill up the formula to exercise that you're fundraising, and then see if they want to exercise those and follow on

109
00:31:11.734 --> 00:31:21.280
Sambhav Mehta: on average, only one or 2 companies out of every class get followed. So it's not a signal. That's bad. If you don't get it, it's more of a boost for whoever is ready for it at the time.

110
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:49.609
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah. So we don't know the exact forms. I think there's a more thorough answer somewhere that we could pull up or show you what influences it. But yeah, there's a list of inputs. There's a form you fill out to request consideration, a follow on. And and then they look at your financials. There will be a traction at the time.

111
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.199
Sambhav Mehta: This class is Hq. But you can look at that. That's what they're that's what they're considering.

112
00:31:54.822 --> 00:32:09.739
Sambhav Mehta: As well as the ground dynamics. As far as I'm worried, they're pretty price conscious. And look at who else is in or out there, including our chief investment officer. I think

113
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:22.094
Sambhav Mehta: you can do it sooner. But Chloe's recommending that, because that is like at the latest is what we would say. You can let them know sooner, too.

114
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.140
Sambhav Mehta: if the round is already half full, can you write it on?

115
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:41.709
Sambhav Mehta: Okay, that's true. On a legal capacity within 20 days, if you close.

116
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.369
Sambhav Mehta: but you have to do that. That's your legal obligation.

117
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:53.220
Sambhav Mehta: Okay, if you don't want Texas to fall over, I would probably recommend

118
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:58.849
Sambhav Mehta: letting them know right at your 1st commitment, and there isn't too much traction in the round.

119
00:33:01.797 --> 00:33:13.899
Sambhav Mehta: yes, yeah, it's important for you all to communicate work with me on that if there's something you want to consider, it's like, Hey, I'm not sure I want to start to take up more space on. I want to make room for a lot of investors.

120
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:38.779
Sambhav Mehta: That's something I need to strategize with you on. And we'll like work, basically together to make sure techsar is aware of that intent? Because it's not always the case that that would happen right? They want to participate. That's part of why the vehicle structure, the way it is I have had time to where I've been able to pull that off. But it's rare, so we have to be intentional. So I'll work with you on that. If that becomes

121
00:33:39.544 --> 00:33:43.260
Sambhav Mehta: we don't need the enough we don't need.

122
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.475
Sambhav Mehta: Okay,

123
00:33:46.940 --> 00:34:10.060
Sambhav Mehta: More details will be shared. Everything will be written out. I just wanted to flag. You need to submit your financials quarterly, and we will be sharing info about how to both notify gestures that you're raising and submit yourself, for there's also an investor newsletter, for when your ground is also around 40 to 50% full that blasts

124
00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:14.640
Sambhav Mehta: your round details to a bunch of investors

125
00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.350
Sambhav Mehta: set up like a premium investors.

126
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.699
Sambhav Mehta: So that

127
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:40.410
Sambhav Mehta: has a really wide scope. If you want to get involved with that, there is a pretty strong, pretty, solid lead time, and there are very limited slots on the newsletter. It goes out monthly, so you need to like, get in contact as soon as possible. To to make sure. I can like ping right? People shake the right trees. Make sure you get on that list. But

128
00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:53.790
Sambhav Mehta: been pretty good at getting all the people who want to be able to promises focuses of each month. Sometimes it seems. But yeah, if there's a way to keep the only investor reveal. Chloe and I would need the work to make that out

129
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.739
Sambhav Mehta: right?

130
00:34:55.449 --> 00:35:04.940
Sambhav Mehta: So you mentioned financials quarterly, is it like you guys looking at something like a form to fill out? Or is it the submit? Or

131
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:12.190
Sambhav Mehta: but and you should be able to? I mean it should be on something

132
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.280
Sambhav Mehta: approval or something, but I can't imagine I should take too much time

133
00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.750
Sambhav Mehta: oops anything else.

134
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:29.170
Sambhav Mehta: I think they got it. Let's do it. Okay.

135
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:56.909
Sambhav Mehta: so yeah, this is the. This is like the formal deck that we have, that techsars. Everyone shares. All of Texas programs have this. We'll Riff because we have thoughts on some of these slides that may like deviate the most standard but it's still really important and helpful, because now you all are getting the same communication. Every other founder graduating from this program this week and next week they're going to see. So this is kind of the culmination of everything.

136
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:05.049
Sambhav Mehta: Okay, investor Review. This is another trickster central thing that is coming up.

137
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.109
Sambhav Mehta: We're gonna ask for a whole.

138
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:27.419
Sambhav Mehta: some sort of some more submissions. We've done so much prep for them today and your data and ready. So this will take 30 seconds for you to fill out. Right? Yes, yes, okay. It's nothing too crazy. The heaviest lifting is just the deck and and some high, level overview stuff.

139
00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:50.269
Sambhav Mehta: What I'm trying to raise that is only for founders who have just graduated. So if you're raising now, this is this is the one thing that does expire. You only have this, this one chance to participate in the investor review. The techstar Central investment team sits down after every class and they do their best to make targeted intro matches.

140
00:36:50.594 --> 00:37:12.639
Sambhav Mehta: Some people don't get matches. Some people get like 10. The average, I think, is around 2 to 3 matches per calendar. It depends on what industries are like sexy at the time it. Also, if you're in a closer niche, you'll probably get better, more tailored matches. Like AI is really loaded. If you lean into your verticals, you'll probably have a better chance of

141
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:28.129
Sambhav Mehta: of meeting with people who are super aligned. But that all happens through bridge we'll communicate about deadlines after program. But it's typically 2 to 3 weeks after program is that submission deadline. And then it goes live around. 2 weeks after that is when matches will start being made.

142
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:35.410
Sambhav Mehta: So the things that you're building now should be ready to go within that case

143
00:37:36.303 --> 00:37:42.900
Sambhav Mehta: for this to be useful, 100%. Yeah, where's Lisa?

144
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:49.779
Sambhav Mehta: Spring's on. Spring's on. Oh, okay, so it's like, next July, yeah, put yourself on the radar, I mean, why not?

145
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:58.250
Sambhav Mehta: You'll have to yourself to submit by that deadline, and you'll still get the matches at the same time. But you can like use it as like Intro call.

146
00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.329
Sambhav Mehta: But you gotta tell Texas that you're busy.

147
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:13.050
Sambhav Mehta: No, yeah, it's not. It's not compulsory, but it is a once a 1 time thing. So we've had founders reach out and go. Hey? Can I do, the investor reveal. And we're like, no, it's too late.

148
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.650
Sambhav Mehta: This one, except this, okay.

149
00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:42.260
Sambhav Mehta: we're going to continue working with you guys on data rooms, because I know that there's a lot of work to be done. As you guys get closer to actually raising. But please keep that those financial models up to date. With the new reporting requirements and raises coming up on the horizon for a lot of you being really dialed in super important. Yeah. Well, if and by the way, more to the investor, reveal.

150
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:52.809
Sambhav Mehta: and you don't have these things up to date right now, then, you're not seriously like you're not ready. So just be honest with yourself about whether you're ready and whether you want that, because if you don't have these things lined up.

151
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:54.400
Sambhav Mehta: you're not.

152
00:38:54.630 --> 00:39:01.810
Sambhav Mehta: But but when you're gonna submit, yeah, exactly. You got it. Figure it out in New York.

153
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:02.860
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah.

154
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.225
Sambhav Mehta: Okay,

155
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:34.560
Sambhav Mehta: keep hanging out with your mentors. A lot of them are, and we'll throw a check about this program. Some of them operate during program, but really leverage the network for investor connections across the board. The mentors you've stayed in contact with. Use them as more inter pathways bring them in pipeline, I mean. I can't tell you how many times I meet with founders who want to meet because they're finally ready to raise, and they need help and want to sit down and go. Who have you met with

156
00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:38.430
Sambhav Mehta: from the program. Who have you talked to? And they go. I haven't done it yet.

157
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:51.930
Sambhav Mehta: Okay, again, like, what are we talking about here like, are you gonna do the things that are available to you or not? So like sometimes my meetings are like reminders to people of obvious things. So I'd love to avoid that with this group, if I can.

158
00:39:54.130 --> 00:40:23.609
Sambhav Mehta: Texas universe is a good resource, and it's going to be way more useful with bridge attached. So now you can use universes like your shopping list of people you want to get connected with and use bridge to identify pathways throughout. So like, figure out which Md, you want to be able to connect you, to, to connect to a specific investor like there are all these like weird new pathways that are going to be a lot more visible now. As of this morning. Yeah, it was a really cool email from David. So David, totally emailed the entire company this morning, and basically said, like, Hey.

159
00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:28.919
Sambhav Mehta: some of us are good. Some of us are bad at following through and following up to make introductions for founders.

160
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:44.999
Sambhav Mehta: Now we're all gonna be and hear that. And there's like a whole huge guide. And it's like every all techsart founders now that are active get access to a pro account for bridge. We signed a big contract with the company, and we all get the advanced accounts as well. So now it's like autumn.

161
00:40:45.240 --> 00:41:14.480
Sambhav Mehta: like, I just need to click a button to say yes rather than like the email and the follow up and the warm intro and all those steps and keeping track of the communication systems and whatever. Now, I just want to get stuff, it's cool. It also gives you dramatically more visibility, like. If someone sends an intro, it automatically notifies you 2 weeks later. If there's no response, it just keeps you up to date on what's going on. So you don't have to make that spreadsheet from here that's like to see where this middle.

162
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:20.220
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, I'll be honest like this. That's the shittiest part of the whole thing for me. It's like managing

163
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:35.599
Sambhav Mehta: multiple different communication channels and requests. So I'm actually solving 10 years ago. But how do they? How do you guys get them involved. Let's say, somebody graduated 10 years ago

164
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:37.090
Sambhav Mehta: in the video.

165
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:45.719
Sambhav Mehta: They're gonna get. They have to choose to do it. But they all get notified. They have access to a lot. So everybody might want to be there. But whoever is there?

166
00:41:45.880 --> 00:42:00.449
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah. But but like our network like, it automates the connection opportunity. And what what happens if you've ever used it. But what happens is, if they're not a member of bridge, they get a message from you, basically, hey, I'm using this to make this connection to this person, this. Okay?

167
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:16.820
Sambhav Mehta: So it's us, actually, the person, whether they have bridge or not. If we can make the intro, you'll see it. It's a platform that the email notifications are really good. You don't have to be on bridge

168
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:27.549
Sambhav Mehta: tech stores like to give all this access, uploaded. The emails of every single company that hasn't like, exited or then acquired. Like all those founders who are still operating the Tech Service Company are.

169
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:44.909
Sambhav Mehta: It's great. I think you guys can benefit big time like there's no better time to get like connections with people than right now as a text. And this is the 1st time this is happening. Some investors

170
00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.149
Sambhav Mehta: whatever, but not like this.

171
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:04.379
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, now you have a pro account. You are with a free pro account.

172
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.060
Sambhav Mehta: All techsofthani.

173
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.820
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah.

174
00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:19.230
Sambhav Mehta: I know a lot of you are thinking about bootstrapping, avoiding raised smaller rounds.

175
00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:24.880
Sambhav Mehta: You have the plan. You're good. But stay aware in the numbers.

176
00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:26.730
Sambhav Mehta: Bye.

177
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:53.000
Sambhav Mehta: the Texas founder fundraising toolkit is a notion, Mega page, that will with the Hq. If it's not already there. I know it's already in the Alumni, Hq. But it's a ton of really great resources. Everything from population tools to how to build your investor. Crm, like it's just a bunch of resources that are there for you to come through anytime. You want to dive deeper into any of the topics we've covered, or

178
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.719
Sambhav Mehta: stand out beyond what we have.

179
00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:14.010
Sambhav Mehta: That's only gotten better over time, like I've seen many different versions of it over the years. It's basically the collective whistle of prospects, ours all in the notion page. It's great highly recommend it. If you want to do with me to talk about fundraising schedule, and you haven't gone there. I'm just going to tell you to do that first, st so you might as well take that step and then talk.

180
00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:23.939
Sambhav Mehta: and then finally, thanks for help talk to us. I love reading through the steps, Neil. If you

181
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:31.790
Sambhav Mehta: we put in the work, Neil will sit down for a Mothbc interview, and just rip you apart, and then I'll do whatever I'll do anything that's helpful.

182
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.490
Sambhav Mehta: Okay.

183
00:44:36.210 --> 00:45:03.950
Sambhav Mehta: this is important. This is this is real, and and you don't know it until you feel it like we tell people we have time for other to relate. But there's this thing called the clip, which is like you just had 3 months of structured, immersive programming, community connectivity friendships. All this stuff, right? We have Kpis. We have all these events and activities. We haven't seen real to be accountable to all this communication channels. And all of a sudden, after New York

184
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:08.520
Sambhav Mehta: things get real quiet and you're in the field.

185
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:12.939
Sambhav Mehta: Some of you are gonna like that thing. But I think most of you are gonna go damn like.

186
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.019
Sambhav Mehta: I didn't realize what I was, gonna miss.

187
00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:22.849
Sambhav Mehta: So when people get that clip like the opportunity for you is to one, be prepared for it and know it's coming, but 2

188
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:28.599
Sambhav Mehta: do what you need to like, pick it back up like, reconnect with people and bring that community back together.

189
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:49.050
Sambhav Mehta: Usually not everybody makes it. But most people do. I hope everyone in this group decides to stay connected. Because you guys are amazing. One of the most qualified and impressive groups people I've ever had the pleasure to work with. So I hope you all take that seriously, and you keep us as it was, too. But this is a choice that you have to make when you follow the split. What do you do when you know when you get back up?

190
00:45:50.456 --> 00:46:00.360
Sambhav Mehta: And then we all hit on this last week. But we we do stay connected. It'll make this whole transition so much easier.

191
00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:08.429
Sambhav Mehta: Stay connected right there it is. Good.

192
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.610
Sambhav Mehta: Please, please

193
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:26.340
Sambhav Mehta: just keep your email current in Texas universe. The rest do what you want like if you want to be searchable and more accessible to other people. Great. But please keep your email updated. If it changes.

194
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:32.219
Sambhav Mehta: That's how we like, find and keep track of you. Keep sending you sort of resources. Event invites whatever.

195
00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:38.989
Sambhav Mehta: Don't let us disconnect, it almost looks so bad. It's like, I know, this person says we gotta go whatever

196
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:51.559
Sambhav Mehta: we're gonna have 2 post program surveys. One is going to be the Texas Central one that's going to be sent out on Friday after Demo Day. I believe it might be next week. I'm not sure

197
00:46:56.502 --> 00:47:01.499
Sambhav Mehta: so it should be this Friday, and then they're gonna keep emailing you about it. Please fill this out.

198
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:30.219
Sambhav Mehta: Please fill this out. This, this feedback is ridiculously, incredibly valuable. And it goes to Central. So it just helps them understand how our team is doing. And then we're also gonna send a second survey from. And for just our team where we're gonna ask in more detail about different program features, different sort of things. We've been doing to get a better gut check on the more specific things to our program versus just.

199
00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:38.889
Sambhav Mehta: we want you all to be proud of the program that we shape going forward based on your feedback.

200
00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:56.079
Sambhav Mehta: So we know that we're not perfect, and, like all of us, are perfect. So whatever we need to do to improve, we want to know there's more nuance with the survey we send out. That's related to our program specifically that you know, they will test our solutions out. And, by the way, that's real like tech starts like I get a message from the CEO

201
00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:08.830
Sambhav Mehta: about these results. They'll they'll ask me things. So just so, you know, like it's real. They will listen. They are listening. We want your feedback, but just know it also, like it shapes our reputation within the company.

202
00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:27.330
Sambhav Mehta: So just know that as well. So if you have thoughts, whether they're complimentary, critical, whatever we want you to like, give those but definitely like if you could like, especially if you have good things to say, I would very much appreciate it, I think only 4 companies filled out the midpoint out of the 10, so please help us out with that feedback

203
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.119
Sambhav Mehta: based on like

204
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:44.199
Sambhav Mehta: full time members are the ones to be asked to fill that out. Yeah, but I'll I'll be honest with you all. I have a little bit of like, not anxiety, but like I'm a little concerned about it, because, like to be frank, there's a lot of people that weren't part of a lot of the programs.

205
00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:51.540
Sambhav Mehta: So there's full time members that didn't full time show up. So it's weird. Because on one hand, you're gonna get feedback about things

206
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:58.770
Sambhav Mehta: that you didn't experience. So just be mindful and respectful of that, because if you decide not to show up to everything we asked, that's okay.

207
00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:03.949
Sambhav Mehta: which is recognized like, you may not have the full picture of what this program is all about. If you didn't show up there.

208
00:49:06.214 --> 00:49:11.160
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, this is kind of like.

209
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:40.590
Sambhav Mehta: it's not important stuff. I think it's gonna be helpful for you guys to know each session. If we do the most out

210
00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:47.230
Sambhav Mehta: the idea behind those are it's gonna have like one pager for everyone like.

211
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:53.579
Sambhav Mehta: Then take all the little things that show

212
00:49:53.790 --> 00:50:01.780
Sambhav Mehta: tips or stuff you get out of themselves and yet sharing everyone. So maybe you know, I need something that may.

213
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.309
Sambhav Mehta: But you know oh, damn!

214
00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:08.490
Sambhav Mehta: And then you share it with like the rest of the

215
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:15.659
Sambhav Mehta: people teach or and then come back to it if you want. It sounds especially helpful for people who miss the majority of our program.

216
00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.400
Sambhav Mehta: So actually, it's using salesforce as a bit of a keyword

217
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:38.200
Sambhav Mehta: like Alex was telling me ideas that he learned. But what what we came down to was actionable insights, like from. If I go back to India and tell my co-founders that this is this, and also for other other people in the cohort.

218
00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:50.839
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, I think that's great. I'm just big idea. Yeah, I think that's great. And I would just also emphasize, like, I mean, frankly, you miss a shit ton of program, right? So there's a lot to catch up on. I recommend you. Go back and look at some of those workshops.

219
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.990
Sambhav Mehta: There's a lot of value. I think in this.

220
00:50:53.680 --> 00:51:00.650
Sambhav Mehta: yeah, on that, the thing that we were saying like, I say, like, people are like, Okay.

221
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.370
Sambhav Mehta: I think I'm gonna introduce you to this point.

222
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:07.469
Sambhav Mehta: The example I gave was that dance workshop.

223
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:11.090
Sambhav Mehta: They, too, because I love. I absolutely love them

224
00:51:16.336 --> 00:51:18.480
Sambhav Mehta: in 2,008.

225
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:23.119
Sambhav Mehta: So just to ask, like, I don't know how to do it. Okay.

226
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:30.730
Sambhav Mehta: give or whatever post it on Linkedin

227
00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:41.269
Sambhav Mehta: sessions. That's great. I'll just also add, like you get out what you put in like. I said the beginning. So if there's a workshop you didn't go to, and in your mind there weren't actionable insights.

228
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:45.549
Sambhav Mehta: If you showed up to that workshop, and you asked for optimal insights. Maybe you would have gotten.

229
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:51.550
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, I think I think this is not supposed.

230
00:51:51.840 --> 00:52:02.230
Sambhav Mehta: Aw, t, that's it, screw that is supposed to be just a few things.

231
00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:11.240
Sambhav Mehta: What is we want? Very actionable ideas, love it, that's requisite.

232
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:12.630
Sambhav Mehta: See?

233
00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:17.170
Sambhav Mehta: But that here's 1 thing, that it is

234
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:26.959
Sambhav Mehta: huge story. There's a lot of good feedback from Dexter, that is, you have to experience it, to know or to get value out of it.

235
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:35.819
Sambhav Mehta: And this is very get saved. And it's very difficult. Yeah, it's not sweet. Yeah, that's, of course.

236
00:52:37.103 --> 00:52:51.800
Sambhav Mehta: think it's going to be a long list. Some of it is going to be like, very, very like

237
00:52:57.435 --> 00:53:02.460
Sambhav Mehta: so much evaluating.

238
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:09.709
Sambhav Mehta: I guess the point is that since it was a discussion between us, we just wanted to pay another.

239
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:38.600
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, I'm super excited to review how each of you have engaged on the material that seems super interesting to figure out what works and like how

240
00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:47.240
Sambhav Mehta: I think I have a whole snippets. Who's up, Chloe? I love being a secret.

241
00:53:49.830 --> 00:54:10.029
Sambhav Mehta: I'm our little secret. Yes, if there's something you like about me like I don't care. You can say whatever you want online. But, like, you know, I'm sure I'm saying Chloe needs to build up her reputation so I can post whatever

242
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:11.620
Sambhav Mehta: come on.

243
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.429
Sambhav Mehta: But that that would be amazing. If if you're cool with us using that, we'd like.

244
00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.609
Sambhav Mehta: do a little bit after the program and also put up the sourcing.

245
00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:24.538
Sambhav Mehta: So I'll say one more thing about this slide before we move on to engagement.

246
00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:29.680
Sambhav Mehta: this community, especially in San Francisco is yours to shape.

247
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:34.619
Sambhav Mehta: It's new, it's arguably one of the newest, but also one of the most important.

248
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:42.219
Sambhav Mehta: So here you all are, with the golden opportunity to be the leaders of the San Francisco Bay Area Tech search network.

249
00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:56.499
Sambhav Mehta: If I'm you I'll grab an apple by the horn. You don't have to physically be here to be a part of it, too. Right? Take advantage of the fact, like you all have a brand, and very few people do, even within the tech circle. When you go to New York, people run on and up

250
00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:07.980
Sambhav Mehta: what's going on. Oh, here's and that's why I want you are where everybody wants to be. So you all aren't figuring out a way to like capitalize on that as a group. But shame on you!

251
00:55:08.654 --> 00:55:30.499
Sambhav Mehta: I'm happy to brainstorm and talk about things happy to help. There. We have our own kind of plans to, you know. Make sure we make the Bay Area and San Francisco, more prominent in the Texas universe. But, like, I do think, alumni tend to take charge of the formation of events, activities, reputation. You all shape the culture.

252
00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.129
Sambhav Mehta: we're not in charge.

253
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:40.519
Sambhav Mehta: Okay, yeah, then, you definitely different personalities. I'm not sure necessarily

254
00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:44.740
Sambhav Mehta: super like social media out there kind of person.

255
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:47.580
Sambhav Mehta: But one of the things that we really care about

256
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:52.769
Sambhav Mehta: these future founders. Yes, so the same follow that.

257
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:55.299
Sambhav Mehta: Because I know, you know, just like

258
00:55:56.650 --> 00:56:01.340
Sambhav Mehta: so the founder talks program probably is the highest

259
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:07.350
Sambhav Mehta: value that I've ever gotten through this 10 people. So

260
00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:14.410
Sambhav Mehta: I don't know what the right pathway to kind of signal. Then I know that the next 6 h and Sf. Is far down.

261
00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:17.249
Sambhav Mehta: so I don't know if they're like

262
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:21.350
Sambhav Mehta: chunks that we can contribute at least

263
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:25.950
Sambhav Mehta: frankly, when you guys brought like, you have like, text, only students like, I mean.

264
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:38.560
Sambhav Mehta: college sometimes be involved in direct.

265
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:45.930
Sambhav Mehta: 5 weeks ago. Good one, that like social media. So yeah, like, maybe like the

266
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:55.927
Sambhav Mehta: like, it's like the events like the tech stars kind of ambassador.

267
00:56:57.270 --> 00:57:16.450
Sambhav Mehta: genuine interactions with people in whatever form you all think they should take. I don't control that. I'm not saying it's even to be clear. I'm saying that for me personally, like it's not my cup of tea like, my interest is in like actual products. So we've been talking about something real. We're doing something.

268
00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:30.590
Sambhav Mehta: That's what I'm I'm not hanging around and like we can do that. That's fun for this group, or our groups, or whatever you all let me know, I'll go to Karaoke, but like for the most part, it's just for fun. I probably will be there. But if it's for something real valuable I'm in.

269
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:38.089
Sambhav Mehta: So I love to include you all little signal while we're we're going to bother you about programs.

270
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:57.319
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, we love you coming back and just ping like, if you want to do a talk. Whatever I. I was talking to Vermona for the Kpis, and it's like I think I like. I think I've sorted talk with fundraising journey, and I think you should have to do that, too. Just tell us your ideas, and we'll we'll put it together and like iterate over time.

271
00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:16.324
Sambhav Mehta: we'll also like ping you about this sort of panel stuff. If you're interested, we'll keep you up to date, and definitely come to the new class kickoffs and demo days in the future. But also, if you're interested in getting touch with other programs who are running in the fall or sooner, or like off our sort of spring spring schedule.

272
00:58:17.347 --> 00:58:30.790
Sambhav Mehta: yeah, your your referrals get a top priority fast pass, too. So if you have a company or company, you want us to talk, to consider investing in, or to work with or to help. We prioritize what you all say.

273
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:33.099
Sambhav Mehta: so that shoots at the top of the list.

274
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.689
Sambhav Mehta: Oh, the winters!

275
00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:36.460
Sambhav Mehta: Right?

276
00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:48.419
Sambhav Mehta: So Okarbi, for update on global mentor engagement. If you want to get in touch with a different program.

277
00:58:48.760 --> 00:59:03.029
Sambhav Mehta: talk to her and she will route you to the program teams and get you in touch and let you know, like what what's running when and all of that, she used to work on anywhere team. So she's close to the program team and she's cool. And she'll help you land in the right spot.

278
00:59:04.165 --> 00:59:06.399
Sambhav Mehta: There you go.

279
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:07.900
Sambhav Mehta: Okay.

280
00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:21.699
Sambhav Mehta: if you want. That's the one on one with the lead mentors. If you want this, they're not obligated to do that. But we recommend you ask if you have a good connection with them. Keep a regular checking. No, I mean, that's great. And I'm available. So like I said.

281
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:27.180
Sambhav Mehta: it's choose your own adventure with me. So by the end of this week, assuming I'm not

282
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:35.279
Sambhav Mehta: drunken, Napa, I send a message out, at least by the start of next week. We'll see how it goes, I send a message out with my account.

283
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:42.900
Sambhav Mehta: So that's my customary thing at the end of every program is, I say, I share my calendar. I don't share every program because my calendar.

284
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.990
Sambhav Mehta: So you can book time of week anytime you want that I'm away.

285
00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:56.839
Sambhav Mehta: So that's always available to every founder I invest in. So you have my calendar. You can book whatever time I have and I have some founders that have a standing meeting.

286
00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:05.480
Sambhav Mehta: I've done weeklies. I've done bi-weekly, so I've done monthly. So I've done quarterlies. I have all versions of that at different times at different times in their lives when they need help.

287
01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:30.380
Sambhav Mehta: Berman had it with me for a while, when he came out of the program. That was great, but he kept coming late, so I just canceled it. I was like Bro, this box, me and he started doing that. And things worked out. But don't think you need that time unless you want to be serious about you, show up with an agenda you have something to talk about. Send me something beforehand. You all know how to show up but just know, like there's no question that you have the most access to me other than my pain

288
01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:31.409
Sambhav Mehta: in my life.

289
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.100
Sambhav Mehta: That's it.

290
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:38.639
Sambhav Mehta: Keep talking to each other.

291
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:59.431
Sambhav Mehta: I like we keep hammering this because it is so so important. Some people are still doing weekly calls. Some classes are doing monthly really make time to see each other, and then commit to showing up like 6 months down the line. When you see that like, save that time on the calendar, please.

292
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:00.940
Sambhav Mehta: the

293
01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:26.959
Sambhav Mehta: it always feel better after it like I join these alumni calls whenever I can. It's always just so so lovely to like check back in with people, whether it's attraction updates or sharing fundraising strategies, or whatever whatever's hard or easy, or whatever you're celebrating, it is so so delightful, really make time and commit to checking in long term, and it's easy to sort of let that fall off.

294
01:01:27.438 --> 01:01:47.320
Sambhav Mehta: Whether it's Kpi calls 10 by tens. Whatever structure makes sense for you, whatever duration makes sense, whatever cadence makes sense, agree on that before you all disperse. And unfortunately, I hate to say it. It works better when there's a single owner of those times same classes try to rotate it. It's really hard.

295
01:01:48.020 --> 01:02:08.939
Sambhav Mehta: I it just unfortunately works better when it's 1 or 2 people. Yeah. So whoever wants to like lead the charge there, I've also seen people rotate hosts every quarter where, like one person will run 3, and next person will run 3. That's it, or miss that works sometimes.

296
01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:22.819
Sambhav Mehta: But unfortunately, the the class that's doing the best with. It is Oakland Spring 24. Since Jayla starts at that computer every Monday. She is one of you immediately call, and people show up, and she's there

297
01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:27.840
Sambhav Mehta: sets up process monthly, and they try to do some rotations, and then I didn't

298
01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.420
Sambhav Mehta: to a single host, but like.

299
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.869
Sambhav Mehta: just pick a person, whoever wants to charge.

300
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.060
Sambhav Mehta: and then it looks really nice to that person.

301
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.440
Sambhav Mehta: because it's annoying to have to keep track of.

302
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.089
Sambhav Mehta: And then some of us are friendship companies. So finger you all. We'll bother you all.

303
01:02:45.551 --> 01:02:51.169
Sambhav Mehta: If you have ideas for additional workshops you want to do. Let us know. We're

304
01:02:51.690 --> 01:03:08.550
Sambhav Mehta: it's something we experimented with a bit more this program alumni run stuff. And I think the more we lean into the live, tactical experience of our alumni better the program gets. So we have so many people who are so good at very specific things, and we want to share more of that.

305
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.830
Sambhav Mehta: So

306
01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:21.149
Sambhav Mehta: the whole thing here to think about framework. Wise is like, if it's something you really enjoyed learning and getting into, you really engage with the material.

307
01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:22.860
Sambhav Mehta: Buddy.

308
01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:33.969
Sambhav Mehta: apply it in your business, of course, but they come back and share the notes. Ask yourself, wow! If I could have learned this from me when I was at work, and this would be more helpful if you feel that when it comes back, what's us up?

309
01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:59.759
Sambhav Mehta: And we can also do alumni workshop. But I haven't done this a lot yet. But I'm experimenting with some ideas. So like we have a whole community, right people, we can do a remote workshop whether it's a 30 min day, 45 min thing, and just it's catch all for anybody who wants to come. Once the whole group. I think those are really cool, especially now that we have our next program in March of next year. We have a lot of time to do a lot of extra valuable programming for the whole like class.

310
01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:04.779
Sambhav Mehta: We had a program in March of next year. We have a year off.

311
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:13.229
Sambhav Mehta: is it for some, many, many of them? Yeah, some are running experience. Yeah.

312
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:18.459
Sambhav Mehta: new York is the one that has the most program loads. Because that's our headquarters. And we have multiple different programs.

313
01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:21.440
Sambhav Mehta: Oh.

314
01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:28.640
Sambhav Mehta: I had a really good question about New York tech and New York delegate. So I registered in New York delegate.

315
01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:38.270
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, you might have to fight your way in. I don't think everybody can get to.

316
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.580
Sambhav Mehta: I do. You're in.

317
01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:42.450
Sambhav Mehta: That's

318
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:48.910
Sambhav Mehta: I don't know. I don't know how the protocol is, but I I know I've had to message people sometimes to help diamonds fit in.

319
01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:50.400
Sambhav Mehta: Thank you.

320
01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.749
Sambhav Mehta: If you want to know. Yeah.

321
01:04:55.315 --> 01:04:56.630
Sambhav Mehta: So

322
01:04:57.030 --> 01:05:02.080
Sambhav Mehta: if you want to go to the New York Demo day, you have to register for it, and you may not get in

323
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:19.590
Sambhav Mehta: program teams, but they're in the same situation with us where their event is being run by Google, and they will need a service and do that asap. If that's something that you're trying to do and also be respectful with the events like, I also want to be clear, like, we actually

324
01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:34.120
Sambhav Mehta: there was a founder from, was it New York? There was another program where founder came from last? Yeah, for the last program, and he like, demanded access to our demo like a seat. We have 200 slots for our Google Demo Day. For this.

325
01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:36.039
Sambhav Mehta: We don't know.

326
01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:59.109
Sambhav Mehta: because it was clear from what this communication that I noticed, and then I heard from a few other people who knew him. This founder. This is a transactional person. He was here for himself. He was here to take away the limelight from the 10 companies that were pitching. He wanted to interject himself and his business to network and fundraise and take advantage of people in the room in a way that wasn't give 1st or respectful to the situation. So I will

327
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:13.120
Sambhav Mehta: the founder from that kind of thing. I'm pretty sure my fellow needs to do the same course. So be the kind of person that goes to New York next week and actually gives first, st and is a joy to have in those rooms, not somebody that's only interested in your own products because you're that I'll hear it.

328
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:24.509
Sambhav Mehta: It really wasted energy. And he's like my round has been going really badly. Now that I'm in San Francisco, it's your problem. Yeah, let me get access to this. And you guys help me. I'm like, no sorry, Buddy.

329
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.230
Sambhav Mehta: don't. Don't be rancid.

330
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:35.290
Sambhav Mehta: Keep your eyes out. We might have some stuff cooking in the like, larger am.

331
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:41.330
Sambhav Mehta: yeah. Situation in the next year or so. Do we keep you guys up in there and then

332
01:06:41.920 --> 01:07:06.010
Sambhav Mehta: check in on discord, particularly when you're traveling. You can sometimes, like meet founders in different cities, from like the tech stars network. It's an easier way to get in touch with people I'd also recommend, if you're going to a different city and you know that Texas has an office there in the program team ping, the program manager of

333
01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:28.220
Sambhav Mehta: area. It's not always doable, but usually can. So a lot of people hit play because you can imagine San Francisco is a place lots of techstars alumni try to come to. They hit us up. We're like, Hey, can you help us out?

334
01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:38.130
Sambhav Mehta: We're in program. Sure we'll give you a day in the office. That kind of thing. We're on a program. We don't have an office. So here's a list of recommendations we have, how we can help.

335
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:48.540
Sambhav Mehta: you know, or or things that we think are good, so they can help you connect. They can let you know if there are any events happening at the time, don't act as scheduled

336
01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.319
Sambhav Mehta: and ask specifically, without, you will.

337
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.626
Sambhav Mehta: So yeah,

338
01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:17.040
Sambhav Mehta: you guys see my portfolio support groups, because I add you to alumni skew from week, one or 2. So you see what's there? What's there is what I am? For the most part there's more. Maybe we'll see when you get out of me. But yeah, I think I'll get better at my job you all definitely make me better. But if there are things that you think I could be doing that I'm not

339
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:18.359
Sambhav Mehta: well.

340
01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:35.160
Sambhav Mehta: I'm your product. I'm a version of a product. I'm your fundraising investment vehicle product. But you can chisel into what you think it should be. So help me help you. I guess we have a slide on that next? Right? Sorry. Yeah, I know it's coming. Thank you. Yeah, that So

341
01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:44.130
Sambhav Mehta: let's see what else I have. Okay. So you all know that Alexis, little portable thing bridge is. Gonna solve a lot of that. Still. Have that in your back pocket.

342
01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:50.180
Sambhav Mehta: If you don't know what that is, if you haven't clicked that link, or if you can't remember what's behind that link.

343
01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:57.709
Sambhav Mehta: Please look at that. It's old. It's like over 10 years old. It has not gotten old. It is the

344
01:08:58.029 --> 01:09:04.840
Sambhav Mehta: was the sake of the English. Correct? It is this standard, please.

345
01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:12.619
Sambhav Mehta: when you communicate like that. Yes, exactly. If you communicate the way Alex recommended Alex. Is the investor, Berlin, that he's telling you story about.

346
01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:13.550
Sambhav Mehta: Right?

347
01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:26.899
Sambhav Mehta: He nailed. I I think I found a better practice of what he outlined there of how to like keep things short to the point about why a good intro is in that for an investment to entertain from a family

348
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:33.490
Sambhav Mehta: the things that don't end up happening with successful intros is if a founder is spamming

349
01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:42.529
Sambhav Mehta: because they're scattershotting because they're desperate, and they want lots of connections with lots of contacts and investors with very little to no customization in the message.

350
01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:48.459
Sambhav Mehta: So some praise. Few weeks ago, I think Meg reached out to us with her like ideal connections.

351
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.980
Sambhav Mehta: And the message you wrote, I forgot who the name of the person was.

352
01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:57.200
Sambhav Mehta: There was somebody who's like a big deal, you know, this person really important? Or.

353
01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:28.790
Sambhav Mehta: yeah, the level of thinking that Meg put into that message. I was like, yes, this is the way, like she literally customized almost every single line thinking about who this person is and what you want to talk to. I think that's that's the best practice I I can't recommend enough if it's important you to have a connection, if it's not important, I can tell, because you're gonna message me, it's gonna be generic thing about you. And I'm running around. And here's 1 quick line that I automated that kind of says something. They're actually, vaguely kind of maybe customized, almost

354
01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:31.169
Sambhav Mehta: sure that sounds important.

355
01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:42.880
Sambhav Mehta: You want it to like. If I accidentally send it to the wrong person, they'll know that it's like their name. It should be abundantly clear.

356
01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:50.029
Sambhav Mehta: Cool. Keep talking about some basic world around culture world around.

357
01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.920
Sambhav Mehta: Keep your data up to date like

358
01:10:53.180 --> 01:11:04.249
Sambhav Mehta: tech service really likes pulling data from French base to look at the company metrics. Obviously, the financials are more important. But it's always nice to have an updated presence

359
01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:34.159
Sambhav Mehta: continue to learn. So we have alongside the fundraising toolkit. There's a whole new suite of educational stuff that's been reworked over the last like 6 months or so. We have really cool firesides and talks that you can sit down and watch a whole bunch of content. Well, yeah, I want to say a few things here. So one is if somebody asks you what sex stars are like, or how is it one? We have a friendda with you all about our account.

360
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:42.880
Sambhav Mehta: So one thing is, you should not be sharing any of our internal workshops with other people or outside people sharing those zoom links and recordings and workshops don't do that.

361
01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:46.529
Sambhav Mehta: but what you can do is go to the toolkit.techservice.com.

362
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.500
Sambhav Mehta: which has a lot of excellent content that's really available to everyone that shocks me, that so few people take advantage of it.

363
01:11:52.660 --> 01:12:00.400
Sambhav Mehta: So if you have someone that wants to be more like you, tell them to go, do that, and then come talk to you afterwards, and then find out what more you can do to help them

364
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.580
Sambhav Mehta: orange juice in the meat. You think they're worth it

365
01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:09.240
Sambhav Mehta: right, but just make sure you keep our San Francisco program in house, because that's our expectation.

366
01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:33.580
Sambhav Mehta: Beautiful. Take care of yourselves. They're they're like the little quizzes where you can like 5 check, and it feels very like high school class to be like, am I sleeping this many hours a night? But sometimes it is good to just look at it on paper and be like, Oh, shit like my habits are bad doing this sort of ticking the boxes that I need to like. Feel good.

367
01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:38.910
Sambhav Mehta: It it's honestly a pretty useful exercise that they've got up there.

368
01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:42.839
Sambhav Mehta: which is super interesting, whatever whatever way works best for you.

369
01:12:43.556 --> 01:13:08.299
Sambhav Mehta: Talent, you have a job board you can claim your posting your your company profile through careers or jobs where you can like clean your profile, and then there's a bunch of other like, I think there's some handshake stuff like access to universities like there's a bunch bunch of resources for full-time talent recruiting.

370
01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:17.060
Sambhav Mehta: Also we have those partnerships with Berkeley that you can continue to leverage for

371
01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:22.390
Sambhav Mehta: designers of internal employees. What's the

372
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:30.550
Sambhav Mehta: Berkeley and in Chicago? So it's in Chicago's met now and then trainers of Berkeley. And quickly.

373
01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:39.430
Sambhav Mehta: yeah. By the way, those those are so, Berkeley, New Chicago, are the ones that we directly say possible. I mean, if I'm you all and you need access to talent.

374
01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:48.689
Sambhav Mehta: I'm going to community. I'm not gonna find universities that have the talent, the curriculum, the class the pedigree that you're looking for. If I'm you, I'm

375
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:59.670
Sambhav Mehta: I'm getting yeah, I mean, I'm I'm here. I'm your way there. I mean, I'm engineering some professor engineering school and at the business school. So 2 of the best schools for talent for startups

376
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:08.399
Sambhav Mehta: you've always teaching totally. Also ask ask mentors for that. So a lot of mentors have, like good people, sort of in community like.

377
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:17.409
Sambhav Mehta: do they want to sort of elevate? I don't think my school gets enough reputation and deserves we're number 6 in the country overall. And that's 1 of the top business schools on Earth, like.

378
01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.230
Sambhav Mehta: you know, recognize?

379
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:23.470
Sambhav Mehta: Thrown away there.

380
01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.849
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, yeah, he did, too. Yeah, he did the the law school thing. Too bad.

381
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:44.170
Sambhav Mehta: Anyway, there's also stuff on how to like, decide on salaries and all that stuff.

382
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.160
Sambhav Mehta: Why is it important to send these updates out?

383
01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:57.210
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, he wanted to follow. We're gonna take a look. Okay, have they been updating us? Have they kept it consistent? That's probably one of the inputs that they're tracking to determine. The follow on indicator

384
01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:04.614
Sambhav Mehta: also updates at techstars. I know it's been acting here it is active. It has been confirmed like 4 times.

385
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:20.020
Sambhav Mehta: it is looking at it. And there might be like an email address that feeds into that which is inactive. But like your updates, that things are landing in the right place and then working on whatever weird bounce messages are happening. Keith

386
01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:28.070
Sambhav Mehta: talking this, and then there'll be more details on that. But for for the good habits, all that monthly quarterly, whatever we need to do it.

387
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.380
Sambhav Mehta: cap table. There are a bunch of

388
01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:48.730
Sambhav Mehta: resources and things we have. A lot of them are contingent on you, having less than a million dollars raised. Like the free or discounted version. There's also fidelity. Private shares has a discounted

389
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:56.099
Sambhav Mehta: version. I'll share. I think it's I think it's free version as well and then significantly cheaper than 10 current.

390
01:15:56.550 --> 01:16:13.550
Sambhav Mehta: But there's a bunch of resources check the universe, but also check the partnerships slide and the alumni community. That's where I'm dumping a bunch of resources that are exclusive to San Francisco. Only. So we've got some some extra stuff there where we need to discuss this

391
01:16:13.730 --> 01:16:22.660
Sambhav Mehta: to Fuisha's point. I think they updated this from here, so looks like they want it when you have your 1st commitment, not at 50. That being said like.

392
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:28.130
Sambhav Mehta: I think 50% is still the latest. You should do it. But it sounds like they're asking you to do it even early.

393
01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:30.240
Sambhav Mehta: So consider that if that's what you want.

394
01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.919
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, we'll just put this.

395
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:43.400
Sambhav Mehta: It's the 2 some have or some are time bound, others aren't. You have to look

396
01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.959
Sambhav Mehta: so well? The Perks. He's asking how the Perks expired.

397
01:16:48.240 --> 01:17:11.429
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, so you'll see expiration dates on on. But that's just like whenever the contract gets to negotiated. So some like keep an eye out different after the expiration date. But all the Perks and Gnp credits are overwhelmingly open to whoever there's some things that will only be available if you've raised under a certain amount.

398
01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:34.540
Sambhav Mehta: Specifically, the capital stuff that tends to be. And then, cloud credits are 10,000. So whenever you activate that package that those credits expire. That's something to really solid eye on. Like, don't take off the 350 K Google package. Now take off the 25 K. And then 2 years later, once you use it up, then you can.

399
01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:59.709
Sambhav Mehta: But generally it has nothing to do with. When you graduate from. I think if you time it all right, like I've heard this, I haven't seen it. I don't know it for sure, but I've heard some founders and people acknowledge this. I think when I was, I did an event with the Tokyo and me last week, and he said, like, there's over a million dollars in like actual real value to the Perks. If you structure and utilize them properly

400
01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:16.010
Sambhav Mehta: in millions, it's millions, it's a number. It's a bigger number than you would think that you can actually pull full value from if you strategize around which Perks are helpful to your business. So I think it's awesome. It used to be like a hundred 1,000

401
01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.099
Sambhav Mehta: when I joined. It was a hundred out. That was my talking.

402
01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.979
Sambhav Mehta: Did I ask about it?

403
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:28.420
Sambhav Mehta: Whatever just in general.

404
01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.860
Sambhav Mehta: So either default is not saved anywhere.

405
01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.860
Sambhav Mehta: Thanks, if you if you have like.

406
01:18:35.480 --> 01:19:03.239
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah. The way I hear it reminds me of stripe, you know, like you could pay less and do more of the work yourself, or like, do something that's a little more legal, you know. Whatever stripe seems to make things relatively standard. You guys know better than me. I haven't had to use this in a while.

407
01:19:03.370 --> 01:19:22.580
Sambhav Mehta: This stuff didn't exist back when I had the problem. So you're gonna have to help each other figure out what makes sense with their billing departments. And like the overall customer experience being over, Bill in the past 6 months to a year, so we should be other options.

408
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.460
Sambhav Mehta: and sorry I don't.

409
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:30.630
Sambhav Mehta: It is more expensive. This, I mean, we're talking about is, it's more expensive.

410
01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:34.020
Sambhav Mehta: That's yeah.

411
01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:47.170
Sambhav Mehta: And these are all moving targets, too. There's no like standard best practice that stays true forever. So as things evolve, communicate with each other. Let us know, too.

412
01:19:48.836 --> 01:19:57.780
Sambhav Mehta: what's the meaning of what's the term sheet? Or is it like an email written group just working?

413
01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:03.429
Sambhav Mehta: I think a soft permit is probably how I would interpret that that they go

414
01:20:03.570 --> 01:20:05.880
Sambhav Mehta: some email, that proof that there's

415
01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:13.939
Sambhav Mehta: yeah. I mean, it's not about proving it. I mean, you're just we're taking at your work. So whatever version of the commitment you think is real when you communicate, that's what we're gonna

416
01:20:14.636 --> 01:20:20.990
Sambhav Mehta: something you can be strategic like. If you want to

417
01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:38.389
Sambhav Mehta: wait until you have a little bit more traction to notify, you can say 1st term sheet is signed, and also these are in the pipeline. That's a good point.

418
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:47.519
Sambhav Mehta: So so if I'm hearing totally, see if I'm hearing totally right sorry to interrupt, I just want to clarify. I think this is interesting. What she's saying is interesting because I didn't. I didn't think about that way. So I heard that. But

419
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:50.239
Sambhav Mehta: even if you do get your 1st commitment.

420
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:55.020
Sambhav Mehta: Maybe it makes sense to time it in a way where you know, you're gonna like, have more momentum

421
01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:13.079
Sambhav Mehta: that might strategically, if I'm you. That's what I would strategize. But I want follow on. I want to structure in a way where not only am I getting my 1st payment, but I'm updating them with more that are on the way, because I know it's timed in a way that's gonna demonstrate that rather than just like Oh, in my 1st payment, and then, like crickets.

422
01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:21.749
Sambhav Mehta: time passes. Okay, now, I'm okay. They're struggling. So I don't know if that's how they think. Honestly, I have no idea. But if I'm you, that's kind of the strategy.

423
01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:24.300
Sambhav Mehta: just like with any other investor.

424
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.140
Sambhav Mehta: So from the other industry, do you really.

425
01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.499
Sambhav Mehta: there is moment to manage some sort of a

426
01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:42.550
Sambhav Mehta: 4. That is just a local thing. Then we bring others on board. Then the 1st one actually comes on board. But do we really do that with text ours.

427
01:21:43.070 --> 01:22:01.460
Sambhav Mehta: I would treat them like another investment that's making a follow on funding decision. It's not us making this decision. It is you theoretically competing with hundreds of other companies for programming at the same time like this is, it is one fund for all North American follow on funding. So it's

428
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:15.389
Sambhav Mehta: like it is unlikely to get it. If that's something that you really want in and around, you need to. I yeah, I know, I know our investment team. I know our investment team, I know Andrew Cleland, the chief investment officer, said. Yes, all of you.

429
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.070
Sambhav Mehta: because he had to approve

430
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:30.209
Sambhav Mehta: along with David Cohen each investment that I make. So they've looked at your company. They know it. So they're going to be critical of it. They've thought about it, and they ultimately chose you once didn't choose you again, and that his team Andrew's team is

431
01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:57.840
Sambhav Mehta: those are savage like I met with one of them last week, and like they're serious business, they remind me of like a legit later stage Vc. Deals as well like, you're not just competing against other 3 C rounds or C rounds you're competing against like a series B from a company that detection 5 years ago. It's a difficult time to work with and you need to. You need to be pretty buttoned up with how you're engaging, even if it is just a little fun. That's right.

432
01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.870
Sambhav Mehta: Good, great!

433
01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:03.889
Sambhav Mehta: I told you Amy got it right

434
01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.669
Sambhav Mehta: from live from our last San Francisco Club.

435
01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.329
Sambhav Mehta: Provision information can be provided.

436
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:25.500
Sambhav Mehta: Oh.

437
01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:29.860
Sambhav Mehta: some people may not even remember what this is. But we did ask them to do in the beginning.

438
01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:51.579
Sambhav Mehta: the founders at email. You'll remember this, some of you. Maybe not. It's okay. We recommend it in the beginning, we on boarded you in the 1st week that you create a founders at message for your domain, for your company. That's something that we would typically try if we have trouble getting a hold of you, or that this is a good catch. All that we use as a kind of internal best practice. A lot of Vcs are familiar with this, too.

439
01:23:51.990 --> 01:24:04.879
Sambhav Mehta: Just let just let us know if you change your email, please, because I will let you down through and like if I don't have the bandwidth like it might lose you for a few months, and I'll get upset anyway.

440
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:11.660
Sambhav Mehta: it's not saying like, Really, please, okay.

441
01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:22.569
Sambhav Mehta: I think this is redundant. We can probably talk through the end. Okay, I'll do my Abraham quote. You all know this. Abraham Lincoln quote. I think it's dope. Read it, take it in. It's important. I'll be sure to internalize this.

442
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:28.859
Sambhav Mehta: This is you guys, we're doing our best.

443
01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:39.009
Sambhav Mehta: We give each other feedback, we work on our mistakes. This is kind of like what I talked about last week in that secret sauce thing that did. But it's a similar thing where, like.

444
01:24:39.630 --> 01:24:56.970
Sambhav Mehta: you know, you can't do everything, and sometimes we overcommit it. Sometimes we have intentions to do things in certain way. We don't do it in a certain way. Just own it, move on from it, deal with it. But that all being said, we have feedback that we need from you, and we really want. So give it to us. Could you put that? Sure? Take it in? Yeah, go ahead

445
01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:09.080
Sambhav Mehta: still cool.

446
01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:11.120
Sambhav Mehta: Oh, man.

447
01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:23.989
Sambhav Mehta: but it's real. I relate to that. I feel that some of you might feel that, too. But that being said, I think you made this right, Chloe. I don't think it's this anymore. It might be Csat. Yes, so it's csat. Now.

448
01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:29.000
Sambhav Mehta: whatever it is, similar vein where the whole idea is like

449
01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:51.400
Sambhav Mehta: what people think a low score represents versus what it actually represents like, this isn't an Amazon. This is way more detailed nuance, and like taking everything into account. So, anyway, just understand what these numbers mean. If it's not this. And you see, set that you get. Understand what that means. Just know what score you're getting and what that represents, because sometimes you get founders go. I know you guys are awesome. So I gave you a 7.

450
01:25:51.930 --> 01:26:03.149
Sambhav Mehta: And I'm like, Wait, awesome is not a set just to be clear like. That's not what awesome means. But let's unpack what you mean. If you mean not so awesome and only awesome in these ways. That makes sense. But you mean mostly awesome. And you have a few critiques.

451
01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:05.010
Sambhav Mehta: Let's talk about what the score records.

452
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.509
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, yeah, that's it.

453
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:14.660
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah.

454
01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:26.759
Sambhav Mehta: So now, this, this nice, okay, let me just go ahead.

455
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:28.260
Sambhav Mehta: I don't know.

456
01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.610
Sambhav Mehta: It's a you.

457
01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:34.410
Sambhav Mehta: It's a question that they can be submit for a question this.

458
01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.440
Sambhav Mehta: But we solicit Internet.

459
01:26:41.820 --> 01:27:05.000
Sambhav Mehta: Okay, so now, what the emails are updates hash that they look at for thousands coming in. And it's important that they continue to receive those garbled letters

460
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:16.330
Sambhav Mehta: at basecamp.com like that super garbled email drop stuff right into a base camp project. So that is actually your best chance of getting mailed through your emails.

461
01:27:16.645 --> 01:27:39.360
Sambhav Mehta: So keep me on your list, obviously. But like the email platform to put that in there. I get a feed of all your dates in my little dashboard that I have all my companies. And then I have all the little running thing of emails like investor update emails that I see. It's like, whoever sending it to that basement thing that I get. I do get in my email, too.

462
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:44.850
Sambhav Mehta: Emails like, that's that's dangerous ground for me. You don't want to look at my inbox.

463
01:27:45.130 --> 01:27:51.749
Sambhav Mehta: But yeah, but he like basically built himself a separate inbox. That's only for founder investor in both.

464
01:27:51.920 --> 01:28:10.270
Sambhav Mehta: That's what matters. And then we'll share anything. You just copy things.

465
01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.260
Sambhav Mehta: No judgment.

466
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:15.710
Sambhav Mehta: It's all done. Okay, that's cool.

467
01:28:15.850 --> 01:28:17.559
Sambhav Mehta: So I do have like.

468
01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:19.430
Sambhav Mehta: So both of it.

469
01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.580
Sambhav Mehta: Bonus.

470
01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:29.000
Sambhav Mehta: Yes, but I think it's I do suggest.

471
01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.590
Sambhav Mehta: Beside.

472
01:28:37.670 --> 01:28:40.840
Sambhav Mehta: it is a little bit more. And

473
01:28:42.978 --> 01:28:57.559
Sambhav Mehta: but, like you said investor updates because it helps you.

474
01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:09.250
Sambhav Mehta: not because it helps us. So if you think it's some sort of homework obligation that we need to hold you accountable to, I would challenge you to rethink what you're thinking completely. And I made that really clear in the beginning, because

475
01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:16.189
Sambhav Mehta: you want to communicate to your investors about how things are going, whether or not they have something to help you with, because

476
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:19.280
Sambhav Mehta: later on down the road, if someone asked.

477
01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:29.370
Sambhav Mehta: Well, how is their communication and how they've been. Other investors are going to want to see what are all the updates you can send. That's 1 of the things that they look at to evaluate whether you're worthy of funding. Now you don't care about it.

478
01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:31.659
Sambhav Mehta: That's your choice.

479
01:29:32.170 --> 01:30:01.710
Sambhav Mehta: Just be aware that we're trying to help use the best practice based on what we think will help you things that you want. Yeah, example on how you can build that character yourself. If you remember the sending cooler updates workshop nature was like, Yeah, it hasn't like really helped me like, I guess if let's sometimes people respond whatever. And he had like 30, 40 people on his list, Alex, from purposely, who was able to make moves, get clients, get investors, do email updates had 400 people.

480
01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:07.632
Sambhav Mehta: So you you got to make your own carrot a little bit by getting more people involved and engaged in your journey,

481
01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:29.040
Sambhav Mehta: People would be more likely to respond. Once. They're a little bit less frequent and like, I'll be responsive emails when I'm getting them a little bit less. And when I'm not seeing you guys every day, but you gotta make your own and like expand your chances for success in terms of like letting people have access to the information they need to help you. Yeah, if you think about it like, it's homework for us, and you're doing it wrong.

482
01:30:31.690 --> 01:30:32.830
Sambhav Mehta: 100 people.

483
01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.210
Sambhav Mehta: That's why, like ourselves and such

484
01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.380
Sambhav Mehta: people are fine.

485
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:49.289
Sambhav Mehta: I I forward pros. Investor updates all the time to people.

486
01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.740
Sambhav Mehta: This is awesome.

487
01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:53.259
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, in 5 clicks.

488
01:30:54.220 --> 01:31:10.500
Sambhav Mehta: I think you, I understand. It's our responsibility. Yes, that's right.

489
01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.520
Sambhav Mehta: Just single

490
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:18.840
Sambhav Mehta: meetings there is.

491
01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:25.630
Sambhav Mehta: But it's not all of that.

492
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:43.150
Sambhav Mehta: The value that I was getting back it just happens so

493
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:53.630
Sambhav Mehta: wouldn't do it, we should do it because it's it's kind of it's important.

494
01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:58.010
Sambhav Mehta: Get a difficult step like the program.

495
01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.820
Sambhav Mehta: If you want to benchmark like what is what is like Sellers.

496
01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:26.309
Sambhav Mehta: I'm trying to get something new here, because I I'm hearing you and I, I feel it's the same point, and

497
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:36.890
Sambhav Mehta: like what I've said is still the response to what you're saying. This, there's

498
01:32:40.170 --> 01:32:54.430
Sambhav Mehta: yeah. So I'm not just saying that since so so can.

499
01:32:55.130 --> 01:33:01.010
Sambhav Mehta: here's what's helpful. And here's what helpful that is specific to the address you send me.

500
01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.120
Sambhav Mehta: It's

501
01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:14.399
Sambhav Mehta: different for this. That is exactly about. But I don't know that it's a decent. I'm just saying like for me.

502
01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:17.829
Trina Das: I'm sending this into the.

503
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:45.490
Sambhav Mehta: Sorry the Sydney killer updates workshop that we had. Yeah. So maybe we watch it. I don't know. You need to remind yourself of those things, because that's literally why we ran that workshop. It covers and addresses all the points that you're making. I think you made it really clear.

504
01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:54.930
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah, he's what what they took away from this. There's a hundred different best practice

505
01:33:55.810 --> 01:33:58.399
Sambhav Mehta: at the other day. Different call

506
01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:16.089
Sambhav Mehta: of different ways that work better for them to do this and generalize the format. Just do something that is useful for you.

507
01:34:17.202 --> 01:34:21.819
Sambhav Mehta: just saying that the difficulty in this is I

508
01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:41.119
Sambhav Mehta: for me, I'd love to have some feedback. So after Demo being, let's sit down for 15 min, and I'll like review and see if there's any sort of edits you can make to your structure to get more engagement.

509
01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:45.040
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah. But yeah, and then.

510
01:34:45.530 --> 01:35:00.310
Sambhav Mehta: so yes, yeah. So one more thing I'll flag is. Now, you guys will be more engaged with each other's updates. When we're seeing each other less frequently. So like it. It'll be nice to see each other stuff like, Make sure you guys are are all.

511
01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:02.180
Sambhav Mehta: And then.

512
01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:11.409
Sambhav Mehta: yeah, that's kind of it. But also you're in the Big Leagues. Now, man, you all control your own destiny. Whatever isn't working for you. Fix it.

513
01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.479
Sambhav Mehta: Fix it, Felix.

514
01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:21.390
Sambhav Mehta: You guys, yeah, waiting for me?

515
01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.000
Sambhav Mehta: Probably.

516
01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.420
Sambhav Mehta: Would she? Not necessarily something.

517
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:31.300
Sambhav Mehta: Hold on oops

518
01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:38.989
Sambhav Mehta: honestly what I would recommend and like what we probably should be doing is collective review as a backup.

519
01:35:39.670 --> 01:35:44.809
Sambhav Mehta: Just in case the company goes. Yeah, that's that's right. Yep, that happens.

520
01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.370
Sambhav Mehta: Or in case you change their names a bit, whatever people don't realize it.

521
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.440
Sambhav Mehta: When they pivoted. I've lost 500,

522
01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:57.549
Sambhav Mehta: and then per one had to reintrolate to

523
01:35:58.248 --> 01:36:05.810
Sambhav Mehta: one more, major giant thing that you guys are going to do at the end of the week. Okay.

524
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:32.569
Sambhav Mehta: you are going to turn on your basement email notifications. You're gonna turn this on because we are not going to bother you unless it's something we actually want you to see. So the level of notifications is going to drop so dramatically after Friday. And you guys are probably some of you, you're obviously welcome to continue using. Basically, if you want, the team is still going to be there still be accessible.

525
01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:36.380
Sambhav Mehta: But tools and implications aren't, because we'll have like

526
01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:39.689
Sambhav Mehta: events and stuff and resources, and like

527
01:36:39.850 --> 01:36:59.803
Sambhav Mehta: these are lawyers who offers are exclusive to San Francisco. All that stuff, and it's we only notify you. And and technically, you don't even have to log into basecamp ever again, you'll get email updates. And you can reply via email. So if you don't prefer logging to base camp, Carlos,

528
01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:18.360
Sambhav Mehta: oh, you start to like, okay, got it 3 months in emails about whatever is relevant to you. And then when you see those, you respond

529
01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:27.699
Sambhav Mehta: because they got to pay money, if they keep those okay who is coming back to galvanize after the pandemic.

530
01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:35.570
Sambhav Mehta: not not the week of New York, but the week after being in the building.

531
01:37:35.970 --> 01:37:37.499
Trina Das: Yeah, we do that.

532
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:48.739
Sambhav Mehta: It sounds like it's 17,

533
01:37:49.470 --> 01:38:14.840
Sambhav Mehta: and when you're done they have the keep up number 15. We'll call June 15.th I will verify

534
01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:22.999
Sambhav Mehta: cool, she? She said, that she can give. Give us that significant discount.

535
01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:26.029
Sambhav Mehta: If you want to stay for longer she'll give you a discount. Sounds like

536
01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:28.419
Sambhav Mehta: it's like 50 bucks is ours.

537
01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:33.880
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah.

538
01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.959
Sambhav Mehta: that's good. That's good. That's good. I like it.

539
01:38:52.900 --> 01:39:37.480
Sambhav Mehta: Yeah. Yeah. Including, no one gets what I get the best deals.

540
01:39:37.770 --> 01:40:06.319
Sambhav Mehta: So the Hq. Is going to remain unchanged. I will periodically post in the Hq. To like. Tell you the big alumni Hq. Is probably going to be the most active after program with that big stuff that's going on the individual company projects are going to be sunset like a month or 2 after program. It's a temporary archive. It can be on archived if you ever want to go back in there. But our like

541
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:32.819
Sambhav Mehta: on our team side. It's a nightmare. We have like 90 unused projects in our list. Yeah, we'll keep it active. We'll turn it on if you want to start using basecamp for real, for real. You're welcome to use my account for now I recommend you at some point getting your own account, because you want control of everything. I'm the admin on this account. So you want those admin powers which might be helpful to you and your team. Take them, but you'll have to take

542
01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:41.739
Sambhav Mehta: so alright. So it gets more real and more fun, I think tomorrow for a 10 by 10, and all that good stuff.

543
01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:45.559
Sambhav Mehta: And then, I think, has everyone read the weekly what to expect

544
01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:49.999
Sambhav Mehta: if you have not. And you have questions about anything happening this week.

545
01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:54.380
Sambhav Mehta: I'm not gonna answer your question, but I'm gonna point you to that, and then we'll talk.

546
01:40:54.530 --> 01:41:01.260
Sambhav Mehta: and we're also going to rewatch with our students. We'll talk about them today.

547
01:41:02.150 --> 01:41:09.530
