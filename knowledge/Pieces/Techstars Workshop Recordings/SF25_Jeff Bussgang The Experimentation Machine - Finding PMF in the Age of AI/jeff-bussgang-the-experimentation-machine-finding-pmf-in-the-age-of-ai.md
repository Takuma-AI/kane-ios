## Core Concepts

### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Jeff Bussgang: Yeah. And look, I'll say a few things that many people here know, I'm sure. But just to kinda summarize, there are a series of timeless methods for finding product market fit
- Jeff Bussgang: decades of working with startups, investing in startups and teaching thousands and thousands of Hbs students who went on to start companies. So that's there. Those are the timeless methods.
- Jeff Bussgang: and you want to make sure that you're still being very strategic about the timeless methods about picking the right hair on fire problem and value proposition, finding high willingness to pay building a sustainable, profitable, economic model, finding old fashioned competitive advantage and competitive moats. So that's really the interesting. Let's call it 2 eyes, seeing that you, as founders need to be able to do.

### Key Insights

> "Jeff Bussgang: customer discovery nailing down your ideal customer profile, starting narrow, doing things that don't scale running a series of experiments. I could have written about those things. I mean, I've been teaching about those things for the last 15 years. So I put that in the book because it's important to, I felt, synthesize a lot of those lessons from"

> "Kerty Levy: Awesome, awesome. I think that's you know, you're hitting on what everyone is going through right now.

So that's great. One of the things that we also got to read about. And also, you know, we've been discussing is"

Am I just going to be a Gpt wrapper? That's a fear we don't have with them because of that proprietary data set that is, then self reinforcing."

> "Jeff Bussgang: Gpt-two, Gpt. 3. Nobody used those platforms because they were just sdks, but when they launched Gpt. 3.5, they said, hey? Just for fun. Let's throw this Chatbot on it, and let's run the experiment to see if we can expose this to the common user. And of course the Chatbot was this killer app. So, understanding what the killer app is, and the killer human AI interface is a really important 3rd criteria, and then the 4th and final is when we talk about teams."

> "Gary Stark: 2 critical pieces of information from the health system. One is every single thing that they've bought. So we manage their entire purchase order, history number one, but number 2, we get their contracts. So you sparked my interest when you told me about the the moat of a proprietary data set.
