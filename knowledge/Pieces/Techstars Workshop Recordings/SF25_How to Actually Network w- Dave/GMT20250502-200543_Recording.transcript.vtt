1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.900
Chloe Lannert: So.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.260
Dave Scott: I know nothing other than I'm like, 6 months ahead of you guys.

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:16.616
Dave Scott: But Chloe asked me to come in and talk to you guys about networking, because I think that she observed that I was a relentless networker. And

4
00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:25.762
Dave Scott: I took. I took advantage of literally every opportunity to meet people and to to nurture relationships. And

5
00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.647
Dave Scott: and I think they I think they noticed it.

6
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:37.809
Chloe Lannert: Good. He like asked for connections with the right people, had the right rationale clean. Follow up like

7
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.059
Chloe Lannert: if you want to meet good people you like, Dave.

8
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.979
Dave Scott: A little, and also a little bit.

9
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.097
Chloe Lannert: A fun fact.

10
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.080
Dave Scott: During the 13 winks of tech stars I raised a half 1 million dollars.

11
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.709
Dave Scott: mentors and just everywhere, really, whoever I could talk to.

12
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.149
Chloe Lannert: I used to get rid of chest closed directly from the dramatics I've ever seen.

13
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.819
Dave Scott: Oh, wow, yeah.

14
00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:07.930
Dave Scott: so I was relentless the entire time about trying to take advantage of every ounce of this program.

15
00:01:08.352 --> 00:01:15.989
Dave Scott: And I'm just gonna give you guys some tips that they that I learned throughout the way it's gonna be very, very interactive session, that sound cool

16
00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:20.050
Dave Scott: alright right on okay, so

17
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.470
Dave Scott: I, I enabled this, find your tribe and part of the reason why I do that is because.

18
00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:27.210
Chloe Lannert: That.

19
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.350
Dave Scott: What I was seeking to do is to find other like minded people

20
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.660
Dave Scott: that can help me a lot with my journey.

21
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.960
Dave Scott: So my definition of a tribe is anyone who could relate to me. Other founders in my space mentors that were in my space

22
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.730
Dave Scott: invest

23
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:57.629
Dave Scott: that got what I was doing. People who know investors that got that like what I'm doing like, literally like, I tried to create as many tribes as possible. And and then each one of them was able to give me something back in return. So

24
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.390
Dave Scott: So mine is as Dave Scott. I'm with evil genius. Games, evil genius games just by way of

25
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:08.390
Dave Scott: of what we're doing is we create a gaming platform

26
00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.109
Dave Scott: which allows anyone to build a game based off of famous movie IP, so we are

27
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.859
Dave Scott: 30 billion dollar business, 30 billion dollar market.

28
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.180
Chloe Lannert: Oh, yeah, is it.

29
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.390
Dave Scott: All right.

30
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.189
Dave Scott: How about you guys online? Can you hear me.

31
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.000
Meg Hall: Yeah.

32
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.439
Chloe Lannert: Your laptop

33
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.980
Dave Scott: Yeah, this is better. The echo went away.

34
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.359
Dave Scott: Do you want to do that?

35
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.220
Dave Scott: Totally.

36
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.760
Meg Hall: I mean, this sounds fine.

37
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.789
Dave Scott: Hello, Hello! Actually, it is. It is on.

38
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.819
Dave Scott: It is on.

39
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.020
Dave Scott: So hopefully, you guys should hear me. Okay, I'll try to speak louder.

40
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.510
Meg Hall: It sounds good to us.

41
00:02:49.020 --> 00:03:01.879
Dave Scott: Alrighty. So so basically, we, we did 2 million dollars of revenue last year, 1.8 and we've raised 2.5 million dollars of money, so far from 33 people on our cap table.

42
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.700
Dave Scott: about a 3rd of our cap table were Vcs. And the other 2 thirds were angel investors

43
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.720
Dave Scott: of one shape or form

44
00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:18.920
Dave Scott: of the the 11, or of the 11 or 12 Vcs. We also got scouting checks from series, a companies

45
00:03:19.285 --> 00:03:30.249
Dave Scott: about 2 or 3 of those. So those are people who write checks more at the 10 million dollar range or whatever they like. What we were doing. They wrote a small check just so they can have pro rata rights going forward.

46
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.780
Dave Scott: Does that make sense?

47
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:42.529
Dave Scott: All right? So so you guys got to figure out where your tribe is. My tribe is gaming right? Any other gaming startup or gaming investor or gaming influencer?

48
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.440
Dave Scott: It is

49
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.980
Dave Scott: any B to C company. That's a broader tribe that I was working, that I was thinking through.

50
00:03:50.536 --> 00:04:00.970
Dave Scott: Another one is Wharton grads. I went to Wharton, so like networking through my my Wharton grads, even my undergrad, I went to William Mary undergrad. I found connections through that

51
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.062
Dave Scott: so Wharton grads, you know, undergrad grad undergrad grads,

52
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:18.090
Dave Scott: game makers. So through this program was actually able to get to know the found, the creator of mortal Kombat

53
00:04:18.973 --> 00:04:22.786
Dave Scott: which is like super random, but yet still not

54
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.239
Dave Scott: I ended up meeting the guy who created fortnite

55
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:40.439
Dave Scott: crazy, dude, crazy dude. But then he introduced me like 3 other people that then were like super useful. But like that's kind of how it rolls, which is like, even if they're not immediately an apparent. Oh, my God, those are my guys!

56
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.990
Dave Scott: That's funny.

57
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.790
Dave Scott: So that right there is. Hold on. Let me go. Route 2.

58
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.145
Dave Scott: So you can network, hey? If you ever see it live?

59
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.690
Dave Scott: Alright?

60
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.640
Dave Scott: Oh, my God, dangerous!

61
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.310
Dave Scott: Much request.

62
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.560
Dave Scott: Yeah.

63
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.250
Dave Scott: You know.

64
00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:32.170
Dave Scott: Part of this networking was. I met a guy who was in another techstars program, who happened to be a second time founder.

65
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:48.799
Dave Scott: and he had joined this club of what's called previously exited founders. So they're all people who already had a company before and exited out of it. And they're all like multimillionaires, if not billionaires. That guy runs the San Francisco chapter of the Pef organization

66
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:59.649
Dave Scott: which I found a bunch of investors through that. So he's he's in a he's meeting right now, but he said might stop by and introduce himself and talk about his journey. If you want

67
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.390
Dave Scott: talk about his situation in Pdf, because it's a sick organization.

68
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.759
Dave Scott: Yeah, wow, that's weird. That's super random.

69
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.110
Dave Scott: alrighty. So so from my perspective oops.

70
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:25.010
Dave Scott: So so I want you guys to sort of think about your tribe like, who's your tribe? And sort of what are the different ways? You can sort of slice and dice that tribe.

71
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.159
Dave Scott: And I'll take volunteers when you guys have an idea.

72
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.089
Dave Scott: Yeah, for sure.

73
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.680
Dave Scott: University and state from

74
00:06:39.478 --> 00:06:45.410
Dave Scott: yeah. So so by the way, State, not so much state. But city is really important. Because.

75
00:06:45.780 --> 00:07:05.439
Dave Scott: okay, so it's a little smaller. Yeah, so like people like. I found that the founders in Austin are like really close knit founders. And when you break into that category there's a whole ecosystem of investors that only invest in Austin based companies. And they're really, really loyal to their location. So I think that's a good one.

76
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.050
Dave Scott: And you didn't speak.

77
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.220
Dave Scott: Yeah.

78
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:23.920
Dave Scott: and even culture, right? So there's a lot of black and brown founder organizations that I belong to. There's actually an organization for immigrants. So if you're an immigrant. Then there's just just Vc investors that only invest in immigrants.

79
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:46.240
Dave Scott: There's 1 that only invests in in Asian founders who are second generation. There's ones that only invest in 1st generation college. I mean, there's all sorts of really weird Vc Theses out there that you could sort of take advantage of whoever you might be, or whoever you might identify with.

80
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.320
Dave Scott: then those are all super useful.

81
00:07:48.420 --> 00:08:01.000
Dave Scott: So, for example, in fundraising, you know, there are. I have a list of 100 diverse venture. Capital funds right? And so that will be a tribe I'm going to try to build is networking through that that particular

82
00:08:01.746 --> 00:08:05.860
Dave Scott: affinity group cool anything else?

83
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:12.939
Dave Scott: Oh, I was gonna ask question of, like, how you break into these like organizations?

84
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:33.350
Dave Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think. I think just through networking. You'll find someone who's in one of those groups, and they'll probably invite you because they're always desperate to grow. And then I think you go from there. So you know, I was just. I literally was talking to this ex tech stars, Guy, about the previously exit founders. And I said, How did you raise your round? He goes. Oh, my God! I just met this group

85
00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.259
Dave Scott: that's like Super Random. They're on discord.

86
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:44.170
Dave Scott: They talk about their yachts all day. And I'm like, Can I get an invite? And he's like, Yeah.

87
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.369
Dave Scott: I just like discord. It's like the randomest group is so funny. But they're super cool.

88
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.379
Dave Scott: And I wish I was that rich a bot?

89
00:08:55.323 --> 00:09:03.749
Dave Scott: So yeah, so think about it from the broadest perspective. And then why build a tribe. The whole reason is because I don't think that anyone could do what we're doing alone.

90
00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:16.569
Dave Scott: And not only that, but like it's amazing on how many like treasure troves I uncover from the most random conversations which lead to the most random stuff that leads to whatever like I I ran into, like

91
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:32.549
Dave Scott: a friend of mine for Wharton I had talked to 20 years. She asked me what I was doing. I told her this. She goes, do you know Ed Zobrus and I go. No, she goes. Let me connect you. So she connected me to Ed. Zobrist. Turns out that he was the Cmo. Right games when they 1st launched.

92
00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:34.559
Dave Scott: Fort fortnite!

93
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:55.740
Dave Scott: And so like. This guy's like a legend, right? But like it's just random like she happened to know him, and whatever. And then I actually flew down to La to speak to one of his classes. And you know, so it's just this weird how things get connected, which means super be. Have a super open mind, and don't be like attitudinal about who you talk to, because you never know what that next person is that they'll know

94
00:09:57.953 --> 00:10:26.900
Dave Scott: another example. I talked to a random producer. That produces Jj. Abrams films right? And the guy absolutely had 0 interest at all in investing in my company. But then he was like, Well, what kind of license do you like me? And I said, Oh, man, anything cool, sci-fi, and he's like, well, I know the producer of Westworld, and I'm like I make a game out of Westworld. And so he just recommended me to the producers of Westworld. So now we're going to do a deal. So it's just, you never know kind of what's going on.

95
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.329
Dave Scott: And, in fact, I'll give you guys some ideas on how to deal with that in the future?

96
00:10:31.858 --> 00:10:40.439
Dave Scott: So let's talk about ways to be able to build that group. Build your your networking. So the 1st one is the 1st one I took advantage of is techstars universe.

97
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.820
Dave Scott: So as soon as I got. Do you guys have your accounts yet

98
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.430
Dave Scott: soon as I got the counts I worked the hell out of this thing.

99
00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:51.539
Dave Scott: Like it was my job.

100
00:10:53.506 --> 00:10:58.799
Dave Scott: And so with techstars universe, as you guys know.

101
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.370
Dave Scott: You have this section called networking.

102
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.769
Dave Scott: and then it breaks it down networking company, entrepreneur investor.

103
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.800
Dave Scott: And so when you so this is me right here.

104
00:11:14.735 --> 00:11:20.060
Dave Scott: But when you do a search you can filter by a bunch of stuff.

105
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.990
Dave Scott: And so what I 1st did is I filtered by

106
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:30.849
Dave Scott: what other companies were in cohorts right now that have the same thesis as I am, or work in the same space.

107
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.149
Dave Scott: And then I called them all.

108
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.349
Dave Scott: and every single one of them met with me, and we compared programs.

109
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.699
Dave Scott: Then I went in and said who everyone in the history of Neil's

110
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.530
Dave Scott: Neil's cohorts did gaming, and I called Bimo.

111
00:11:44.870 --> 00:12:00.409
Dave Scott: And then I said, who in the entire networks universe does gaming, and I called them all so and you know, just learned a ton about how to make the best uses of this of the program. If they had investors, would they introduce me to their investors.

112
00:12:01.067 --> 00:12:14.730
Dave Scott: You know. Is there a opportunity for us to collaborate on something the whole 9 yards? And I found myself meeting with amazing game developers from Japan, from Sweden, from all over the world. Just sort of thinking through all this stuff.

113
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:22.269
Dave Scott: And what was the intention going into it? Was it to meet investors, was it to meet

114
00:12:22.927 --> 00:12:32.769
Dave Scott: make deals like when you got on the phone, like, what were you setting out to do? Yeah. So I always set a 15 min phone call. And it's literally just, hey.

115
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.850
Ankur Toshniwal: Breather.

116
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:45.189
Dave Scott: Cool. What am I doing like that? Was literally it. Like my whole objective for techstars. Universe was to figure out how to get the most out of the program. So the one question I asked everyone is.

117
00:12:45.300 --> 00:13:02.840
Dave Scott: what did you do to get that? You found the most valuable thing that you did in the program. And and that's what I focused on. And then all the other stuff was subsequent to that right? So but for me it was initially about building rapport building relationship, creating commonalities. Ask them how they exploited the program the best they could, and then roll from there.

118
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.899
Dave Scott: But, like super literal. So just to.

119
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.610
Dave Scott: So you go from universe.

120
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:30.250
Dave Scott: Then, literally, how did you reach out to them like Linkedin email? Yeah. So what I love about universe is, and it's not for everything. But you click on this the company and then you click on a profile. And in the profile oh, this is a bad.

121
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.140
Ankur Toshniwal: That example and the profile.

122
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.339
Dave Scott: It literally has their email address.

123
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:46.499
Dave Scott: Here you go. So this right here is Sully at Fableai. It's just right here, literally, yeah.

124
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:58.789
Dave Scott: super easy or just like, Hi, I'm a current text or founder. Do you have 15 min to hop on the phone to talk about your experience? Exactly. Yeah. And in fact, I think I actually might even have that blurred.

125
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.650
Dave Scott: because I write out all my blurbs ahead of time.

126
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.660
Dave Scott: Techstars blurb.

127
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.049
Dave Scott: This is what I used probably too long.

128
00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:14.400
Dave Scott: But I kind of laid it out.

129
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:25.710
Dave Scott: yeah. So I mean, I think it's a it's just a matter of of how you do it. If if that doesn't work that you could also use Linkedin.

130
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.751
Dave Scott: that's the other thing.

131
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:42.639
Dave Scott: so a lot of these guys. Sorry. Let me find this page. Okay, so a lot all of them have Linkedin on it, even if they don't have your email. So Linkedin's a good way to reach out. I do like the idea of keeping things short and simple. And these guys have a discord channel, so you can reach out via discord. So

132
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.360
Dave Scott: I just do every single way I could.

133
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.009
Dave Scott: Are you? We're getting asked me to have anything before sharing the

134
00:14:52.991 --> 00:14:57.910
Dave Scott: sure. Yeah, yeah, I'm happy to play around with that?

135
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.790
Dave Scott: Yeah.

136
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:17.189
Dave Scott: on another level? Or.

137
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:35.229
Dave Scott: yeah, exactly. So I spend the time kind of screening them right? Like, have they raised money before? Are they raising money from good people? What other things do they do, or things that they have.

138
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:52.099
Dave Scott: that I can have right like? Oh, do you have a really good mentor. And then I'm like, Hey, like, Hey, you know, you talked about John, he said, was like a killer mentor like, do you mind making an intro for me, or you talked about your your lead investor in your cap table. It sounds like they write $500,000 checks

139
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.929
Dave Scott: for companies like ours. Do you mind making an intro? And I never got turned down?

140
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:08.590
Dave Scott: Yeah, yeah. So think about the ways that you're connecting. And then and then definitely do it. Ask sometimes you'll you just have nothing in common.

141
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:26.660
Dave Scott: and then it ends with, it's nice to meet you, you know. You have a great day, you know, a couple of companies I met that were out of business, or that I met that, you know, just were like in a completely different space. And then, somehow, they're miscategorized, or whatever. And it's just like, Hey, nice to meet you, man.

142
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.480
Dave Scott: thank you.

143
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:28.929
Chloe Lannert: Jump in.

144
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.820
Dave Scott: Hearing about it.

145
00:16:42.665 --> 00:16:45.194
Dave Scott: Okay, so that's techstars. Universe,

146
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.530
Dave Scott: and so really great for finding current program goers

147
00:16:50.081 --> 00:16:57.249
Dave Scott: really great for finding alumni, mentors and other. Oh, and the other place also is mentors.

148
00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:06.560
Dave Scott: So you guys, have you guys gone through mentor madness? Yet you have okay? And so how many people do you connect with with Mentor madness? How many different mentors?

149
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:12.340
Dave Scott: 40. Okay. You know, there's 400 in the program.

150
00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.699
Dave Scott: So how many of the 400. Have you reached out to you other than the 40? Why not?

151
00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.480
Dave Scott: Oh, there's 16,000

152
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:31.630
Dave Scott: on the universe of mentors. Oh, my gosh! See, I didn't even know that. Yeah. But like, I should.

153
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:37.359
Dave Scott: just because just because they weren't assigned you to the program doesn't mean you can't reach out to them.

154
00:17:38.276 --> 00:17:48.079
Dave Scott: And so I think over the course of the program. I think I met another half dozen mentors just randomly through either Chloe or whatever, and like 3 of them, invested me

155
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:54.520
Dave Scott: so but also keep going.

156
00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.040
Dave Scott: Antoine sent me some verbals last name.

157
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.620
Dave Scott: I do remember these people. Yeah.

158
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:25.600
Dave Scott: yeah, so this is sort of the lookbook that we had during our mentorship, and then what we did is we we divided up, and each company was able to add notes and bios and information, so that we knew sort of what they were interested in. In addition to the information they already provided. So we created a whole spreadsheet. So we knew exactly who they were and stuff like that. And then we just attacked them.

159
00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:41.030
Dave Scott: So I know these guys told you like you should be like Inch, you know. Introduce, introduce yourself before the mentorship program. Then you have the meeting. Then you gotta reply afterwards. But if I were. You ask every single one of them for a follow up call.

160
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.000
Dave Scott: Why not?

161
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.170
Dave Scott: Yeah.

162
00:18:47.490 --> 00:19:14.699
Dave Scott: So, for example, Jan Kazera, he was one of my mentors not not much in common. We met each other in the social circles 3 or 4 more times, and then finally it clicked what I did, and he's now. He's introduced me now to 2 or 3 investors, because now he finally got that 30 min that I had with him he had no clue. What I was doing, and he had no reason to believe that he'd ever invest in my company or add value. And then, after he got to know me. He realized that there was some connectivity there.

163
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.999
Dave Scott: So I think just keeping those relationships and connectivity are huge is huge.

164
00:19:22.865 --> 00:19:35.520
Dave Scott: Also other managing directors. So I actually went to a program and end up bumping into a managing director from Los Angeles. Yeah. And Matt is awesome. He was apparently Neil's mentor.

165
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.059
Dave Scott: and he actually sat down and and ripped through my Powerpoint presentation.

166
00:19:42.350 --> 00:20:01.110
Dave Scott: You know, I actually ran into through my alumni organization. I ran into another techstars, part of the investment fund of techstars. He went to my same college, and he's now referring me to Vcs. So it's just random that I meet these people. But like I try to take advantage of every single human being I meet

167
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:13.269
Dave Scott: Linkedin's obviously huge. I you know it's funny. Neil kept talking about leveraging in Linkedin, and I was like, this is stupid like it's so much work. It's ridiculous. Blah blah blah

168
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.299
Dave Scott: but let me tell you why he was right. I was wrong.

169
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.318
Dave Scott: Couple things. Number one is

170
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.719
Dave Scott: really work on your linkedin profile.

171
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.329
Dave Scott: So if you guys come from a marketing background at all.

172
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.290
Dave Scott: do you guys know what SEO is?

173
00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:39.749
Dave Scott: Yeah? So searching search engine optimization is the strategy of making sure that all the keywords people are searching on are in your search. Terms of your content of your page

174
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.579
Dave Scott: turns out that that's exactly how Linkedin Search works as well.

175
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.870
Dave Scott: So

176
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:56.870
Dave Scott: if you're an AI company, put AI in your in your title. See how weird long my title is. It's there for a purpose, because when people search for things, I show up

177
00:20:58.376 --> 00:21:04.260
Dave Scott: if your tech stars along, put it in your title like this title can be unlimitedly long.

178
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.840
Dave Scott: And so think of it as sort of a computer search algorithm.

179
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:13.290
Dave Scott: Don't worry about readability of you and I, because this is how people are going to find you and do deals with you.

180
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:30.110
Dave Scott: even with every single one of my tools here of my experience actually say exactly what it is. Sas tabletop B, 2 C. Gaming. I'm hitting every single keyword that anyone could possibly search on for me. So I'm maximizing this for search engine optimization.

181
00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:35.149
Dave Scott: And then when you go to my and then does everyone have a page.

182
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:43.620
Dave Scott: a Linkedin page. Cool Linkedin pages are huge. It's it's surprising how many investors look for this

183
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:48.530
Dave Scott: and then do their homework before us, or look for my crunch, crunch base page.

184
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:51.740
Dave Scott: Yeah.

185
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.220
Dave Scott: Find their company page, and they're not sending files.

186
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.399
Dave Scott: Is there something?

187
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.630
Dave Scott: But I don't know.

188
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:01.830
Dave Scott: Oops.

189
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:07.889
Dave Scott: Yeah. It gives you an opportunity to control the narrative also because you get to control this page. But, like.

190
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.100
Dave Scott: you know this, I look pretty hot here, man, 11 to 50 employees. Is that right? I don't know.

191
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:20.690
Dave Scott: You know. Get my website in there, you know. The whole 9 yards.

192
00:22:22.398 --> 00:22:28.159
Dave Scott: So yeah, so like, make sure this is on how many guys post to it on a weekly basis.

193
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:53.409
Dave Scott: Yeah, there you go. Nice. Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah. I mean, the more content, the better carrying your narrative. I don't do a great job of it honestly, but but I could do a better job every single time you get press you can link it to this, which is something I'm horrible at. But like, yeah, use this as sort of an opportunity to present your package to potential networkers that are rely on Linkedin to make decisions for you.

194
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.950
Dave Scott: Yeah.

195
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:15.840
Dave Scott: yeah, yeah, I mean, so that's going to help grow your followership a lot. But then when you get to a real serious investor and they read it, and they find that that's what you're doing. It might shed a negative light.

196
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:34.539
Dave Scott: But it doesn't mean you don't have. You don't have to worry like you can still create quality posts quickly. AI does that like I'll be like, I want to write an article about this, and here are the 5 points I want to make, and they'll give me a halfway decent article like, and then you just massage, and you post it, man.

197
00:23:34.955 --> 00:23:39.199
Dave Scott: So like there's lots of different ways. You can do this without having to worry about

198
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.970
Dave Scott: about doing shitty articles.

199
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.920
Dave Scott: In fact, I did once. That's so funny. So one of our cohort members and techstars.

200
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:55.890
Dave Scott: Hi, there is is a hey? How are you, hey? No problem.

201
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.939
Dave Scott: hey? I want to introduce you to everybody.

202
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:24.289
Dave Scott: This right here is the current cohort of techstars. San Francisco. Yeah. So Peter's a great friend of mine through the Pdf program which is previously exited founders.

203
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:47.590
Dave Scott: And it's been a real, wonderful network. Do you want to? Do you mind giving 15 seconds about what previous exit founders are, yeah, yeah. So basically, this is the biggest community of founders who had had a financial exit and are no longer involved in the day to day. And so our people were very nice, because when you get there, you know that it was smart for us.

204
00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.589
Dave Scott: a lot of humanity, very, very weak retirement.

205
00:24:50.810 --> 00:25:07.700
Dave Scott: I'm also you. I mean, I'm doing some training for you organization. Once your business gets a million revenue to get the kind of support personal also with peers. It's amazing product is that people are really so happy to help.

206
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:16.510
Dave Scott: When I reached out to some for some mentors when I ran mentorship, I thought 5 people

207
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.889
Dave Scott: I trouble like going through the list.

208
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:24.380
Dave Scott: So in terms of whatever you're building, by the way you can, you can connect

209
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:30.960
Dave Scott: with us with me. If there's some ways that we can support you in your journey connections, maybe investment, other stuff.

210
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:39.220
Dave Scott: Do you want to give 10 seconds on what your exit was, yeah. So 4 startups. 1, st 3 learning experiences.

211
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.610
Dave Scott: The last one was a Saas platform for car dealers.

212
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.040
Dave Scott: We have partners, you know, excel and market their cars

213
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.220
Dave Scott: exit, travel the world. Some reflections around here.

214
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.210
Dave Scott: Something is missing. You may get to that one

215
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.019
Dave Scott: right? You're on your business. But then, who am I?

216
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.290
Dave Scott: And then so travel the world a little bit, met some interesting people.

217
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:03.749
Dave Scott: And now, on the other side, having other founders inquire.

218
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.410
Dave Scott: basically, people who are trying to do a success.

219
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.709
Dave Scott: We're struggling with the next level.

220
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.640
Dave Scott: That's what they're missing. Something

221
00:26:16.554 --> 00:26:18.609
Dave Scott: internationally.

222
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.380
Chloe Lannert: Organize events a lot of people are doing.

223
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.379
Dave Scott: Especially when there's like 1.6.

224
00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.449
Chloe Lannert: People of our country in a group of 25, having ice cream.

225
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.519
Dave Scott: But I figured awesome.

226
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.580
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, so what? Well, that's a quest. Do they have to.

227
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:41.920
Dave Scott: Permission to reach out you to with you via Linkedin. By all means, by all means

228
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:52.240
Dave Scott: ask anything. If you have a question that can help in some way with my resources or intro. Happy to do that! We have a cohort company who's

229
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.009
Dave Scott: very exciting because they're in the same business as your as your

230
00:26:58.191 --> 00:27:10.019
Dave Scott: hey? Thank you so much, Peter.

231
00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.740
Dave Scott: All right. See, there you are. That's the power of networking.

232
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:21.160
Dave Scott: So this guy puts coffees on all over the city once a week.

233
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:28.979
Dave Scott: Just pop in, have coffee. It's all investors and previously exited founders. Post exited founders.

234
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.740
Dave Scott: Good Guy, to know.

235
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.790
Dave Scott: So how funny! How funny!

236
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:36.250
Dave Scott: Alright!

237
00:27:37.940 --> 00:28:07.090
Dave Scott: I know. So post. So so get your company profile page up, post and grow. And now searching networks. Now this is something that I actually, I actually learned here. And I was like, this is stupid. And then, now I'm like, Oh, it was not stupid! It was actually super valuable but this is my buddy, Michael Kim Michael Kim runs a fund to fund. So he runs an organization that funds Vcs

238
00:28:07.566 --> 00:28:14.760
Dave Scott: and so this right here is the search function. I don't know if you guys, anyone's ever showed you how to use this yet you guys have

239
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.059
Dave Scott: totally use it.

240
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:31.789
Dave Scott: Okay? So the way I've done it is, it's a lot of work, because I go to all filters. I then go to venture capital and private equity, and then now I can see all the people he knows in venture. Capital.

241
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:36.689
Dave Scott: So this guy here, Larry Marcus, is a consumer. Vc. Wait. I know Larry Marcus

242
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.840
Dave Scott: for all of them.

243
00:28:38.479 --> 00:28:43.720
Dave Scott: And and then take a look at it, and then what I can do then is, I can go, Michael.

244
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:56.610
Dave Scott: I know you know, Larry, I send him affordable saying, I know you know Larry. Larry would be great as an investor. My company, because of XY, and Z. Would you mind an introduction? And then I send affordable, he forwards it on.

245
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:03.462
Dave Scott: We've been going back and forth on this. It's so relevant.

246
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.390
Dave Scott: Sorry I'm doing it right now.

247
00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:16.489
Dave Scott: Always, always, always, always. It's a someone said it was like a 6 or 7 x increased response rate.

248
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.900
Dave Scott: Yeah, I always do it, no matter what short and sweet.

249
00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:30.019
Dave Scott: So I also spend 50 bucks a month for Linkedin Navigator. I don't know if you guys know, or like navigator

250
00:29:30.975 --> 00:29:37.599
Dave Scott: what navigator allows you to do? What allows me to do is it allows me to send emails to people even when I'm not connected to them.

251
00:29:38.602 --> 00:29:50.410
Dave Scott: and I I'm still debating whether or not that's a good thing or bad thing. But I went through a spurt during techstars just reaching out to a bunch of people through this, and I got like 20 responses from Vcs that asked for my

252
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.750
Dave Scott: ask for my pitch deck.

253
00:29:52.930 --> 00:30:01.060
Dave Scott: So I thought it was broken. And then I realized, 2 months later I went in and said, Let me see what's going on. And everyone responded, I'm like, Oh, my God, I just totally abandoned this.

254
00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.819
Dave Scott: this, this, this technology, and didn't even know.

255
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:08.719
Dave Scott: So it does work, you know, for cold calling. It works pretty well.

256
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:17.599
Dave Scott: Local events don't skip out on local events. You guys are all here. You could go to event every single day.

257
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.748
Dave Scott: Oh, you're really good at this

258
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:28.190
Dave Scott: but like I don't know who this person is. But somehow I got into her newsletter, Marianne Becker.

259
00:30:29.437 --> 00:30:32.719
Dave Scott: So you guys are on Marianne's Newsletter.

260
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.930
Dave Scott: Oh, yeah, it's an email thread.

261
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.470
Dave Scott: like every single day like she has. She knows everything that's going on in the city. And every

262
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.370
Dave Scott: okay. Yeah.

263
00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:54.740
Dave Scott: So like Monday, Wednesday, Thursday. This is the Giga party also Thursday

264
00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:05.279
Dave Scott: also Thursday, like like there's like. Usually there's like 10, like like 3 or 4 events to choose from. And I just whenever I'm free, I just go to one of these events.

265
00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.530
Dave Scott: And I love how you do events because you are so efficient.

266
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:17.019
Dave Scott: Yeah, yeah. So I'm the King of the Irish. Goodbye. I think you caught me leaving once

267
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.226
Dave Scott: only once, only once.

268
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.679
Dave Scott: I love dipping early.

269
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.640
Dave Scott: See who comes on and leaves

270
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.590
Dave Scott: because he doesn't want to hear the secret. He's like, I'm gonna go home with my kid.

271
00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:47.410
Dave Scott: Yeah. So the advantage of going early is. You actually know who the the organizers are, because they're the only ones there at that point. In time you actually get to know them

272
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:53.659
Dave Scott: and you help them set up, or whatever, and as people come in, and no one else to talk to other than you.

273
00:31:53.810 --> 00:32:06.179
Dave Scott: so you can meet every single person that comes in and have more one on one time than if you break in, and everyone's already in a conference. You know you've been there. You come in late. Everyone's already in the conversation. It's like you gotta awkwardly walk and go. Hey? What do you do?

274
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:10.900
Dave Scott: You don't have to do that. So what I do is I I ask them what they do.

275
00:32:11.469 --> 00:32:19.849
Dave Scott: If it's relevant, then I'm like this is super cool. We should connect up, show my Linkedin badge we scan, and then I'm off to the next person.

276
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:48.230
Dave Scott: if it's not relevant. Same thing. Hey? Nice to meet you, good luck! And I leave if it's a Vc. Then I ask them, what are they investing in right now? If it's something that's interesting, that's similar to what I do, I'll actually pull them aside and get their email address. If it's not something relevant. I do. And this is something that's totally clutch. Oh, you know what I was part of the techstars program, and I have another fellow company that actually does what you guys are excited about. Can I make an introduction?

277
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.770
Dave Scott: It turns out that you build a lot of credibility with investors when you can give them deal flow.

278
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.809
Dave Scott: It's yeah. This is killer, like killer in North Carolina.

279
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.139
Dave Scott: Yeah. And then I just shoot a bunch of leads to my buddies

280
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.060
Dave Scott: per policy.

281
00:33:09.646 --> 00:33:18.669
Dave Scott: Well, I kind of feel like they're actually they're self explanatory. So probably not gonna go to to women and invest women in AI,

282
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.680
Dave Scott: because I'm not an AI company nor a woman.

283
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:35.619
Dave Scott: this one could be okay. But they tell you right here. Climate energy, sustainable. AI enterprise journal tech. Literally. No gaming on this list. Probably not the right spot for me.

284
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:39.879
Dave Scott: This party. I don't even know what's going on here? Maybe.

285
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.900
Dave Scott: Yeah, this one I might go to, because it's generic enough.

286
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.619
Dave Scott: And then, like they, they have a promise of good food

287
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:52.340
Dave Scott: like, I love. The last event I went to last night. I literally pocketed all the Gary Deli chocolates.

288
00:33:52.470 --> 00:34:13.489
Dave Scott: It was like dinner, so the last one I went to was this one. It was super weird, and I got I get in. I meet a bunch of people, and they're all not really related. But if they're remotely related as founders. What I'll do is, I'll actually say, listen. I think I've got a couple of investors that I've met with that really like to invest in you. Let's connect and let's trade leads.

289
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:22.640
Dave Scott: particularly if they already they already have a have already had fundraising. I'll say I'll trade one for one an introduction in one of your investors to an introduction of one of my investors.

290
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:25.099
Dave Scott: and usually they're like, I love it. Let's do it.

291
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:44.259
Dave Scott: Then I ended up chatting with this Vc. Who was like really, really excited about humanoid robots. And so I listened to him drone on about humanoid robots for about 20 min, and then he finally asked me what I did. He goes, oh, my God! I've got a buddy of mine that invests in exactly what you guys do? Can we connect? Got that guy's email?

292
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.920
Dave Scott: Then I grab my Ghirardelli's put in my pocket and then dips.

293
00:34:49.570 --> 00:35:02.810
Dave Scott: So my whole goal is like, I try to make 3 meaningful in introductions meaningful meetings. And then that's enough for me, for any given event is to make 3 meaningful intros.

294
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.059
Dave Scott: That's great.

295
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:20.659
Dave Scott: Yeah. So this. So that this was last night. Guess who the Vc. Was that dude?

296
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.620
Dave Scott: So he already accepted my thing. Invite right? So check out Stanley Chang.

297
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.660
Dave Scott: cool PIN PIN Guy. So on and so forth.

298
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.950
Dave Scott: Partner at Silicon Valley Venture Fund. Don't know what that means.

299
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.190
Dave Scott: So then what I'll do is I'll send her a message.

300
00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.630
Dave Scott: and I got like, Hey, Stanley.

301
00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.989
Dave Scott: awesome to meet you last night.

302
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:13.630
Dave Scott: You said you had a friend, and Myspace would love move them.

303
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.099
Dave Scott: We should also connect.

304
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:28.947
Dave Scott: Here is my calendar, so I always offer my calendly just because

305
00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.820
Dave Scott: You never know

306
00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.349
Dave Scott: where's my calendar?

307
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:41.309
Dave Scott: Can you use the citizen on that

308
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.700
Dave Scott: never heard of it. Is it cool, weird?

309
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:55.220
Dave Scott: If you have this little thing of all the links that I use all the time

310
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.289
Dave Scott: sits on your screen.

311
00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.488
Dave Scott: How do you find it?

312
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.099
Dave Scott: Just it's if you go to applications.

313
00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.660
Dave Scott: it's in applications in 6 sticky.

314
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.110
Dave Scott: So then I just copy this thing over. Okay, thanks,

315
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.269
Dave Scott: and then hop. Hop on the Linkedin

316
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.349
Dave Scott: back on Linkedin, and like them.

317
00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.960
Dave Scott: 15 min meeting. No obligation, no must, no fuss.

318
00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:29.170
Dave Scott: There is. There is an invoice proportion. The less you write the bed, the greater chance they'll actually respond.

319
00:37:39.402 --> 00:37:41.688
Dave Scott: Yeah, I leave.

320
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:55.310
Dave Scott: I'll be honest with you, like I think you can find gold out of any event, I'll give you an example. I went to a mansion party in Los Altos.

321
00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:00.650
Dave Scott: There were like 9 dudes there. They forgot to buy drinks.

322
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:07.239
Dave Scott: and so like they were like, well, like like 1 1 person was like, Well, I think I've got like a kombucha in the fridge.

323
00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.680
Dave Scott: It was just the worst situation you could ever imagine. Right?

324
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:22.540
Dave Scott: Yeah, it was like, it was like, just it was awkward and everything but then strolls in this guy who runs a a billion dollar

325
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:30.200
Dave Scott: runs a billion dollar family office that was that lives next door to this house

326
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.799
Dave Scott: Super random, so I got his number right.

327
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.580
Dave Scott: The rest of the conversations were horrible.

328
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:44.270
Dave Scott: so I spent like 30 min there. I got this guy's number. I called her to win, and then I left.

329
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.609
Dave Scott: So it was like 30 min, and it was raining, too. So

330
00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:54.540
Dave Scott: but you know, 30 min out of my time. I just got I got a guy who runs a billion dollar aum family office.

331
00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:01.250
Dave Scott: It's worth it. So I I don't think there's any negative unless you're in harm's way. I don't think there's any negative

332
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.529
Dave Scott: other than your time to doing some of this stuff.

333
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:10.740
Dave Scott: Do you call people after the event on the phone. Do you text them? Get their numbers?

334
00:39:11.626 --> 00:39:24.889
Dave Scott: No. Well, typically, I try to grab their email addresses. It's very intimate to actually try to reach out them on the phone, and it happens very rarely they'll give you their phone number. So I apologize about that. That usually don't get usually don't get that.

335
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:49.990
Dave Scott: I'm super lazy like half the time I write it down. But I actually so like your sticky notes, I'm religious about notes. So everything goes in my notes folder. What I like about my notes folder is that it goes with me everywhere, so I can access the same notes here

336
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:57.519
Dave Scott: or here or on my ipad, and I don't have to worry about it. So I just jot down a note on here. And then, typically it follows me around

337
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:05.049
Dave Scott: 2 comments and a question for you. So 2 comments about to be tracking people, I have a Google sheet of people.

338
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:34.009
Dave Scott: The morning after the event, he'll send them a message on Linkedin wants to reach out to them. It's not like you disconnect some kind of connection there.

339
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:43.370
Dave Scott: It helps you remember what we're talking about. So like, Hey.

340
00:40:46.460 --> 00:41:03.269
Dave Scott: yeah, here's the other cool tool that I created. So I met this guy named Jimmy Ku through an investor. Jimmy does not have any money to. Oh, man, I wish I had the money right now. It's not liquid. So I went on his Linkedin and I actually found all the people who I thought had money.

341
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:11.219
Dave Scott: And then I sent this list to him and said, Hey, the ones in yellow like, can you make intros for me, and he's he's he's doing it.

342
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.250
Dave Scott: So just just make lemon lemonade out of any kind of lemon you get.

343
00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.120
Dave Scott: Honestly.

344
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.160
Dave Scott: No, there's no bad connection there.

345
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.939
Dave Scott: 17, that is.

346
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.920
Dave Scott: And he said.

347
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:34.669
Dave Scott: the ones in yellow, would you be open to making an intro? And if he says Yes, in fact. So what I do on this list

348
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:40.660
Dave Scott: is, I actually have a just a section here where he can actually type in yes or no.

349
00:41:41.273 --> 00:41:45.149
Dave Scott: Most people don't do it. And then I then I create custom.

350
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:48.510
Dave Scott: I create custom forwardables for every single one of them.

351
00:41:48.740 --> 00:42:11.830
Dave Scott: So if you see here for every single person that I found on Linkedin. I actually did research. I actually went to their website. I actually studied what their investment, who they invested in, whether or not they even write checks in my space the whole 9 yards. So it took me probably 15 min per one person on this list, so it took me 3 or 4 h to do this list, and then for the ones that I wanted to introduce me to, I sent them just those.

352
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.579
Dave Scott: and said, Are you willing to

353
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.500
Dave Scott: the ones that are, yeah, the the ones in yellow.

354
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:27.869
Dave Scott: It's a 15 min call. Man. Yeah, yeah, I keep a lot of rapport in 15 min.

355
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.959
Dave Scott: and and just be sure I did it right.

356
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:36.530
Dave Scott: Tell him, hey? I needed your connections.

357
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.489
Dave Scott: There's some of them I don't know.

358
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:45.190
Dave Scott: I'm sorry. Put that on the caller just in a follow up email.

359
00:42:45.657 --> 00:42:52.209
Dave Scott: So it's funny is in this case, I forgot to do it. So I just shot him the email afterwards.

360
00:42:52.807 --> 00:43:15.949
Dave Scott: But usually yeah, it would be kinder if you did it in the in the email rather than blasted him. But here's the crazy thing. So what Jimmy ended up doing last weekend is he got? He called me up in the middle of the weekend, and he goes. I'm happy to do it. Do you have a blurb and I go. I got a blurb, but it kind of sucks he goes. Send me everything. Then what he did. Check this out. He wrote my blurbs for me.

361
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:23.120
Dave Scott: So he actually wrote, look at this 6 different possible ways. I can reach out

362
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.100
Dave Scott: based on the information he collected about my company.

363
00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:33.709
Dave Scott: And he's like, let's try them all. Let's just see which one sticks. Let's do a B split tests across each one of them.

364
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.860
Dave Scott: Okay, this is, go ahead.

365
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:50.060
Dave Scott: So that's kind of yeah. But you know, what's funny is is

366
00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:59.339
Dave Scott: this has happened to me a dozen times where someone doesn't have the money to invest. But they like what you do, and they and they have friends.

367
00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:04.350
Dave Scott: So they get right in the middle of it with you, and they start working on your behalf.

368
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.380
Dave Scott: and they don't ask for anything in return.

369
00:44:12.145 --> 00:44:17.430
Dave Scott: Tried to get him invest to invest.

370
00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:28.579
Dave Scott: Yeah, this is this is meeting him on Youtube on zoom after the fact.

371
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.510
Dave Scott: Yeah, yeah, thank you for typing. Yeah, yeah.

372
00:44:32.823 --> 00:44:38.120
Dave Scott: So I know we're running out of time. And I, I even have a phone call I've got to make. But let's let's keep going.

373
00:44:38.681 --> 00:44:45.730
Dave Scott: Has this helpful. By the way, you guys would forget all of it like, I forget, forget everything.

374
00:44:46.147 --> 00:44:56.719
Dave Scott: So here's the tools that I use. So Linkedin, obviously, Linkedin Sales Navigator. Have you guys are ever heard of. Hunter. I think this is a product that you guys taught me about. Okay, have you guys ever heard of? Yam?

375
00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:03.389
Dave Scott: Yam is awesome dude. Oh, my God, I'm addicted to yam.

376
00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.950
Dave Scott: It's free. Yeah, it's 1,500 a week.

377
00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.440
Dave Scott: No, 1,500 now.

378
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:21.480
Dave Scott: Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah, I've been using it all along. But all you gotta do is you got to create a list like this

379
00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:24.659
Dave Scott: with 1st name, last name, and then the fund name

380
00:45:25.118 --> 00:45:35.960
Dave Scott: and then you go into extensions and you do yet another mail merge, and then it finds an open draft of an email in your inbox. So right here all my open drafted emails.

381
00:45:37.263 --> 00:45:41.909
Dave Scott: Sorry here, you know. So like here, genius tech lab.

382
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:53.380
Dave Scott: Remember, I told you about SEO tech stars alum 5 times. Founder B, 2 B Saas, 1.8 like, I lay everything out right like. So he opens the email. And then this is one of Jimmy's

383
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:54.620
Dave Scott: verbiages.

384
00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:10.489
Dave Scott: and so it mail merges with it, which is, and it mail. It makes it look totally natural. So long as your data is good it'll look good right, you know, like you gotta have the 1st name. You gotta have whatever you can even add attachments to it

385
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.620
Dave Scott: like your deck like it's sick.

386
00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.130
Dave Scott: and it looks like it's coming directly from you.

387
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.430
Dave Scott: Yeah.

388
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:29.750
Dave Scott: So this is ridiculous. Okay, so what else can I show you? So we showed you the jimmy list.

389
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:42.729
Dave Scott: Oh, so also I. Whenever I create blurbs, I create hundreds and hundreds of blurbs. So like Jimmy, how Jimmy created 6 or 7 blurbs. This is the. This is the one I did before. So

390
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:48.800
Dave Scott: existing investor, Blurb, new outreach. Actually, one of my investors wrote this for me.

391
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:55.740
Dave Scott: a condensed version of what he wrote an enhanced version of what he wrote, Vcs that have passed

392
00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.499
Dave Scott: post exit founders, email

393
00:47:00.942 --> 00:47:08.120
Dave Scott: and then I actually do responses. So, for example, if a post exit founder turns me down.

394
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.430
Dave Scott: I send this thanks for the reply.

395
00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:28.390
Dave Scott: as as you're part of the Pef group, then you've been in my shoes before any help I can get connecting to potential investors is critically important at this point in my journey. Can you think of one or 2 investors that are willing to invest in a strong B to C Sas business like my own.

396
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:34.119
Dave Scott: And it's amazing how many people respond and will actually make an intro for you.

397
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.440
Dave Scott: And this all works because David's in here which

398
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.200
Dave Scott: you're like, you're delightful now. But on

399
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:50.210
Dave Scott: you- you guys have minimum that seems like on and so on.

400
00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.479
Dave Scott: And I'm an introvert.

401
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.279
Dave Scott: Yeah, I have 15 min of good material

402
00:47:57.976 --> 00:48:06.980
Dave Scott: and then this is like, follow up Linkedin intros as well. So I just write everything down. I get them all done and then I just track like an A B split test everything that's going on.

403
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.315
Dave Scott: So no, we're still

404
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:27.309
Dave Scott: all spreadsheets. Man, like, yeah, I so like, I tried to like, customize hubspot and stuff like that. It's just it's a lot. I actually tried a product called Turbo Fund. I can't remember who introduced me to Turbo Fund.

405
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:32.749
Dave Scott: which is, oh, yeah, I think I think techstarts did. Actually, I think this is a tech starts company.

406
00:48:33.408 --> 00:48:44.930
Dave Scott: So Turbofund, basically is exactly like techstars universe. So you can actually go in. You could. It'll search for investors based on your criteria, and then you could actually add them to your pipeline.

407
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.240
Dave Scott: Yeah, you select tulip adds to your pipeline. You could track them across the Crm.

408
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:58.259
Dave Scott: The only problem is, it's it's super buggy. And so I stopped using it because it kept losing my data.

409
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.920
Dave Scott: Yeah.

410
00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:11.830
Dave Scott: So streak is another version like yam. The the problem with streak is it's hard. I keep losing the I keep losing the data.

411
00:49:12.377 --> 00:49:15.230
Dave Scott: As well. It's it's it's more complicated

412
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:26.429
Dave Scott: specifically for selection. I can see, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

413
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.909
Dave Scott: yeah. I mean, you see, here, I've got Streak right here.

414
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:34.290
Dave Scott: So. But I've tried it. I just haven't worked it.

415
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.380
Dave Scott: Let's see.

416
00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:37.510
Dave Scott: Beautiful.

417
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:42.590
Dave Scott: Oh, you're not talking about streak the app. There's a Crm tool called Streak.

418
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.549
Dave Scott: It's a Gmail native.

419
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:49.270
Dave Scott: Oh, really.

420
00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:55.309
Dave Scott: No, no, yeah, it's integrated into Gmail, right? Yeah. Streak that same one. But it's a 3rd party product.

421
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:59.909
Dave Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's the one I use. Right?

422
00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.029
Dave Scott: Cool.

423
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.700
Dave Scott: Is that helpful folks?

424
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.109
Dave Scott: That's all. I got

425
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:17.379
Dave Scott: a pretty damn good. But how do you structure these conversations and networking events to be more purposeful

426
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:24.790
Dave Scott: to bounce, not being mercenary. Yeah, yeah, like this.

427
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:29.069
Dave Scott: Oh, hey, what's going on? Big. Nice to meet you, Andrew, what are you doing?

428
00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:35.920
Dave Scott: We're kind of partners. We let teams, parallel platforms with web and document data. As you know. Code

429
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:39.610
Dave Scott: cool. That's our time.

430
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:48.539
Dave Scott: Everybody's money yet some friends and family and text, everyone. Oh, cool, nice.

431
00:50:48.800 --> 00:51:10.969
Dave Scott: Well, good luck. But that's really it. Like, it's really just like and just trying to relate to them yesterday. And we chatted about San Francisco restaurants nearby.

432
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.580
Dave Scott: Yeah, I see exactly.

433
00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:15.989
Dave Scott: It's a it's a good luck.

434
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:22.799
Dave Scott: Yeah. So it's usually the average sites. It's like, Hey, well, it's nice to meet you. I'm gonna grab a few other slice of pizza.

435
00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:45.759
Dave Scott: or Oh, my God, that's all you gotta do. So what's nice about food and drink? Is it resets everything, and if there's no food or drink, it's you know what. I just got to hit the rest a little bit or phone call like there's there's always reasons for you to exit out of a meeting out of a conversation.

436
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:57.570
Dave Scott: Here's the other thing that I do is really super cool. It's like, Hey, hey, hey, Chris, anytime?

437
00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:09.450
Dave Scott: Yeah. The handoff. Yeah, I should name that the handoff super useful.

438
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:17.060
Dave Scott: They're just connecting everyone with everybody. Yeah, that's right.

439
00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:19.300
Dave Scott: Exactly.

440
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.979
Dave Scott: Yeah. So the connecting one's great.

441
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:27.809
Dave Scott: Yeah. Cause you're like, you know. Oh, I just talked to another guy who's actually doing something similar your space. Do you mind if I bring him over here.

442
00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:31.760
Dave Scott: Go get them, introduce themselves.

443
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:34.640
Dave Scott: I leave Irish. Goodbye.

444
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:58.670
Dave Scott: So one thing I love doing, and also so like, let's say, I'm talking to you guys

445
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:11.180
Dave Scott: and some random dude is walking by because you can see people looking for a conversation. And there's just a certain percentage population that can't interact.

446
00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.940
Dave Scott: And then look around here.

447
00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:35.923
Dave Scott: And I said, Okay, oh, sorry. Nice to meet. You want to join our conversation. And then that person stops going on about. Okay, my name is Chris. And then it stops from talking. And there's a new thing.

448
00:53:38.684 --> 00:53:47.129
Dave Scott: Yeah. So I try to be as inclusive as possible.

449
00:53:59.237 --> 00:54:07.590
Dave Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna jump. But you guys know, you guys know how to find me, Chloe, I'm on base camp

450
