**Workshop:** Understanding Your Customers Workshop Part 1  
**Cohort:** OAK24  
**Date:** February 27, 2024  
**Facilitators:** Neal Sáles-Griffin (Managing Director), Lilliana Robinson  
**Type:** Customer Discovery & JTBD  
**Tags:** #customer-research #jtbd #product-market-fit #forces-of-progress #customer-interviews

## Overview

This foundational workshop introduces the Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework to help founders deeply understand their customers' motivations, struggles, and decision-making processes. Neal Sáles-Griffin and Lilliana Robinson guide founders through the core concepts, practical applications, and nuanced techniques that have helped Techstars companies achieve significant breakthroughs in customer understanding and business growth.

## Key Themes

1. **Progress Over Products**: Customers don't buy products; they hire them to make progress in their lives
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Deep understanding from 10-12 JTBD interviews trumps hundreds of surface-level conversations
3. **Humility in Discovery**: It's not about your solution yet - it's about understanding their struggle
4. **Forces of Progress**: Understanding what drives and inhibits customer behavior change
5. **Timeline of Decision**: Mapping the complete customer journey from first thought to ongoing success

## Opening Context: Why JTBD Matters

Neal opens with a powerful collection of feedback from Techstars mentors:

> "Use storytelling of current customers experiences to help sell the product. Start giving me stories about the customers. Don't chase your customers, understand your customers. Focus less on sales till you know your customers. Stop building out technology, focus on the business. Stop thinking of the company as technology, start thinking about it as a problem you're solving. Too obsessed with product. Hit the brakes on tech dev, sharpen the story."

This feedback consistently emerges during Mentor Madness, highlighting a common founder blindspot: building before truly understanding.

## The Framework's Power: Real Success Stories

### Performview (B2C Example)

Indy Sanders, founder of Performview ("Netflix for video art"), shares transformative results:

- **Initial skepticism**: "I've done a lot of customer interviews before. Why do I need to do more now in this entirely new format?"
- **Key learning objective**: Why do people sign up? What are they doing about it?
- **Discovery**: Found emotional reasons for purchase they had no idea existed
- **Action taken**: Completely redid landing page based on emotional insights (not design, but messaging)
- **Result**: Landing page conversion jumped from 4% to 36% - sustained improvement

> "I'm 100% certain it's because we have a better understanding of what that emotive trigger in our customers is. We're hitting it on the spot before they have to think for themselves."

### Nala (B2B Example)

Himena from Nala demonstrates enterprise application:

1. **Pricing confidence**: Increased prices by 25% after understanding true value
   - Every single target company said yes and renewed for 2024
   
2. **Marketing precision**: Improved messaging by focusing on:
   - Specific struggling moments
   - Clear benefits Nala provides
   - Addressing friction points and fears in sales process

3. **Product roadmap clarity**: Discovered their unique value wasn't features competitors had, but their specific approach to actionable talent management data

4. **Sales efficiency**: Can now identify where prospects are in their progress journey and customize approach accordingly

## Core Concept: Progress, Not Products

Neal introduces the fundamental mindset shift:

> "People don't buy products or services. They hire them to help them make progress in their life."

### The Classic Drill Example
- People don't want a quarter-inch drill
- They want a quarter-inch hole
- But why do they want the hole?
- To hang a picture
- But why hang a picture?
- For motivation, focus, achievement

**Key insight**: You must go deep enough to understand true motivation, but not so deep you reach existential crisis. As Neal notes: "At some point you have to call it. Because if you ask why too many times you get to an existential crisis."

## The Two Essential Tools

### 1. The Timeline

The customer journey consists of distinct phases:

1. **First Thought**: Initial awareness of a problem
2. **Passive Looking**: Casual research, not urgent
3. **Active Looking**: Dedicated search for solutions
4. **Deciding**: Evaluation and comparison
5. **Buying**: Making the purchase
6. **Ongoing Use**: Post-purchase experience

**Critical insight**: Most customer interviews happen around buying/deciding, missing the rich context of earlier stages.

> "When I'm doing a jobs to be done interview, I have this timeline in front of me. I am talking to people about their journey, and I'm filling in the events as I go. My job as I do the interview is essentially a video game where I'm filling in the chain of events."

### 2. The Forces Diagram

Four forces influence every customer decision:

**Progress Forces (toward new solution):**
- **Push**: Problem causing pain (flat tire analogy)
- **Pull**: Attraction to better future (new Tesla appeal)

**Resistance Forces (away from new solution):**
- **Habit**: Comfort with current state (OS switching example)
- **Anxiety**: Fear of change (price, uncertainty, past failures)

Lilliana's clarification on forces:
> "The push is pushing you toward the new behavior, and the pull is pushing you toward the new behavior. It's just one is stronger than the other. The pull is much more about an attraction or an allure... I always associate push with pain."

## Practical Q&A: Real Founder Challenges

### Pre-Product Customer Discovery

**Ale's question**: How do we apply JTBD when we don't have a product yet?

**Neal's answer**: Interview people who've hired alternative solutions:
> "I would go find people who've hired alternative solutions than what you plan to offer and understand what they're hiring those solutions for... by going deeper to understand why they're spending money to make progress with those other tools or solutions, it will provide a lot of key insights."

### Getting Customers to Interview

**Snow's challenge**: Paying customers won't accept interview requests.

**Neal's strategies**:
1. **Flattery approach**: "We want to find more people like you and understand how to better serve you"
2. **Incentives for sensitive products**: Deeper product access, longer commitments, or cash/gift cards
3. **Churn interviews**: The ultimate test - understanding why people leave

### B2B2C Prioritization

**Kevin's dilemma**: Do we focus on restaurants (easy sale) or consumers (harder conversion)?

**Neal's framework**:
1. **Default rule**: "Who's gonna pay me? Whoever's paying me, I'm trying to know them"
2. **Alternative consideration**: "Who can teach us the most about the problem?"
3. **Strategic context**: Consider fundraising goals and investor expectations

### The Danger of Future-State Interviews

**Snow's question**: Can we interview people in the middle of their decision process?

**Neal's warning with memorable phrase**: "Bitchin' ain't switching"

> "When someone's struggling with the problem but they haven't taken action to change, you're not going to learn nearly as much as the person who ends up switching... The energy comes at the moment of the switch."

**Key principle**: What people say they'll do and what they actually do are completely different. Neal shares his personal failure:
- Interviewed 25 people for his coding school
- Vast majority said they'd pay $6,000
- Launched the program
- Zero of those people signed up

> "I said, 'Oh, we'll ask them to do it.' So you interview someone, and they say, 'Oh, I'm willing to pay $30 for this.' And you go, 'Okay, it's ready. Actually, so here's your credit card ready. I'll take your $30 right now.' And then you'll find out the truth."

## Advanced Applications

### Sustainable Travel Challenge

**J.Loh's complex question**: How do we find customers for sustainable travel when the category doesn't exist?

**Neal's guidance**:
- Start extremely narrow, not with broad characteristics
- Avoid abstractions like "Tesla owners who shop at Whole Foods"
- Focus on specific struggling moments
- "You start small. And when you start small and narrow, it's way easier to abstract"

### Morphine vs. Vitamins

**Tunde's connection**: How do push/pull relate to painkillers vs. vitamins?

**Neal's clarification**:
- **Vitamins**: Proactive improvement
- **Painkillers**: Reactive to immediate pain
- **Morphine**: Deep-seated pain needing relief

> "By default, ideally, you're trying to deal with the morphine level problem because by solving a morphine level problem, people are willing to go to much greater lengths to make progress."

### B2B Emotional Drivers

**Lilliana's B2B example**:
- **Push scenario**: Executive messed up, job threatened, needs solution to keep position
- **Pull scenario**: VP wants promotion to Chief Innovation Officer
  - Both can be morphine-level despite different directions
  - Pull driven by desire for new house, family advancement
  - "There's still not a push there. But the pull, I would say, is at that pain killer or even morphine level"

## Key Frameworks and Mental Models

### "Who Can Teach Us Most?"

Ryan Singer's question that changed Neal's perspective:
> "Who can teach us most about the problem?"

This reframes customer selection from revenue to learning, especially valuable when:
- Pivoting strategic direction
- Meeting investor milestones
- Testing new market segments
- Validating specific features

### The Reality Check

**Critical warning**: "We cannot research our way to product market fit"

> "You still have to execute. You still have to screw up. It's messy, it's unproven... What to expect from this isn't an answer. It's a series of potential pathways to go down to find the answer that you want."

### The Humility Principle

Matthew asks: "Can we try to be both push and pull?"

Neal's reframe:
> "The context of this slide has nothing to do with us and has everything to do with the person you're trying to help... It ain't about us yet. Once you tell me, I know I want to help them. Then we start with humility and we go, 'Okay, what do we need to become to actually help them make their progress?'"

## Implementation Guidance

### Interview Best Practices

1. **Maintain timeline focus**: Fill in events chronologically during interviews
2. **Separate discovery from sales**: Don't disrupt research with supply-side thinking
   > "Wait either to the end or in a follow-up after you have those conversations to make those additional offers"
3. **Study actual switches**: Focus on people who've made decisions, not those considering
4. **Go deeper than surface**: Use "when" questions more than "why" questions

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Volume over quality**: "So many of them go, 'Well, we've done hundreds of customer interviews.' And I'm like, 'So what? What did we actually learn?'"
2. **Solution-first thinking**: "They always try to tell me about their solution, and I stop them"
3. **Assuming intent equals action**: Survey results showing willingness are "hollow words"
4. **Starting too broad**: Especially with new categories or sustainable products

## Techstars Integration

### This Isn't School

Neal addresses the "homework" perception:
> "If you see it as homework, all love. However, what you should see this as a better way to understand the people who are going to be funding your future progress as your customers... It's a completely different beast to learn a literal framework, apply it and make more money because of it."

### Results to Expect

- Increased pricing power (like Nala's 25% increase)
- Improved conversion rates (like Performview's 9x improvement)
- Clearer product roadmaps
- More efficient sales processes
- Deeper customer loyalty

## For Future Application

The workshop establishes that JTBD is:
- **Accessible**: "You can read this online... but it's about applying in a particular context"
- **Practical**: Real revenue and fundraising impact
- **Foundational**: Everything else builds on understanding customer progress
- **Ongoing**: Not a one-time exercise but a continuous practice

As Neal concludes: "The work knows what it wants to become" - but only through deep understanding of the people you're serving.

## Next Steps

Founders are expected to:
1. Conduct 10-12 high-quality JTBD interviews
2. Map complete customer timelines
3. Identify and analyze the four forces
4. Extract insights about emotional and functional jobs
5. Apply learnings to product, pricing, and positioning decisions

The framework provides structure, but success comes from disciplined application and willingness to be surprised by what customers reveal about their true motivations.
