### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Steven Plappert: And that's my preamble. So now, now we'll get into kind of the main 2 2 topics of the day, which is like, how do you use your model to pitch deck to drive conversion into a diligence process into a second meeting with investors, and then ultimately, how do you present that model in a way that drives confidence? So maybe real quick. There, you know, before we get into that any any burning questions or comments you know, on what we've
- Steven Plappert: just always follow up something basic, you know, there. But it's just I'm big team like anytime. You have a meeting with an investor. You need to have a time bound specific. Next step, by the time you get off that meeting. That's ideal, just like sales. So leave yourself time at the end of the meeting to define that next step always follow up right after the meeting with that next step, and you can totally share a copy of the model after the meeting. In fact, it is wise to do that.
- Tunde IO : Yes, I see. Thanks for for sharing your insights on this. I just had a question. So this process where you effectively try to what tries to hold the model hostage. In order to get the meeting. If we suppose is that you are the next stage after that. Is that then we share your data room.

### Key Insights

> "Steven Plappert: it's completely table stakes for me to have a great model at this point, to be able to speak to it, to understand my core economics like, there's no way I'm gonna raise a series A, especially not in this market without a good handle on the on the core economics of the business. But at the preced seed stage, that's not always the case, like there's a lot of founders that are out there."

> "Steven Plappert: To which you say, Hey, yeah, the models, not in the data room. And that's actually because I really would love to have a conversation with investors. You specifically about our model, and just really talk through the forecast, and how we put it together. And, most importantly, how our business works and how how we scale this business. You know, before I share the model, you know, because I really think it's important that we get back into a room and have a good strategic conversation about this business. That's the way both"

> "Steven Plappert: walking you through the financial model that supports this forecast. And, most importantly, just having a really strategic conversation with you about how we acquire, about how we monetize about the cost of scale and what our plans are for this business. I think that would give both of us a a great understanding of you know if this is a real, if this is a good deal for both sides, so I'd love to spend that time with you, and we can circle back to that at the end of the meeting."

> "Steven Plappert: one of the most important things, in my opinion, to keep in mind is what is the purpose of this meeting? Right? You know. You know, what are we ultimately trying to do with this meeting? And and the obvious one to me is if we're trying to close them as an investor, you know we're trying to. You know, we're trying to get their investment. That's that's the ultimate purpose."
