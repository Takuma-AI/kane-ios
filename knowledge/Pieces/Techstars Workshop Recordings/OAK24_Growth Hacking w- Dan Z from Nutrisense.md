### Key Insights

> "Dan: and we still didn't get a T-shirt for 3 years like it took us. I think it was literally 3 years later. We're like 120 people in that point where it's probably some T-shirts with Logos on it, because we had no swag period first 3 years, and then Neil was always asking, Where's your T-shirt? There's a every company would have T-shirts. No, in person. At that point they were coming to their T-shirts. We just didn't have anything"

> "Dan: because we didn't think it was critical that point in time."

> "Dan: And I think it's important to remember things that matter to customers and to your business."

> "Dan: $100 for T-shirts sometimes, but at that point in time didn't, was not critical for design swag."

> "Dan: And so I think really, it's important to remember"
