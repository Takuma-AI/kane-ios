Chloe Lannert

## Core Concepts

Based on the workshop content, founders will learn:


### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Chloe Lannert: you can become really good friends with other people who work at startups that you know, larger, like AI companies who work at funds, who do all sorts of stuff in the ecosystem. So I'd approach it like that, really, to be kind of open to those relationships like Chloe said, and to know that your network is like extra important in the startup ecosystem, like way way, more than if you worked at like Jp. Morgan.
- Chloe Lannert: going a step further to be like, Hey, you know, do I know other people in products? Maybe they'd like to meet like you can even be directly. Ask ask them like, you know, I'm so grateful for the intro like I'll let you know what happens. In the meantime, love to, you know, grab a coffee and learn more about what you're working on, or let me know if there's anyone in product like and then be creative like I actually do have a friend who just started at open AI and the product team. And like, maybe that'd be interesting for you, given like your background
- Chloe Lannert: I'm happy to share those with you in cyber. Oh, by the way, I have a friend at this fund. Do you know them? They're in cyber like, you know. I feel like I could think of 15 ways to help this person and continually keep the relationship. So, but that's this very niche kind of specific thing. But I think in all of your roles and all your businesses there's ways to kind of adopt the same framework, and we like how you can help and build a relationship. But we have some more content around this, too. But yeah, at the core of it show that they're making an impact

### Key Insights

But yeah, I think I think with the San Francisco network, it's what I touched upon yesterday. It's small. It's a really small ecosystem. Everyone knows everyone, you know. Word will get around about who you are, what you're doing your company things like that. So it's like extra important. I think, in the bay to."

> "Chloe Lannert: you know. Make sure that every connection counts, and like you're putting your best foot forward in front of anyone, because you don't know where you're going to see that person down the line like people always hop you don't know. Maybe you'll work with them. Maybe you'll hire them, you know. Maybe they'll be an investor later, like you don't know. So you know, I think that's just one thing in Sf, that differs from other cities like"

> "Chloe Lannert: The timing is is really really important with short runways as"

> "Chloe Lannert: But I think you know what Chloe mentioned with the transactional pieces is really important, but also just to double click on this, like."
