WEBVTT

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Mentors and experts around certain subject matters as well.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Because one of the things that we've learned over time is.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It's a mistake to just directly connect the founder to an expert when they haven't done.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The prep. Work and the.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The initial steps required for them to be ready for that conversation.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So we do a lot of work with you all to prepare you to come correct to the folks that.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Would have high value interactions with you if you make sure that.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Have all the right questions ready to go.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Agreed.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Okay, we can go to the next one.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So base camp is what we'll use to run our program.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
We can go to the next slide.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Let's learn the basics. Okay. Next.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So this is what you'll see when you go onto basecamp.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
You won't have all of these projects, but this is a screenshot of what my screen used to look like.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
You'll see in the demo what it looks like. Now it's gotten even more complex.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But I wanna talk you through this homepage and what we're looking at. So there's gonna be some arrows. So I'll just keep saying next. So 1st is the program. Hq.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.000
The program. Hq. It'll say 2024 San Francisco program. Hq. All of you will be in it. Every single one who's a full-time program participant.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So everyone who fills out the class roster.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:31.000
We will add everybody based on who has already filled out the class roster. I know it's due tomorrow, so we'll do 2 sweets of adding people to base camp. We'll add people at the end of the day today, and at the end of the day tomorrow, after the deadline.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Oh, yeah, Chloe, would Chloe and Neil use dark mode? So that's also.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:53.000
An option. You'll see this program. Hq, that is the Hub, for where the program happens. That's where all of us will be in there together. That's where my announcements go. That's where workshop recordings go all resources. That's where you guys can talk amongst yourselves with us in there. Of course you can have your own private channel as well.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
But that is our Hq.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Next area.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000
You will also have your own individual project. So keep inclusion, was one of our companies in 22.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:17.000
That project has only your team members and our team members. That's where we get in the weeds with you on your specific business. There aren't other classmates in there that's just for your business. That's where you'll submit.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Deliverables. You'll upload files. You'll ask us questions. You'll gain. You'll get asynchronous help. You can post a message in there, and we can go back and forth with what we think. That happens a lot. And it's super helpful to the team. Because we're able to have like a thousand conversations going on at once with all of you, since it's asynchronous. So we can be helping everybody every day with many different problems, since it only takes a few minutes to write a response.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Versus having a bunch of meetings.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Another thing for your individual company is that any part time program participants that you guys have? So maybe some co-founders team members who aren't participating full-time. They can be in that project.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So a lot of people have like their devs in there, their designer. Whoever else is like maybe not fully participating in program, they can go in there. So the Hq. Will be only our full time program participants because a lot of relevant program information. But in your company project that should be everybody who's relevant to you, even if they're part time, so that everybody can be involved in the work on the business.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Okay.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Up top. You have this toolbar.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So we're already at home. I usually skip, line up. That's something you guys can use if you want it's just kind of everything happening.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Pings is the most important up here for you, because that isms.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
So we try not to overly rely on pings, because, like I said about the written communication.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Like I said about the written communication. It doesn't allow for everybody to see. So if you do pings, everything's kind of siphoned off in like a 1 on one conversation, and you're not getting the benefit of everyone being able to see the thread or contribute. So a lot of the benefit of like, for example, Cape Inclusion down here, if they wrote a message post asking Neil for their advice, and they put it in their.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Company project. Then Chloe or I could also lean in and say, Hey, actually, I know this mentor that could help with this, even though you're originally asking Neil. So it allows for a lot more contribution and collaboration.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:30.000
For pings. That's a lot more like you need to. DM us something specific, maybe personal. Or you need to let Chloe know you're getting a miss, a workshop. You have a quick question. Where do I find this? That's kind of where we want things in the Dms. We don't want?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Really complex questions that we should discuss out to live there. It's not good hygiene. You won't be able to look back on it, so I'll show you where to put it instead. So just make sure we're not overly relying on pings. It's easy to do so. I'm just giving you that warning now, but you can do group chats, and you can do one on one. So all of us will be in there. You can also ping your fellow classmates. So it's a great way to make friends.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Help each other. I remember some of you were gonna ping each other restaurant recommendations, things like that. That's how you'll do it.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Okay. Next.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Hey, hey? Is like your phone's notification center. So you'll get a little red dot when you've missed stuff.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
That's basically every time someone has tagged you every time I've.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Chosen to notify you with something I've posted. Maybe a team member of yours is writing something in your company project. You'll get automatically notified for all of them. So your hey should be something that you go through every day because it'll basically show you everything you need to be aware of, and everything that you get notified for from our team is purposeful. So you're not gonna get a bunch of random notifications. Base camp is really good about allowing us to choose, if we notify you and.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Not so you'll get notifications on relevant announcements, etc. So make sure you're reading that.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Okay.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
At the at the top, right.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Is your settings, so you'll see a little bubble with your initials. Once you get on boarded to base camp.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I have 2 asks that I'll show you in the demo the very 1st things you should do when you pull up this page, and you just logged in is one. Add a headshot.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So, as you can see in all these little bubbles. Everybody has a head shot except a couple of people, and you see they have.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Initials.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
It is so much easier when we can see everybody's face.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
To differentiate who's speaking. It's just like way faster than seeing

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
People's initials. So everybody here needs to add a head shot 1st and foremost, before you do anything.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And the second thing is going to be changing your notification settings, and I'll show you how to do that in the demo.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Your notifications.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Right now. Our default set to send you an email every time you get a notification.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
You need to turn that off.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:54.000
That is for after program. If you don't want to touch base camp, you can turn back on email notifications. For now you need to just go on base camp, or else you're gonna get like 50 emails every single day. And it's gonna be crazy. So that is the second thing you need to do. It's a requirement, or else you're going to be very annoyed. And I'll show you how to do that in the demo.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:03.000
For the base camp app itself, you can either access it via Browser, which I know some people prefer, or there is a native app.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
On desktop for both. I Mac and windows.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I use the native desktop app.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
There's also an ios app for ipad, and.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Iphone as well as android. So you guys can download it as many places as you'd like. I do it on my native Mac desktop app. And then Ios and I think those apps are great. So if you guys want to be able to stay up to date all the time. There's not really a lot of unnecessary noise. So it would be okay to have on your phone if you are interested.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Alright. We can go to the next one.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:43.000
So let's take a look inside a project. So if you click on one of those white squares, this is what you'll see. For example, the Hq.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:52.000
So when you click on the Hq. This is how we'll run our program. I'll go through each of these tools and then I'll show you. Your individual company program project.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Go ahead! Katina!

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
The 1st one is message board.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So each of these tools replaces something else. And I would say, message board replaces email.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So the same way that I sent you that very long email on Friday, with all of your relevant updates and deliverables and things you need to know that from now on, after tomorrow.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Will go in the Message board.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:39.000
So every week you'll get this very long weekly. What to expect from me? I tell you more about that in the program handbook. That basically is your roadmap to the program. So every single week there will be a single post on Fridays that gives you every single thing you need to know for the following week. I I highly encourage you to read it thoroughly. Those will be in the message board, so those are really important.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
There are also other things that will.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Post, so as you can see in the message board this.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:19:01.000
This group are alumni now. So Techstar, Chicago reunion tips for investor introductions. Who's in for a ski trip from Neil? Me sending out their demo day link another founder giving a relevant update on their company that they were in a magazine.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:11.000
All of those things are things that would be posted in the message board. So just see it as if we're all living in a community center, and there's a big bulletin board that has all the announcements. That's the message board.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Okay. Next, tool.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
The next one is Campfire, which I believe we've renamed for you as chat.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:25.000
So this one you should see as a water cooler. This one is the most like a little slack channel where it's just forever going up.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And because of that there's no permanence. So we use the campfire or the chat. It's the same thing as something that's.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Semi-permanent, mostly temporary, so much more social sharing. If anyone wants to like grab coffee today. Anything like that, there should be no expectation for you to have read the campfire or the chat. This is just something that's gonna like, ever go and if you want to contribute, you can. If you wanna drop a casual shout out, you know, can you guys like this post? I just.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I just competed in this competition, or you can shout out each other like way to go, Dominique winning that award.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Things like that, so much more social.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Much more social. Much more casual, much less important. So anything that's important should go in the message board.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Oh, yes. Chloe gave me a great point for message board. There's going to be 2 message boards. One is going to say message board. One's going to say cohort support. So this is something we added. Actually, after this.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:39.000
This cohort. So you don't see it in this? Hq. You'll see it in the demo. There's another message board that looks exactly like the 1st one, but it's called cohort support. This is because.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Our founders started leaning to helping each other a lot more during program. So we made a whole tool just for them. So you guys can post asks for one another. So can somebody review this like Beta version of my product that I just put out does anybody have any good recommendations on

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Like services to recruit engineers. Does anybody have you know anything like that? You guys can put out asks, and you can help each other in the thread.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
That's going to be what cohort is. I'll show you in the demo.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
But it's very similar to message board. It's just not announcements. It's asking for help from one another.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Docs and files replaces. What would be Google drive for a lot of people.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:30.000
It does integrate with Google drive. So as you can see in this picture, there are Google sheets that are uploaded in to this, docs and files.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:44.000
The Jackson files is just an archive. It's a little vault that has all of the relevant resources and documents that you need. They're also native based camp documents like that group habits, decision making. Doc, that's yellow right there. That's a native base camp. Doc.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And there are also a couple of air tables and Pdfs linked in there. So you'll just find pretty much every resource you need, and it just allows us to put them all in one place, which I find really helpful.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Next.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:08.000
To do so to dos will be not a part of the Hq. Because there are no like group to dos for all of you, however, to dos will be a huge part of your individual company project.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Probably one of the biggest parts of.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Of your company project. So every week you'll get a weekly to do list.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Probably not a lot during the 1st month. I think I said this yesterday, but once we get into that cadence in months, 2 and 3 every single week. You'll have a to do list with deliverables.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Relevant to the workshops of that week, as well as external work that we have for you guys. That are part of the curriculum for the program. So to dos are very important. I'll show you in the demo.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
And that's also how we run our team.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
So you guys are welcome to make extra to do list for yourselves in your company project. If you'd like, I'll show you an example of a team doing that.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Next.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Automatic check-ins. You can ignore the questions that are in here for this one. We made fun questions for them because they're no longer in program. But automatic check-ins are going to be a very important tool in the Hq. Every Monday. After we finish mentor madness, it will ask you to post your Kpi update.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:28.000
So that's where you'll post your Kpi update. You'll be able to comment on one another's, and your ers will be able to comment so it'll be an asynchronous Kpi check in. And you'll talk about what you what metrics you hit this week. What you didn't, why, how you're gonna make sure you hit them next week, and what your goals are for the next week, so I'll post a whole separate message about that, and what your templates.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I'll post a template for you guys to use. But that's what automatic check-ins is going to be used for. So super important. There.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And lastly, is the schedule. So the schedule like replaces. But I would say, complements Google Calendar. So it will be exactly the Google Calendar.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
And we'll every week make sure that it stays up to date with any changes that are made in the Google Calendar.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Which leads me to something I didn't say in orientation yesterday, which is that the Google Calendar, right now that we have shared with all Ceos, and that we will share with everyone who completes the class roster after tomorrow.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Is 95% set.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:31.000
So just take it with a grain of salt. Sometimes things will need to move, because external hosts have their own lives. They're doing this as give first, st and sometimes things come up. Sometimes their children get sick, or they actually need to miss something or reschedule. And so we're pretty gracious because we appreciate that they're sharing their time. In the 1st place, sometimes things will need to move. So just know that that's not like a hundred percent cement. Sometimes you'll look at it, and they.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Will have shifted up or down, and that's just part of the game. So we try not to do it within like 2448 h of something. And if it's the week of we also try not to. Make it a huge shift. So you'll just see some changes happening and just know that it's like 90 to 95%.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
The schedule here the whole purpose of having it in base camp, as well.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Is redundant, so that you can just have redundant information because it's very helpful, but also in base camp. You can ask questions below each event. So in Google Calendar, there's no way to ask us things about certain events. There's no way to post notes that you might have taken that you want to share with the class anything like that.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:24.000
But in base camp, in the schedule every single event is commentable. So you can start a thread under. You can ask questions. We can share the contact info for the host. You guys can post notes or ask questions about it, and it can all live in the event in base camp.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Alright!

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Alright cool. So those are the tools. Can you go back? One slide? Does anyone have any questions about the tools before I go into the demo?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Just like the basic uses of the tools.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:53.000
So like, can we, you know, create a drive within our Google drive like creates a folder, maybe, and then attach it to here, so that you know we can use it as a.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Funnel to.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000
You know, like anything we want text related. We can just drag and drop there. And will it show up here, or.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Yeah, so you can't link.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Like, how do we do the tox.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:18.000
That's a great question, or you can't link the folder. You can only like individual documents. So you would make a folder in docs and files, and you would just link the individual documents as you make new documents.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Any other questions.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
A quick question about the schedule. So the the Google Calendar linking.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Like, would it? My calendar show up if I link mine here to the scheduler? I'm just seeing the tech stars.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Play plastered on my schedule on my count, like is it.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Equal back and forth. My events show up here.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Perfect.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
It's actually not integrated. So it's manually. But.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Okay. Okay.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I have tried to code an integration for this, for, like the whole time that I've been here, and it just hasn't happened yet. But.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Maybe Neil can ask them in the future to do that. But for now we're just, we just do it manually. So there are ways to like integrate, but it doesn't stay up to date. So if you like, have a set calendar that you want to put in your company project like you can. You can like integrate your schedule, but it will just be like a 1 time. Copy over. It won't be like a live integration.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Yeah, so this will be. This is manually populated by our lovely Akatina here. Every week.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
So there's no like thing that keeps it up to date.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Cool, any other questions.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Alright. Let's go into the live demo. I'll take over screen sharing. Now. I could do.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Alright!

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Okay.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
So I have a lot more projects now than I did back then.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
As you can see, we run our.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Our team on here. So I left these on here so that you guys could see like the colored ones.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Our all hands. That's where our whole team lives. We also work on eco dev, and we have some associates that help us with that.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Rising stars is something we haven't talked about yet. Neil will talk about it on the retreat, but this is a small pre Accelerator fund for under represented founders that Neil raised.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
An 8 million dollars fund for that I've been helping him with since 2020.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
So that's something that we're still working on.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Port Coast support is where you guys go after your alumni. So we still help our 150 alumni companies every single day sourcing and selection is how we got you guys here. And that's where every single bit of deliberation happened. And then these 2.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Blank ones, the ones that don't have any color on them. That's what you'll see.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:47.000
So I just wanted you guys to see how we run our team on base camp but when you guys come onto base camp. What you're gonna see is the Hq.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000
And your company project. So Travis is one of the companies from our last cohort, so I'll show you their project.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
When you click in.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
This is your company. Hq.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Everything in here is kind of blank right now, but it will soon be populated. But with a bunch of messages and things you need to know. Chloe has already started with some important information. So you'll log in.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Remember. We have 2 message boards. The 1st one is where a bunch of announcements and things like that will happen. If you guys have an announcement for the class as well. You can also post in the message board.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:41.000
But if you have an a message that is more leaning toward you want the classes support on something you need to post it in cohort. The reason for that is because you guys will get to the point where we have, like one or 2 people asking for support a day. So we need to like siphon it off from the announcements that need to be read. So in cohort support.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
You can press new.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And then we have categories, so it will usually be an ask if it's cohort, and you can put a title.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
And then you can post it. So that's how it works. When you want to post something and get help from your class.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Docs and files.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:08.000
You'll find workshop resources such as decks. From our external workshop host. Here we'll post all of our workshop recordings whenever we are able to record. Not every session will be allowed to be recorded, but when we are, we'll post it here.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:21.000
We have a couple of things for you guys to read. Once you get in such as the code of contact things like that. I'll also email that to you tomorrow. And then we have resources for you, such as how to get into our office. Things like that.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And then, lastly, we'll put the program handbook in there.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
We already have a welcome message for you guys to read when we you get in here as well.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:42.000
If you scroll down the campfire is where you guys will be able to chat so you can already start saying, Hi! In there, once you get on boarded schedule is where you'll find the calendar. And then, like I said, Kpi, check-ins will start a little bit later. You don't have to worry about that yet.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Then you'll go into your own company project. I'm showing you one that's extremely populated already, so you can see how it.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Was used.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:56.000
So this was Travis last program. They uploaded all of their relevant docs in here. So they put.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:05.000
A lot of deliverables for the tasks we gave them, as well as like mentor. They wanted us to read things like that.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:16.000
To dos, they completed all of their todos, and this is a group that also made their own. So, as you can see, we have week, 5 week, 7, 8. We have all of the weekly to dos that.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:37.000
I send it to you guys. But they also made their own for their team. CEO admin to do list personalization, unique inventory, content, strategy. So these were for their actual brand. These are things that they were working on a aside from the tech stars work. That's because this team chose to do that. And they were tracking their progress up here on the hill chart.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:51.000
You guys don't have to do that. You can just complete the weekly to do list that we give you. But that's an option. And I think that they thrived because of it. They were an extremely organized team, and I like that. They wanted to implement that and have it all in one place.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Message board over here this, where we'll assign you the data room much later, like starting in week 7.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:15.000
But also this is where we'll send you messages that are only specific to you, such as your mentor, madness, schedule, or an up like an update when a mentor is gonna be gone, or something like that. Things that only you need to know will post a message board for you.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:24.000
The last thing I wanted to show you in this demo is clicking on the settings up here. So the way that you're gonna add your head shot. The 1st thing you're gonna do when you get in here is you click profile.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
And you'll be able to change your picture.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.000
The next thing. Change your notification settings. So you go up here and click, change your notification settings. And right here.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Send me email notification. This needs to be unchecked and then save.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Very, very important before you do anything else.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
I also like to go over the notifications down here the when.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
This is a really cool and unique feature from base camp.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
You should know that if you're gonna have the app.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Things will be happening at all times of the day into the night, and everything we have people that are on all kinds of time zones. Also, our team likes to work at night. Sometimes instead of during the day, like, we will send you messages at 1011, 12 at night.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:19.000
It's up to you to moderate your own notifications. So something that base camp does which is awesome is work can wait. So if you want to get no notifications outside of working hours, or outside of whatever hours you set.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
You set that, and then it'll give you a little wrap up from everything you missed when you're away. When you come back.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:34.000
So that's up to you. I keep mine always on, because I just manage my own notifications to not pop up during certain times, using like Apple's focus settings.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:43.000
But this is up to you. So I just want to make it very clear that the onus is on you, and you will get messages, and, like you will get notifications. People will be posting things in the night.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
And you guys can manage that as you please.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
That is everything I wanted to show you for this live demo.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I'd love to take questions. I think I'll leave it up in case I need to show any anybody, any part of it. But.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
That's everything.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:12.000
I had. I had a quick question, are there any integrations with base camp like I know you mentioned the the Google Calendar? One isn't there but our team uses Asana and just wondering if there's any way to integrate that.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Yeah, there, there are a couple of ways. So there are these things here. I'll show you in the company project. So in your company project you guys can do. You can play with base camp as much as you'd like. We have these things here.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
We set up tools.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
And they're called doors.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Now. Ha! Oh, yeah, open a door right here. So these are all the integrations where you can add a door. A lot of that is just it's gonna link you externally.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:50.000
So it's kind of like a way to get into that tool, but also for Asana in dots and files.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:01.000
I guess Asana is not something that would have docs. But these are all of the integrations that you can put into your docs and files that will like directly put it in here. So like this Google drive, we're able to like talk through it in the comments.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
You can click on it. It'll take you to Google drive. So I like the.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:12.000
They also, they also have a really robust open Api, so you can if you want to get crazy with it. With your tech team like you could actually do something. Fancy.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Okay, cool cause. Yeah, I think you know one thing. Just an idea to this presentation is, you know, Asana, we just started using it a couple of months back and just trying to up accountability for myself and the team using it. So I think, integrating it in here and having the tech stars team. See it.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Might make us use it a little bit better. So yeah, this is great.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Okay.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I have experimented a lot with Zapier and that would probably be your best bet, Annie. So basically like the action would be every time you add.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
A task to us on it would like auto populate in a to do list in your base camp project.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
So we can work together on that. If you want.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
But I know that you can do a lot of cool population things with Zapier into.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Yay!

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Okay. Awesome. Thank you.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
That's a cool question.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Another quick question is this material that you know we'll be working week by week, and you know there's a good amount of organization here is this, you know.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
And offered compatible meaning. You know, after we're done with the program, let's say, can we.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Take this structure out, and you know, maybe puts in a drive like file, or any Xml format like.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Does this work that way, or maybe a mark down like him.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Does? Or is this like.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:43.000
I think I think you can export things, Neil. Do you know, if you can export like their work in the to do and stuff like that.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:37:00.000
I? There might be a way. I've never done it, but I can't imagine there wouldn't be if you really wanted to.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Like this is an alumni company right now.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
So they can come back into this anytime. We have.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
But the real thing that we have set up here is that you can just access this forever. This will always be available. So if you ever need to get anything from it, it's there.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Okay. Thanks.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.000
All 150 companies in here, with their name, having their own project because of Neil's super account.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
And I would say, probably like.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
10 to 15 of them are actively using their base camp.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Project here, still.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Neil is totally fine with that, like you can run your company out of this, even though it's on his account. It's just you'll know when you reach a certain size or a certain bit of success, or a certain amount of employees when you need to get onto your own account, because you still will never be an admin on here. So running your whole company on here is great when it's just like 2 of you. And you're being scrapping. You don't want to pay for it, but.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
There's a certain time some of our companies have graduated to their own base camp since they got so big.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Any other questions.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Cool. Everyone's ready to jump right into base camp and start using it.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
I see a lot of nods. Okay, cool. That's awesome.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Well, I know that once you guys get in, you'll have a lot of questions as you're trying to like, work out the kinks and figure out where things are and what you're supposed to do.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Can always ping me or Chloe or Akatina, and we can find things for you. So I know for the 1st few weeks it'll be a lot of like, where is this? I can't find this totally fine. We love helping people with base camp, and I also wanna make sure that you know how important it is that you understand the tool, because the more we go into program the more complex it's gonna be. And if you don't have that foundational knowledge. It's gonna get much more confusing. Like, we're gonna start using the check ins, you'll start having.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:54.000
More to do. Lists and things will be happening in many different places, and it'll start feeling overwhelming if you don't understand these basic like foundational principles of where everything is, how to use the tools.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:03.000
So make sure that once you're in there, you understand it. I've also gotten on zoom with people to like Re, explain it. So don't be shy if you need help.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Alright, so I think I got us out 15 min early, so.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:22.000
We can take a a extra long lunch break and be back here at noon. Pst, I'll stick around for a couple more minutes in case people do have some questions. But other than that, I can't wait to see your companies at noon. See you in an hour 15.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Last quick reminder.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Fill out your class roster email me, your non-time.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Participants, so I can get them set up in basecamp.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
And I have office hours on Thursday. If anyone wants to go over this again.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
That's all.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Yay!

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Please, Sally.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Thank you so much. That was super helpful.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
See you soon
