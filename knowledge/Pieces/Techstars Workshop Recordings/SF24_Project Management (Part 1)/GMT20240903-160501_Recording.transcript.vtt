1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Unshare and refresh.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.250
Lilliana Robinson: It's good to see you all.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think I did it. Lilian, did you want to make any tech stars? Related announcements before we kick things off here?

4
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:22.219
Lilliana Robinson: Everything should be in your to do list that I went over on Friday. Does anyone have any questions now that you've had some time to look at those assignments.

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.310
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, cool.

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:33.173
Lilliana Robinson: I'm always here. You can ping me on base camp if you have questions. But all of the due dates and everything should be in there.

7
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.930
Lilliana Robinson: yeah, I think that's about it. We I did want to mention the David Cohen welcome call, Neil, if you want to just give some background that's going to be on Thursday.

8
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I mean, I think that's really important for us.

9
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

10
00:00:47.317 --> 00:00:52.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for us in particular, because we have a reputation to uphold right, Liliana.

11
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

12
00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:06.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The welcome call with David is a way for you all to not only meet our CEO, but also see all of the other founders across all of the other programs, which is really cool.

13
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I think there's going to be a special kind of eye on you all, because you're the 1st San Francisco class.

14
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So they're going to be like, what's up with these companies? Where are they at? What's their deal? You know? What's the vibe. So I want you all to come out swinging.

15
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And what I mean by that is.

16
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know you give 1st you're engaged.

17
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:38.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You like you will bring the energy that will lift up the entire class of text companies all across the globe. I think we're launching programs, including yours. I think there's what 28

18
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: program starting.

19
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So 28 classes of companies. So it's gonna be a whole bunch of people on this call.

20
00:01:47.526 --> 00:02:01.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And and and I think you all being the 1st ever San Francisco City program is going to be meaningful. And you know, I want to make sure that we have a culture of both positivity support both of each other and of the remaining the rest of the tech Stars classes.

21
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So leaders among leaders

22
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: got me. I think I get it. I think they're smiling and nodding and stuff I see, like the right kind of reactions. That's good.

23
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.650
Lilliana Robinson: I think it's just important to come correct on that call. It'll be at.

24
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And.

25
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:23.280
Lilliana Robinson: Am our time so a little bit early, but definitely worth it as it's a global call, like, it's kind of outside of hours for us, but

26
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:34.850
Lilliana Robinson: coming with genuinely thought, provoking questions for David, not just like the 1st thing off the top of your head shows some really good respect to him, and respect for.

27
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Great point.

28
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's a great point, Leon, cause you know what? There are times where founders will ask like

29
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a very basic question, in a way where it's like, wow! You didn't even look up who this person was. So just be mindful of like

30
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how pointed your questions are. You know you've been. You've been prepped and trained properly already, though, so it's all good.

31
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.730
Lilliana Robinson: You guys are already very thoughtful and resourceful founders, but we've just seen

32
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:20.870
Lilliana Robinson: founders in the past from other programs. Ask questions that I would be embarrassed if our co-founders asked, because David's time is very valuable. And he's done this forever. Even when he wasn't CEO when he was chairman, he would do these welcome calls, and I think it's like a very rare time that you can just ask him anything so like. Take advantage of that. And like, actually think of questions. I think that that's really important.

33
00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.079
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. And then we have another order of business. We have Fabio here.

34
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I guess.

35
00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:27.950
Fabio Caironi: Yes.

36
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.330
Lilliana Robinson: From our 12th company is finally joining the fray. So now we're like fully, we have all the avengers. Do you want to introduce yourself, Fabio?

37
00:03:36.330 --> 00:04:02.700
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, sure, I didn't want to jump in, but you know I was ready for the right moment. And yeah, nice to meet you all. Sorry I missed the chance to attend the previous sessions, but I kind of already got to know you by watching them. My name is Fabi. I'm the founder of White Knight. We do distributed computing for batch processing powered by crowdsource harder. So yeah, we'll get to know each other along the way. I'm so excited to be here.

38
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:11.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright, Fabio, we gotta unpack that just for one more layer. You gotta tell them more of what that means, cause I'm sure some people were like excited and other people like. What is he talking about?

39
00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:36.549
Fabio Caironi: Sure. So we basically, we run computations on crowdsource devices. Which means like your computer or a business server. So we basically decentralize a data center into crowdsource assets. And we do that to power intensive computations, such as AI training or video processing or Etl processes. So we're doing this for the benefit of power

40
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.129
Fabio Caironi: customers that are startups or developers who need a intensive computing capabilities for a cheaper price.

41
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:56.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, alright, let's get it interesting. It sounds hard, but I'm excited. I'm excited to do it. I had to. We had to go through a few additional layers of scrutiny internally at techsars to like

42
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:07.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: make sure that we could help by night succeed. But I'm really happy to have Fabio on board with us. He's he's been a pleasure to onboard, so cool, cool.

43
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.960
Lilliana Robinson: Thanks, Fabio. Okay, we're ready to jump right in.

44
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:22.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright! Let me share my screen again. And then, Lilian, I kind of gave my version of a background on this already, so I'm curious to give for you to give yours. But I'll give him a quick run of show. So

45
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:34.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, we did our small talk. So we're done with that that's great. I want to give you a few use cases of project management within the class of like, you know, examples where we've seen success and and some

46
00:05:34.680 --> 00:06:04.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: transformations. I think. I'll go over some very basic principles. I might run through them fast, because I think they're all kind of common sense, and and just more refreshers and reminders for folks. So if you need me to slow down, I will. But the plan is to blaze through it and share the deck later. So you can revisit the principles if you need to, and then I'll give a little bit more of my personal journey with project management, which I think will color my perspective and give you all some hints as to how I could be helpful to you specifically, if you want to work with me on anything I love.

47
00:06:04.557 --> 00:06:15.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Scoping work. By the way, it's like one of my favorite things to do. It's strange, special interest. So if you do want to sit down as the founder of your business and go. Am I working on all the right things like? Let me add it. I'll help you.

48
00:06:16.382 --> 00:06:24.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then we'll demonstrate what we do to organize our own work, which is the impetus for this workshop, in the 1st place, was certain. Founders saw how we operated.

49
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they asked us to show

50
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how we do things so that they could. They could do that. We're like, all right cool, and I guess they found that interesting. Liliana's played a huge role in that lately.

51
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.656
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then we'll wrap up with part one

52
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: where we will give you all a few exercises to make things real.

53
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:50.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's not just a talking at you day. This is a I'll give you some ideas in the beginning, and then you will actually have to look at yourselves

54
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and

55
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: show your work.

56
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's what we'll be doing today. For those of you that are here. So I'm looking forward to that

57
00:06:57.754 --> 00:07:05.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so cool background on the workshop. So, Liliana, from your own words, I think, is best, because I gave them my little speech before you got here.

58
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:15.550
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I'm not sure what you covered. But I added this slide this morning when I was going through these slides because I thought it was important to explain where this workshop came from. So

59
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:38.599
Lilliana Robinson: a couple of programs ago, I think we've been doing this like 4 times already. So I would say, like 5 programs ago, we had a bunch of founders in the middle of program, super stressed telling us they like had no idea what they needed to do. All of their to do's were everywhere. It was during a CEO call, so the Ceos were kind of confiding in Neil, and they were telling him, and I was there.

60
00:07:38.838 --> 00:07:53.850
Lilliana Robinson: That they just felt like their head was underwater, and a lot of them felt that way, and they felt like their work was spread across all these tools. They couldn't get their team to like, be aligned on things. They had no idea what their team was doing. It was hard for them to manage tech stars with all of their tasks.

61
00:07:53.850 --> 00:08:18.830
Lilliana Robinson: and they needed more time, or they they just thought they needed all of these different things. And then Neil and I were thinking, if only they knew kind of like, how we ran things for project management for ourselves, it might help them. And also he and I are very passionate about project management. So like hearing them all have such issues where it was kind of like hard to hear, because we care about you guys. So we quickly spun up like, not what you're seeing now.

62
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:26.200
Lilliana Robinson: but a very rudimentary version of this, where we were like. This is how we work. This is what we believe in for project management. You guys should try it.

63
00:08:26.502 --> 00:08:41.769
Lilliana Robinson: And it worked. It helped a lot of the founders they were able to not just use. It wasn't about getting them onto base camp. It was about teaching them using basecamp you're going to use base camp today as like an exercise. But a lot of them were able to bring it back to whatever

64
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:57.640
Lilliana Robinson: you know. Whole tool they had set up for their company, and they were able to breathe a lot more easily. They felt like they could implement a lot of the processes or principles that we suggest today. And then they were able to like, have goals set goals, make sure their team was meeting those goals, and then they held each other accountable.

65
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:06.959
Lilliana Robinson: So another thing from today is you'll see we're going to use the CEO project a lot, and you guys will be able to use each other as accountability buddies, because that also really helped.

66
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:23.450
Lilliana Robinson: So after we saw that that really helped when we like spun up this like what I would call an emergency workshop in the middle of program, which happens a lot of the time. Like you all you guys might have a very urgent need. We haven't anticipated, and we just spin something up for you. That's part of what makes this like a white glove experience and.

67
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:30.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm calling it. Now. It's going to be related to something with San Francisco, like, I just don't know, you know. So we're going to learn something new about the city, and figure it out together.

68
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:36.450
Lilliana Robinson: And we'll do a workshop on it. I believe that we already did that with Oakland. Actually, it was a big learning curve over there.

69
00:09:36.590 --> 00:10:01.559
Lilliana Robinson: But yeah, we decided to put this in pre program prep and make it a whole day. So Neil was like, forget the workshop. We're making a project management day, because it's that important for everyone to have good hygiene before they even start the program. So we made this workshop. This 1st part, like Neil said, will be more like teaching you some principles. My favorite part is part 4 of the run of show, which was Neil's background on project management. It's very interesting to see the evolution of

70
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:17.160
Lilliana Robinson: how we got to the systems and processes that like we all use in our team today, and we'll show you those. And then in the afternoon it's going to be more interactive. And you guys all get to work together, and Neil will get to critique you and give you some feedback. So it's super helpful. But that's kind of the background. There.

71
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:25.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. And for awareness, I think Liliana is is cutting out in about 45 min. Maybe a little sooner than that, so she'll be back in the afternoon.

72
00:10:26.414 --> 00:10:29.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we'll we'll have her back with us then.

73
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:37.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So alright, so defining success. I I have a selfish version of this. And then I, we have what we think

74
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is success potentially for you. All. My selfish version is.

75
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:51.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I not only want to be known as running programs where founders know their customers better than anyone else. I would also love to be known to have the program where the founders are just

76
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the best at getting stuff done

77
00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:19.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like there's just there's just like this reliable reputation, culturally, that they know going through any program of our San Francisco and formerly Chicago the founders are just on the ball, you know. They don't. They don't drop anything. They get stuff done. They over communicate and they're very thorough with what they are able to accomplish and do both within their team and also with investors and others. So that is my like personal goal. And if some of you all feel like

78
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you've got a system dialed in, I want to learn from you.

79
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:41.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I want to learn all of your techniques, and how you manage your your life and your work, and all that. I want you to help each other. And then also, like, I hope that there's something new that you can. You can derive from this. So you'll see what we're we're kind of doing here with these 3 buckets. So the situation for success here is

80
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: answering the questions, what's my team up to?

81
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:53.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's the most important thing I need to do today? And what's falling through the cracks? You all might know that off the top of your head you might have this written down somewhere, whether you do or you don't, you will, by the end of this day

82
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:55.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the motivation.

83
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think Lena did a good job of summarizing this already, but

84
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:08.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: everybody struggled through this, and I want to get familiar with how you all work and how you think about work. So we can better support you. Going into the program itself.

85
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Desired outcome is

86
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:18.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you all have a better understanding of how you can create and improve your project and task management systems to get more done with your team.

87
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think they picked up what we did there, those 3

88
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: little formula.

89
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: all right. So

90
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: projects are everywhere. Goals broken down into actionable chunks

91
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:58.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at this stage of your business. Most of you are essentially project managers. So we talk about Ceos. It's always funny when you like, you start a startup. And then you put the title, CEO on Linkedin, because you're like one person, 2 people, 3 people. You're the CEO of a business. It's like, what does this even mean? That being said. It's still legitimate, because you do have to make some important decisions, and it's difficult. But, as you know, this changes a lot over time, and

92
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as you scale. Let's just say you get over to a million in revenue.

93
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:08.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Dave knows a thing or 2 about that, or you have over 10 people working for you. Some of you know about how that works.

94
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:18.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This whole notion of project management changes a lot in company management and leading it and running it. So I'm just curious. For anyone just really quickly.

95
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How do you think about

96
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what project management even means like, what does that mean to you?

97
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:25.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Anyone can unmute.

98
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.650
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I can go to me it means scope budget and timeline.

99
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Management of this

100
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: scope, budget and timeline. So so

101
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the idea is that for a given project these are the actions you're taking to kind of give a structure.

102
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.290
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Yeah, yeah.

103
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I couldn't agree more. Dominique.

104
00:13:49.380 --> 00:14:09.049
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, I I agree, I think building on that for for me, project management is really making sure that everyone in the team is aware of what the not only what the key tasks are, but really the North Star. So everybody's working together in sync, so we can really get the best, not only out of the task, but out of the team, too.

105
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.499
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: It's I guess, how I look at budget management.

106
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Said Morgan.

107
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:27.060
Morgan Stanton: Like Dominique was more eloquent, and saying, What about what I would project? Management, I see, is just like everything I have to get done to make sure that goal is executed by that end. Date like.

108
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:32.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 100%. I I mean you, said Tommy, was more eloquent. But like I like, I like that version, too.

109
00:14:33.510 --> 00:15:01.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That was that was very palatable. So I appreciate that morning. Simple is often excellent. And and the way that it's defined in like traditional outlets is process creating structure for projects which you all included all the details in color for so without that structure, I think there's a lot of vulnerabilities that a lot of founders face with their businesses, and you can get away with those vulnerabilities early on, because no one's scrutinizing it right? You can have scattered stuff everywhere, and it's no big deal, because you're the only one that

110
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:14.099
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like holding yourself accountable, even when you have a board of directors, it's not like they're trying to look at your to do list, and how you manage your company. They're kind of trusting that you'll figure that out, and you have that going but just think about how much time you waste when you don't have that structure.

111
00:15:14.476 --> 00:15:31.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How many meetings you're having that are standing meetings that you sit around and go. What else we have to do? Oh, I don't know. And then you try to fill in the time. You! You have to do this in multiple places without a lot of structure or clarity on what exactly needs to get done today. And then a lot of other messy systems like email threads. And I, I'm

112
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:47.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm a vocal critic of notion because I think it's a junk drawer for a lot of tech entrepreneurs. But you know, that's just my hot. Take so I'll leave that where it is. But I like to say, project managers like cooking with a recipe. It's not a guarantee for success. But you have a much better shot at making an awesome meal.

113
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so not too different than the job stuff we've talked about.

114
00:15:50.796 --> 00:16:14.243
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So here are a few principles is no 2 projects are alike. So each of you are going to have your own flavor and structure and need and tool that you even use for it. So, like Liliana said, I apologize in advance. I am a base camp aficionado, so I'm literally force feeding you with that tool for the next 3 months, but I think you should use whatever system floats your boat, and I have no strong opinion about what which one is the best

115
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:25.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but just figure out what is best for you, and this is a part of the art. For your for you know your your journey now as a founder. And then here are some principles that I think are universal.

116
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so.

117
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:26.400
Lilliana Robinson: You know.

118
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Go ahead, Lily. I'm sorry.

119
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:40.179
Lilliana Robinson: We go into the principles. Something that people have asked in the we're in this workshop before is like we'll show certain functionalities in base camp. And people think that that is required to implement these principles.

120
00:16:40.180 --> 00:17:02.290
Lilliana Robinson: And it's not so if you need help trying to like, be creative and figure out how you can implement some of these same principles of project management into whatever tool your company uses, we can definitely help you with that. So just reiterating what Neil is saying like, we're using one thing to teach you. But all of these are more than applicable to any sort of system you want to do, even down to pen and paper.

121
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:18.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Paper your notes app on your computer or phone, like, like, everything we're talking about can be implemented in any of these tools. So just keep that in mind it. It's amazing how many times I have to remind people of that, because then I'll start talking, and then they'll go. Yeah, but we don't have base camp, or we use this. And I'm like.

122
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:24.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I thought I told you that it has nothing to do with the tool. So I'll remind someone, I'm sure.

123
00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:33.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So 1st off, we need to define goals and objectives for the project, whatever that project is. And I guess something about projects.

124
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I like to give projects some sort of finite

125
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:43.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: completion parameter. I think Morgan alluded to this in her description, but the notion here is that

126
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:52.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I'm not a big fan of like infinite lists and infinite objects. So if you have a project and you, it's just called your company name.

127
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and all of a sudden you just drop work in there.

128
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:05.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's gonna live forever, and I like to get things done. So when I'm going to do anything. I give it a time bound kind of label.

129
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then I execute it. And when that's done I move on and instantiate something new.

130
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:18.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think goals and objectives for the project could mean a lot of things for you. But just be mindful that you don't want an infinite bucket of things. You want to have things that you can just complete.

131
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:20.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

132
00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:36.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you you know what the issues are here. So I just kind of repeated this point already. But your goals are going to help you activate effort within your team because a lot of the things that I deal with in program or founders that reach out to me and go, hey? I'm having an issue with my co-founder because I don't think that we're sharing the same workload

133
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:59.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like I feel like I'm doing more than them, or, you know, like there's like all these weird feelings of people not being held accountable or not knowing how to set the right expectations. So, having everything kind of laid out objectively on, who gets what done by when saves you a lot of the hassle and confusion, especially when tech stars interests afraid and ask you all to do even more work. It's unclear how much people are getting done in any given day.

134
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think it's really important to lay that out.

135
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:09.139
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and also that you have alignment. So making sure that you've defined what success is.

136
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and

137
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as far as on budget, on time and on spec.

138
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:23.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It also needs to be relevant to the progress of the company. Needs a lot of the times. People find really clever ways to come up with things to do, to be busy.

139
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But it's not necessarily leading towards something that would be an important business outcome.

140
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:37.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So ensuring that you take this seriously is going to help you remove a lot of potential regret down the road when you look back at 3 months from now, and you go. Well, what did we even get done?

141
00:19:39.101 --> 00:19:50.079
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then the the notion of fulfilling a business need also needs to be clearly defined. I think your goal setting packets are helping us with that which Chloe is going to work with you to review, but stating the obvious there

142
00:19:50.190 --> 00:20:03.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then who's going to do the work sometimes? Not everybody on your team should be working on every project, and that's probably the case for a lot of you right? So figuring out who is best to allocate to what job is another important principle and factor here.

143
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So and this is also a great way to activate people

144
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: who are

145
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: potential members of your team.

146
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:27.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So a lot of folks end up bringing on contractors. And I tend to advise people before you hire someone, pay them to work on a project with you for a week or 2, or even longer a month to understand what it's actually like to work with them. So this is a great like consideration there. Where I think

147
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:43.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know that there's like some debate or controversy about like when it comes to level playing field meritocracy and inclusion with hiring. But there has been no better advice that I've received and given to founders than to pay people to do a project before you hire them full on.

148
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:48.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I like. There's nothing short of of learning what it's like to actually work with someone compared to

149
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:55.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: acing an interview and presenting a lot of fancy work that's done to date. Not the same dynamic as working with you directly.

150
00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Liliana.

151
00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:20.710
Lilliana Robinson: I was gonna say that the problem of having random work being ha! Like happening during your company that isn't directly aligned with the company goal is usually a ramification of the leader. Probably the CEO here or in our team. Me cause I'm in charge of project management, not laying out the work for the employees well enough. So that's not usually, I think.

152
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: A lot of.

153
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.589
Lilliana Robinson: People think that when people are just doing frivolous work, it's a

154
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:45.880
Lilliana Robinson: a reflection on the employee, and that maybe they're not valuable, or they're not bringing a lot to the team. But I think this workshop should help you look inward where it's usually a problem from the top, and like not scoping out the work correctly, not basing it in your goals and then letting it trickle down. So kind of think in terms of that. If that's something that you're seeing in any of your team members.

155
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's such a great point I I can't reiterate what she just said enough, because

156
00:21:51.980 --> 00:22:02.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a lot of the times I do deal with some founders who will reach out during program and outside of it, and they'll talk about their frustrations with their team. My team isn't getting enough done, or I'm having these issues with my team. And I'm like.

157
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:16.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, well, you're the CEO. What are you doing? You know. How are you setting your team up for success. So I asked myself the same question, every CEO goes through this journey where you have frustrations with the things around you. But then you realize like, wait a second. The bucks off for you.

158
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:30.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You hire these people. You chose to build this business with these people. You're laying out the work. You're setting the direction. You kind of have that dominion to make those calls and you're also deputizing others on your team. Your co-founders to do the same thing within their their subgroups.

159
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:38.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So how accountable are you holding yourself to whether you've done an effective job of setting the workout properly for them to get done. So it always starts from the top.

160
00:22:39.866 --> 00:22:46.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is where team roles and responsibilities come in right? So making sure that leaders are assigning people based on what they're great at.

161
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But what's awkward with the startup

162
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:58.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is you're gonna inevitably face the moment where they go. Well, that's not a part of my job description. And you're like, well, we're a startup. Everyone has like 10 jobs.

163
00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:09.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's why we have equity. So you have to clearly define what is exactly someone's job to do, and where there's room for interpretation and customization and adaptability.

164
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:15.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So, in my view, the 1st 5 to 10 people on your team should all be Renaissance oriented.

165
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:23.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: meaning they are up for anything like let's get it done if we, if I'm not that good at it. But it needs to happen, and no one else is around. Let's find a way

166
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: now. I shouldn't, I should say, only with mission like things that aren't too sensitive like. I don't want somebody

167
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: trying to, you know.

168
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:39.667
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Submit some code, and they don't know how to code like that would be a nightmare. But you know what I mean. Don't take me literally, but you know, use your best judgment for what that even means.

169
00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then I guess another caution about building consensus here.

170
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:53.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because while I am talking about like bringing people in and letting the group kind of decide and set scope and structure, it's empowering to the team.

171
00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but it could also be a risk.

172
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Can anyone think of

173
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: why, I would caution you about the group centered approach

174
00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to forming responsibilities with a team

175
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what might be the the negative factor there, or the risk

176
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:17.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cause? It feels good to build consensus and get everyone on board and on the same page. But yeah, Monica, I would say.

177
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:18.100
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): I'm sorry.

178
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They're George!

179
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.069
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Oh, oh, no! No! Sorry!

180
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Monica, and then George.

181
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:26.519
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Okay, okay, I I was just gonna say, sometimes decisions may never get made.

182
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, analysis, paralysis, as they say.

183
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.759
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Yeah, basically yeah.

184
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:42.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 100%. And and that that is that is where like, it's funny, because, like, I keep referring to CEO, and I will do that a lot throughout the program.

185
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:46.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let me tell you that I know that there are not all Ceos in this room.

186
00:24:46.760 --> 00:25:12.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and congratulations because I don't even like that job. That much like I've been to CEO a few times is hard. It is hard. You go to sleep at night with more on your mind than most most humans should. And when it comes down to like the tough calls and the disagreements, that's when, like, you're the deciding factor, and sometimes not. Everyone's going to be happy about what you do or what you say. And also you're the one truly and ultimately held accountable

187
00:25:12.395 --> 00:25:20.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: by your investors by your board and by outsiders. They're gonna look at you 1st and foremost, because at the end of the day it's it is on you to make these decisions.

188
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I would just implore any co-founders to like.

189
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:32.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Take advantage of the fact that you may not have that same burden, and therefore you might be able to think and move differently than your co-founder. In some respects

190
00:25:32.955 --> 00:25:40.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: norms for working together. So maybe all of you all have a perfect working dynamic with your team. Maybe you think there's work that needs to be done.

191
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:46.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Either you know the answer to these questions, or maybe you want to revisit answering these questions together as a group.

192
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how are we working together?

193
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How often should we meet?

194
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How are we making decisions? And what are we going to use to communicate.

195
00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:03.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now, again, you probably have answers to all of these revisiting them now is a great opportunity to reset. If you feel like there's areas for growth or improvement in any of these categories.

196
00:26:04.578 --> 00:26:11.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But going into techsars, I think it's really important as a team that you spell out your specifics for working together. From the jump.

197
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And we've had teams do this where they set a new standard with their their folks, and then they're all of a sudden

198
00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:27.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: able to run in a way that they never have before, and get more done than they ever had before. So a lot of the people say, like I get more done in tech stars in 3 months than I would have in one or 2 years.

199
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or at least, that's how it's felt to some of them when they take this seriously and do it right.

200
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:48.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright project roadmaps you've heard of this. So I'm gonna kind of move fast relevant deliverables. Timeline. Who's responsible? There's different ways to lay that out. There's a really cool way in base camp to do that. Now that's a new feature. But it's essentially a shared plan that outlines vision and priorities and steps you need to take to get there.

201
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:57.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now, this is where it's going to get interesting so weekly for tech stars we have this Monday session that you have with your eirs and us.

202
00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:04.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're every Monday starting after Mentor madness. So I think it's 5 weeks in. If I have that right, Liliana.

203
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:09.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we'll have these Kpi meetings, and I think they're like 90 min long.

204
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:23.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they used to be with the whole class. But now we've broken them up into subgroups, where for the 1st 10 to 15 min we all meet as a group, and we review everyone's kpis and goals, and how everyone's performing. But then afterwards

205
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you break off into subgroups with your eirs, and

206
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:43.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it gets scrutinous like when you take a magnifying glass, and we talk about how things are going with your business, what's going on, and you all help each other. But then also your eirs and and myself. Along with our team. We really get into the weeds with each and every one of you, with your stated goals and your reflected progress in your metrics.

207
00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:54.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm sure you've got kpis. You had to submit some for us both for the lean canvas and for the techsar's application. But here's some examples of ones just as a refresher.

208
00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How much time are you spending on things

209
00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:01.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so very simple? One? But when I think about the cost of getting things done.

210
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:08.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and you take a 2 week project and people will say crazy things, especially with metrics like, Oh, well, our customer acquisition cost is 0.

211
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I love it when founders say that

212
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because it's hilarious, because 2 weeks of your time is worth nothing.

213
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:23.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? So think about how you value your time in addition to all the other inputs for your business, because all of those things are going to go into your financial model

214
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:30.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and be reflected there. All these other ones, I think you've are either familiar with or can look up. Outside of this

215
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:53.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: communication effectively is with key stakeholders with us, with other investors, if you have them. With outside members, and obviously in those those messages. But having a ledger of all of the things that you've been doing. It makes it easy, whereas I think founders struggle a lot to provide updates when they have so much scattered information. They're busy and they're overwhelmed.

216
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:59.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if you're properly managing your work, putting together an investor update should be merely

217
00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:05.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: an exercise in referencing work that you've already documented, completing

218
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:10.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? So like I, I and I deal with this so much where founders are

219
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: falling behind on sending out their updates, especially when they're not fundraising.

220
00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's the other. Tell

221
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: his founders

222
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they'll send out investor updates out of nowhere

223
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:27.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like, Oh, wow! I haven't heard from you in like 4 months. What's going on? Oh, well, we're gonna kick off a race soon. Okay, good.

224
00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But the problem is that investors will look at your data room.

225
00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:36.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They'll look at your investor updates, because you'll have a whole log of all of your investor updates, and they'll see gaps.

226
00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:47.869
Neal Sáles-Griffin: large gaps sometimes, because if you're only showing up when you want something as opposed to being consistent about how you're reporting and sharing your progress.

227
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:52.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's the difference between founders who are on the ball versus ones who are not so much

228
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so. I'm gonna keep going here.

229
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Communication, effective communication

230
00:29:59.991 --> 00:30:12.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: adapting as you go. So just another point on that halfway through. If something's not working out. If things if you start to fall into old habits or you realize things, don't kind of, you know. Work your way.

231
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:16.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: be sure to revisit what you're doing, and maybe even simplify it or strip things away.

232
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's see, I'm gonna skip this just more words.

233
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: benefits of project management. I'm sure you'll agree with this.

234
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It keeps your team members happy.

235
00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:45.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, so it gives everybody on the team a clear understanding of what needs to get done and what success looks like, and how they're going to be evaluated. So this may not matter that much to you now, because you all as a team, have full, complete trust, and you know each other. But think about when you need to hire your next 3, 4, 5 people.

236
00:30:45.770 --> 00:31:00.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What room do you want them to step into? You want them to step into like a really messy, dirty office where you're like? I'm sorry. I don't really know where this is, or oh, we gotta go look for this, or let me clean this up real quick, or you want them to step in to go out. They I'm really proud to be on this team.

237
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I feel like I'm on, you know. I'm in the right place, and I already belong here

238
00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:10.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for those of you that are doing. B, 2 BI think you might refer to your customers also as potentially clients.

239
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:18.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? So having effective project management and things organized helps you interact with your customers and your clients really well as well.

240
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:24.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because founders who don't quite have their stuff together are missing deadlines

241
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: can't demonstrate that they have robustness in both, how they communicate and how they operate.

242
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That can be a huge negative signal

243
00:31:32.483 --> 00:31:39.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to a potential customer client, and you may not even find out that that was something that deterred them from doing business with you.

244
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It'll be too late.

245
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and maybe they it's a subconscious reaction rather than an overt.

246
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:57.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So they'd never, never tell you. And then you end up losing business. I've I've I've known and heard of examples like this same thing with investors. I've heard Vcs talk about founders who they feel like either weren't effective communicators

247
00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:59.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or they didn't believe

248
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:11.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: were organized enough to get the work done properly, even if they met well, or they were really technical or capable, or was a great idea if they didn't believe in the founder of the team, and how they work, that changes things entirely. Still.

249
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Liliana.

250
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:20.620
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I know from experience, interviewing hundreds or maybe thousands at this point of founders.

251
00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:25.340
Lilliana Robinson: it shows so even if we never talk about project management.

252
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:30.560
Lilliana Robinson: and we only ask you about your numbers and your your customers and your product.

253
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:42.540
Lilliana Robinson: It shows in everything that you do, whether you're organized in this way or not. It shows in the way that you send the follow up email. It shows in the way that you talk about your roadmap. It shows in every single way.

254
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:54.000
Lilliana Robinson: So when he was talking about is like it's never explicit where it's not like someone messed up or dropped the ball or lost a task. It's just a way of working that is very palpable when a founder is working like that.

255
00:32:55.070 --> 00:33:01.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Agreed. Yeah, you can tell. And then those are the ones that you get excited about. And you get this immediate instinct of wanting to reinvest.

256
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm like, oh, I wish I could double down.

257
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:18.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, on this founder right now, because you can tell that they're off to the races in a way that is leagues beyond, I think how most people operate, and another preaching moment for me. I guess now that I'm thinking about it is like, I think. Unfortunately, a lot of founders treat startups like

258
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: either like careers or like

259
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.441
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't know. I think.

260
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Amanda Leonard actually said it best Liliana, she called them startup tourists.

261
00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's people who are kind of like

262
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:47.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: floating in this area, because the idea of being a founder is either cool or enticing or interesting, but when it comes down to like the hard part which is the real work of it's not pretty, it's not sexy, it's not always fun, but you gotta get it done regardless

263
00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like, who's actually gonna show up to the rodeo.

264
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And that's kind of where stuff like this

265
00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: can't be taken for granted, and if you take it seriously, and you realize, like

266
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:08.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you're already setting yourself behind. If you don't have all of these like baseline aspects dialed in. How are you going to get the hard part done when it's time for you to innovate?

267
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:18.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So focus is key and making sure that the best ideas rise to the top amongst your team? And it helps you identify ideas that are valuable because

268
00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: everything isn't just going to come from one person.

269
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:27.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and you should be bringing people on whose perspectives and opinions you value at every step.

270
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

271
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: making sure that you're activating all of the brilliance on your team, and as you onboard new people

272
00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright few methodologies.

273
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm sure you all have heard of these waterfall, agile scrum.

274
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: critical path, lean

275
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:55.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: shape up. That's my favorite. But does anyone like familiar, or anyone here familiar with any of these techniques or methodologies? Anyone's not listed here that you know. Well, that you'd like to share.

276
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm curious.

277
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.640
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Google sprints are quite good.

278
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.340
George Reed - CEO and Founder: I mean, that's that's lame kind of but.

279
00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:02.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's it called.

280
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.279
George Reed - CEO and Founder: The Google Sprint room like Google Sprint.

281
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, Google sprints. Yeah. So that's that's he's a friend of mine. His name.

282
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:11.250
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Really.

283
00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:18.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's his name? I know him. He's from Google. He wrote it. We hung out in Chicago, Ryan.

284
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:19.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's not Ryan.

285
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:31.139
Neal Sáles-Griffin: anyway. He he looks like my other friend Ryan Singer. He's a really tall guy. He's cool. Yeah. Google sprints is great. I'm I'm a big fan of that. But that's Google. Sprints is intense, though I find it hard

286
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for one week

287
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: sprints sometimes, but for techsars it's perfect.

288
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:56.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So for techsar is perfect. But outside of techsar, I think a 1 week sprint depending on your capacity to execute could be really challenging, whereas, like my tried and true method, here out of these are shape up, which I'll do a workshop on later in the program in month. 2. I'll like, Okay, midterm madness. You have a new strategy. Some of you have pivoted.

289
00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now let's talk about how to actually build a product. Better?

290
00:36:00.128 --> 00:36:04.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'll talk about that. But any others, anybody else with the project management

291
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: experience with any of these buckets or

292
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: ways of the force.

293
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No.

294
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: come on, I know there's some programmers in here, Morgan.

295
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:21.828
Morgan Stanton: We used to do scrum at my previous job. I wasn't the biggest fan, but we we did it pretty often.

296
00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:26.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. Tell me why you weren't the biggest fan, because I I can relate. But I I want to know your your take.

297
00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:41.680
Morgan Stanton: It was incredibly timed. Biology has its own, you know. It's a little bit slower than you know, not a tech sprint or something. But we were meeting all the time every day, and so every morning we would be these discussions, and there wasn't much to be said. There wasn't huge changes between 24 h and.

298
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

299
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:52.260
Morgan Stanton: Hours. So probably just like a, you know. Maybe once a week would probably have been good enough. But we were. We were trying to fill time. Basically, it was a meeting that wasn't great for the company.

300
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:58.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 100%. Oh, man it! Whenever I feel like time is being wasted, I get real

301
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:05.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like anxious cause that because all you have to do is calculate, how much time are we spending like everybody in this room? Let's just say, like

302
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:10.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: everybody here, like having a group meeting is so expensive to a company.

303
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:18.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? Especially if you're, you know, hopefully down the road. All of you are probably in the, you know, 6 figure range. Let's just say salary wise.

304
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:25.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: paying everybody here $100,000 a year for us to be on a call for 2 h right? Learning from me. That's expensive.

305
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I have to make sure it's worth it. That's why. Sometimes I'm like, all right, let me skip over this and just get to the point.

306
00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:40.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But I can relate heavy to that. So I was also asking any programmers here, anybody who uses agile or come on. I I know somebody's doing some of this stuff.

307
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No.

308
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:53.299
Sezer: Yeah, we we use it all the time both with our like clients, with our other business, and also at snapshot reviews.

309
00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:55.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Good.

310
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.220
Sezer: I have mixed feelings to be honest.

311
00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:03.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Tell me more cause you have a lot of experience with this. You've you've built a successful business already.

312
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:12.960
Sezer: I think it works great for a big corporation, especially if you have like written processes.

313
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:17.580
Sezer: And like the product, goals are very clear.

314
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:25.720
Sezer: You can see ahead of time like 2 sprints later. You have your backlog failed.

315
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.980
Sezer: I guess, in those kind of cases. Scrum works well.

316
00:38:30.622 --> 00:38:34.000
Sezer: But for a startup. I doubt it.

317
00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And and in your view, what has worked well for the startup.

318
00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:47.780
Sezer: I think even complete chaos may work better than scrum, like just

319
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.390
Sezer: deciding things on the fly, and

320
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:55.279
Sezer: like giving decisions and changing directions.

321
00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:05.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Too much structure can get in the way of progress, especially at the early stage. I I couldn't agree more. So that's also really important to be mindful of. There's a sweet spot I think

322
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:26.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of not having. I guess you refer to it as complete chaos. I would like just like a little little bit of chaos, maybe a little bit of structure to just a little bit of both. Maybe. Now, now is the graduation period for some of you to go beyond your chaos. But I'm with you, that's good. So this brings me to the I guess the final chunk here challenges.

323
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So, figuring out what to prioritize.

324
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how do you decide

325
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: where to put your time and resources? Anyone have any

326
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:34.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: perspective here?

327
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You have any rubric for prioritizing your work.

328
00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.339
George Reed - CEO and Founder: You mean like rice schools, that kind of thing like.

329
00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You wanna explain what that means. I know what you're talking about, but.

330
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:53.590
George Reed - CEO and Founder: So are we like I might get it wrong with reach impact, what's see? And then I always see, or C and E.

331
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:57.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I have to look up the acronym, too. Yeah, but that's good. Rice rice is a good.

332
00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:01.989
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Just like the region. Yeah, how impactful will this activity basically be

333
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:06.349
George Reed - CEO and Founder: to prioritize things just prioritizing prioritization frameworks. Right?

334
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:07.950
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Basically.

335
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:20.270
Florence Ettlin: I think, maybe also, what really moves the needle rather than a framework. But actually, just this will really move the needle for my business. So that's where I put my priorities on.

336
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:26.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's great. And and you know it's funny. I think, Julia, correct me if I'm wrong.

337
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.812
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think there's a new feature in Base camp that's literally called move the needle.

338
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I love that you use that phrase cause that's like actually built into the tool that I'll show you in a bit.

339
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.680
Nirat Attri: I think the one thing which is most valuable from time to time is direct customer impact

340
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:48.939
Nirat Attri: like. So that's where, like, I think, prioritization should always be.

341
00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.470
Nirat Attri: what's the end customer?

342
00:40:50.540 --> 00:41:01.050
Nirat Attri: And then everything else just flows down lower in priority. What the business objective is comes next, and then, of course, everything else about optimization, perhaps after that. So that's how I tend to bucket it.

343
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:12.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, customer impact makes sense. If only we, you know, had a framework that helped us understand customer impact that could help prepare us to have a better understanding of what that could be and how to measure. It'd be great.

344
00:41:12.746 --> 00:41:15.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, very good, very good.

345
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I did not plant that comment. That was just all from him.

346
00:41:20.416 --> 00:41:24.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool! So does the problem matter. And if so, how much?

347
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:33.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Ask yourself that? And I'm sure you do intuitively, but giving you a little bit more structure for it. Do we have the right appetite for this? How much time are we willing to bet?

348
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think we get this done in 2 weeks. It's usually double that right?

349
00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I hear this when it when I hear founders talk about fundraising.

350
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:47.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And they're like, Oh, yeah, I think I'm going to fundraise. Now, I'm like, Okay, cool. What's the plan? And like, yeah, I think in the next, like, 2 or 3 months, we want to close our own.

351
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm like, Oh, okay, alright, that's interesting.

352
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:57.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And what I always do by default. Whenever I hear a founder give me a timetable, for when they're going to fundraise.

353
00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I multiply it by 2,

354
00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:13.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cause that's usually about on average. How often how long it takes for them to get it done. So, whatever time you give me for how long you think it's gonna take you to fundraise, I'll double it, and then I'll go. Okay. How do we get it done in that timeframe. So

355
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: just as a rule of thumb.

356
00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:19.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then also like, are we at the right time to prioritize this

357
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: scope? Creep. What do y'all know about this?

358
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:25.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What does scope creep mean to you?

359
00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Have you heard this phrase before? I'm sure you have some of you.

360
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.929
Nirat Attri: Typically when you plan for a project like you need to

361
00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:43.219
Nirat Attri: make sure that the requirements just don't keep going up so you can meet the end result on time.

362
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:47.909
Nirat Attri: So typically we see it like, I mean, especially in the b 2 b sense, because customers.

363
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:48.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes.

364
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.679
Nirat Attri: One, adding more requirements.

365
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: More, more and more. Yes.

366
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.879
Nirat Attri: You need to sort of

367
00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:58.280
Nirat Attri: put a limit to what is phase one phase, 2, phase 3. Typically, that's.

368
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:06.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And how do you? Yeah, how do you design against that? That's what I was. Gonna ask, actually, from your experience like, what do you do to like, avoid scope, creep, especially in A, b 2 b context.

369
00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:18.480
Nirat Attri: Like, it's all about like versioning like aligning on what version you want to get out first, st like, what becomes a v 0, v. 1 v. 2. A lot of alignment should be done on that explicitly.

370
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:19.580
Nirat Attri: Oh.

371
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 100% I saw a couple of hands, George and Agent lunar team.

372
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:38.620
George Reed - CEO and Founder: It was basically similar to what Nerod was just saying. I would. I would also add that, like sometimes I find myself having to micromanage develop my developer team as well to make sure that they don't like get the wrong idea and start building in the wrong direction.

373
00:43:39.308 --> 00:43:43.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. So yeah, when you say that, that's pretty big, because a development team

374
00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:53.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: tends to be very expensive, right? And if you don't set them in the right like kind of direction and parameters. Things can go off the rails pretty quickly. You'll have a lot of regret.

375
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:59.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's really important. And there's the notion of micromanagement, which is often with a negative connotation.

376
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But I would just say effective

377
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: management.

378
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right, which is probably the sweet spot

379
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: agent lunar.

380
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:25.629
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, I I mean, a lot of the points have already been mentioned. I think I'm smiling, because as a marketeer I'm I know there's a couple on in the cohorts as well. But scope creep is a big topic, especially when you're dealing with agencies, or if you bring your own digital marketing and set in in house and

381
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:40.540
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: looking at it from a different lens. I'm guilty of it myself, in the sense of. I'm working with a team member or somebody. A specialist, a freelancer. Because what often happens is, you'll see. Let's take a website, for example. You'll have

382
00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:58.270
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: clear deliverables in place. And then, when you actually see it being developed, you think, Oh, it'd be really cool if we actually add this, or Oh, actually, designers, can you do this, and before you know it, you've added more and more and more, and the the creeps completely expanded. So I think it's more about thinking about. What's a nice to have versus.

383
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

384
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.961
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Actually getting the job done that you set out to do.

385
00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:04.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I am. I'm

386
00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:29.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I wish I should make I made this slide like red, you know, like just really bright, like, I'm trying to ring the alarm bells for you all. Because here's the thing you're coming into tech stars. You're about to meet some really smart people who are all gonna tell you exactly what you need to do to be successful. And your team, you're gonna look at each other. You're gonna go! Oh, we should do that. Oh, no, we should do this. And here oh, we gotta do that now. And all of a sudden the scope is gonna just go insane

387
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:33.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because you're going to want to listen to everybody who's smart and everything that they're saying that you need to do.

388
00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I'm here to tell you that I've got your back

389
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because

390
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:41.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you're gonna be so tempted to do so much.

391
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but very often

392
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: less is more

393
00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: aim small, Miss Small.

394
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:52.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: give yourself the patience and grace to do one thing really well, as opposed to 4 or 5 things very poorly.

395
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:57.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So special. Call out for this moment because scope creep will happen

396
00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:08.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for many of you, and you're going to have to support each other. And you're going to need to call me up to get support as well. There's no program I've ever run where I haven't had this issue with more than one founder and team

397
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so cool, almost done.

398
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:19.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: let's see, that's the technical term I defined already. You know, it's you already know what it means. We talked about it.

399
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:23.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So limitations and ways to avoid scope creep is to get things in writing.

400
00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:32.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Getting things in writing is super uncomfortable to habitualize, but when you do, it is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself and your team.

401
00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Liliana, can speak on this

402
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:42.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cause. She joined my team, and I force fed her and everyone else that I've worked with to write their updates

403
00:46:42.910 --> 00:47:10.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because I don't want to just get on calls. I don't want to have daily stand ups. I don't want to have Tetris going on in my calendar, where I have lots of meetings and check ins and this and that, whatever I am a programmer I like flow. I like uninterrupted time. I'm an introvert. I'll want to deal with people all the time. Let me just get my stuff done and do my job, and I will effectively write up exactly what's going on and how I'm thinking about it. And, by the way, sometimes, no, almost always.

404
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:15.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: your thoughts are more refined when you give yourself time to think about what you want to say

405
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:25.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? If you take the time to actually write it out, it's usually much clearer, and you can say it in a much more effective way than you would if you just kinda on the fly decided to just

406
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:27.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: talk it out somewhat.

407
00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:35.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's always value in having meaningful discussions live with people, especially in crucial conversations, and where you're trying to discover and brainstorm.

408
00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or go over something that you've already reviewed.

409
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But it is a lazy

410
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:45.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Band-aid and catch all I think for a lot of people, especially at the early founder stage.

411
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:51.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: where you're not taking the time to properly lay out your thoughts and write them down, and what you have going on.

412
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Liliana.

413
00:47:53.660 --> 00:48:14.179
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. And, Neil, I I can't remember if you were on your flight or not. But during the base camp training with these guys, I reiterated this point of how important it is to write things up and what the benefits are. And I would say we do it twofold because we write things up for our own team, but we also avoid having a bunch of stand ups for you guys. So

414
00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:38.219
Lilliana Robinson: as soon as I started working here, Neil said. We're going to communicate asynchronously with the founders, and it has saved so much time for all of our founders that have been in program because other programs do a daily stand up where, like all the announcements and things that once we start program, you'll get via base camp, you'll see like a whole message poster announcement, probably every day those things that are thoughtfully written up that I take a lot of time, and

415
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:57.570
Lilliana Robinson: I take a lot of like pride in making it really nice. So that you guys can refer back to it. Those things are just verbally said in other programs. So we kind of like eat our own dog food and put it in writing for you guys, too. So not only are we saving time from stand ups for our own team. We're also doing it for you.

416
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:07.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Absolutely. It can be really challenging, I think, when we have one offs with founders where we have a meeting about something or a conversation about something in a zoom call. And then all of a sudden, the people who weren't on the call

417
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:09.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: miss out on that context.

418
00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:17.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So having things in writing is super important, especially as a follow up from a meeting, because the people who weren't in the room are still in the know of what's happening.

419
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Fabio.

420
00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:45.940
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, I just wanted to chime in really appreciate this vision of yours, and I can't help but like, just embrace it and bring in my experience. At byte night like ever since, I think February of this year we started like jotting down everything, including like meeting summaries. And you know, project overviews. And it was so beneficial to our business, because not only we got accountability of what we were doing, and we can like

421
00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:50.333
Fabio Caironi: see ourselves grow, and, like, you know, have, like a tangible

422
00:49:51.303 --> 00:50:01.849
Fabio Caironi: tangible impact of our of our actions. But also, thanks to you know. These task management software like AI, we could query all that information we can have.

423
00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:02.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

424
00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:28.219
Fabio Caironi: And and reproduce it. And yeah, oh, and, by the way, like all the taxers, application purchase was, I think, meant to be like also very written, and we really appreciate it, because that gave us the time to think about our business. And, and, as you said, like, just put it down in words in the best version possible way, way, better than you could like. Talk it out you know.

425
00:50:28.752 --> 00:50:30.169
Fabio Caironi: All I need.

426
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:38.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I I love that. And and Fabio, just as a quick follow up what inspired you and your team to adopt more documentation early on like this.

427
00:50:39.238 --> 00:50:48.030
Fabio Caironi: It was primarily because we were bringing in more people. And it was basically impossible for me to just have one on one with everybody, and just a board. It like it was also.

428
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

429
00:50:48.830 --> 00:51:03.129
Fabio Caironi: And I was like, Why don't we, like, you know, spend some time. It was definitely like some overhead, like, you know, additional time to like. Set it all up, and it needs maintenance. But the benefits that you reap are definitely definitely bigger than

430
00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:04.420
Fabio Caironi: than anything.

431
00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:34.659
Lilliana Robinson: I think that's a huge point, Fabio. The initial investment sometimes scares founders, especially when it's just just a solo founder or 2, because with just 2 as well like it, it doesn't seem like the benefits outweigh the costs of like taking the time to write all these things down like I could just shoot them a quick DM like it'll be really easy. They already get me like it's just easy to keep one person up to date. But the minute that you get a 3rd person, a 4th person, a 5th person.

432
00:51:34.840 --> 00:52:00.930
Lilliana Robinson: the benefits immediately outweigh the cost, and you will wish that you had implemented this earlier. So I I do like to challenge when founders are like kind of hesitant on investing the time and effort to like set this up when it seems like overdoing it, or it seems like too much for like what you need right now, because it will very quickly be essential. So getting ahead of it is the best thing you can do while things are easy. Right now, when you're not scrambling, or have too many people that you need to keep up to date.

433
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:02.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Agreed.

434
00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:16.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. I'm going to get to these last few slides, Liliana, and then, if you have anything else that you wanted to share before you have to leave. I would love to get more of your thoughts before I go into my story. So just really quickly. A few more tools for avoiding scope, creep, saying the right appetite.

435
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:19.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's usually a timeframe, and then sticking to it.

436
00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And when I say, stick to it, that means

437
00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:24.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you are being vicious.

438
00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: ferocious with how you're cutting scope to fit the deadline.

439
00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:31.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you don't let

440
00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:43.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: things just kind of go over time or bleed over you go. Wow! This is the commitment we made for the time we're giving this project. We have to make some compromises and sacrifices because we run out of time and capacity to do what we originally set out to do.

441
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:51.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The gift of sticking to that parameter has leads to so much creativity.

442
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They say constraints. Force, innovation

443
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is such a cool exercise to force yourself to fit the parameter that you originally set out to

444
00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and make whatever trade-offs or concessions required to do so.

445
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's a really really helpful tool and technique

446
00:53:06.933 --> 00:53:16.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and explain the true costs. So understanding what is on at stake to lose if you put too much time into that as opposed to what you have next on the roadmap.

447
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:27.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? So understanding like I said, the the people costs like salary and otherwise factor that in to how you're budgeting the work that you're trying to get done.

448
00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And you also need to know where to stop.

449
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:49.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You gotta know when to call it, because sometimes you're trying to power something through and get it done because you feel like you promise it to someone, or you're you're gonna feel guilty if you end up having to call it or fail or ship something different. But you're gonna have to just have the discipline and the realization that nothing that you ship at this date needs to be perfect

450
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool.

451
00:53:52.614 --> 00:54:04.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just keep this stuff in mind. And as you go through this, you will shift a lot of your point of view, and you'll develop your own recipe for this. And eventually you'll be coming back to

452
00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:13.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: our program helping the founders realize how you manage to scale your business, which we have a lot of founders doing in the coming weeks, because they all have different ways of doing it. Some of them use

453
00:54:14.027 --> 00:54:18.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: notion, which, you know it's whatever it's all good. I'll just keep talking my trash.

454
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:28.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But yeah. So this is my personal start to it. I'll show you a few images. But, Liliana, before you head out anything else you wanted to add before we wrap.

455
00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:42.290
Lilliana Robinson: No, I'm excited for you guys to see the second half of this where we show you kind of how we work. If anyone has questions about like how our team does things. I can answer them in part 2. So I just have to head to the doctor, so I'll see you guys in like a couple of hours

456
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.460
Lilliana Robinson: cool.

457
00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.474
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, one flag for Liliana is

458
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:51.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We over the past year had the insurmountable task of moving out to California

459
00:54:51.840 --> 00:55:02.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to run additional programs. And that threw a wrench in all of our project manager systems. So the screenshots you're going to see are actually from before then and then. Now, it's like a whole complex web of additional

460
00:55:02.924 --> 00:55:07.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: things that I'm not going to burden you with now. But maybe Liliana will do a demonstration when she comes back

461
00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:15.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool. Alright. So I'm gonna keep rolling. Unless actually, you know what? Let me check in. Are there any questions before I give you my quick

462
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:17.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: personal journey.

463
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:24.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: questions, comments so far, is this bit helpful? We're like 1 h in. So I want to make sure this is keeping your attention.

464
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:42.879
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Super super helpful. Happy to kick that off. Yeah, really, it's given given us the kick we need to to not make excuses and think, okay, there's only a few of us now. But actually, let's get this done and ready for when the team grows. So really appreciate it.

465
00:55:43.280 --> 00:56:03.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, you know how like, when you're when you're on your computer. And it's like running kind of slow. And you're not sure why you just reset it right? You just restart the computer like, I want this to be that for you all for project management. If you need it, you know. Just restart the computer still the same stuff in there. But you're just rebooting it, and whatever you needed to clear got cleared up. And you're just like, all right, we're gonna do this the right way this time.

466
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:29.600
Lilliana Robinson: And what's really nice is, you can do that as many times as you need like. I would say, Neil, and I've had like resets for project management, probably like 8 times in 2024 alone, like every time it just gets a little haywire you just like have a reset, and that looks different every time. Sometimes, like we have a zoom call for a while and we reset it. Sometimes I just go in. And I'm like, all right. We're overhauling this so like it, you do kind of have to like Yank the wheel back and like, keep it driving straight, cause it'll like

467
00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:40.470
Lilliana Robinson: start veering off, and you just pull it back. So that should be like something that you get used to, because I've learned that that's just normal. It just happens, and so keeping that good hygiene and being used to doing these resets is really good.

468
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, my litmus test is always, can I

469
00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:48.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: click a button and see exactly what I need to get done today? Comprehensively?

470
00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:52.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And if I can't, and if I don't have my work scoped out properly like that.

471
00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:57.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know that I need to do some adjustments until I'm back at that. That's like my baseline

472
00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:04.939
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is. Is my work properly scoped out thoroughly for the day, where I have nothing to add or change, and I know what's on the deck for the rest of the week.

473
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:06.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I'll show you what that looks like

474
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:12.416
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in a second. So like, I said, you're gonna hear my founder story later. But

475
00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:16.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I am proud to say that I was one of the early

476
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:29.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: access users of Google Docs when it came out in 2,006. This is what it looked like way back in the day. And has anyone ever had one of those? You know that device, the palm trio.

477
00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:31.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You might know that.

478
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:34.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, I'm so old.

479
00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:36.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, so

480
00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this was like

481
00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:43.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the smartphone before the smartphone. Okay, it's called a palm pilot.

482
00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:53.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I was 18 years old I had my 1st company. We raised $250,000. I didn't even know what I was doing right. I was just this kid from Chicago.

483
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:57.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I figured out how to get

484
00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:18.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like spreadsheets into my palm trio. I remember this is like it was like a whole effort. It took me a whole day like, figure it out. But I was doing some weird technical stuff, and like I was able to like, manage like my Google spreadsheets and my excel spreadsheets and all my like Crm stuff for the sale I was doing like sales for this company that I had started.

485
00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:19.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And

486
00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.474
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, I also had that bluetooth

487
00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:29.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: thing in my ear. I just looked ridiculous driving around my dad's like 1986 station wagon

488
00:58:29.675 --> 00:58:36.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: trying to do like sales and doctors offices. It was pretty wild. So that's how I started off a project manager.

489
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:46.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then I graduated to yeah, when I graduated university, I started my coding school, which ended up being called the Starter League. This is

490
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:48.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the original base camp

491
00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:52.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and base camp classic, and then the tabs at the top.

492
00:58:53.445 --> 00:58:58.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There was a new base camp. There's base Camp 2 base camp 3, and we're now on Base Camp 4. It's been like 20 years.

493
00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:15.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then there's another app called High Rise, another app called Backpack, and then Campfire. So all these were different apps and tools that this company had that I was managing, and then eventually all consolidated into one platform which you we now use today. But I also use that.

494
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:16.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then, after this.

495
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:21.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or actually during I don't know when. But I used another app called huddle

496
00:59:21.752 --> 00:59:31.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this was another like project manager tool. Again, like I'm dating myself with these different things, and then some of you might be familiar with this one. You might know what this one is

497
00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:36.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which one? What's this?

498
00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's on the tip of Dominique's tongue.

499
00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:43.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Come on unmute. I want to hear you think about it out loud. Let's do it. Let's do it.

500
00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:46.540
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I couldn't.

501
00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:48.029
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Old Jira, is it.

502
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:50.379
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Someone go to this Jira? No.

503
00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:52.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's a good guess.

504
00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:54.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: close, but no cigar.

505
00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:56.080
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: What is it? I know what it is.

506
00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:56.880
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Trello.

507
00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:58.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Nope.

508
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's called Pivotal Tracker.

509
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:05.240
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, yeah.

510
01:00:05.545 --> 01:00:27.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, there we go. So so you're familiar with that. Somebody know pivotal tracker? No, so this is one of the originals. This is one of the ogs for this style for that Kanban style formatting. I really like pivotal tracker because of. And and you all have to tell me whether the other tools do this or not. But what was baked in was estimating work and velocity.

511
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:32.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and doing that in a way that allowed me to really quantify my productivity in a way I'd never had before.

512
01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:41.981
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I became obsessed with like quantifying my productivity like any given day. And there was another tool. I used to finally do that and that tool

513
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: was called the Pomodoro technique.

514
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You guys familiar with this, I think this is persisted.

515
01:00:48.500 --> 01:01:00.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this came out in like mid 2 thousands, like 2,008, 2,009, I think around then, is when I 1st heard about this technique for those of you who don't know what it is. Does someone want to explain it? Actually, since I'm tired of hearing my own voice.

516
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Anybody know what the Pomodero technique is

517
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if you want to do it.

518
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:09.700
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Isn't it like a chunking thing where you set a timer? And you'd like do 15 min.

519
01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:10.760
George Reed - CEO and Founder: But all.

520
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 25.

521
01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:14.108
George Reed - CEO and Founder: And then you take a bell. Sorry? Yeah.

522
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:23.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. So a Phd, a. Phd wrote this, actually, I think they were getting their Phd, and they developed this technique

523
01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:44.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to be successful in acquiring their Phd. And then they rolled it out as basically a resource and a framework over time. But it's a technique that I still use to this day, like I have a little timer right here that I use, and I work in. There it is. You can see it now 25 min. So I work in 25 min increments with 5 min breaks and sets of 4, and then I take a 30 min break.

524
01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I do that multiple times per day.

525
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:49.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and in those 25 min

526
01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:56.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they are undistractable, meaning. I turn off notifications. I don't take calls. I don't let people interrupt me. I'm getting something done.

527
01:01:56.590 --> 01:02:04.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm usually throwing on some just really dope music that I want to listen to. And I'm just focusing on a job or a task, and I scope all of my work.

528
01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:07.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so that within 25 min is my estimate

529
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for how I'm going to get that work done.

530
01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:26.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So when I say I scope my work in 25 min. That means like, I'm not going to come up with a task that takes 5 min. I'm gonna bundle a set of tasks that could take up to 25 min if I get it done earlier. Great! But I am budgeting that. I think I want to dial it in. So I know how much work I can get done in a 25 min increment.

531
01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's a very technical.

532
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: personally micromanaging style to live. But it's the only way that I stay sane.

533
01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:35.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I couldn't recommend this

534
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:44.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: approach and technique more for anybody who feels like they struggle with focus and productivity for your individual work any given day.

535
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:48.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It has been probably one of the greatest things that's ever happened.

536
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so

537
01:02:49.590 --> 01:03:00.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: couldn't recommend it more so much so I even worked with a friend to build an app some time ago. This is many years ago. Where on top of Base camp. We built something called dayboard, which was like.

538
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:01.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What do I have to do today?

539
01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:03.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like app.

540
01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:07.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And what's really cool is basecamp ended up like implementing

541
01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:16.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a version of this into their like app itself, like there is a today day board that they now have in there. But back then, when they had their open Api.

542
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: me and a buddy

543
01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:23.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: just decided to like roll this, this little app and a bunch of people use it, and it was really helpful and useful for them at the time.

544
01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:27.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But all this being said, there's also just like the standard tools, right?

545
01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:28.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Email.

546
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Google Docs

547
01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: base camp

548
01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:35.469
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for me it was huddle and pivotal tracker. Base camp, 2. Base camp, 3. Base camp 4.

549
01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But now my question is.

550
01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what are your tools?

551
01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:43.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What do you all like to use. I've been talking at you for an hour.

552
01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's let's hear what you all love.

553
01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Caesar.

554
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:52.759
Sezer: Is there a reason why you're you're not

555
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:55.050
Sezer: referring to Slack or Girado.

556
01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You mean this or this.

557
01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.320
Sezer: Yeah.

558
01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Or this or this.

559
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:02.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, for this or this.

560
01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:03.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Come on, man.

561
01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:09.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm cooking with gas over here. I'm ready for anything. I just wanted to get to know you first.st

562
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.350
Sezer: Yeah, I've.

563
01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:13.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's all there. It's all the same.

564
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.410
Sezer: Yeah, 4 years in every, almost every project

565
01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:25.369
Sezer: we have been, every client slack. And Jira was the tools that they were using.

566
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, yeah.

567
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you won 2 punch.

568
01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:36.530
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Product. That we're looking to integrate like we only just did like Slack and Jira. And we were like.

569
01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.929
Kirimgeray Kirimli: we'll deal with everything else later.

570
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.140
Sezer: Yeah.

571
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:46.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I I think slack. And Jira is like probably

572
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:53.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Slack and Jira, or slack, and whatever tool, slack, and Asana, slack and notion slack, and whatever that seems to be the baseline now

573
01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:55.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for me, I'm

574
01:04:56.810 --> 01:05:00.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I. The reason I chose base camp was purely because

575
01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:01.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there's no end.

576
01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's just base camp.

577
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't need another thing on top of it. I can just use that.

578
01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:09.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

579
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:13.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that was the integration that that made a difference for me. But like, I think.

580
01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: tried and true, like slack, plus

581
01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:28.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: whatever project management seems to work a lot for a lot of really good teams. Tech stars overall uses slack, and Asana, that's like tech stars as a company, and how they they work! I don't do it so, but that's just how they like that.

582
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I saw some hands up.

583
01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:54.690
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): Oh, so I have been using for the past 20 years, Microsoft notes app and it's been working. And then for software development, we use Jira, but my master list is Microsoft notes, and I've used it in my career. I used it for the startup like I don't know. It's just simple, and it's always on the desktop.

584
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:58.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You say, Microsoft? Notes like that's not the same as onenote. Right? There's a 2.

585
01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:05.290
Monica Roy (Seascape Clinical): No, not I don't even need to go into onenote. It's the very basic like notes. App. That's been in it forever.

586
01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:06.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, got it?

587
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:15.239
Nirat Attri: I think for us, I think confluence also flows under the radar a bit, because, especially when it comes to documentation.

588
01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Confluence. Is that what you said.

589
01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.120
Nirat Attri: Yeah.

590
01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, yeah, I've heard really good things about that.

591
01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:30.182
Nirat Attri: Especially because, like, so of course, we're in Med tech. So that's also highly regulated. So I feel like regulators also like, have some really clean documentation. So

592
01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:38.700
Nirat Attri: I think one thing to highlight here is like notion has problems with data encryption. So it isn't encrypted at rest. There is some problem with that.

593
01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:42.790
Nirat Attri: And at that's why I was really enjoying it, bashing on notion, because there was.

594
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:43.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Complain.

595
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:51.909
Nirat Attri: Thing that we were discussing that. Oh, can we use notion for a lot of these like of this FDA documentation that we were doing at that time.

596
01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:54.320
Nirat Attri: And you're like, Okay, that can't work.

597
01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.120
Nirat Attri: So yeah, just wanted.

598
01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think I need a separate. I need a separate group just to like, you know.

599
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:04.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: rag on notion. I I just I could use that just as a little small group exercise or something.

600
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:09.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But I I think I'm talking so much trash about it, because, like all the other textile programs, use it.

601
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:10.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Crap.

602
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:15.990
Nirat Attri: And I think I would also want to like highlight teams is doing like a great job, because they also, like what Microsoft has done, is build a.

603
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's up? Teams.

604
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.220
Nirat Attri: Listen.

605
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:17.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

606
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:23.309
Nirat Attri: So they've done like build a good ecosystem like around the internal app. So like, I think it's a

607
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:34.500
Nirat Attri: you know the way all the Microsoft apps integrate directly into teams that have also done like a great job there. So it's kind of like a base camp competitor in that sense like the way it combines

608
01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:40.199
Nirat Attri: communication. Just also wanted to highlight that if people haven't used it yet, I would also recommend doing teams once.

609
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:42.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for sure.

610
01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:46.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right. Agent, lunar, how are we doing it?

611
01:07:47.400 --> 01:08:01.820
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Hey? So comment from both of us. So I think, yeah, we're we're big fans of teams as well. But what we're quickly realizing is that across the pond it's it doesn't seem to be

612
01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:19.959
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: yeah, as favored. So we are like strongly considering changing. But I think teams has has been really helpful in terms of having everything in one place we're able to integrate confluence and Jira slack whatever anyone's using. It has a nice integration. But we are.

613
01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:22.614
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: We are open to trying base camp.

614
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:24.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't know. Teams sounds really cool.

615
01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:46.939
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Teams. It's I mean to being very honest with everyone. This was what I used at Ubs. It's very good for enterprise. So at 1st we thought, is this really the right tool to use for a startup? But in the same principle, as you know, no matter how small the team is, you should still get organized right? So that's where teams has been awesome. But you had a

616
01:08:46.939 --> 01:09:06.889
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: yeah. The other one we've been using a lot of is loom, which has been really handy for managing different teams in different time zones and just being able to yeah, save a meeting and just shoot them a quick note more at the end of the day, so that when they come online that they can kind of watch it in their own, their own time.

617
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:09.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So loom, meaning the video

618
01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:10.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: overlay.

619
01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:12.270
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: That's it. Yeah, yeah.

620
01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:17.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I have a funny story about Loom so Shahid Khan, the the founder of Loom.

621
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:24.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know that kid, and I say that kid because he was just like this young guy hanging out in Chicago

622
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:35.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with us like he was like an intern and like lurking. And he was like at all the events and everything. And I was like, Oh, he's he's ambitious, he's a cool kid. And then he ended up selling this company for almost a billion dollars. Last year.

623
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.869
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Oh, wow!

624
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:46.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I was like, Oh, my God! I didn't learn from this guy, so I hit him up. You know we we touch base. I'm excited to, you know, re-engage him. But that's just such a funny thing that you can go from.

625
01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:50.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You know nothing to something like that, and just do a phenomenal job. So

626
01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:52.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: looms a Homie

627
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Morgan.

628
01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:57.740
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: He's funny.

629
01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:21.310
Morgan Stanton: Right now, because we've been smaller. We've just been using Google sheets like the table views before. And I think I'd love to get anyone else's feedback on other project management tools. We're looking on onboarding for more people. We think we might need something a little bit better, and getting used to base camp. I wasn't familiar with it before, and you're talking about your own personal time. I'm definitely a pen and paper person. I don't even see.

630
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:22.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, it.

631
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:33.020
Morgan Stanton: Bullet points like a crazy person. But it just helps me organize my time during the day. And then the other day these notes get kind of tossed, and I start again the next day, but it works.

632
01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:33.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well.

633
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:42.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: well, Morgan, I have to ask the room. Does anyone else have a similar situation that we can't see right now? Okay, Talitha has one right?

634
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:53.889
Talitha Abraham: Oh, yes, I'm exactly like Morgan. I'm so old fashioned. I love like writing notes every single day on, like my little planner, and I think the team knows that very well. I'm like, so I'm a Virgo. So I love being organized.

635
01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:54.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We thought.

636
01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:57.270
Talitha Abraham: Such a thrill. So, yeah.

637
01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:04.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright, alright, very cool. The only the only condition I have. There is a lot of the times, the work that we write down.

638
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:19.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's important to make sure that other people have awareness of what the work is. Still right, so you may have to find a way to either, duplicate it or translate it digitally. So others are aware of what you have going on. If you're not working in the same room.

639
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:32.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But the only other reason I don't take physical notes all the time myself is I just don't like my handwriting. I don't like looking at it. It's look kind of ugly. So I'm like, yeah. But if you have very beautiful handwriting, I'm sure it's gonna be great.

640
01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:33.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Fabio.

641
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:39.010
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, same here. By the way, I think I lost like the ability to handwrite a a while ago.

642
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:50.419
Fabio Caironi: It's just like all typing on the keyboard. So for I I don't use like much stuff for personal management, but task management. But we use clickup so that's.

643
01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

644
01:11:51.060 --> 01:12:09.120
Fabio Caironi: And I think, like, you know, just like the process of going over all these staff enter software. Has been kind of a puzzle. And I ended up choosing Clickup honestly, just because I I love the CEO like he's super cool and like I always watch their wheels, and that. You know he's a

645
01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:22.240
Fabio Caironi: yeah. His Linkedin is popping. And I I just like the whole concept about their company. And like they're very similar to notion or to Monday, so in the end, I mean, I love the look and feel of the platform. I love the company, you know. You know.

646
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:31.580
Fabio Caironi: if we, if we put all our knowledge on that platform, we're gonna end up on that. So in the end, you know, you might wanna just choose your provider also like

647
01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:38.789
Fabio Caironi: depending on how much you love the company. So yeah, for me, it was like that, because honestly, they were all pretty much the same for me.

648
01:12:39.141 --> 01:12:41.069
Fabio Caironi: and then for for personal tasks.

649
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:45.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, Fabio, sorry to interrupt you. I just want to clarify one thing you just said.

650
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:48.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or highlight it to everyone.

651
01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What he just said about the CEO of Clickup and the company itself.

652
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:56.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: My dream is for customers to say the same thing about each and every one of your companies.

653
01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:05.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That was so. That was so nice to hear. Like, I admire this business, not just because of what it does, because of who's doing it, and their approach to doing it

654
01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:13.953
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like that is such a a an endorsement for that business that's so powerful. I love that. And I couldn't.

655
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:17.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah, I I couldn't agree more. So that was really well said.

656
01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:22.295
Fabio Caironi: That's yeah. Great that you agree. I I honestly kind of

657
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:28.590
Fabio Caironi: prioritize functionality, of course. But in this case, since all these platforms. They look pretty much.

658
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:47.849
Fabio Caironi: They had the same functionality to me. I I prioritize the yeah, the look and feel and the the overall vibe I got from the company. So, yeah, that was a selection process. But then, like for task management, I want to see what? What's what are the opinions here. Has anybody used a motion with an M.

659
01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:50.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. The the AI one.

660
01:13:50.440 --> 01:14:04.070
Fabio Caironi: Yeah, cause I I found it cool. But like, it's, it's not really helping me too much, because it basically schedules your your tasks and your day, and I felt like I was too much constrained by it. But I I was wondering anybody else has used it.

661
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:10.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Everyone's shaking their head. Okay, I've got one

662
01:14:11.745 --> 01:14:12.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

663
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:15.139
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this is a strange one.

664
01:14:15.554 --> 01:14:39.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's only for me. I don't know anyone else who uses it. But I use an app, cause I as I I'll you'll see in a second. I have some slides to show you how I break down work within base camp. But it's a to do list which live anywhere like Monica said. It can live in your notes, app right? So it doesn't really matter where the to do list is, it's more about how you structure the to do so for me for structuring to dos. I use an app called goblin tools.

665
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:44.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it's a really cool thing where, like, if you give it.

666
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's AI. So if you give it your task

667
01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:52.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and you go break this down into smaller tasks, it'll

668
01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:58.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: boop, boop, boop, boop, boop! Break it all down, and it'll give you like 10 or 15 discrete steps to get that task done.

669
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:10.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it saves me a few steps of thinking through that discretion myself. But yeah, that's that's my app of choice for the like, really insane, like magical to do list generator.

670
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:16.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if you like. So, for example, for your personal life, if you ever wanted to go like I need to.

671
01:15:17.067 --> 01:15:18.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Do my laundry.

672
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:30.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and you put that task in there. It'll break down 10 steps to get your laundry done from like putting it in the washer, taking it out, putting in the dryer, and then like folding everything and then putting it away like I'm like, yes, speak to me.

673
01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:37.759
Morgan Stanton: How accurate do you find it for your work? Does it ever give you extra tasks or things you find not useful.

674
01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You can. You can chisel it. But, like most of the time, I don't even have to change anything.

675
01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:44.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's creepy like I'm worried about the world.

676
01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.370
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Crazy

677
01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.279
George Reed - CEO and Founder: the laundry thing. Yeah, everyone should just go try it. Yeah, it's like.

678
01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, go to go to goblin tools and type in like, do my laundry today, and just see what it does.

679
01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:54.940
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Just.

680
01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They like, creep you out.

681
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:58.010
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Dominique.

682
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's my recommendation.

683
01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:03.479
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: As we speak, and love the branding. By the way.

684
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I need.

685
01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:10.430
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Like. That's all I needed to see like his face. I'm like, I like you. Yeah.

686
01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.090
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Less of a goblin right? Making you more organized.

687
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:17.457
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll show you on my phone. I don't know if it's visible, but I have it right there.

688
01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.040
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I need this.

689
01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

690
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.950
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: That's a marketing, even though I am a marketeer like I love him like. It's great.

691
01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:40.474
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I've never even mentioned this tool ever to founders like this is this is the 1st time i've ever, even said that all out, which is hilarious. I'm just realizing. Thanks, thanks, Fabio, for pulling back more of the layers.

692
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:46.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Very good. Alright, so I'll make this fast. How we use base camp as a team. So

693
01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:48.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: now you'll get a sense of

694
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:59.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: my treachery here, so I'll give you a bird's eye view first.st Liliana. Kind of already did this for you all when she did the base camp tutorial. But this is like a little bit of a time machine. So blast from the past.

695
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We'll go back a year ago.

696
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:02.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and this is what it looked like.

697
01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

698
01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:06.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for me.

699
01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:07.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I had my leadership.

700
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:15.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I had all my Chicago program stuff's running. I had my eirs. I run a book club for founders who are interested

701
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:18.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: where we read a bunch of really cool business books and get smarter together.

702
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:23.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I had a really important one, is actually the portfolio and alumni support

703
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:28.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: side on the bottom left there. That one is really robust now.

704
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:37.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So my portfolio and alumni support a base camp project. Has every single one of your like you, all my companies, and whenever you all ask me to do something.

705
01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or I decide it's important for one of us to do something for you.

706
01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:59.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: A. To do goes into your like. Your company. Name is a to do list, and it goes on that list and has a deadline and steps to take, and all that stuff. And that's how I organize following up and supporting you all. I'm also a university. I teach at the University, Northwestern. So I have a project for that or 2 projects for that.

707
01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:02.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And what have you? So that's like the bird's eye view.

708
01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:05.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and what I like about basecamp, is, it

709
01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:12.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: provides everything all at once for me. So for my leadership. This is now Liliana and myself

710
01:18:12.999 --> 01:18:21.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: before it also included Brad and Anthony, who are now running a program in Chicago. But it gives me, like, you know, same structure that you all know.

711
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:31.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then this is where it gets even more interesting. So I have like a 2 layer system for how I roll out work.

712
01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:35.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I have a master like project for lead called leadership.

713
01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:49.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And then I have sub projects within that master that have more detailed to do lists. So the to do is I have over here. If you see week, 9 week, 10 week 11, those are to do lists that I've now taught Liliana to structure

714
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:53.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that reflect the week of program that we're in for techstars

715
01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and for each of those to do's in this project.

716
01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:00.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They have their own discrete to do. List another layer deeper.

717
01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we had Chicago 2023,

718
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:08.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and this is under leadership as a list of all the to do lists within that project.

719
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So when I click that link

720
01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:16.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Chicago, Jpm, 2,023 program team, it takes you to another project where all those lists now live.

721
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm just gonna make sure. I repeat that and make it clear to everybody. I have a list of to dos.

722
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:25.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and within those to dos

723
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:29.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: are links to the actual to do list within a different project.

724
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:40.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it allows me, as a leader at a high level to see the work that Liliana is doing. But I don't have to worry about micromanaging the work at the lower level, where all the tasks are broken down here.

725
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:43.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All I care about is that week 9 is planned.

726
01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:45.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't need to know

727
01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:48.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: all of what goes into week 9

728
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at this level of fidelity.

729
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:58.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'll give you more examples and keep going. But just to reference this, let me see if I can pull up a list here.

730
01:19:59.246 --> 01:20:01.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Program team.

731
01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let me keep going.

732
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:12.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Here we go. This is the program team to do list that I was talking about. So for here

733
01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this is where it is, you know. So you see, week 9 on the bottom right there.

734
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:18.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if I go back.

735
01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I have week 9 here.

736
01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:21.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is within that project.

737
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If I go back over here, you see week 9 there.

738
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:31.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm only tracking Liliana's progress on Week 9 here, for the most part

739
01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:34.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as her leader, who's spending my time elsewhere.

740
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:38.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: She and the team are working on that list in a much more detailed layout

741
01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: over here in the separate project.

742
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I just want to make sure that this to do list gets done.

743
01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is my way of kind of like leading.

744
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:49.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but not micromanaging

745
01:20:50.377 --> 01:20:58.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it allows those discrete tasks that that goblin tool thing like does, but also, like all of you can just do manually, which you'll probably do today.

746
01:20:58.780 --> 01:20:59.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Soon.

747
01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:06.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but it gives us all a clear idea of what needs to happen. To prepare any given program.

748
01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:14.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Also, I really enjoy seeing status and progress across our portfolio like I said, I break you all down into seasons.

749
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:20.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we're in season 12 right now of silicon prairie slash Silicon Valley.

750
01:21:20.595 --> 01:21:40.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's my like, own internal private TV show and reality show that's been happening running all these textile programs because you all are ridiculous characters. And you're gonna get to know each other and realize how crazy you all are when you hang out. But yeah, it's a whole side show of activities that all being said, this is kind of what it looks like when I organize the work.

751
01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:46.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I I also color code. The companies based on like my own personal like sentiment analysis.

752
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:54.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So like, I'll be like, all right. I think this company's in the green like they're good. Yellow is like they need some help like, I gotta spend some more time with them. Red is like

753
01:21:55.250 --> 01:22:08.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: shits at the fan, and somebody's got to intervene like we. They need help like we gotta we gotta get serious here, you know, so that that all happens. And it's not a judgment or like a character assessment. It's more like company status reference for me

754
01:22:09.166 --> 01:22:30.323
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as a rule of thumb but what all this does. So you see, I have all my companies laid out. I have my team with all their tasks laid out. I have overall for any given program. This is the program team. So like right now, it's Akadena and Chloe and Sylvia. They're all in this program. Team project for us. For San Francisco

755
01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:53.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I have this hill chart tool, which I think also has the move. The needle feature now flow that allows you to kind of move things over the hill. So as I'm getting work done, my team submits updates from going up the hill to coming down the hill. Meaning, how much work are we actually getting done? Are we wrapping up this project in this work, or are we in the process of still figuring things out and getting the ball rolling?

756
01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:56.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's a really helpful kind of framework for that.

757
01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:07.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But, like, I said, these are just features and functionalities, and how I live and work. You can do this anywhere. You can implement a lot of these ideas with whatever tool that you prefer. Okay.

758
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:17.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: almost done. So this gives me the headspace. And when I say headspace, I told you all that I know I'm on the ball when I can click a button one click and see everything I need to do today.

759
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:19.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is what that looks like.

760
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.059
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay. So when I have all my stuff laid out.

761
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:26.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I can see the 5 to 10 things I need to do today.

762
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:31.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then I know not to worry about what needs to be done tomorrow, because I'm gonna wait till the bomb.

763
01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:37.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the way that I indicate that both to myself and my team

764
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:43.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: are through automatic check-ins, not daily stand-ups and not meetings.

765
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:47.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I have 4 powerful check-ins that I like to use with my team.

766
01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What are you working on this week.

767
01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:52.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What are you working on today?

768
01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What did you work on today?

769
01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:56.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And what did you work on this week?

770
01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: These are my magic. 4

771
01:24:01.230 --> 01:24:02.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Monday morning

772
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or Tuesday morning when there's a holiday.

773
01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:07.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: My team writes up what they're going to work on this week.

774
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:09.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I do, too.

775
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:11.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're all on the same page.

776
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:15.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, I see what Liliana's up to. I see what Neil's up to. We all know what we're up to cool.

777
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:20.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They comment on the Updates to go. Oh, what about this? Or actually, I can take this off your plate.

778
01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:24.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Awesome. Takes 20 min at the start of my Monday morning.

779
01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Doesn't have to be a huge lift.

780
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:30.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let me see.

781
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:33.585
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, that's where my reflection, I'll show you that in a second. So

782
01:24:34.290 --> 01:24:38.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What am I working on today. That's more real like, okay, today. Here's what I want to give.

783
01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:41.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: By the way, the thing I showed you before this.

784
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:43.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sometimes I'll take a screenshot of this.

785
01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:57.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I'll just say, here's what I'm working on today, and I'll add any other layers like if I have meetings or something like that, I'll throw those in in the written update or any other context I need to add, or how I'm feeling, or if it's coming off the weekend, I'll throw a photo of what I was up to. Just like. Let the team know, like.

786
01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:01.107
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, I'm still cool. But

787
01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:09.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I think this is a reflection at the end of my week. That's what this is. But I was just sharing a reflection on my team. I'm like.

788
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: actually.

789
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:18.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this is what I'm working on this week. That's what this update is. So if you look at this, this is like how Neil thinks about his week

790
01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:20.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in like structures his work.

791
01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:21.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

792
01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:30.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's that. But it's really cool, because there's just like 3 big rocks. And then like overall few other things they need to do. And now my team knows exactly what's up, and I don't have to have a conversation with them about it.

793
01:25:31.562 --> 01:25:41.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is, I think, what Brad's working on on a Wednesday, so he's like he's got a full day of meeting, so he's super busy, and he's got 3 big things that he wants to get done. If you look at the bottom there, there's like these little boosts.

794
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:47.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Some of you have already figured out how to do this in base camp, but like I'm like, Oh, I read it. I like to just indicate that I read someone's update.

795
01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:54.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'll just drop drop a little booster and emoji in there if I have nothing to say or ask, but, like I at least want to acknowledge that I was there, and I read

796
01:25:55.570 --> 01:26:00.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Liliana's. Talking about how her week went. So this is the end of the week.

797
01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and she's reflecting on everything that got done.

798
01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is really helpful, and what I love about both

799
01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:09.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what I got through this week and what I got done today.

800
01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:12.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's it's a way of signing off.

801
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:16.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Most of you all don't know how to turn your freaking brains off.

802
01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:24.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you're working, and you'll just never stop working because you're running a really hard, intensive, difficult start up so you don't know when to end your day.

803
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you're just finding ways to slip in all the self-help and self care things like, oh, I need to eat.

804
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or maybe I should go to bed now.

805
01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:36.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or maybe I should take care of myself or do something. Maybe I should call someone who I care about, or a friend

806
01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:48.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like you're just sneaking those in around all the work you're doing all the time and see I'm not. I think I'm hidden some. I'm cutting too deep there, I could tell. But I'm saying that to say, though with my team there's a lot of peace of mind

807
01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:54.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because their updates are expected between usually 5 and 6 o'clock, maybe even 4 or 5 o'clock.

808
01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So between 4 and 6, any given day.

809
01:26:57.670 --> 01:27:00.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm seeing these updates from my team about what they got done.

810
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:02.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and that I'll talk to him tomorrow.

811
01:27:03.970 --> 01:27:09.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's really awesome. And it it really makes a huge difference when it comes to our own like mental health.

812
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:13.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and like our ability to also prioritize our personal care

813
01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:15.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and your personal life.

814
01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:18.589
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know as startups and as founders, you're always on.

815
01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I know this is a big thing to ask of you to do now, so I'm not saying to do this.

816
01:27:23.730 --> 01:27:33.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but I am saying that aspire to do this someday, because, as you bring on team members, you are not going to ask everyone to burn the midnight oil, because not all of them have

817
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:41.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the equity that you have in your business, so you, at the very least, need to treat them with care, and thought about how you respect their time.

818
01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:53.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which is what I do, because I do tend to work a lot more than what is documented. But that's more of a personal choice and a habit of me as a fellow founder, and less of something that I would impart upon people who aren't

819
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:57.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at my company or on my team as a founder, but more as an employee.

820
01:27:58.150 --> 01:27:59.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So does that make sense

821
01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool, almost done here.

822
01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:07.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think William mentioned this before, but I'm really passionate about including

823
01:28:08.562 --> 01:28:14.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the schedule in base camp. In addition to the Google Calendar. It's a little ridiculous because we're duplicating work.

824
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:20.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: meaning we can't. We have to manage both manually. It doesn't automatically synchronize an update.

825
01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:26.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but it's worth it because of the conversations we can have in base camp about those events.

826
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:28.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I can't have a conversation with you

827
01:28:28.710 --> 01:28:31.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in Google Calendar about the calendar events.

828
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:35.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So where do we talk about those events and activities in a way that is very consistent

829
01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and permeable. And so that a year from now.

830
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:46.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when you're running your business, you've hired 5 people and you want one of your team members to reference something that you went through a tech star, San Francisco.

831
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:49.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now you can very easily jump to that date and time

832
01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and see a reference to that activity, or the notes or a link to a recording.

833
01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think it's helpful.

834
01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:18.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I encourage all of you to utilize the schedule in base camp to reference any notes that you take in any workshops or sessions any conversations that you want to have to engage people about what was discussed or reflected on. It's really helpful to use as a as a resource for you all to give some permanence to your experience.

835
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Liliana also mentioned this thing called earn the meaning.

836
01:29:22.930 --> 01:29:27.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I do this not only with you all, but with my team as well.

837
01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I break things down pretty clearly for folks in a way where I'm like. No, you need to actually show me

838
01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:34.362
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that you have

839
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:38.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: taking the time to think through everything that you want to talk to me about.

840
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:46.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you want to have a meeting with me, there's a few layers that you need to pass through to make sure it's worth our time, both of us, to take the time to do that.

841
01:29:47.630 --> 01:29:54.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One little Bandaid I have just for you all for founders and for program is, I use Boxer as like my little intermediary.

842
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:58.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so like, instead of having a 30 min meeting, let's have a 5 min Boxer chat.

843
01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Then, if we realize that it takes more than 5 min.

844
01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll escalate it to a meeting.

845
01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:05.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then we'll schedule time.

846
01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:11.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But usually a lot. You'd be shocked at how much can get done in 5 min if you just get to the point.

847
01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:17.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's my style. And I hope you appreciate the time that it'll save you.

848
01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:28.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, so part 2 cause I think we can wrap up now. I think we're kind of done early, but I do want to give you a hint and maybe get ahead of the game a little bit on what we're going to cover later today.

849
01:30:29.553 --> 01:30:31.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Here's what we're gonna do.

850
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're going to review founder examples of your week, one priority to dos.

851
01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So get those ready.

852
01:30:39.025 --> 01:30:50.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're gonna add in some goals and show you how to break work down for those of you that either have it broken down. Well, we'll use as examples for those that maybe have it at higher level. We'll help you chisel them and break them down.

853
01:30:50.814 --> 01:31:05.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're gonna have some breakout sessions where everyone's gonna give each other feedback on their work. This is a really fun activity. By the way, trust me, like every founder like, seems to do well with this, and it allows you all to get to know each other better, because everyone has a different style for how you all manage and think about your work.

854
01:31:05.795 --> 01:31:14.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we'll do some show and tell for those that are particularly proud, or want some specific help from the group on their work, and how they're scoping it, and then we'll wrap up and debrief.

855
01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:17.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's what to expect from part 2.

856
01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But yeah, I would be happy to

857
01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and early, but answer any questions before we call it.

858
01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:33.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How'd I do? Was that helpful? Was that a good use of 90 min of your time.

859
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:34.850
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Super.

860
01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay.

861
01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:40.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool. I'm hoping wetting, whetting your appetite for this afternoon.

862
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:41.709
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Scratching the surface. Yeah.

863
01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:42.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Huh!

864
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:50.890
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: May I ask? Maybe a silly, I'm sorry. Was someone going to speak.

865
01:31:50.890 --> 01:32:00.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, don't, don't. It's there's no silly questions. If you ask a question, it's probably something that other people wanted to ask, but they didn't even think to ask, or they didn't have the courage or confidence to do so. Yet.

866
01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:06.250
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Appreciate that one. No pressure. So I,

867
01:32:06.330 --> 01:32:15.140
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: yeah. So with so base camp, I'm actually pretty more excited about it. Now you've shown me. Because I like that you can have

868
01:32:15.230 --> 01:32:17.919
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: the bird's eye view of all of your projects.

869
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:25.419
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: something that I used to do in my old team as in when I was at Ubs, I used excel not very sexy.

870
01:32:25.530 --> 01:32:28.443
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: and the reason for that was on

871
01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:34.859
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I had like an overview sheet where I was able to have an overview kind of timeline of

872
01:32:35.367 --> 01:33:00.910
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: if I'm putting too many tasks on one day, if that makes sense. So if I'm overloaded if there's like too many to do lists and and tasks from all the various projects running. So I just wanted to ask from your experience, because you've got so many different projects running in parallel. How do you? How do you do that? I do you individually go into each project, set your timelines, and then revisit if you've got.

873
01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:03.690
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I don't know 50 items on one day.

874
01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:08.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, so okay, let me pull this up again.

875
01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:09.789
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Thank you.

876
01:33:10.631 --> 01:33:13.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is. This is where I'd see my day right.

877
01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:14.250
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Right.

878
01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:15.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

879
01:33:15.730 --> 01:33:17.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: sometimes.

880
01:33:17.690 --> 01:33:30.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so one that could be a question of whether there's too much you're taking on too much right? So 1st of all, am I taking on too much work, where I have so many tasks, in so many places, that I don't even know how I can manage all that being said. If you notice here.

881
01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:34.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: each of these to dos are within different, to do lists and projects.

882
01:33:36.683 --> 01:33:37.166
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah.

883
01:33:37.650 --> 01:33:43.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So. So so this is actually consolidating them across all of my projects throughout base camp.

884
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:44.790
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Got it.

885
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:48.599
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And it puts them all in one place. But what I do when I have a to do

886
01:33:48.630 --> 01:33:52.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that is beefier meaning like there's more in it than just the to do itself.

887
01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:57.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: In the notes of the to do. I'll break down the smaller steps.

888
01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.239
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Got it. Got it.

889
01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:08.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like like the goblin tools. So like I'll break down all the other little things I need to do. But I have to do. That means get this thing done. And then there's all the micro steps to actually getting that thing done that I'll lay out.

890
01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:09.850
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Got a

891
01:34:10.190 --> 01:34:14.718
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: yeah, that's helpful. It makes sense. I'm just yeah, all clear. Thank you for that.

892
01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:18.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And we'll do it this afternoon as well with your with your tasks.

893
01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:20.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so we'll do it. Live, and we'll look at your work.

894
01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:21.415
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Oh,

895
01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll get ready.

896
01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:40.079
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Not to hijack the the mic, but in terms of then, Neil, you you chunking it up because something that while we're still using. Excel, and we sort of take things from teams and then try and chunk them up into those

897
01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:48.299
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: bite size pieces of, say, an hour block. Now we're going to do 25 min blocks. But how do you then take that to do list

898
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:50.189
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: and start to.

899
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:53.699
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I guess. Piece them together like throughout the day.

900
01:34:57.150 --> 01:34:58.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I will

901
01:34:58.970 --> 01:35:08.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: choose a task to do so I haven't. I'm sorry for all these tools. By the way, like I said, all of this can be done with pen and paper, and like

902
01:35:08.190 --> 01:35:12.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a manual timer, so like again, forgive me, for, like my references to tools.

903
01:35:12.810 --> 01:35:15.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but I use an app called focus to do

904
01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so. It's this one right here.

905
01:35:19.625 --> 01:35:26.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But it'll. It's basically my timer. So I'll put in a task that I have to do from that list here, and I'll hit the start

906
01:35:26.670 --> 01:35:31.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: on the timer, and then it'll run to my 25 min task just for that job to get done.

907
01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

908
01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:38.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's I. I just do that all day long until my to do list is gone.

909
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:41.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Wow! And what's great is that like?

910
01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:45.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's gone before my day ends, so I always have time at the end of my day.

911
01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:50.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If I'm scoping my life properly, I should be done no later than 4 o'clock.

912
01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:55.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because I want 4 o'clock to 4, 30 to write my update to my team about what got done.

913
01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.500
Fabio Caironi: They're so lucky.

914
01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.339
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: We're all like, oh.

915
01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:08.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Just say, just try it out. Try it out for a day, you know. Just try. Just just do me a favor and try out what I'm recommending for one day.

916
01:36:09.295 --> 01:36:09.640
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: And.

917
01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Say, I'm going to end my day at 5.

918
01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:13.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm going to start my day at 9.

919
01:36:13.770 --> 01:36:19.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's nothing against 9 to 5. That's a great amount of time to get work done if it's focused.

920
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.900
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Hmm.

921
01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:29.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If it's not focused, that's when it's not a good use of time. Right? All of a sudden you're taking calls. You're getting distracted. You're doing meetings, you're doing this, that and the other, and you're not in flow.

922
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:31.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, you need more than 9 to 5.

923
01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:32.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You need more than 8 h.

924
01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:36.939
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But if you have a lot of dedicated structured work with intention

925
01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:40.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like that's all you need any given day, even as a founder.

926
01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:41.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: In my opinion.

927
01:36:44.100 --> 01:37:00.139
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: No, I like this 25 min as well, because it keeps you accountable. I think there's, in a way, an element of scope creep with your tasks if you haven't properly estimated. Okay, I need to put a chunk of time towards it. You can end up spending

928
01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:05.666
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: a few minutes more, and then, by the end, that's that's a couple of hours.

929
01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:10.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I mean. So the the whole notion of in conversation we had about scope creep

930
01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is also related to your day to day.

931
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:17.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like any given task. You need to apply the same principles as we do for an overall project.

932
01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:26.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Are we implementing scope Pre today with all the work that I need to do. Am I letting more things layer into it rather than just getting it done and moving on to the other thing? That's important.

933
01:37:27.150 --> 01:37:29.770
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Let's do it. Thank you.

934
01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:30.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.

935
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:33.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: anyone else

936
01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:39.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: get out of here. Y'all if you need to go. Don't worry. We're this is like bonus hours. Now get out of. Here, George, take a nap.

937
01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:46.069
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Oh, no, no. I was just gonna ask if you've used the built in Kanban in Base camp at all.

938
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:49.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, yeah, it's cool. It's called card tables. Yeah.

939
01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah. Okay.

940
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:52.070
George Reed - CEO and Founder: So that's good. Okay.

941
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:56.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's it's it's good. It's good. Yeah, I I'm I mean, I'm less dependent

942
01:37:56.550 --> 01:38:00.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: on it. But I think for particularly like software projects, I think it's really helpful.

943
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:05.630
George Reed - CEO and Founder: I want to replace Jira. Yeah. Basically, if I'm going to use base camp because my developers love Jira.

944
01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:11.069
George Reed - CEO and Founder: I'm gonna try and convince them to switch over. So okay, cool. Yeah, I might hit the wall. You're right.

945
01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:12.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Get out of here, man.

946
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:13.510
George Reed - CEO and Founder: 8 h, or something, so.

947
01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:15.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, my gosh!

948
01:38:15.150 --> 01:38:17.379
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's like 2 am. Where you are right now.

949
01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:19.079
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Nearly 3. Yeah.

950
01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright! Good night, George!

951
01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:22.090

955

Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Well, clearly, I've not, you know, been implementing the steps, showing the juice.

Neal Sáles-Griffin: and the price matches the quality. Yeah, it's good.

Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: That's good.
