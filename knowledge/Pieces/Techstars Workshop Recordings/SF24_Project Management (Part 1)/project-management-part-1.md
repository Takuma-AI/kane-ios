### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Fabio Caironi: Yeah, sure, I didn't want to jump in, but you know I was ready for the right moment. And yeah, nice to meet you all. Sorry I missed the chance to attend the previous sessions, but I kind of already got to know you by watching them. My name is Fabi. I'm the founder of White Knight. We do distributed computing for batch processing powered by crowdsource harder. So yeah, we'll get to know each other along the way. I'm so excited to be here.
- Fabio Caironi: Sure. So we basically, we run computations on crowdsource devices. Which means like your computer or a business server. So we basically decentralize a data center into crowdsource assets. And we do that to power intensive computations, such as AI training or video processing or Etl processes. So we're doing this for the benefit of power
- Lilliana Robinson: you know. Whole tool they had set up for their company, and they were able to breathe a lot more easily. They felt like they could implement a lot of the processes or principles that we suggest today. And then they were able to like, have goals set goals, make sure their team was meeting those goals, and then they held each other accountable.

### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: I'm always here. You can ping me on base camp if you have questions. But all of the due dates and everything should be in there."

> "Lilliana Robinson: I think it's just important to come correct on that call. It'll be at."

> "Lilliana Robinson: founders in the past from other programs. Ask questions that I would be embarrassed if our co-founders asked, because David's time is very valuable. And he's done this forever. Even when he wasn't CEO when he was chairman, he would do these welcome calls, and I think it's like a very rare time that you can just ask him anything so like. Take advantage of that. And like, actually think of questions. I think that that's really important."

> "Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I'm not sure what you covered. But I added this slide this morning when I was going through these slides because I thought it was important to explain where this workshop came from. So"
