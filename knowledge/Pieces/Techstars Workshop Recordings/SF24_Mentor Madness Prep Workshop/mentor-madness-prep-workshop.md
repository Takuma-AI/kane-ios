### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Kevin Kaspar: So here's something I wrote. But this was before we had the elevator pitch workshop. So just review yesterday. That's a much better like kind of masterclass in what to say. But I used to say, start by saying, Hi, I'm blank and we help solve blank through or using blank. I'd love to talk to you today about Blank, because, like. So this last line should be your next, your next steps in your elevator pitch, like we practice. I'd love to talk to you today about and give your objective. And then the because is really important, because it shows the mentor that you thought it through. And there's a reason that you're asking them about that.
- Kevin Kaspar: okay. They're not criticizing you as a person. They're giving you constructive feedback about your business. I even went this extra step to clarify because I gave this workshop, and then someone after the 1st time I gave this workshop got the feedback.

### Key Insights

> "Kevin Kaspar: So ever since then, for the past 8 programs. I've been doing this workshop. And it's really important that you guys heed my warnings because the people who do have a very successful mentor madness, and the people who don't make the same mistakes that their predecessors did. And I just don't want that for you guys. So make sure that you pay attention and ask me any questions for things that may not make sense"

> "Kevin Kaspar: do get kind of unhappy when they realize the mentors don't read every single time they send these emails. It's still required and important as a positive thing."

> "Kevin Kaspar: So you never know what they're able to do who they're connected to, or what they might have. That isn't searchable or easy to like. Discover on the Internet."

> "Kevin Kaspar: lose interest because they definitely have questions. They want to ask you to just practice like a 30 second elevator pitch that we practiced yesterday, and leave room for them to probe you with questions. Remember to write down the questions they ask you immediately after the pitch, so you always want to start by introducing yourself."
