### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Chloe Lannert: A little bit on the history of basecamp. So it's a Chicago based company with a really close relationship to Neil which will elaborate on during the retreat. But they have a really cool philosophy on Startup building and bootstrapping. Highly recommend giving Jason freed a follow on Linkedin. He's got some really cool stuff coming out, and I really like his approach to to building products. Neil looks like.
- Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's the framework that they developed.
- Chloe Lannert: But at the core of our philosophy when we're approaching project management. It's really asynchronous communication. I know we tease this a little bit yesterday, but just wanna reiterate

### Key Insights

> "Chloe Lannert: we're gonna run through this deck. Give you a tour of some key features of basecamp and talk a little bit about our project management philosophy. And then we're gonna jump into a live demo of the tool."

> "Chloe Lannert: project management as a whole is a really strong passion of Neil's. Probably originating from his relationship with basecamp. It's something we're gonna talk about a lot and something. Our team talks about a lot in terms of making sure we have a really strong foundation. So we can do our work really, effectively and collaborate really, effectively. So if you ever want to dive deeper on your project management setup whatever tools you may use. Let us know. We're always happy to to dig a little bit deeper."

> "Chloe Lannert: program is a lot. We we run a lot of sessions we make these sessions effective. But we really value protecting your flow time outside of that. And so we're always gonna default to asynchronous communication outside of scheduled program sessions."

> "Chloe Lannert: And this documentation is so important because it's really really effective for for new team members. So for us at techstars, our team has shifted a lot in the last 2 years as we've been working with different funds and running different programs."

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's important to acknowledge that all of you all have your respective expertise as well, and I'm sure many of you, if not most or all of you are effective managers of your own time and of people on your team. So we're not trying to force feed you a different way of thinking about things. If you have a better way."
