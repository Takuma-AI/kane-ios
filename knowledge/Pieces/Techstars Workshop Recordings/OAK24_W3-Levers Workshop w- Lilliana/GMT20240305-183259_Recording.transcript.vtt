1
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.870
Lilliana Robinson: Again.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: lilliana, has that that really dope apple monitor.

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.430
Lilliana Robinson: You don't know about that. It's a good one. Zoom

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: got these champagne problems going on over there. Check.

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.990
Nelson Mitchell: Nancy.

6
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.810
Lilliana Robinson: Let's see.

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, in the meantime I'll give some background about what this is. So

8
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: levers is. So you you're gonna get a little bit more Chicago on, but on top of that

9
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:53.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This framework was in, in, created in part or in full by Amos Schwartz. Amos is the former managing director of Texar, the Austin.

10
00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:09.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and he is a dear friend. He is somebody that when I joined tech Stars I immediately gravitated to flew out to Austin and shadowed his program experience and his participated in multiple screening committees for him.

11
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: he has run 10 tech start programs

12
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and has written multiple books. So he also wrote, Sell more factor which some people get copies of.

13
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:38.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But the framework that Amos came up with it's something based on and derived from his experience running these accelerators. And he basically learned that there's a very clear and important pattern to successful founders who go through tech accelerators.

14
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:49.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they're the ones who've mastered this framework that lilliana is about to teach, so I'll let her take it from here. But, as you can see if you notice at the bottom of this image that our very own Troy Hennikoff.

15
00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:03.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Texas, Chicago, and D close friend, I told you a lot about Troy teaches financial modeling for us. He also co-authored the book in a few sections, too, and I had the privilege of being one of the reviewers for the book report was published during Covid.

16
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:18.840
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome now and thank you for the intro. So yeah, that's everything you need to know about the Lovers book, and we're gonna talk about W. 3, which is just the first chapter of 4 chapters and lovers. So those are all the different

17
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:40.139
Lilliana Robinson: quote unquote leverage that you can pull for your business. They go into revenue financial modeling, and a couple of other things like metrics. But this one is specifically about W. 3. And this workshop is actually more than what it says in the book, because I've taken it and changed it to Meld perfectly with the stage that you're at with jobs to be done.

18
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.040
Lilliana Robinson: So

19
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:56.820
Lilliana Robinson: Amos never mentions jobs to be done in his book. He's aware of it, but I think that these 2 actually go extremely well hand in hand. This is a separate framework, and it's a separate set of exercises that we're gonna do together. And you'll see how it goes. Really. Well.

20
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:07.550
Lilliana Robinson: they're not related at all. But if you do both, you're gonna come out with an extremely comprehensive understanding of your customer segment and their desires, and what it exactly it is that you're selling.

21
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:17.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And and just to comment briefly, lilliana, the unique contribution that lilliana has made to this. Is that what she just said is that she took the job to be done? Framework.

22
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:26.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and she learned that the framework that taught taught by Amos and and a lot of other programs adopted, and she found a way to like kind of connect it to in a meaningful way.

23
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is.

24
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: II would say, very unique perspective and content that like she kinda

25
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a

26
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: conjured, so very, very valuable and impressive

27
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.159
Lilliana Robinson: thanks, Neil. So first is understanding that proving your

28
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.099
Lilliana Robinson: w, 3 s. With data and experimentation equals reaching repeatability. So the whole point of this that we're doing

29
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.900
Lilliana Robinson: is to be able to

30
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:17.610
Lilliana Robinson: reach what we call repeatability. That is ultimately the goal for a company that goes through our accelerators. So what does that mean? That means that you can pull lever A, and you know for sure that B will happen once you get to that point where your business is so predictable. We also call it predictability. Once you get there.

31
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:30.430
Lilliana Robinson: you'll know that putting X in gets Y out that makes you a fundable business that makes you a sustainable business, and that's how you reach success. So this is one method to getting you to that repeatability.

32
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:47.799
Lilliana Robinson: What we mean when we say proving your with data and experiments, it means that everything that we're doing today in this workshop together is just a theory. Cause we're just speculating. You're gonna do some exercises. You're gonna speculate on a piece of paper or on your laptops.

33
00:04:47.890 --> 00:05:04.610
Lilliana Robinson: That means nothing until you go out and test it with data and experiments. Try it. See if it's correct. Go back to the drawing board and iterate once you've tested it, and you have data, and you've done experiments, and you've proven that your W. 3 is correct and spot on. That's when you can know for sure.

34
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.239
Lilliana Robinson: So we'll go into like, how to test that with data. A little bit later, Neil.

35
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:23.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, the last thing I'll I'll add here is regarding repeatability. III don't know if I already mentioned this in my background, but I worked at math venture partners with Troy. I actually worked with him. While I was at tech start as a part time venture, partner

36
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I met with I don't know. Call it a hundred companies, probably more during that time.

37
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:38.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And when I observe things getting to the partner level where we're making a decision whether to write a 500,000, check, a million dollar check, or you know, whatever

38
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is.

39
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we would essentially ask the founder to

40
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: do exactly what's written right here is what experiment

41
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:56.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: signal the repeatable like metrics that you have, or the repeatable kind of patterns that you would have to acquire customers.

42
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:08.010
So all I'm trying to say is. there's a very objective pathway to getting commitments from investors to raise capital. It's a very uncomfortable pathway, because it actually requires you to demonstrate with data

43
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that you have something that's worth investing in.

44
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But it is the absolute best way to raise capital, because you know

45
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.129
what the value of the company is and what it will become based on those levers.

46
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:31.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's still assumptions, and there's still some healthy, like theoretical components to it because you don't know how it's actually gonna play out. But you have indicators that you're able to demonstrate

47
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:46.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that like could make the case for you to be at a certain both value and a command, a certain amount of capital from an investor. So this is a more scientific framework than I think a lot of the games that are played in the venture. Capital.

48
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:57.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know art and practice that, like founders, become masters of and student stuff, we hover far more on the the science than the dark arts of

49
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:06.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: kind of manipulating information, so that you can convince these to write. You bid checks. That's not really what we're good at. We're better at actually demonstrating it objectively.

50
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:23.440
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, instead of like storytelling or selling a dream, you have an actual like set of information that you can tell for short. That's why it's important to validate the assumptions that we're making today with real experiments and real iteration and data so that you can foreshore. Say these things.

51
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:33.989
Lilliana Robinson: So with that being said, we're going to jump into some exercises, a series of exercises where we're going to theorize your W. 1, 2, and 3, and we'll work on it together.

52
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:51.729
Lilliana Robinson: So as we go through, every single person who is on this call is going to do the exercise, because it's important that everyone from your team is able to articulate what it is your business does, and you might not get it right the first time when you go and test it, you might be completely off. And I have some stories that I'm gonna talk about.

53
00:07:51.730 --> 00:08:07.530
Lilliana Robinson: Another thing for this workshop is that most of my examples are B, twob, so a lot of people have asked for a lot of B to be examples. And this framework lends itself extremely well to both B to C and B to B, whereas maybe at the beginning of jobs to be done, it seems like we tend more B to see this one is

54
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:14.770
Lilliana Robinson: very easily applied. With very little like mental hoops to jump through. So I have some examples for you later.

55
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:29.780
Lilliana Robinson: So first, I want you guys to each take a piece of paper or a notes on your computer and write out, who do you believe your customer is, what are they buying, and why are they buying it?

56
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.929
Lilliana Robinson: So I'm going to give you 60 s. Just the first things that come to your head, go ahead and write it down.

57
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.570
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that's the time. So

58
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.170
Lilliana Robinson: you guys can raise your hand or just unmute. Was that too much time, too little or just right.

59
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.790
Mircea Gogoncea( Cicada): It's just right here.

60
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.129
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, just right.

61
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.470
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: Just like.

62
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.730
Lilliana Robinson: yeah. Kelman.

63
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.370
Kelvin Alaneme - LocumDoc: yeah, just right.

64
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:11.379
Lilliana Robinson: So the next thing I want you to write is, how do you know? Think about the data that you have the opinions that you have? And also what you want to know that you don't know. So basically, how can you justify the things that you wrote before?

65
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.689
Lilliana Robinson: Go ahead and take 90 s?

66
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.979
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that was time. So again, was that too much time, too little or just right.

67
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.580
Ale: I will, with the previous question.

68
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.179
Lilliana Robinson: say it again.

69
00:11:51.770 --> 00:12:02.560
Lilliana Robinson: Would you say I was? I would have reversed the Times with the previous question. Okay, so too much time for this too little time to write down what it is. Does everyone agree?

70
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:21.620
Lilliana Robinson: Wow, okay. So this ideology might feel tedious, but that's the point. So the point of this is to get into the nitty gritty, like deep down, so that you can better understand your roadmap for the next 13 weeks. And beyond.

71
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:34.450
Lilliana Robinson: So remembering that this is all a theory, and you're just taking this to test and go validate. So everything you just wrote down is just speculation on our parts, right? So we're gonna break up into groups of 2 companies

72
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:46.930
Lilliana Robinson: with each company going into the same breakout room. So everyone's gonna have a partner company and what I want to happen. I'm gonna go through what's gonna happen. And then I'm gonna put you in your breakout rooms, and I'll give you prompts via the chat.

73
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:57.850
Lilliana Robinson: So everyone's gonna go into assigned breakout rooms with another company and the Ceos, if they're present, otherwise another co-founder can do it. The Ceos are, gonna do this exercise, and everyone else can follow along.

74
00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.550
Lilliana Robinson: So

75
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:07.819
Lilliana Robinson: we're going to have the first. CEO explain to the second CEO, their W. 3, that they just wrote down their who, what and what

76
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:15.630
Lilliana Robinson: the listening company should just write down, what they're hearing, and what questions they have. So they're described. So they should not talk

77
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:25.809
Lilliana Robinson: the next 90 s. We're gonna let that second company, that second CEO, repeat back what they heard to the first, CEO, and share any questions they have with the first CEO

78
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:38.030
Lilliana Robinson: the first. CEO shouldn't speak. They should just also absorb what the second company is saying back then we're gonna flip. Now, the second company, the second, CEO, is going to explain to the first founder the first, CEO,

79
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:48.540
Lilliana Robinson: what their W. 3 is, and the first company will just listen and write it down, and then they'll repeat back what they heard and share questions. So we're gonna do that. So 4 sets of 90 s.

80
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:55.719
Lilliana Robinson: So I'm gonna go ahead and have Chloe open up the breakout rooms. And you guys will see your company name, and you can go ahead and jump right in.

81
00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:01.019
Lilliana Robinson: and I will give you a prompt in the chat with timing.

82
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.250
Lilliana Robinson: Is everyone able to find their breakout rooms.

83
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.130
Lisa Hennessy (she/her), Travaras: I didn't get one. Yep.

84
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.120
Lilliana Robinson: Chloe, can you start inviting people if you can?

85
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:15.850
Jeremy Banning: Yeah, you should be able to manually select the one with your company name, but I'll start assigning people.

86
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:28.910
Jeremy Banning: I thought it was just the Ceos being put into the rooms. No, no, you guys get to go in and do the exercise to just only one person can be able to talk.

87
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.499
Lilliana Robinson: So follow along. I'm gonna start the timer now, so go ahead and jump in.

88
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:50.900
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So, lilliana, how do I select? I'm sorry I'm lost here. Yeah, there should be a breakout. There should be a breakout rooms tool at the bottom. Do you see where it says breakout rooms?

89
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.430
Lilliana Robinson: It'll say your company name.

90
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.159
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Gotcha. Thank you.

91
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.290
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that's everybody.

92
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.030
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, 10 days.

93
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.430
Lilliana Robinson: Did you have?

94
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.050
Chloe Lannert: Well.

95
00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.210
Lilliana Robinson: there we go.

96
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.489
Chloe Lannert: Which is just us in the AI

97
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.179
Lilliana Robinson:  There's 1 min left for this, first round.

98
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.490
Lilliana Robinson: oh, Maria.

99
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.160
Lilliana Robinson: okay.

100
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.840
Lilliana Robinson: Chloe, can you pause the recording.

101
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.900
Chloe Lannert: Yes.

102
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.160
Lilliana Robinson: Did you think, was there anything that

103
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.970
Lilliana Robinson: you wanna share? Does anybody want to unmute and let us know how that felt?

104
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:21.940
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): I wanna say something it felt really easy to follow because we were allowed to take notes. So I was able to. I we were almost, you know, I'm a fast Typer, so I could almost type work for what I was hearing. So I'm not sure if that was super productive. But yeah, it was also very well explained. So

105
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:33.589
Lilliana Robinson: okay, well, we're in person. I normally make people use pen and paper. So it's not as easy to just follow along. But yeah, I totally agree. I usually you can kind of type it down.

106
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.690
Lilliana Robinson: Malcolm.

107
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.380
Rob Nelson: Wow.

108
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:49.960
Malc - Xsauce: yeah. That was great exercise as well. Had a really good conversation with Dan. And one of my key takeaways is just how I guess it's proximity to the problem. I kind of gonna be from agency perspective and also from a client perspective we just offer. We've really gotten to the nitty gritty around.

109
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:57.709
Malc - Xsauce: Yeah, how did he know some of the assumptions it was? You could feel it was first hand you could feel like he was living and breathing a problem area. So yeah, it was really good to kinda hear him break that down.

110
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:20.660
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, wow, so yeah, it sounds like, you guys have some similarities. And you were able to go even more into detail. I'm curious. If anyone and, David, I'll let you go 1 s. I'm curious if anybody found a difficulty, or maybe like a barrier in between explaining the problem. Maybe you are very close to the problem. And you got someone that's not as close to problem. And maybe it was a little bit difficult.

111
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.159
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, Marcel, and then, snow. We'll go back to David.

112
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:52.790
Marisel Polanco: Oh, I don't know if the answer to questions you just asked but we were we would both be to be to see. I found it really interesting that we got matched. And yes, it is answering your question. It it is a challenge when you have, when you are B to B to C, trying to explain who you're selling to cause. It's a 2 way street here. So we we found those similarities. And it was interesting talking to Jeremy.

113
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.620
Lilliana Robinson: Interesting. Okay, snow.

114
00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:06.010
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah. II actually read the 1 3 part of the levers yesterday. So I tried to follow the guide. But actually

115
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:14.090
Snow Lee / Runbear: I because of that, I try to explain what our customers buying instead of what we are selling.

116
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:24.599
Snow Lee / Runbear: But in the meantime the meanwhile, but it makes the least difficult to understand what our product is. I'm not sure which one is better. Yeah.

117
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:31.379
Lilliana Robinson: that's interesting. Yeah, we're gonna get into that with W. 2, and then I was telling me at the end, if maybe it still seems unclear.

118
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.820
Lilliana Robinson: David, did you want to go?

119
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:41.570
David Akinyemi (he/him): Yeah, mine is kind of different. But I was kind of your first question, but it was around.

120
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:55.699
David Akinyemi (he/him): We kind of had very similar businesses kind of in a way to the point where we spoke to Pardo and Parta was like, I've actually experienced the problem you're trying to solve. And I wish this existed a year ago. Kind of thing. And so

121
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.730
David Akinyemi (he/him): I think because of that, we

122
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:05.399
David Akinyemi (he/him): almost like knew exactly what the other person was trying to build. Cause is the same space. So interesting, maybe on purpose.

123
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.600
David Akinyemi (he/him): Curious to see what opposite would be like.

124
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:18.109
Lilliana Robinson: That's really cool. Yeah, I'm curious, too. It's interesting that we kind of randomly did that. So a lot of you ended up with people that understood. That's interesting. Christy.

125
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:44.249
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Yeah, it was interesting to just pay attention to when you're explaining it like acronyms, right? Or certain phrases that you think you know or is common in your industry. But for the other person your audience. They may not be familiar, so always to be mindful of of that. And then also when I was explaining what you know that the 3 y. The 3 W's.

126
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.869
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: I was kind of generalizing it in that.

127
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:54.590
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: I was trying to make it a simple, but then it didn't get to the heart of like, what is the actual thing that we provide to get to that benefit?

128
00:20:55.580 --> 00:21:13.630
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, it's hard, right cause you want them to truly understand what your business is, so you can't dumb it down too much. But when there's not that inherent knowledge in that space it's a little bit difficult. But we'll meet a lot of people that aren't from that space that you still need to explain it to like advisors, investors, etc. So it's definitely hard, Antonio.

129
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:28.770
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So one observation is the first question. I didn't know where whether to put the customers like kind of the vision that we have for the customer, which is consumer products versus

130
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:50.560
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: the first customers, which is where we're targeted targeting to. And and so I decided in the end to to use our first customers the ones that we're doing the gut to be done interviews for. And actually it was nice to see that we have a lot of clarity on on that. Now we we we're try to validate our assumptions

131
00:21:50.920 --> 00:22:12.129
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: with with these interviews. So at least it was nice to see that we have some clarity. We have some clarity we are targeting. And the other observation I had is that when the last question around, how do you know, like the first thing that popped up to my mind was our competitors are are making familiar.

132
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:17.290
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and so like the fact that there is already a market for it, but we can do it better.

133
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:25.059
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med:  give give me some solid things, but I think I I'm gonna feel much better when I see those 1015 interviews

134
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.219
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and and and try to learn from that.

135
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:57.240
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. Well, there were so many good nuggets in there. So yes, having competitors in this space already, making money is absolutely a validation. A lot of people think it's the other way around. But we want to see that interest in that market so completely agree there. And also you. I'm so glad you brought up the point. Should I be tackling like my giant vision for the market or the first few customers we're gonna get into that today. But you chose absolutely, correctly, because those first customers are the ones that we're focusing on at the

136
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:07.050
Lilliana Robinson: moment. It's almost like the big vision doesn't exist at this time. We're all about that first segment. That's really what today is about so 100. Antonio Matthew.

137
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:21.089
Matthieu Bonnard: Hey? Yeah. So it was very interesting exercise. And to me, kind of eye opening to hear the questions and the way I read it like, if there are questions to clarify whether how, why, and what are

138
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.180
Matthieu Bonnard: it means? We haven't nailed it.

139
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.520
Matthieu Bonnard: And so we need to do that, so that we use this like

140
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:33.970
Matthieu Bonnard: 30 s to make it like crystal clear on this 3 w's to whoever we're talking to.

141
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:44.460
Lilliana Robinson: That's exactly right, Mantia and I have a slide for that. If you can't articulate your W. 3 in 3 min. Which of how long we gave each of you, how can you grab someone's attention in much less time?

142
00:23:44.460 --> 00:24:06.619
Lilliana Robinson: So this was a controlled environment. But imagine being an environment like a networking event, or you meet an investor in an elevator. You know the age-old principle of an elevator pitch. You have much less time to grab someone's attention 15 to 20 s. So we need to have you guys locked down, extremely crispy, concise, and clear, able to articulate it in a very fast

143
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:17.299
Lilliana Robinson: but also potent manner, so that you can grab people's attention and have them extremely understand it in an extremely deep way, in a very short amount of time, so that I know that's exactly what you're getting at, Matthew.

144
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.140
Lilliana Robinson: Pardon.

145
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:32.099
Pardo Walter: yeah, it was kinda echo what David mentioned earlier, what we were basically within the same umbrella, but different categories of issues that we're trying to solve under that massive umbrella within the vintage space. And there.

146
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:50.059
Pardo Walter: they detailed it enough. They were articulate enough that it was so succinct, yet detailed enough that I was able to by the end, once they finish to know, like I could have definitely use something like you guys, you know, a year and a half back during all the crazy hectic market craziness. So

147
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.120
Pardo Walter: yeah, that was our experience.

148
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:57.910
Lilliana Robinson: That's awesome. Okay, kudos to David and his teammate. That's really great to hear. Felicia.

149
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:27.059
Felipe Acevedo - Goohaus: Yeah. 1 one thing that I noticed in myself it was like, who do, I believe by customers. And it's like retailers. And it's like, Okay, that's fine. But it's very, you know. And many people say like banks that some team here guys say, like Duane say, banks or credit companies, I think we have to narrow that now. Finally, to who in the company, like product managers or category managers or e-commerce

150
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:34.260
Felipe Acevedo - Goohaus: manager. So whoever, I think that's that. That's the customer finder. You know the the person more than the company.

151
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:45.850
Lilliana Robinson: exactly, and we'll narrow that down right now. So let's jump into w one. So now we're gonna get into each. So you guys, major hypotheses, let's try and narrow those down, and I'll teach you about each one.

152
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.020
Lilliana Robinson: So first we have

153
00:25:49.660 --> 00:26:12.339
Lilliana Robinson: a side note, which is until you have data. You shouldn't go too far in any one direction. So Amos, in his book, talks about being lost in the middle of nowhere, and if you're lost, if you just get dropped in the middle of the desert. You don't. You're not just gonna pick one direction at random and head there because you have a lot to lose. If that direction is wrong. You're gonna die of thirst. You're not gonna make it so instead, what

154
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:28.089
Lilliana Robinson: like most people would do is look, start looking for clues, look for sign posts. Try to collect additional information along the way to prove whether or not you're headed in the right direction that way, but you can make your best judgment, and give up, like all the energy you have left into trying to find.

155
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:33.549
Lilliana Robinson: been a nearby city and refuge. So the same is true here. I really like that story because

156
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:58.369
Lilliana Robinson: you should picture yourselves as that person when we're making a startup. We're really dropped in a desert like there's no roadmap. You're making it up as you go. I'm sure all of you feel that way, and you don't have the resources to just choose the wrong direction. We wanna make sure that we're making the best guess before we go too far in any one direction. And that's really what the point here is that this is gonna help you better inform what direction to put all your resources behind.

157
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:09.640
Lilliana Robinson: Another side note is that everyone on your team needs to understand and believe in your. So I got at this at the beginning a little bit. But even though the Ceos were the ones doing the exercise.

158
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:22.429
Lilliana Robinson: and even though only some of your team members are here in the workshop to day. Once you've gotten your W. 3 down, pat, it's really important that everybody in your company can thoroughly understand and believe in your company's. W. 3.

159
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:30.009
Lilliana Robinson: The amount of times I've seen someone get a key strategic investor or a very key Mentor Board member

160
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:48.350
Lilliana Robinson: advisor from a member of their team who is not a leader, who is not maybe even C suite, but because they understood the vision, and we're able to articulate. It has been very plentiful. So I've seen that a lot of times. It's not just always going to be the CEO or the Coo

161
00:27:48.370 --> 00:28:04.519
Lilliana Robinson: getting those key connections. It's really anyone, and as many team members as you have that can better articulate it. That's more people out in the world making these connections for you, and it's less missed opportunities. So make sure that everybody on your team is able to articulate the W. 3 that you decide on

162
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.839
Lilliana Robinson: so that you can grab every opportunity that comes your way.

163
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.960
Lilliana Robinson: So with that, let's go into W. One

164
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:18.769
Lilliana Robinson: who do, I believe is my customer. So this is your first of the W. 3 s. And then this is your first theory on the direction you want to go into.

165
00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:44.299
Lilliana Robinson: So at full scale, like Antonio was saying, this is your total addressable market. This is your vision for your entire customer segment at full scale. But for now we're gonna start narrow. So this is not your end goal. So if you set your W one is something extremely small, which is what we want. That doesn't mean that you're gonna have a small business. That means that you're capturing that market right now, and we will slowly expand out.

166
00:28:44.700 --> 00:29:01.819
Lilliana Robinson: This should be uncomfortable. So even if your W one segment is point 0 0 1% of the entire market that you eventually want to get, you'll have the absolute confidence that each of those people is meant to be in your targeted audience that you can make a sale with those people.

167
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:14.159
Lilliana Robinson: So just keep in mind. This is not where you're ending. It's just where you're starting, so that you can get a really deep understanding of all the attributes and circumstances of your ideal customer, and there's no such thing as too narrow.

168
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:22.040
Lilliana Robinson: My favorite part of this presentation that I like to bring in because I studied this in engineering school is the diffusion of innovation.

169
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:35.629
Lilliana Robinson: So the for those who haven't seen this before. Some people call it the innovators curve or the diffusion of innovation, or the curve of adoption. This is how people adopt a new technology. So there are many different

170
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:46.560
Lilliana Robinson: things that people call it. But it's always the same segments. So we have innovators and then early adopters. Then we have the chasm. If everyone's ever heard the book crossing the chasm, it's referencing this.

171
00:29:46.560 --> 00:30:07.109
Lilliana Robinson: Then we have the early majority, late majority and laggards. So I always start off by saying the laggards we wanna just basically pretend don't exist. That's for people like Google who are now getting the 80 year old people in the Nursing Home to use Google. So that's like the last bit of the market that people will ever be able to capture.

172
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.180
Lilliana Robinson: What we want to focus on

173
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.919
Lilliana Robinson: is not just the innovators, but

174
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:31.939
Lilliana Robinson: the very, very, very small original block of the innovators. And if I was on in person on the board I would point out literally just the black line that that arrow is pointing at. So not even the light blue block, just the little black line, the point 0 0 1% of innovators. That is what we want to start with.

175
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:43.089
Lilliana Robinson: Because if we start with those adopters, and we get spot on. It's very easy to expand those concentric circles out and just make that market bigger and bigger. And I have some examples later that I'll talk about.

176
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:51.279
Lilliana Robinson: So the goal is that with a hundred percent confidence, you could sell to every person that you put in that W. One.

177
00:30:52.070 --> 00:31:07.099
Lilliana Robinson: The important note here is that I said, every single person in this criteria that you talk to in a sales context would result in a sale, so I don't want to conflate that with jobs to be done. So when you're doing your customer discovery, you're not trying to sell them.

178
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:36.600
Lilliana Robinson: But the idea is that once you do your customer discovery, your screening criteria is who you're going to talk to, to get those insights, and through those insights you will validate your and that W. One segment which may or may not overlap with your screening criteria your segment. If you go and talk to each of them in a sales context, would a hundred percent result in a sale? Because you just know that their situation is exactly right to have your product to come and help them make progress in their life.

179
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:41.610
Lilliana Robinson: Does that make sense? Does anybody have any questions there? Because that's a really important distinction.

180
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.500
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

181
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.930
Lilliana Robinson: so

182
00:31:52.150 --> 00:32:10.239
Jeremy Banning: in the in the diffusion diffusion of innovation curve you said the focus really should be, is it between the early adopters and the those first 2 blocks? Right? No, it should be. So. We're focusing on the innovators that 2. Nobody here is past the innovators stage.

183
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:31.989
Lilliana Robinson: We know each of your companies. A lot of us think that we're way further. That's good news, though, cause that means you have huge markets to capture. But we're all in the innovator stage, and we're not even in the 2.5 of your total market that you could get. We're focusing. And if you are trying to capture that right now, I'm asking you to narrow it so that you can be more accurate. You're not going to be able to scale as much if you don't have this

184
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:46.439
Lilliana Robinson: extreme accuracy. So we're not even focusing on the 2.5%. We're focusing on less than 1%. So we're at the very, very beginning of the curve. That's why I say, like, even just like the left hand black line of the innovators block

185
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:56.160
Lilliana Robinson: that 2.5. We're focusing on like point 0 0 one very small with extreme accuracy and specificity. And then we'll expand out very quickly.

186
00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.820
Jeremy Banning: Good question, Jeremy. Brian.

187
00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:11.580
Brian Simiyu: I'm just wondering I'm just trying to make sure that I've come up to this. Is it safe to then say that? We're trying to get a monopoly in a very small market.

188
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:27.639
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I like that. Yeah, in a very, very small. And you can be the winner in that, even if there's a competitor like, you know this is where you can start and get that niche, and then you can expand outward and jobs to be done is to help you validate that Alexander a little bit

189
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.530
Lilliana Robinson: good question, Kevin.

190
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.729
Kevin: Yeah. Hi, Iliana. So the

191
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:51.430
Kevin: we're like, if you were to give an example of this for instance, like we've narrowed ours down to, let's say, the fine dining industry with fine dining restaurants. How could we? Even? What would be an example? We could get that even further, it'd be like a specific like type of

192
00:33:51.550 --> 00:34:18.220
Lilliana Robinson: fine dining restaurant like how? Cause? That's that's a small niche in the market. But it still is probably higher than that point 0 0 one. That's way higher. So you're thinking a lot about attributes which is part of this. But what about circumstance so like, what? What is that fine dining restaurant going through to like, even have the problem? In the first place, what is specific about the struggle that they're going through that, you know. You can help them make progress.

193
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.960
Kevin: You can. Do you want to spitball a, a, an answer, or

194
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:36.360
Kevin: we can call back to you after we have everyone. Another frame. Yeah. Another frame of of reference for this, as you all have used and probably know, is bottom up as opposed to top down

195
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:46.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a lot of thoughts I hear from how people are thinking of screening things is, you think, from the top big market, and you work your way down to something narrow. start with one person.

196
00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:57.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What are they going through? What's their deal? Describe them, and then go. Okay, is there another person like this? Maybe maybe not. I don't know. But at least you know that one person type a specific circumstance.

197
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:58.260
Lilliana Robinson: Yes.

198
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.919
Lilliana Robinson: so. or were we

199
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:30.359
Lilliana Robinson: right here? So once you know your who intimately, you can identify every attribute of what makes that? Who a perfect customer. So once you've validated your theory of your who this is, how you expand. You'll have that really narrow one. You're gonna validate it through customer discovery. And then you can make a list of attributes and situations that this narrow segment is in. And you can. The book explains how you can test each of those attributes for that 1, 5, 10 people

200
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:52.740
Lilliana Robinson: and expand your base outward with a high success rate. So if you decide, it's fine dining restaurants who are in this very specific circumstance, maybe it's also fast casual restaurants who are in this very specific circumstance. Maybe it's something different about the circumstance that makes them a prime customer, but when you can pinpoint that. Then you can start expanding outward into bigger and bigger markets. Does that make sense

201
00:35:53.060 --> 00:36:01.530
Lilliana Robinson: cool? So most people wonder at this point, like, yeah, no problem. Most people wonder at this point. What's the difference between this and Jtb.

202
00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:21.239
Lilliana Robinson: while they're both related to starting with that narrow group of customers. W. 3 is a theory about your business. And then Jtb, DI call the tool to verify that. So we're making these theories. Then we've chosen our screening criteria to go out and validate it, and part of the learning questions in your head should be, is my theory for what my initial customer segment

203
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:26.459
Lilliana Robinson: is correct. and you can validate that through these interviews that you are doing.

204
00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:43.019
Lilliana Robinson: and if you do it well, something magical happens. So if you can identify your W. One properly, it will directly inform your product roadmap and your financial model in a very predictable way. So again, we're after that predictability. You are sure that you know, like.

205
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:58.179
Lilliana Robinson: I will pull this lever, and a hundred percent of these people will buy. You can that can inform your financial model and a product roadmap. Because now you know who you're selling to, what their situation exactly is, and you don't have to guess. So you can start building for those people and make even more sales.

206
00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:18.790
Lilliana Robinson: Here's my first example. Bloomfilter is a company from our summer 2022 class in Chicago, and they're a software engineering management. Platform. Think Jira and they thought when they came in and they were sitting in this workshop, they thought that they were selling to Ctos of medium to large corporations.

207
00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:36.539
Lilliana Robinson: So through understanding W. 3, they actually realized, and then, after validating it with jumps to be them, they discovered that their W. One back in 2022 was actually chief innovation officers of companies with 50 to 200 employees who had recently

208
00:37:36.550 --> 00:38:05.629
Lilliana Robinson: experienced a slowdown in software engineering due to like an error in organization, so either they missed a bug or like a project didn't get off its feet. They had a list of dilemmas but one. They were talking to the wrong person, which I'll get into later 2. They had a different size of company. They actually needed to scale much smaller and 3. It was that circumstance. So when they realized that they could target people who had recently had this issue, their sales skyrocketed.

209
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.259
Lilliana Robinson: So they started targeting a different audience. After this

210
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:25.979
Lilliana Robinson: another side note for 2 sided marketplaces, which I know we have a a couple of 2 sided marketplaces have 2. Who's 2 w ones. So first focus on the one that gives you money, and then you can go back later and do this exercise with your team to do the other half.

211
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:45.349
Lilliana Robinson: So. David, I will take your question while everyone else starts writing their who. So go ahead and take 3 min. Define your who as narrowly and specifically as possible. Write down all the known attributes you believe are in your who, so that you can go test them. So known attributes, scenarios that they're in circumstances that they've had.

212
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.070
Lilliana Robinson: David, how can I help?

213
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:53.330
David Akinyemi (he/him): Maybe this exercise might be the answer to my question, but it was like, I really like how

214
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.740
David Akinyemi (he/him): you went from those ctos to like

215
00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:06.809
David Akinyemi (he/him): it was almost like, you know, exactly who you're looking for. I was hoping you would share more about that process. But I think the 6 exercises.

216
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:33.989
Lilliana Robinson: Well, if you wanna know about Bloom filter. Specifically, they made that hypothesis, and they were selling to Ctos, and they knew it wasn't working. So they actually made a hypothesis in this workshop. Maybe it's cios, and they only change that. So then they had to validate that in jobs they started to talk into Cios, and through that they heard someone say something about like, You know, if this is at my last company. I would need it, or something like that I can't remember. Maybe Neil can remember. But there was a statement made.

217
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:53.660
Lilliana Robinson: and that gave them the hint. Maybe we need to skew smaller. So then they started talking to CIOS. At smaller companies. And then they realized that there were companies who had these dilemmas happening, and those people were the ones that had this like burning problem. And so it was a lot of iteration and validation through talking to actual customers based on a hypothesis that they make like right now.

218
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:54.909
Lilliana Robinson: does that make sense?

219
00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:57.879
David Akinyemi (he/him): Yeah, thank you.

220
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.970
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, a little less than 2 min left.

221
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:28.830
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I'm gonna pick on Kevin since we said we would circle back. Did you come up with oh, is he still here? We'll give them a second.

222
00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.050
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. In the meantime, does anybody want to share their W. One.

223
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.089
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): Okay, if nobody else does. Yeah. Go ahead. Mutex.

224
00:41:40.370 --> 00:42:03.749
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): Sure. So okay, narrow it down. Professional musicians who are trying to make more money from music. So that they can focus more on their art and worry less about survival. They typically play a lot of gigs, but they don't make a lot of money from them. They are either buskers or gig musicians or diy concert organizers that you know work with a small band.

225
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:15.499
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): They typically don't have merch, but they thought about getting it and never took the step. And they want to level up their career, but usually don't have a manager representative yet at the major label, or anything like that

226
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:35.350
Lilliana Robinson: that was extremely specific. I really like that. The in the very beginning there was something that could be more specific. Can you read the first few lines again? Just the beginning. Oh, yeah, the first one. Actually the first one was reused from the first time from the first time that I tried musicians who are trying to make more money from music so they can focus more on their heart and worry less about survival.

227
00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:56.199
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So trying to make more money for the music, it's like, I was originally gonna say, what does that mean? But I see that you expanded upon it. Cause you explained, they're either busking. They're doing like they don't have a manager. So those things are extremely specific. Do you see how they're also circumstantial? They're also like about a set of scenarios that the person is in, so that person could be like

228
00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:07.479
Lilliana Robinson: any gender they could be from anywhere that could be any age, that it's not demographic, and that will help you so much. So I really liked that example. That was a really good job.

229
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:09.340
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): Yay, thank you.

230
00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:22.000
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, so we'll move forward, and I'll pick more examples for the next 2. But let's talk about W. 2. What do I believe my customer is buying from me?

231
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:35.090
Lilliana Robinson: So I heard someone at the beginning who had read this before saying, like the difference between what they are buying versus what they are selling. This is a very important distinction. The customer actually doesn't care what you're selling.

232
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:37.980
Lilliana Robinson: They care what you do for them.

233
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:52.009
Lilliana Robinson: So the difference here is actually the job, which is exactly what Neil and I talked to you about last week. So you're gonna lead with how the product impacts their life from their eyes. Not what you believe you're selling.

234
00:43:52.080 --> 00:44:03.130
Lilliana Robinson: So this is the same thing as the quarter inch drill versus the quarter inch hole in the wall, which is exactly what we said. My favorite example of this is, when you go to get a haircut.

235
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:13.039
Lilliana Robinson: The person is selling a haircut. If you ask any hair stylus, what they sell is cutting your hair, you know you get shorter hair. Maybe you can do a different hairdo. But

236
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:20.480
Lilliana Robinson: what are you buying like you? Personally, I'm asking you guys, what are each of you buying when you go to get a haircut

237
00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:28.319
Lilliana Robinson: I haven't in. I have an answer for what is the most common, but everyone has their own. So what are you buying when you go get your haircut, Malcolm.

238
00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:41.189
Malc - Xsauce: you buying that that confidence, that crispy look? Yeah, you head into the weekend none better than Friday evening. Haircut. Are you ready. Yeah, that's exactly right. Confidence all the way, Nelson, what are you buying?

239
00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:56.750
Nelson Mitchell: Yeah, exactly exactly what he said. I always get my hair cut like before a big event or an important something like I could look like a shaggy dog, you know, working from home. But I know when I go out, and I have to present myself along with my best

240
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.660
Bob Van Dell: convenience for everyone but me, but

241
00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:09.340
Bob Van Dell: I shaved my head myself, and that's convenient. But back when I didn't.

242
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.960
Bob Van Dell: I didn't have what to take, or the tools, or the know how.

243
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:14.870
Lilliana Robinson: So that's true.

244
00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:25.189
Lilliana Robinson: So that's another thing. We're buying with most services. Right? You're buying convenience, because, like a lot of them, we could spend a long time learning, but not everyone wants to invest that time. Marcel.

245
00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.450
Marisel Polanco: Change

246
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.250
Marisel Polanco: looking to

247
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.089
Marisel Polanco: looking for a change

248
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:39.509
Lilliana Robinson: in just adding, I've heard a lot of that. A lot of people get breakup haircuts, you know. Gotta change your life.

249
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:40.730
Lilliana Robinson: Jayla.

250
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:49.020
Jennifer Loh: also just feeling pampered like getting a blow out and really feeling like it's the service

251
00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:56.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: on that a bit more. What do you mean by that? Pampered toward it. To what end? To what extent?

252
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:09.399
Jennifer Loh: Yeah, like, Alex, it's all care. It's like you go to get your hair cut, but it's like getting your hair washed and the feeling of having someone wash your hair and like, really like pampering you. It's a certain it's like the feeling of

253
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:10.660
Jennifer Loh: being

254
00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:23.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: yeah self care. I guess I want to dig a little deeper there, because I'm not. I'm not convinced that it's it's at that level like that. What you're describing is what you're getting. But what are you seeking through that?

255
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.740
Jennifer Loh: Like a feeling of relaxation.

256
00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:39.520
Jennifer Loh: Hmm! It's almost like cause getting a haircut is almost like getting a massage, you know, like you, it's like a a break from reality. It's like having someone.

257
00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:45.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It doesn't come out of nowhere, though, like what are the causal influences to like seeking that out.

258
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:55.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Do you just decide one day like, I just need to get pampered. I just need that or the things going on in your life that would trigger you wanting to do something.

259
00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.340
Jennifer Loh: Yeah.

260
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:13.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Think through. You gotta think through the other level you can't just go. It's this feeling that I want. It's why do you want the feeling? And you keep unpacking those layers? Maybe something was going on in your life where you decided that you wanted to treat yourself.

261
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But what will that? What is that thing going on?

262
00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.920
Lilliana Robinson: That's what we need to all start thinking more about.

263
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.940
Jennifer Loh: Exactly. I love it.

264
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:28.590
Lilliana Robinson: So Jeremy, Dan and Antonio go ahead and throw what you're buying in the chat because I'm watching the times we're gonna have to move forward. But

265
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:55.420
Lilliana Robinson: those were great. So my favorite thing is confidence. So like, that's that's what I had heard the most times when I asked. And that's personally what I like to go and get a haircut form. But basically, if you are a hairstylist, you're not marketing that confidence. If you don't know this kind of thing. So that's a really simple example of what we're trying to get at. The also isn't always concrete. And sometimes it's more than one thing. So that's kind of what J. Lo was saying and what Neil was trying to get at.

266
00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:07.279
Lilliana Robinson: It's not always concrete. It's not always just a one word like this is what I'm buying, sometimes more nebulous, and you have to try and like pinpoint that because humans are very fickle and hard to describe, very complex.

267
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.209
Lilliana Robinson: And sometimes it's more than one thing, meaning that

268
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:25.229
Lilliana Robinson: you could have 2 groups of people that you know have 2 different W. Two's, and maybe they're related. Maybe they're not. Maybe one person is buying it for 2 different reasons. That's actually what we call in jobs to be done, a small hire and a big hire. So there's always one reason that trumps the other.

269
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:52.390
Lilliana Robinson: Also your W. 2 can help inform your W. One. So if you're who is right, you'll have data that shows your who cares about your what? But if you're facing problems, figuring out your what you should probably go back to your. So everything builds on each other. So if you're building it on an unstable foundation, you're gonna sense problems as we start moving up, and you can always go back and readdress the bottom layers. So with that, let's take 3 min.

270
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.159
Lilliana Robinson: Write about your what?

271
00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:17.089
Lilliana Robinson: Think about your what in context of what you do for your customer, not just what you do, but what you do for them. Write down a few theories of what you believe. Your W. 2 is what you believe your customer is going to buy or is buying from you and lead with how the product is going to impact your customers lives rather than any amazing features you've built that you would like to sell to them.

272
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:25.519
Lilliana Robinson: So it's a lot more empathizing and taking a step back from how much we love, what we're building and believe in it, and put yourself in the context of them.

273
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.989
Lilliana Robinson: Jeremy, do you have a question.

274
00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.509
Jeremy Banning: you know. Sorry II left my hand raised.

275
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.180
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, 3 min

276
00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:42.629
Lilliana Robinson: given through your product. For example@business.com. Amos gives a great example. He used to be involved with business.com, and

277
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:48.020
Lilliana Robinson: they are doing lead Gen. Selling insights into competitors products. This is in like 2,000.

278
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:57.390
Lilliana Robinson: They measure, or their their why is that they want to collect insights into competitors products to get additional revenue.

279
00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:24.459
Lilliana Robinson: They measure that value as additional revenue brought in by each of the leads when they convert to sales. So just knowing that the person is buying insights to the competitors products, and that would they want those to be revenue doesn't matter as much as knowing exactly how they measure it. So for B. Twob, it's really it's really straightforward. If it's revenue that they want, how are they measuring that revenue so like this is not com, was specifically measuring.

280
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:40.550
Lilliana Robinson: Their customers were specifically measuring business. Dot Com's value that they were providing to their company as the additional revenue that was brought in by each of the leads from the software platform as they converted to sales, so they were able to tweak their product to do those things to them.

281
00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:47.039
Lilliana Robinson: increase the amount of people that would see value from it. So it's a B 2 B example. It's a little more nebulous. But

282
00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:58.229
Lilliana Robinson: you can see how, if you don't show the customer that the value they want is something that your product can provide to their life. It means nothing to them.

283
00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:07.139
Lilliana Robinson: This is something that a lot of people don't understand exactly, because they may see their customer as less intelligent or less aware.

284
00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:17.170
Lilliana Robinson: But it's usually a problem on our end that we're not demonstrating the value in the way that the customer measures it, because they're never going to change the way that they measure or seek to see that value.

285
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.150
Lilliana Robinson: Another example could be

286
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:34.769
Lilliana Robinson: a workout app, or something that you're signing up for for fitness. If your fitness goals are different than the things that that app is willing to give you. For example, if you sign up and it's a weight loss app. But you're interested in being toned and gaining muscle.

287
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:46.989
Lilliana Robinson: even if they're helping you quote unquote, get more healthy. It's not in the way that you are interested. You're not showing that I'm fit in the in the way that I measure value. You have to meet me where I'm at. If I'm gonna be a customer

288
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:56.970
Lilliana Robinson: for B to B. There are 2 wise. This is huge. There's the business as a whole, and there's the decision maker as a person

289
00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:02.390
Lilliana Robinson: which is a lot more emotional social business as a whole, a lot more functional.

290
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:06.589
Lilliana Robinson: The second one is very important at the start.

291
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:19.719
Lilliana Robinson: If you can figure out how the decision maker as an actual human being measures the value you're bringing them. Then you can know their motivation and why they're saying yes to buying your product or service.

292
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:34.380
Lilliana Robinson: For example, back to business.com if the company measures value. So the business as a whole from your lead Gen. Software by the extra revenue it brings in. But the individual decision maker say the VP. Of sales.

293
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:48.060
Lilliana Robinson: If the individual decision maker has no incentive to surpass their individual revenue goals on a quarterly basis that they already consistently meet without your product. Then there's no motivation.

294
00:53:48.110 --> 00:54:16.000
Lilliana Robinson: So this actually happened to business.com. They realized they needed to go back and adjust their W. One from selling to Vp. Of sales to selling to Vp. Of sales who have an incentive program to surpass revenue goals to not only meet them, but to increase. So basically getting commission off of all of the extra revenue that they bring in based on the legit, that is how they found their niche because it was people who wanted to go above and beyond, and who were directly incentivized.

295
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:39.980
Lilliana Robinson: A lot of people passed up on their software because they said, we already hit it. We and I don't need to make any more, even though the business as a whole really wants to make extra revenue. So that's kind of that's how you can see the difference between the person and the business. People are a lot more self involved. They really only wanna do what they're directly incentivized to do, even if it's a no brainer for the business as a whole. And that's just a hard reality. Not everybody

296
00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:41.810
Lilliana Robinson: worked in the

297
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:50.960
Lilliana Robinson: in the same vein as just thinking about the business's future. We're all humans at art. So it's not even a bad thing to think about your customers. Matthew.

298
00:54:51.880 --> 00:55:00.200
Matthieu Bonnard: Sorry me again, yeah, this is super important for B, twob, and not to challenge that statement, but just wondering about data to support.

299
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:04.729
Matthieu Bonnard: that that the decision maker, as a person is

300
00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:08.350
Matthieu Bonnard: as equally important as the business as a whole.

301
00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:33.419
Lilliana Robinson: Only at this stage, and the the data behind. That is just if, like, just like Bloomfilter, if you're selling to the wrong decision maker, and you're not getting their Y. So you're they're selling to the wrong ones. So your W. One is wrong, or your W. 2 or 3 are wrong where you're not selling them the correct thing, or in the way that they measure their value. You're just gonna get a no. The hardest thing with B Twob is just getting in there. So that's why we say, when we're at this small

302
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:55.990
Lilliana Robinson: stage of company. The second one is the most important we're selling to a person we're selling to one decision maker. If you can't get past that decision maker. You're never gonna get in. So I've seen so many of my companies that are B 2 B just have these very long drawn out sales cycles that always end in. No, because they're just not getting that foot in the door. If you can capture that decision, maker, and they can be your champion.

303
00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:08.739
Lilliana Robinson: Of course, your product aligns with the value that you can bring to the business. It's a lot more. A lot of people get hung up on. I'm trying to sell it to the business. I'm gonna make them more money. Why do they keep saying? No.

304
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:20.019
Lilliana Robinson: that's why I like that business dotcom example. Of course it's a no brainer for for a Company X to hire business.com to give them lead. Gen. If they've shown consistently that it can bring in more revenue.

305
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:34.100
Lilliana Robinson: But the reason is, the problem is, when we have a startup, when businesscom was very small. they're selling to a person they're having to demonstrate to a single human being that they can provide that value, and that it's meaningful to them.

306
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:52.790
Lilliana Robinson: A lot of these execs do not operate only in the context of the business. I think it's hard to understand as an entrepreneur, because the CEO is the business right, like you live and breathe the business, and it almost seems synonymous. But in these, when we're doing enterprise and we're selling to medium to large businesses, it's a lot more disconnected.

307
00:56:52.870 --> 00:57:01.049
Lilliana Robinson: So that's why we have to think about the people as people. They're not extremely connected, emotionally, or even just like incentively with

308
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:26.200
Lilliana Robinson: the business's goals. They have their own personal goals. Their goals are usually to move up to get recognition within the company. To get be personally, financially incentivized as a bonus or something like that. They have their own personal goals. So just saying that we're going to bring the company more money is not enough, because there's usually a hassle. They have to go through to onboard to champion your business, to get it okayed with the with the higher ups, and they're not willing to do that. If there's not a personal goal.

309
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:42.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this becomes, yeah, this becomes more real in practice than on paper or conceptually. Once you start actively selling to businesses. You start to very quickly realize the human elements that are at play when it comes to different like decision makers and stakeholders throughout the hierarchy that you have to navigate.

310
00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:50.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's that's the journey that we're all gonna go on together, for some of you is like getting in there and actually trying to actively sell

311
00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:55.939
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like there's a variety of circumstances that have human interest elements to it. Even in the B 2 B stage.

312
00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:04.020
Lilliana Robinson: I think the people that understand that upfront are the most successful because a lot of people just treat businesses as businesses and not people

313
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.150
Lilliana Robinson: Kristy.

314
00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:13.639
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: So in in, I know we're experiencing this right now. With enterprise sales.

315
00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:26.370
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: do, are we gonna cover like stakeholder mapping? Because it it may not just be the decision maker. It could be an influencer. There could be someone else that we need to also understand.

316
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:30.569
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Their why and how we can fulfill that.

317
00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.559
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, Neil, did you? Wanna answered Betsey, called her mapping.

318
00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:45.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sorry II missed that one.

319
00:58:45.510 --> 00:59:03.510
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: I get this part, but I know with enterprise, especially with large large enterprises. There's this concept of stakeholder mapping, because it may not just be the decision maker, but leading up to decision makers, influencer. will you help us kind of navigate that. Or are we just gonna

320
00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:23.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of course. Yeah, I mean, we're that's like this whole program. All we're trying to do is help you all figure out the best place to sell and grow so stakeholder mapping is totally far for the course. We'll we'll call it different fancier things, I guess. And then on top of that, the eirs they're gonna be super hands on every week with you on top of myself. So yeah, we got you.

321
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.250
Lilliana Robinson: San Antonio.

322
00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:46.080
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So would this apply also to B, 2 B, 2 C, right, because we are B, 2 B, 2 C, and so the customers pay for the service. But ultimately we need to convince also business to say, we're gonna increase your custom. The number of customers you're gonna have because our service is cheaper, it's easier to use.

323
00:59:47.780 --> 01:00:12.680
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So I would say, you can split that in your mind into 2. So you have the B 2 B and the B to C, and so for the B Twob, where you're even though they're not your customers, you're still needing a yes from them. This would apply, and then the rest is the Y from the customer. So you have 2 as well, almost like a 2 sided marketplace. I would treat it like that, and you have to go through and do W. 3 for both. And this would be true for the businesses that you need that. Okay from.

324
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:21.509
Lilliana Robinson: So you need to feel free to adjust your W. One and 2, as you think about your W. 3. So just like Bloom filter had to

325
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:28.709
Lilliana Robinson: go back and adjust their W. One, and just like business com, had to adjust what they were selling, and exactly to who

326
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:42.919
Lilliana Robinson: they had to change the situation in their W. One. As you're thinking about your W. 3, all 3 theories need to be in alignment. So if you're finding trouble definitely, go back and revisit the first 2 that you wrote, and also remember that you need to go out and test these. So

327
01:00:42.920 --> 01:01:01.659
Lilliana Robinson: everything that you have on your paper after today or on your note stock. Those are all speculation. I just can't hammer that home enough. Do not think that just because we wrote it, and maybe you have a lot of confidence and conviction in what you have written. It's still really important to talk to the customers, to validate the assumptions that we're making today.

328
01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:03.390
Lilliana Robinson: So let's take 3 min.

329
01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:12.580
Lilliana Robinson: Write down your theory on the why question how you believe your customers will measure them, and how you can assure you, have the right tools to measure it on your end.

330
01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:16.189
Lilliana Robinson: Okay? Something. I wanna highlight here before we share is that there's a key line here, which is, how can you ensure you have the tools to measure it?

331
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:17.960
Lilliana Robinson: Why is that important?

332
01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:41.210
Lilliana Robinson: Think back, if you've ever received an email from maybe something you signed up for where they before you even wonder or think about cancelling. They consistently report back to you at either how much money they're saving you, how much they've done for you giving you these reports. It could be a rewards program that you signed up for or like credit card. And they tell you like. You've earned X

333
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:51.440
Lilliana Robinson: in rewards this month, or maybe you signed up for something a service so that they could do something for you, and they've helped you with X number of things this month or this year.

334
01:04:51.440 --> 01:05:00.920
Lilliana Robinson: basically giving you this report of how they know you measured value. And they want to demonstrate that value before you even question if they're giving it to you, understanding how

335
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:10.999
Lilliana Robinson: you, as their customer measures value, and then being able to report it back to you is so strong because it basically mitigates any sort of doubt in their mind, and they will never turn. That's why it's so

336
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:16.860
Lilliana Robinson: powerful to be able to have the right tools to measure value in the way your customer sees it.

337
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:32.029
Lilliana Robinson: and you can just show them like basecamp is a good example, they'll maybe show you. Oh, you've completed X. Projects like these are all the projects projects you've gotten done, and it's all listed in the archive. You feel really accomplished, and it feels amazing. And you're happy that you had basecamp to do it.

338
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:37.330
Lilliana Robinson: Does anyone want to share the W. 3 that they wrote down. We have time for maybe 2

339
01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:38.850
Lilliana Robinson: 2 examples

340
01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:47.069
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): always upfront. If nobody is. please go ahead and reach us.

341
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.430
Okay, cool?

342
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.690
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): So why?

343
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:59.669
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): Because they can see that the amount of work they put into their music careers does not reflect properly in their earnings. So it's not proportional

344
01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:14.559
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): they will measure Security's effectiveness in the amount of money they make out of it, and also in the way that other artists and fans feel about them. Example, do they think that the band is more legit because they have a store in merch.

345
01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:26.850
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): and we can measure it by building a really good dashboard. That shows how much money they made, how many new followers they got, and all the other benefits exactly what you were saying. I wrote that down like 10 s before you started saying that

346
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:49.820
Lilliana Robinson: I think that's really cool. So that is a great example of how this W. 3 exercise can directly inform your product roadmap. So I wouldn't go and invest time and money into building that until you've validated that by talking to customers. Cause. That's completely a theory right now. But if you validate that that is something that has helped people move the needle in the past. Or that's the problem. They really have

347
01:06:50.430 --> 01:07:17.439
Lilliana Robinson: building that out in your product roadmap can help you increase sales so much, because now you know exactly their circumstance and the value that they want, not only will it increase sales that'll decrease churn. So once you get those customers, you're demonstrating that value, and they won't stay. I really like that. That's a great idea on how to demonstrate the value from their eyes. You might not have thought that like showing that they're legit means anything that's not really what you were selling for. So I really like that? Mitch Nelson?

348
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.919
Nelson Mitchell: Yeah, the I've definitely been

349
01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.020
Nelson Mitchell: thinking for the W. 3 that you know, this is

350
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:41.059
Nelson Mitchell: this is a problem that people are trying to solve and so solving it as a 0 to one. But quantifying how solving the problem is, saving them time or money, or whatever is is an interesting thing to reflect back to people. So I think the stats are good. But

351
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:47.630
Nelson Mitchell: the idea of the rewards program really resonates with me, because I think that people are much

352
01:07:47.890 --> 01:08:07.289
Nelson Mitchell: more likely to value something that is, feels like a positive to them than they are to like value the opportunity cost like. Oh, II save this much by, you know, avoiding you know this, this penalty, or something. I'd I'd rather everybody would rather take the reward. And so this is something that I was

353
01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:18.289
Nelson Mitchell: batting around with. With some folks I was talking to, and I think it it just popped popped up the feature list as as being a great way to reinforce good behavior engagement.

354
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:38.260
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So another product roadmap that's being informed by this, I like that so much. So you can go, and you can validate that. You can talk to people who have hired similar products and see how that has changed their life, how they feel about it, or products that don't have that, and see why they fired them. And that's a good way to validate. If that's something that you should invest your time into building out.

355
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:46.179
Lilliana Robinson: I like that a lot. Thanks for everyone who has volunteered. We'll just close out, and then I'll stick around to answer all the questions in the chat.

356
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:47.149
Lilliana Robinson: So

357
01:08:47.260 --> 01:09:08.310
Lilliana Robinson: now that you have your W. 3, how can you go test it again? Broken record here jobs to be done, which is what we're currently doing. So that's why I moved up this workshop to today so that you guys could have all this knowledge in your head as you're going through this first set of work of interviews. So basically, we want you guys to go and do your interviews as soon as you have that screening criteria down, pat with Kate.

358
01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:15.740
Lilliana Robinson: and then on Friday of week one, we're gonna have. You guys do a check point presentation kind of saying how many you've done so far, and what you've learned.

359
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:25.010
Lilliana Robinson: Let's go through the jobs we done statement again. If you remember it's in the form when I so I want to, so that I

360
01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:36.390
Lilliana Robinson: I've taken the liberty to put the W. 3 on top of this, because it really melds perfectly. It's when I which is the who or the situation, and attributes the circumstance that the who is in

361
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:52.040
Lilliana Robinson: I want to? What are they buying? What are they hiring? What is the desire? So that I and that's why that's the outcome. That's the value. And then, on top of that you know in the back of your mind how they measure that value. But from the customer's perspective you can write those jobs to be done. Statements

362
01:09:52.210 --> 01:10:02.279
Lilliana Robinson: with the W. 3 in mind. And that's kind of how the 2 blend together. So that's just something that we've come up with here in our programs. But I think it works perfectly. So.

363
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:10.899
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you guys, this was awesome super fun. And I really appreciate everyone for all your participation. I'll stick around for questions. But we'll see you tomorrow.

364
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.350
Lilliana Robinson: Bye.
