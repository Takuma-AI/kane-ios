### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Neal Sáles-Griffin: This framework was in, in, created in part or in full by Amos Schwartz. Amos is the former managing director of Texar, the Austin.
- Neal Sáles-Griffin: But the framework that Amos came up with it's something based on and derived from his experience running these accelerators. And he basically learned that there's a very clear and important pattern to successful founders who go through tech accelerators.
- Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they're the ones who've mastered this framework that lilliana is about to teach, so I'll let her take it from here. But, as you can see if you notice at the bottom of this image that our very own Troy Hennikoff.

### Key Insights

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: But the framework that Amos came up with it's something based on and derived from his experience running these accelerators. And he basically learned that there's a very clear and important pattern to successful founders who go through tech accelerators."

> "Lilliana Robinson: Amos never mentions jobs to be done in his book. He's aware of it, but I think that these 2 actually go extremely well hand in hand. This is a separate framework, and it's a separate set of exercises that we're gonna do together. And you'll see how it goes. Really. Well."

> "Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, instead of like storytelling or selling a dream, you have an actual like set of information that you can tell for short. That's why it's important to validate the assumptions that we're making today with real experiments and real iteration and data so that you can foreshore. Say these things."

> "Lilliana Robinson: So as we go through, every single person who is on this call is going to do the exercise, because it's important that everyone from your team is able to articulate what it is your business does, and you might not get it right the first time when you go and test it, you might be completely off. And I have some stories that I'm gonna talk about."

> "Malc - Xsauce: yeah. That was great exercise as well. Had a really good conversation with Dan. And one of my key takeaways is just how I guess it's proximity to the problem. I kind of gonna be from agency perspective and also from a client perspective we just offer. We've really gotten to the nitty gritty around."
