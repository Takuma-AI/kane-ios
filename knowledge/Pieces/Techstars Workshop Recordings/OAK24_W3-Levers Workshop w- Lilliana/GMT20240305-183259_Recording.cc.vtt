WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yeah. And then I'm dealing with 2 displays. Screen sharing is paused.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Okay.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Lilian has that that really dope, Apple monitor. You'll know about that, the good one.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Yeah, but there's no Zoom.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Got the champagne problems going on over there.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yeah.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Okay.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Nancy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's see.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, in the meantime, I'll give some background about what this is. So, Levers is so you're gonna get a little bit more Chicago, but on top of that this framework was in and created in part or in full by Amos Schwartz, is the former managing director of Techstar often.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And he is a dear friend. He is somebody that when I joined Techstars I immediately gravitated to flew out of Austin and shadowed his program experience and his participated in multiple screening committees for him.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
He have run Pentex art programs. And has written multiple books. So he also wrote Cellmore Factor, which some people get copies of.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But the framework that Amos came up with is something based on and derived from his experience running these accelerators.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And he basically learned that there's a very clear and important pattern to successful founders who go through texts accelerators.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And they're the ones who've mastered this framework that Lilian is about to teach you.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So I'll let her take it from here, but as you can see if you notice at the bottom of this image that our very own Terri Hennecock.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Picture Chicago and D close friend. I told you a lot about Troy. Each is friendly to my one for us.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He also co-opered the book in a few sections too and I had the privilege of being one of the reviewers for the book was published during COVID.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Awesome, and thank you for the intro. So yeah, that's everything you need to know about the levers book and we're gonna talk about W 3 which is just the first chapter of 4 chapters and lovers so those are all the different quote unquote levers that you can pull for your business.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:41.000
They go into revenue, financial modeling, and a couple of other things like metrics, but this one is specifically about W 3 and this workshop is actually more than what it says in the book because I've taken it and changed it to meld perfectly with the stage that you're at with jobs to be done.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So Amos never mentions jobs to be done in his book. He's aware of it, but I think that these 2 actually go extremely well hand in hand.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
This is a separate framework and it's a separate set of exercises that we're going to do together and you'll see how it goes really well.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.000
They're not related at all, but if you do both, you're gonna come out with an extremely comprehensive understanding of your customer segment and their desires and what it exactly it is that you're selling.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So let's.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Right. And just to comment briefly, Lianna, the unique contribution that Lilian has made to this is that what she just said is that she took the job to be done framework.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And she learned that the W 3 framework that taught taught by Amos and and a lot of other programs adopted.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And she found a way to like kind of connect the 2 in a meaningful way. So this is I would say very unique perspective and content that like she kinda conjured.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So very, very valuable and impressive.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Thanks. So first is understanding that proving your W 3 is with data and experimentation equals reaching repeatability.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So the whole point of this that we're doing is to be able to. Reach what we call repeatability.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:11.000
That is ultimately the goal for a company that goes through our accelerators. So what does that mean? That means that you can pull lever A and you know for sure that B will happen.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Once you get to that point where your business is so predictable, we also call it predictability. Once you get there.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You'll know that putting X in gets Y out that makes you a fundable business that makes you a sustainable business and that's how you reach success.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So this is one method to getting you to that repeatability. What we mean when we say proving your W 3 with data and experiments, it means that everything that we're doing today in this workshop together is just a theory because we're just speculating.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You're gonna do some exercises. You're gonna speculate on a piece of paper. Or on your laptops.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
That means nothing until you go out and test it with data and experiments. Try it. See if it's correct.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Go back to the drawing board and iterate. Once you've tested it and you have data and you've done experiments and you've proven that your W 3 is correct and spot on.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
That's when you can know for sure. So we'll go into like how to test that with data.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
A little bit later, you know.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Yeah, the last thing I'll add here is regarding repeatability. I don't know if I already mentioned this in my background, but I worked at Mass Venture Partners with Troy.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I actually worked with him while I was at Techstars with a part-time venture partner. And I met with I don't know, call it a hundred companies probably more.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000
During that time and when I observed things getting to the partner level where we're making a decision whether to write a $500,000 check, a million dollar check or, you know, whatever.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Is We would essentially ask the founder to. Do exactly what's written right here is what experiment.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Signal the repeatable like metrics that you have or the repeatable kind of patterns that you would have to require customers.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So I'm trying to say is There's a very objective pathway to getting commitments from investor to great capital.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It's a very uncomfortable pathway because it actually requires you to demonstrate with data. That you have something that's worth investing in.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But is the absolute best way to raise capital because you know what the value of the company is and what it will become based on those levers.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:32.000
There's still assumptions and there's still some healthy like theoretical components to it. Because you don't know how it's actually gonna play out, but you have indicators that you're able to demonstrate.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
That could make the case for you to be at a certain both value and command a certain amount of capital from an investor.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So this is a more scientific framework. Then I think a lot of the games that are played in the venture capital.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:58.000
You know, art and practice that like founders become masters of and students of. We hover far more on the, the science than the dark art of.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Kind of manipulating information. So that you can, Vince, DCs the right you bid checks. That's not really what we're good at.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We're better at actually demonstrating it objectively

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Yeah, instead of like storytelling or selling a dream, you have an actual like set of information that you can tell for short.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:24.000
That's why it's important to validate the assumptions that we're making today. With real experiments in real iteration and data so that you can foreshore say these things.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So with that being said, we're gonna jump into some exercises, a series of exercises where we're going to theorize.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Your W 1, 2, and 3, and we'll work on it together. So as we go through every single person who is in on this call is going to do the exercise.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This is important that everyone from your team is able to articulate what it is your business does. And you might not get it right the first time.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
When you go and test it, you might be completely off. And I have some stories that I'm going to talk about.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Another thing for this workshop is that most of my examples are B 2 B. So a lot of people have asked for a lot of B to B examples and this framework runs itself extremely well to both BDC and B to B, whereas maybe at the beginning of John Street on it seems like we tend more be to see.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:18.000
This one is very easily applied. With very little like mental hoops to jump through. So I have some examples for you later.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So first, I want you guys to each take a piece of paper or a notes on your computer and write out who do you believe your customer is.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:57.000
What are they buying and why are they buying it? So I'm gonna give you 60 s. Just the first things that come to your head, go ahead and write it down.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Okay, that's the time. So. You guys can raise your hand or just unmute.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Was that too much time to little or just right?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's just right here.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Just right.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Just right. Yeah, just right.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Yeah, just right. Yeah, Kelvin. Okay, so the next thing I want you to write is how do you know?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Think about the data that you have, the opinions that you have, and also what you want to know that you don't know.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So basically how can you justify the things that you wrote before? Go ahead and take 90 s.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Okay, that was time. So again, was that too much time too little or just right?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Definitely.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I would have reversed the times with the previous question.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
That's right.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I was I would have reversed the times with the previous question.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Say it again. Okay, so too much time for this, too little time to write down what it is.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Definitely too much time for this. I was done in 10 Si was looking at my phone.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Does everyone agree? Yeah. Okay. Wow, okay, so this ideology.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Might feel tvs but that's the point so the point of this is to get into the nitty gritty like deep down so that you can better understand your roadmap for the next 13 weeks and beyond.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So remembering that this is all a theory and you're just taking this to test and go validate.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So everything you just wrote down is just speculation on our parts, right? So we're going to break up into groups of 2 companies.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:48.000
With each company going into the same breakout room. So everyone's gonna have a partner company. And what I want to happen, I'm gonna go through what's gonna happen and then I'm gonna put you in your breakout rooms and I'll give you prompts via the chat.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.000
So everyone's gonna go into assigned breakout rooms with another company and the CEOs if they're present, otherwise another co-founder can do it.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:10.000
The CEOs are gonna do this exercise and everyone else can follow along. So. We're going to have the first CEO explain to the second CEO their W 3 that they just wrote down their who went and won.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
The listening company should just write down what they're hearing and what questions they have. So they're the scribe so they should not talk.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The next 90 s we're gonna let that second company, that second CEO repeat back what they heard to the first CEO and share any questions they have with the first CEO.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:39.000
The first CEO shouldn't speak. They should just also absorb what the second company is saying back then we're gonna flip Now the second company, the second CEO is going to explain to the first founder, the first CEO.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000
What their W 3 is and the first company will just listen. And write it down and then they'll repeat back what they heard and share questions.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So we're gonna do that. So 4 sets of 90 s. So I'm gonna go ahead and have Chloe open up the breakout rooms and you guys will see your company name and you can go ahead and jump right in.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And I will give you a prompts in the chat with timing.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Is everyone able to find their breakout rooms?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I didn't get one. Yep.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Chloe, can you start inviting people if you can?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Yeah, you should be able to manually select the one with your company name, but I'll start assigning people.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Oh, thank you.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Oh, got it. I didn't know that. Sorry about that.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Just

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Okay, so yeah, okay, that makes sense. I thought it was just the CEOs being put into the rooms.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Nearly pick your company.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Yeah, me too.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I was like, now, to see who all the non CEOs are across code.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
No, no, you guys get to go in and do the exercise too. Just only one person sk gonna be able to talk.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Okay.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.000
So follow along. I'm gonna start the timer now. So go ahead and jump in.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So, Lilian, how do I select? I'm sorry, I'm lost here.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Yeah, they should be a breakout. There should be a breakout rooms tool at the bottom. Do you see where it says breakout rooms?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And then it'll say your name. It'll say your company name.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Oh, I see. Thank you. Gotcha. Thank you.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Okay, that's everybody.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Okay.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Oh, 10 day. Do you have?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Yeah.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
There we go.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Which is just us in the AI.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000
There's 1 min left for this first round.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Oh, Marian.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Okay.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Cly, can you call us the recording?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Okay.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
So what did you think? Was there anything that

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.000
You want to share? Does anybody want to, unmute and let us know how that felt?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Okay.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I want to say something it felt really easy to follow because we were allowed to take notes so I was able to we were almost You know, I'm a fast diaper, so I could almost type word for word what I was hearing.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
No.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
So I'm not sure if that was super productive but yeah it was also very well explained so

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Okay, we're in person. I normally make people use pen and paper so it's not as easy to just follow along but yeah I totally agree.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I usually you can kind of type it down. Welcome.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Yeah, I thought it was great exercise as well. Had a really good conversation with Dan. And, one of my key takeaways is just help.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I guess it's proximity to the problem. I kind of gonna being from agency perspective and also from a client perspective, you just offer, wouldn't really get into the nitty gritty around.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Yeah, how did you know some of the assumptions it was you could feel it was first hand you could feel like he was living and breathing the problem area so yeah it was really good to kind of here and break that down.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Oh wow, so yeah, sounds like you guys had some similarities and you were able to go even more into detail.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I'm curious if anyone and David I let you go 1 s. I'm curious if anybody found a difficulty or maybe like a barrier.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:22.000
In between explaining the problem. Maybe you are very close to the problem and you got someone that's not as close to problem and maybe it was a little bit difficult.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Yeah, Marcel and then Snow, we'll go back to David.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
That's okay.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Oh, I don't know if the answer to questions you just asked. But we were, we were both B to B to C.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I found it really interesting that we got mashed. And yes, it is answering your question. It is a challenge.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
When you have when you are BTV to see trying to explain who you're selling to. Cause it's a 2 way street here.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
So we found on those similarities and it was interesting talking to Jeremy.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Interesting. Okay, snow.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Yeah, I actually read the 3 parts of the levers yesterday. So I try to follow the guide.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:15.000
But actually, I, it doesn't that I try to explain what our customers buying instead of what we are selling.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
But in the meantime, the meanwhile, but it makes the listeners difficult to understand what our product is.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I'm not sure which one is better. Yeah.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah, we're gonna get into that with W 2 and then I want you to tell me at the end if maybe it still seems unclear.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
David, did you wanna go?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Yeah, mine is. Kinda different, but I was just kinda your first question, but it was around.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:53.000
We kind of had very similar businesses kind of in a way to the point where we spoke to partner and partner was like I've actually experienced a problem you're trying to solve.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And I wish this existed a year ago kind of thing. And so. I think because of that we Almost like knew exactly what the other person was trying to build because the same space so interesting, maybe on purpose.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Curious to see what opposite would be like.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
That's really cool. Yeah, I'm curious too. It's interesting that we kind of randomly did that.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So a lot of you ended up with people that understood. That's interesting. Christy?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Yeah, it was interesting to, Just pay attention to when you're explaining it like acronyms, right, or certain phrases that you think you know or is common in your industry, but for the other person, your audience, they may not be familiar.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.000
So always be mindful of that. And then also, at least the way when I was explaining what you know the 3 why the 3 W's.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:57.000
I was kinda generalizing it and that I was trying to make it a simple but then it didn't get to the heart of like what is the actual thing that we provide to get to that benefit.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Yeah, it's hard, right? Cause you want them to truly understand what your business is. So you can't dumb it down too much, but when there's not that inherent knowledge.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
In that space, it's a little bit difficult. But we'll meet a lot of people that aren't from that space that you still need to explain it to like advisors, investors, etc.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.000
So it's definitely hard. Antonio?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:43.000
So one observation is, the first question I didn't know where, to put the customers, like kind of the vision that we have for the customer, which is consumer products versus the the first customer switches where we're targeted targeting to and and so I decided in the end to use our first customers the ones that we are doing the, job to be done interviews for.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And actually it was nice to see that we have a lot of clarity on that. Now we're try to validate our assumptions.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:01.000
With these interviews so at least it was nice to see that we have some clarity we have some clarity who we are targeting.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And the other observation I had is that when the last question around how do you know like the first thing that popped up to my mind was our competitors are making familiar in ARR.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And so like the fact that there is already a market for it, but we can do it better. give, give me some solid things, but I think I'm gonna feel much better when I see those 1015 interviews.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And try to learn from that.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Yeah, well, there were so many good nuggets in there. So, yes. Having competitors in the space already making money is absolutely a validation.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
A lot of people think it's the other way around, but we want to see that interest in that market.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:58.000
So completely agree there and also you I'm so glad you brought up the point should I be tackling like my giant vision for the market or the first few customers we're gonna get into that today but you chose absolutely correctly because those first customers are the ones that we're focusing on at this moment.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
It's almost like the big vision doesn't exist at this time. We're all about that first segment.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
That's really what today is about. So, 100%, Antonio, Matthew.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Hey, yeah, I thought it was very interesting exercise and to me kind of eye opening. To hear the questions and the way I read it like if there are questions to clarify whether how why and what .

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000
It means we haven't nailed it And so we need to do that so that we use this like.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000
30 s to make it like crystal clear on this 3 W's to whoever. We're talking to.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:56.000
That's exactly right, Matthew. And I have a slide for that. If you can't articulate your W 3 in 3 min which is how long we gave each of you how can you grab someone's attention in much less time so this was a controlled environment but imagine being an environment like a networking event or you meet an investor in an elevator you know the age old principal of an elevator pitch you have much less time

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:15.000
to grab someone's attention 15 to 20 s so we need to have you guys locked down extremely crispy, concise, and clear, able to articulate it in a very fast but also potent manner so that you can grab people's attention and have them extremely understand it in an extremely deep way in a very short amount of time.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
So that I know that's exactly what you're getting at, Matthew. Pardo.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Yeah, it was kinda echo what David mentioned earlier, what. We're basically within the same umbrella, but different categories of issues that we're trying to solve under that massive umbrella within the vintage space and they're they detailed it enough they were articulate enough that it was so succinct yet detailed enough that I was able to by the end when they finished to know like I could have definitely used

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:53.000
something like you guys you know a year and a half back. During all the crazy hectic market craziness so yeah that was our experience.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
That's awesome. Okay, kudos to David and his team. That's really great to hear.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Philippa?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Well, yeah, one thing that I noticed in myself was like who do I believe my customer is and it's like retailers and it's like okay that's fine but it's very, you know, you know and many people say like banks that some team here.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:30.000
I say like Duane say banks or credit companies I think we have to narrow that now finally to who in the company like product managers or category managers or e-commerce managers or whoever.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
I think that's, that's the customer. Find out, you know, the person, than the company.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Exactly, and we'll narrow that down right now. So let's jump into W one.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.000
So now we're gonna get into each. So you guys made your hypotheses. Let's try and narrow those down and I'll teach you about each one.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
So first we have.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Side note, which is until you have data, you shouldn't go, too far in any one direction.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:09.000
So Amos in his book talks about being lost in the middle of nowhere and if you're lost if you just get dropped in the middle of the desert, you don't you're not just gonna pick one direction at random and head there because you have a lot to lose if that direction is wrong.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:23.000
You're gonna die of thirst. You're not gonna make it. So instead what like most people would do is start looking for clues, look for signposts, try to collect additional information along the way to prove whether or not you're headed in the right direction.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
That way you can make your best judgment and give up like all the energy you have left into trying to find.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Than a nearby city and refuge. So the same is true here. I really like that story because You should picture yourselves as that person when we're making a startup, we're really dropped in a desert like there's no roadmap, you're making it up as you go.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:48.000
I'm sure all of you feel that way. And you don't have the resources to just choose the wrong direction.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
We want to make sure that we're making the best guess before we go too far in any one direction.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000
And that's really what the point here is that this is going to help you better inform what direction to put all your resources behind.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Another side note is that everyone on your team needs to understand and believe in your W 3. So I got at this at the beginning a little bit, but even though the CEOs were the ones doing the exercise.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:24.000
And even though only some of your team members are here in the workshop today, once you've gotten your W 3 down pat, it's really important that everybody in your company can thoroughly understand and believe in your companies.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000
The amount of times I've seen someone get a key strategic investor or a very key mentor, board member.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Advisor from a member of their team who is not a leader who is not maybe even C-suite, but because they understood the vision and we're able to articulate it has been very plentiful.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
So I've seen that a lot of times. It's not just always going to be the CEO or COO.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Getting those key connections. It's really anyone and as many team members as you have that can better articulate it that's more people out in the world making these connections for you and it's less missed opportunities.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
So make sure that everybody on your team is able to articulate the W 3 that you decide on. So that you can grab every.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Opportunity that comes you way. So with that, let's go into W one. Who do I believe is my customer?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
So this is your first of the W. Threes. And this is your first theory on the direction you want to go into.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:33.000
So at full scale, like Antonio is saying, this is your total addressable market. This is your vision for your entire customer segment at full scale but for now We're gonna start narrow.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
So this is not your end goal. So if you set your W one is something extremely small, which is what we want.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:46.000
That doesn't mean that you're gonna have a small business. That means that you're capturing that market right now and we will slowly expand out.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:29:03.000
This should be uncomfortable. So even if your W one segment is point 0 0 1% of the entire market that you eventually want to get you'll have the absolute confidence that each of those people is meant to be in your targeted audience that you can make a sale with those people.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
So just keep in mind this is not where you're ending. It's just where you're starting so that you can get a really deep understanding of all the attributes and circumstances of your ideal customer.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And there's no such thing as too narrow. My favorite part of this presentation that I like to bring in because I studied this in engineering school as the diffusion of innovation.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:31.000
So the for those who haven't seen this before, some people call it the innovators curve, or the diffusion of innovation or the curve of adoption.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000
This is how people adopt a new technology. So there are many different things that people call it, but it's always the same segments.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
So we have innovators and then early doctors. Then we have the chasm. If I anyone's ever heard the book crossing the chasm, it's referencing this.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Then we have the early majority. Late majority and laggards. So I always start off by saying the laggards we want to just basically pretend don't exist.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000
That's for people like Google who are now getting the 80 year old people in the nursing home to use Google.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
So that's like the last bit of the market that people will ever be able to capture.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Yes. I did. I spoke to her and then.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
What we want to focus on. Is not just the innovators, but. The very, very, very small original block of the innovators.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:25.000
And if I was on the in person on the board, I would point out literally just the black line that that arrow is pointing at.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
So not even the likely block, just a little black line, the point 0 0 1% of innovators.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:36.000
That is what we want to start with. Because if we start with those adopters, we get it spot on.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
It's very easy to expand those concentric circles out and just make that market bigger and bigger.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:31:01.000
And I have some examples. Later that I'll talk about. So the goal is that with a hundred percent confidence you could sell to every person that you put in that W one The important note here is that I said every single person in this criteria that you talk to in a sales context would result in the sale.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.000
So I don't want to conflate that with jobs to be done. So when you're doing your customer discovery, you're not trying to sell them.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:25.000
But the idea is that once you do your customer discovery, your screening criteria is who you're going to talk to to get those insights and through those insights you will validate your W one and that W one segment which may or may not overlap with your screening criteria, your W one segment.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
If you go and talk to each of them in a sales context, would a hundred percent result in a sale because you just know that their situation is exactly right.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:38.000
To have your product come and help them make progress in their life. Does that make sense? Does anybody have any questions there?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Cause that's a really important distinction.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Okay, so moving.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Oh, sorry.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Good question. In the in the division. Diffusion of innovation. You said that the focus really should be is it between the early adopters and the that those first 2 blocks.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Right. Just.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Got it.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
No, it should be so we're focusing on the innovators that 2.5 like nobody here is past the innovator stage.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Okay.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
We know each of your companies a lot of us think that we're way further. That's good news though because that means you have huge markets to capture.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
But we're all in the innovators stage and we're not even in the 2.5% of your total market that you could get.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
We're focusing and if you are trying to capture that right now I'm asking you to narrow it so that you can be more accurate.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
You're not going to be able to scale as much if you don't have this extreme accuracy.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000
So we're not even focusing on the 2.5%. We're focusing on less than 1%.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000
So we're at the very, very beginning of the curve. That's why I say like even just like the left hand black line of the innovators block.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:58.000
That 2.5%. We're focusing on like point 0 0 1%. Very small with extreme accuracy and specificity and then we'll expand out very quickly.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Good question, Jeremy. Brian?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Yeah, thanks.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
I'm just wondering, I'm just trying to make sure that I've covered this.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Is it safe to then say that We're trying to get a monopoly in a very small market.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
It's capitalistic. Okay.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Yeah. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. In a very, very small and you can be the winner in that, even if there's a competitor, like you know this is where you can start and get that niche.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And then you can expand outward and jobs to be done is to help you validate that. Good question.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Kevin?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Yeah, hi, Oliver. So the, We're like if you were to give an example of this.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:46.000
For instance, like we've narrowed ours down to let's say the fine dining industry with fine dining restaurants.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:58.000
How could we even, what would be an example where we could get that even further? It'd be like a specific like type of Find dining restaurant like how because that's that's a small niche in the market, but it still is probably higher than that point 0 0 1%.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
That you're looking to get to. Yeah.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Yeah, that's way higher. So you're thinking a lot about attributes, which is part of this, but what about circumstance?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:15.000
So like what is that find dining restaurant going through? To like even have the problem in the first place.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
What is specific about the struggle that they're going through that you know you can help them make progress.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Okay.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Do you do you want to spit ball out? An answer? We can call back to you after we have everyone write their W ones.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Okay, cool.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Yeah, sure. Yeah. That yeah, let me just take a minute to.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Another frame, another frame of reference for this as you all have used and probably know is bottom up as opposed to top down.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000
A lot of thoughts I hear from how people are thinking of screening things is you think from the top big market and you work your way down to something narrow.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Start with one person. What are they going through? What's their deal? Describe them and then go, okay, is there another person like this?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. But at least you know that one person's hyper specific step from stance.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Yes. So wherever we. Right here. So once you know your who intimately.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000
You can identify every attribute of what makes that who a perfect customer. So once you've validated your theory of your who, this is how you expand.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
You'll have that really narrow one. You're gonna validate it through customer discovery and then you can make a list of attributes and situations that this narrow segment is in.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:34.000
And you can the book explains how you can test each of those attributes. For that 1, 5, 10 people and expand your base outward with a high success rate.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:43.000
So if you just decide it's fine dining restaurants who are in this very specific circumstance. Maybe it's also fast casual restaurants who are in this very specific circumstance.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Maybe it's something different about the circumstance that makes them a prime customer, but when you can pinpoint that, then you can start expanding outward.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Into bigger and bigger markets. Does does that make sense? Cool. So most people wonder at this point, like, yeah, no problem.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Completely. Yeah. Thank you.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Most people wonder at this point, what's the difference between this and JTVD? Well, they're both related to starting with that narrow group of customers.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:11.000
W 3 is a theory about your business and then JTVD I call the tool to verify that.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:22.000
So we're making these theories then we've chosen our screening criteria to go out and validate it and part of the learning questions in your head should be is my theory for what my initial customer segment.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Is correct. And you can validate that through these interviews that you're doing. And if you do it well, something magical happens.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000
So if you can identify your W one properly, it will directly inform your product roadmap. And your financial model in a very predictable way.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:47.000
So again, we're after that predictability. You are sure that you know like I would pull this lever and a hundred percent of these people will buy.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:37:00.000
You can that can inform your financial model and your product roadmap because now you know who you're selling to what their situation exactly is and you don't have to guess so you can start building for those people and make even more sales.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Here's my first example. Loom filter is a company from our summer, 2,022 class in Chicago.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:20.000
And there are software engineering management platform. Thank Jira. And they thought when they came in and they were sitting in this workshop, they thought that they were selling to CTOs of medium to large.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
So through understanding W 3, they actually realized and then after validating it with jumps to be them.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:44.000
They discovered that their W one back in 2022 was actually chief innovation officers of companies with 50 to 200 employees who had recently experienced a slowdown in software engineering due to like an error in organization.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
So either they missed a bug or, like a project didn't get off its feet.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
They had a list of dilemmas, but one they were talking to the wrong person, which I'll get into later.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:00.000
To they had a different size of company. They actually needed to scale much smaller. And 3, it was that circumstance.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000
So when they realized that they could target people who had recently had this issue. Their sales skyrocketed.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:19.000
So they started targeting a different audience. After this. Another side note for 2 sided marketplaces, which I know we have a couple of, 2 sided marketplaces have 2 who's.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000
2 W ones. So first focus on the one that gives you money and then you can go back later and do this exercise with your team to do the other half.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Okay, so, David, I will take your question while everyone else starts writing their who. So go ahead and take 3 min, define your who as narrowly and specifically as possible.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Write down all the known attributes you believe are in your who. So that you can go test them.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000
So known attributes, scenarios that they're in, circumstances that they've had. David, how can I help?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Maybe this exercise might be. To answer my question, but it was like, I really like how. You went from those CTOs to like It was almost like you know exactly who you're looking for.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:07.000
I was hoping you would share more about that process, but I think this exercises this going to.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Yeah, well, if you want to know about, specifically, they made that hypothesis and they were selling to CTOs and they knew it wasn't working.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
So they actually made a hypothesis in this workshop, maybe it's CIOs and they only change that.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:32.000
So then they had to validate that in jobs freedom. They started talking to CIOs and through that they heard someone say something about like, you know, if this was at my last company, I would need it or something like that.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
That's

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
I can't remember. Maybe Neil can remember, but there was a statement made. And that gave them the hint.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Maybe we need to skew smaller. So when they started talking to CIOs at smaller companies and then they realized that there were companies who had these dilemmas happening and those people were the ones that had this like burning problem.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:55.000
And so it was a lot of iteration and validation through talking to actual customers. Based on a hypothesis that they make like right now.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Does that make sense?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Yeah. Thank you.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Okay, a little less than 2 min left.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Okay, I'm gonna pick on Kevin since we said we would circle back Did you come up with?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Oh, is he still here? We'll give him a second. Okay, in the meantime, does anybody want to share their W one?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Okay, if nobody else does

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Yeah, go ahead, Mitcha.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Sure. So, okay, narrow it down. Professional musicians who are trying to make more money from music so that they can focus more on their art and worry less about survival.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
They typically play a lot of gigs, but they don't make a lot of money from them.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.000
They are either buskers or gig musicians or DIY concert organizers that you know work with a small band.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
They typically don't have merch, but they thought about getting it and never took the step.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:17.000
And they want to level up their career but usually don't have a manager representative yet. At the major label or anything like that.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000
That was extremely specific. I really like that. In the very beginning there was something that could be more specific.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Can you read the first few lines? Again, just the beginning.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
I could tell.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Oh yeah, the first one actually the first one was reused for the first time from the first time that I tried which was professional musicians who are trying to make more money from music so they can focus more on their art and worry less about survival.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Yeah, so trying to make more money for the music. It's like I was originally gonna say what does that mean but I see that you expanded upon it because you explained they're either busking they're doing like they don't have a manager so those things are extremely specific.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Do you see how they're also circumstantial? They're also like about a set of scenarios that the person is in.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:05.000
So that person could be like any gender, they could be from anywhere, they could be any age, that it's not demographic and that will help you so much.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
So I really liked that example. That was a really good job.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Yeah, thank you.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Okay, so we'll move forward and I'll pick more examples for the next 2.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:31.000
But let's talk about W 2. What do I believe my customer is buying from me? So I heard someone at the beginning who had read this before saying like the difference between what they are buying versus what they are selling.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:39.000
This is a very important distinction. The customer actually doesn't care what you're selling. They care what you do for them.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:46.000
So the difference here is actually the job, which is exactly what Nail and I talked to you about last week.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000
So you're gonna lead with how the product impacts their life from their eyes, not what you believe you're selling.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:00.000
So this is the same thing as the quarter in drill versus the quarter inch hole in the wall, which is exactly what we said.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000
My favorite example of this is when you go to get a haircut. The person is selling a haircut.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:14.000
If you ask any hair stylist with this cell, it's cutting your hair. You know, you get shorter hair, maybe you can do a different hairdo, but What are you buying?

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Like you personally, I'm asking you guys, what are each of you buying when you go to get a hair cut?

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:33.000
I have an I have an answer for what is the most common, but everyone has their own. So what are you buying when you go get your haircut, Malcolm?

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Yes.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
You find that confidence that crispy look, you know, you heading to the weekend, none better than Friday evening haircut. Are you ready?

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Yeah.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:48.000
That's exactly I feel the same like confidence all the way. Nelson, what are you buying?

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Yep.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Yeah, exactly. Exactly what he said. I always get my haircut like before a big event or an important meeting or something like that could look like a shaggy dog, you know, working from home, but.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
I know when I go out and I have to present myself, I want my best.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Exactly.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Convenience for everyone but me but it's cause I shave my head myself and that's convenient, but back when I didn't.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
I didn't have what to take or the tools or the know-how. So the service.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:25.000
That's true. Says another thing we're buying with most services, right? You're buying, because like a lot of them we could spend a long time learning, but not everyone wants to invest that time.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Marcel.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Change.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Change. Looking to. Looking for a change.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.000
In just adding I've heard a lot of that. A lot of people get breakup haircuts, you know, gotta change your life.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Hello.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Hmm.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Also just feeling pampered. Like getting a blow out and really feeling like. It's the service, you know?

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Hmm. So you're

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Would expand on that a bit more. What do you mean by that? Like pampered to what, to what extent?

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Yeah, like, said health care. It's like. You go to get your hair cut, but it's like getting your hair washed and the feeling of having someone wash your hair and like really like pampering you it's a it's like the feeling of being.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Yeah, self care, I guess.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
See you, Brian.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
I wanna dig a little deeper there because I'm not, I'm not convinced that it's at that level.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Like that what you're describing is what you're getting, but what are you seeking through that?

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Yeah.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
And then that the

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Like a feeling of relaxation. It's almost like, cause getting a haircut is almost like getting a massage, you know, like you, it's like a a break from reality.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
And it's like having someone. Yeah, provide you with something that you.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Yeah It doesn't come out of nowhere though. Like what are the causal influences to like seeking that out?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Hmm.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Do you just decide one day? Like I just need to get pampered. I just need that or the things going on in your life that would trigger you wanting to do so.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Hmm.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Yeah. I think it kind of goes.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
That's what we're trying to get you all to think through. You gotta think through the other level.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
You can't just go, it's this feeling that I want. It why do you want the feeling?

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Right.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
And you keep unpacking those layers. Maybe something was going on in your life where you decided that you wanted to treat yourself.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Hmm.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000
But what will that what is that thing going on? That's what we need to all the time thinking more about.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
I love it.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Exactly. So Jeremy, Dan and Antonio, go ahead and throw what you're buying in the chat because I'm watching the time so we're gonna have to move forward but.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Those were great. So my favorite thing is confidence. So like that's that's what I had heard the most times when I asked and that's personally why I like to go and get a haircut for.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000
But basically if you are a hairstylist, you're not marketing that confidence if you don't know this kind of thing.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So that's a really simple example of what we're trying to get at. The W 2 also isn't always concrete and sometimes it's more than one thing.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:57.000
That's kind of what Jala was saying and what Neil was trying to get at. It's not always concrete.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:08.000
It's not always just a one word like this is what I'm buying. Sometimes more nebulous and you have to try and like pinpoint that because humans are very fickle and hard to describe, very complex.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:18.000
And sometimes it's more than one thing, meaning that. You could have 2 groups of people that, you know, have 2 different W two's and maybe they're related, maybe they're not.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Maybe one person is buying it for 2 different reasons. That's actually what we call in jobs to be done a small hire and a big hire.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:31.000
There's always one reason that trumps the other. Also, your W 2 can help inform your W one.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:48.000
So if you're who is right, you'll have data that shows your who cares about your what but if you're facing problems figuring out your what you should probably go back to your W one so everything builds on each other so if you're building it on an unstable foundation you're gonna sense problems as we start moving up.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000
And you can always go back and reddress the bottom layers. So with that, let's take 3 min.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Right about your what? Think about your what in context of what you do for your customer, not just what you do, but what you do for them.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Write down a few theories of what you believe your W 2 is, what you believe your customer is going to buy or is buying from you and lead with how the product is going to impact your customers lives.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Rather than any amazing features you've built that you would like to sell to them. So it's a lot more empathizing and taking a step back from how much we love what we're building and believing it and put yourself in the context of them.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Jeremy, do you have a question?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
You know, sorry, I left my head raised from the last. Okay.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Oh, you're good. Okay, 3 min.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:39.000
How can you demonstrate to the customer that that value is being given through your product. For example, at business.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Dot com, Amos gives a great example. He used to be involved with business.com and They are doing lead gen, selling insights into competitors products.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:59.000
This is in like, 2,000. They measure or their their why is that they want to collect insights into competitors products to get additional revenue.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:13.000
They measure that value as additional revenue brought in by each of the leads when they convert to sales. So just knowing that the person is buying into the competitors products and that would they want those to be revenue?

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Doesn't matter as much as knowing exactly how they measure it. Doesn't matter as much as knowing exactly how they measure it.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
So for B to B, it's really, it's really straightforward. If it's revenue that they want, how are they measure it?

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
So for B 2 B, it's really, it's really straightforward. If it's revenue that they want, how are they measuring that revenue?

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
So like this is not come with specifically measuring their customers were specifically measuring business.com value that they were providing to their company.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:38.000
As the additional revenue that was brought in by each of the leads from the software platform as they converted to sales.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
So they were able to tweak their product. To do those things to them. The amount of people that would see value from it.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:52.000
So it's a BDB example. It's a little more nebulous, but You can see how if you don't.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Show the customer that the value they want is something that your product can provide to their life. It means nothing to them.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:09.000
This is something that a lot of people don't understand exactly because they may see their customer as less intelligent or less aware.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
But it's usually a problem on our end that we're not demonstrating the value in the way that the customer measures it.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Because they're never gonna change the way that they measure or seek to see that value. Another example could be a workout app or something that you're signing up for for fitness.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:36.000
If your fitness goals are different than the things that that app is willing to. Give you. For example, if you sign up and it's a weight loss app, but you're interested in being toned and gaining muscle.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Even if they're helping you quote unquote get more healthy. It's not in the way that you are interested.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:49.000
You're not showing that I'm fit in the in the way that I measure value. You have to meet me where I'm at if I'm going to be a customer.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.000
For B 2 B, there are 2 W. This is huge. There's the business as a whole.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:05.000
And there's the decision maker as a person. Which is a lot more emotional, social. Business as a whole a lot more functional.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:17.000
The second one is very important at the start. If you can figure out how the decision maker as an actual human being measures the value you're bringing them, then you can know their motivation.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:24.000
And why they're saying yes to buying your product or service. For example, back to business.com.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:31.000
If the company measures value, so the business as a whole from your lead gen software by the extra revenue it brings in.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:50.000
But the individual decision maker, say the VP of sales. If the individual decision maker has no incentive to surpass their individual revenue goals on a quarterly basis, that they already consistently meet without your product, then there's no motivation.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.000
So this actually happens to business.com. They realize they needed to go back and adjust their W one.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:07.000
To from selling to VP of sales. To selling to VP of sales who have an incentive program to surpass revenue goals to not only meet them, but to increase.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000
So basically getting commission off of all of the extra revenue that they bring in based on the, that is how they found their niche because it was people who wanted to go above and beyond and who wanted to go above and beyond and who were directly incentivized.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:21.000
A lot of people who wanted to go above and beyond and who were directly incentivized. A lot of people passed up on their software because they said we already hit it.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000
We and I don't need to make anymore. Even though the business as a whole really wants to make extra revenue.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
So that's kind of, that's how you can see the difference between the person and the business.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:39.000
People are a lot more self involved. They really only want to do what they're directing and said to vice to do, even if it's a no brainer for the business as a whole.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
And that's just a hard reality. Not everybody works in the in the same vein as just thinking about the business future.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000
We're all humans at art. It's not even a bad thing to think about your customers.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Matthew?

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Sorry me again, yeah, this is super important for B twob and not to challenge that statement, but just wondering if our data to support.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Not that the decision maker as a person is. As equally important as the business as a whole. Why?

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Only at this stage and the day behind that is just if like just like bloom filter if you're selling to the wrong decision maker and you're not getting there why so you're they're selling to the wrong one so your W one is wrong or your W 2 or 3 are wrong where you're not selling them the correct thing or in the way that they measure their value, you're just gonna get a know.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000
The hardest thing with B to B is just getting in there. So that's why we say when we're at this small.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Stage of company. The second one is the most important. We're selling to a person. We're selling to one decision maker.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:54.000
If you can't get past that decision maker, you're never going to get in. So I've seen so many of my companies that are B 2 B just have these very long drawn-out sales cycles that always end in nose because they're just not getting that foot in the door.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:02.000
If you can capture that decision-maker and they can be your champion, you Of course your product aligns with the value that you can bring to the business.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000
It's a lot more a lot of people get hung up on. I'm trying to sell it to the business.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000
I'm gonna make them more money. Why did they keep saying no? That's why I like that business.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Dot com example. Of course it's a no-brainer for a company X to hire business.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Calm to give them lead gen if they've shown consistently that it can bring in more revenue. But the reason is the problem is when we have a startup, when business.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Dot com was very small. They're selling to a person. They're having to demonstrate to a single human being that they can provide that value and that it's meaningful to them.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:45.000
A lot of these execs do not operate only in the context of the business. I think it's hard to understand as an entrepreneur because the CEO is the business, right?

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Like you live in breathe the business and it almost seems synonymous. But in these, when we're doing enterprise and we're selling to medium to large businesses.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:57.000
It's a lot more disconnected. That's why we have to think about the people as people.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:06.000
They're not extremely connected emotionally or even just like incentively with the businesses goals. They have their own personal goals.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Their goals are usually to move up to get recognition within the company. To be personally financially incentivized as a bonus or something like that.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000
They have their own personal goals. So just saying that we're going to bring the company more money is not enough.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Cause they're usually a hassle they have to go through to onboard to champion your business to get it okayed with the with the higher ups and they're not willing to do that if there's not a personal goal.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Does that make sense back?

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:44.000
This becomes, yeah, this becomes more real in practice than on paper or conceptually. Once you start actively selling to businesses, you start to very quickly realize the human elements that are at play when it comes to different like decision makers and stakeholders throughout the hierarchy that you have to navigate.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:52.000
So, that's the journey that we're all gonna go on together for some of you is like getting in there and actually trying to actively sell.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Like there's a variety of circumstances that have human interest elements to it even in the B 2 B stage.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:06.000
People that understand that upfront are the most successful because a lot of people just treat businesses as businesses and not people.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Christy?

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:16.000
So in, I know, works for this right now. With enterprise sales

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Do are we gonna cover like stakeholder mapping? Cause it may not just be the decision maker.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:38.000
It could be an influencer. There could be someone else that we need to also understand. Their why and how we can fulfill that.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Yeah, no, did you wanna answer about?

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Sorry, I missed that one. What was can you restate it Christy?

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Yep.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Okay. Yeah, so I get this part, but I know with enterprise, especially with large large enterprises, there's this concept of stakeholder mapping because it may not just go to the decision maker but leading up the decision maker there's influencer that never sponsors.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Will you help us kind of navigate that or are we just gonna Just focus.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Oh, of course, yeah. I mean, that's like this whole program. All we're trying to do is help you all figure out the best place to sell and grow.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000
So stakeholder mapping is totally par for the course. We'll call it different fancier things, I guess.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:24.000
And then on top of that, the ER is they're going to be super hands on every week with you on top of myself.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000
So yeah, we got.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000
San Antonio.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:46.000
So would this apply also to B 2 B to C right because we are B twobc and so the customers pay for the service but ultimately we need to convince also business to say we're going to increase your customer the number of customers you're gonna have because our service is cheaper.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
It's easier to use.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Yeah, so I would say you can split that in your mind into 2 so you have the B 2 B and the BBC.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
And so for the B 2 B where you're even though they're not your customers, you're still needing a yes from them.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:07.000
This would apply and then the rest is the Y from the customer. So you have 2 as well. Almost like a 2 sided marketplace.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I would treat it like that and you have to go through and do W 3 for both and this would be true for the businesses that you need that okay from.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000
So you need to feel free to adjust your W one and 2 as you think about your W 3. So just like Bloomfield had to Go back and adjust their W one and just like business.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Calm had to adjust what they were selling and exactly to who. They had to change the situation in their W one.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:41.000
As you're thinking about your W 3, all 3 theories need to be in alignment. So if you're finding trouble, definitely go back and revisit the first 2 that you wrote.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And also remember that you need to go out and test these. So everything that you have on your paper after today or on your notes stock, those are all speculation.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I just can't hammer that home enough. Do not think that just because we wrote it and maybe you have.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:03.000
A lot of confidence and conviction in what you have written. It's still really important to talk to the customers, to validate the assumptions that we're making to them.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:33.000
So let's take 3 min. Write down your theory on the why question, how you believe your customers will measure them and how you can assure you have the right tools to measure it on your end.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Okay. Something I wanna highlight here before we share is that There's a key line here, which is.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:30.000
How can you ensure you have the tools to measure it? Why is that important? Think back if you've ever received an email from maybe something you signed up for where they before you even wonder or think about canceling, they consistently report back to you at either how much money they're saving you, how much they've done for you.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Giving you these reports. It could be a rewards program that you signed up for or like credit card and they tell you like you've earned X.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
In rewards this month or maybe you signed up for something a service so that they could do something for you and they have helped you with X number of things this month or this year.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Basically giving you this report of how they know you measure value and they want to demonstrate that value before you.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Then question if they're giving it to you. You as their customer measures value and then being able to report it back to you is so strong because it basically mitigates any sort of doubt in their mind and they will never turn.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:19.000
That's why it's so powerful to be able to have the right tools to measure value in the way your customers sees it.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
You can just show them like base camp is a good example. They'll maybe show you, oh, you've completed X projects.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Like these are all the projects you've gotten done and it's all listed in the archive.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
You feel really accomplished and it feels amazing and you're happy that you had base camp to do it.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Does anyone want to share the W 3 that they wrote down? We have time for maybe 2. 2 examples.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Always up for it if nobody is. Again, going to Monopolies. Okay, cool.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Yeah, go ahead.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:00.000
So why? Because they can see that the amount of work they put into their music careers does not reflect properly in their earnings.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So it's not proportional. They will measure Cicada's effectiveness in the amount of money they make out of it and also in the way that other artists and fans feel about them.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Example, do they think that the band is more legit because they have a store and merch? And we can measure it by building a really good dashboard that shows how much money they made and how many new followers they got and all the other benefits exactly what you were saying I wrote that down like 10 s before you started saying that.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I think that's really cool. So that is a great example of how this W 3 exercise can directly inform your product roadmap.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So I wouldn't go in invest. Time and money into building that until you've validated that by talking to customers because that's completely a theory right now.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:52.000
But if you validate that, that is something that has helped people move the needle in the past or that's the problem they really have.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Building that out in your product roadmap can help you increase sales so much because now you know exactly their circumstance and the value that they want.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Not only will it increase sales, that'll decrease churn. So once you get those customers you're demonstrating that value and they want to stay.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I really like that. That's a great idea on how to demonstrate the value from their eyes. You might not have thought that like showing that they're legit means anything.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000
That's not really what you were selling. For so I really like that, Nelson.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Yeah, the, I've definitely been thinking for the W 3 that you know this is This is a problem that people are trying to solve and so solving it is a 0 to one but quantifying how solving the problem, the saving them time or money or whatever is an interesting thing to reflect back to people.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So I think the stats are good. But, The idea of the rewards program really resonates with me because I think that people are much more likely to value something that is feels like a positive to them than they are to like value the opportunity cost like oh I save this much by you know avoiding you know this penalty or something I'd rather Everybody would rather take the reward.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
And so. This is something that I was batting around with. With some folks I was talking to and I think it just pops.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Popped up the feature list as being a great way to reinforce a good behavior.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Yeah, so another product roadmap that's being informed by this. I like that so much.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:34.000
So you can go and you can validate that. You can talk to people who have hired similar products and see how that has changed their life, how they feel about it, or products that don't have that and see why they fired them.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And that's a good way to validate if that's something that you should invest. Your time into building out.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I like that a lot. Thanks for everyone who has volunteered. We'll just close out and then I'll stick around to answer all the questions in the chat.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
So now that you have your W 3, how can you go test it? Again, broken record here, jobs to be done.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Which is what we're currently doing. So that's why I moved up this workshop to today so that you guys could have all of this knowledge in your head as you're going through this first set of work of interviews.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So basically we want you guys to go and do your interviews. As soon as you have that screening criteria down pat with Kate.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And then on Friday of week one, we're gonna have you guys do a checkpoint presentation kind of saying how many you've done so far and what you've learned.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Let's go through the Jobsuit on statement again. If you remember, it's in the form when I So I want to so that I.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I've taken the liberty to put the W 3 on top of this because it really melds perfectly.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It's when I, which is the who or the situation and attributes, the circumstance that the who is in.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I want to. What are they buying? What are they hiring? What is the desire?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
So that I and that's why that's the outcome. That's the value. And then on top of that, you know in the back of your mind how they measure that.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:58.000
But from the customers perspective, you can write those jobs sweetheart statements. With the W 3 in mind and that's kind of how the 2 blend together.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000
So that's just something that we've come up with here in our programs, but I think it works perfectly.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So. Thank you guys. This was awesome. Super fun and I really appreciate everyone for all your participation.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I'll stick around for questions
