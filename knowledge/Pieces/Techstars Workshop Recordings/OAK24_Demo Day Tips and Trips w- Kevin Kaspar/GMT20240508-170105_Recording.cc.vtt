WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I think 1st rule of a 1st rule of demo day tips in pitch and practices to be on time to get the You know, get the, get the juice.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alright, alright, let me start recording.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Okay, everybody, we're gonna jump right in to use every single minute. We have Kevin Casper here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He was at the farm.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Kevin has been on our team for 2 programs, I think, right? And then after that, as a Yeah, in Chicago.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yeah.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And then after that as a pitch specialist for many programs after that, so he has come back to help and the reason that we have Kevin back so often is because he has won more pitch competitions than anyone I know.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So he knows so much about pitching. We met when he came into undergrad and was really interested in entrepreneurship.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:48.000
He made his own startup inferno guard, which I think he might talk about when he talks about pitching.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Yeah, just about.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And worked on that for all of college. So. There's an end to that story here. I'll let Kevin tell it, but Kevin has won over what half a mill in pitch competitions and Yeah, and that's just free money.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And always comes back to teach our founders the tips and tricks on how he does it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Okay.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So this is perfect because last Kevin, we introduced demo day and pitching and so they've all started iterating on their pitches.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Perfect.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Thanks.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So today is perfect. So all of your tips, stuff they can implement.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Perfect. Okay, Neil.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
How, how much is venture cat worth? How much was that? 100. Yeah, 160 K.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I think it's $160,000 when I put they might have, a little. Yeah.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Cause I judge that one, right? Yeah, I remember that. So I was a part of the like that 500 K for 160 K of it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That was when I Okay, I didn't I knew you but I didn't really know you that well.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Yeah.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And so it was mostly like older teams with like. You know, sophisticated presentations and plans or whatever.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Yeah.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And then Kevin shows up, you were what a sophomore, I think. Yeah, he was like you know, barely an adult and he stepped in there.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And it was like not even a question like as the judges we looked around and we were like okay well clearly this guy's gonna win.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So it was like, yeah, like he has a way of like kind of commanding the room and knowing exactly what he's there to do and to say that I think everybody here could learn from and appreciate.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So half a million pitch prizes ain't no Trump chain.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Well, thanks now. I appreciate it. Alright, cool. So I'm, I'm just gonna share a presentation with you guys that I've been using for the past few times.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I've helped. Other cohorts out please like jump in with any questions at any time that's the best way to do it for sure just like I need or whatever But I'll go through it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I, check in with the Leon and everyone about the format. So, similar to what I'm used to.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So I'm just gonna share my screen. And then we can go from there.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Can I run see this? Hopefully. Cool. Alright, cool.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Yeah.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Great. So, Lilian already talked about me, but I've worked to tech stars for a while.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I run a company called Inferno Guard that I've been working on all throughout high school.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It's about wildfire detection and notification, so pretty timely out in the Bay Area.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm actually moving out to the bay after I graduate. So excited to be out there and stay connected with the entrepreneurship ecosystem.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But I'm still connected with the entrepreneurship ecosystem. But I'm still at Northwestern.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I'm a senior. I have like a month left of school. But I have been to at least 2 or 3 demo days, maybe more.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So definitely I'm comfortable with the format and, helping you guys out as much as possible.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
At the end of the like presentation, I'll leave my email, my phone number, by LinkedIn, whatever.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Just like, please feel free to reach out, text your email, whatever is easiest. I'm more than happy to help out, however I can.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But, alright, so for my understanding, the format is 60 second elevator pitch, 60 second, demo.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And then, oh, 4 min QA, not 6 min. Liliana gave that to me earlier, but

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I think the most important thing to talk about early on is that like all the whole story arc must be fluid across all sections of the pitch.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I think that one misconception that a lot of people have when they're presenting for demo day is that the 60 second pitch and the demo and the QA are very separate from one another, but really you want to be able to tell a story across all 3 components of the pitch to make it seem like all of those are flowing really well between one another.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So you can do that in a lot of different ways, right? You can kind of have like a lot of different ways, right?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:35.000
You can kind of have like a story arc, you can. Book end the beginning to the end create a very memorable moment but there has to be a way for you to be able to streamline what you're trying to say and even though they might fall under different buckets of the demo, the QA, whatever, you want to be able to kind of.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Visualize what that storyline might look like and It's really going to be different for every founder and for every company.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Especially with tech stars with so many different industries. So I think one thing that's important to keep in mind is like that you will have a very different storyline from someone else and that's totally okay.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But you guys know your company best and we'll be able to make those decisions on your own.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:18.000
But one thing I like to recommend is thinking about it very visually. So, I've worked with like a graphic designer in the past who literally will nap out the storyline, the positive moments, the negative moments, the moments that there are drama or, like concern or negativity.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And you wanna just be able to visualize what that actually could look like, for your pitch and for your product.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And I think that now is a great time to be able to actually start thinking about things like that because you are in the earlier stages and of your demo days coming up.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Right at the end of May, so, you still definitely have time to do this. But when you're going through all of it, I definitely would think about how the storyline actually will look.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And one piece of advice that I always like to give that my dad actually gave to me when I was younger is like you have to teach.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Everything that you're trying to explain like your 10 years old basically, because People really consume information at a very basic level, especially when they're listening to pitch after pitch after pitch.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And I think it's really important that you're able to synthesize all of your earnings into a very easy.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Tangible digestible. Way of communicating. I almost like to think of it like a funnel.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
There's probably a million things that you wanna say or that you could say because you've been working on your business.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So diligently throughout tech stars, but there's going to be like one specific narrative that will come out of it at the end.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:39.000
That I think is really important to keep in mind. Assume that your audience. Knows absolutely nothing about what you're building.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I think that's really important. A lot of times when you're building a product, There are things that are you you have that are almost assumed where you're like, oh, I know I would assume that, you know, they know how the app works or how the user interface looks or how to download it or things like that.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But I think it's good to just assume that you literally know nothing. And then the goal is to walk out excited.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I think if you can pay attention for 8 min straight and have someone Yeah, I'm excited to.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You know, get on your website, talk to you afterwards, have a conversation with you. That's all that you can really ask for.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So I think the responsibility is definitely on you as a founder and not as the listener to be able to make that information digestible.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So it really is. Important that when you're developing your pitch, you kind of do the hard work for the listener.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
You explain things that need to be explained. A little bit more clearly. You dumb down the information so that everyone can understand it.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
You create you know recurring themes in the pitch so that people can understand all 8 min of it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So definitely keep that in mind as you are going out and presenting. And I think this relates to something that's really important.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:03.000
About the amount of like education or teaching that you might have to do and this will vary from every company that is here today, but.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:12.000
There is a certain amount of information that any audience members just will not know about. Your product, your company, your vision.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And you have to think very critically about how much teaching or education you actually have to do. And I think oftentimes Founders will think that they have to over explain or over communicate when I think in reality, you can just be very specific about what you communicate and very, intentional about what you communicate.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And I think it's important to also think about like where this information should go. So oftentimes I like to do all a lot of my teaching upfront.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So I'll usually lead with some sort of story or some sort of Okay. Should we, just check in the chat?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Should we avoid jargon where possible? I definitely think so. Because the pitch is so short, I think that it's really important to just create a vision that anyone can understand and oftentimes like there is a certain amount of jargon that just creates some complexity there.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And that kind of relates to this like this teaching piece too, right? Is that, there might be something that you have to teach the audience.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Maybe it's about maybe you have to teach them about the problem and that's not as clear or maybe you have to teach them about what the users are saying and like your jobs to be done conversations, what you've learned there.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So I think there's definitely different ways or amount of teaching that you're going to have to do, but I think that it is important that you do it somewhat in the beginning because That's when you have the audience's most.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Attentive like Okay, focus on you, but that strikes a little bit of a challenge as well, right?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Because if you're trying to teach the audience a lot of information very early on, you might lose them with any of the complexity.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Which kind of goes back to the point of you have to be able to communicate. This in a very seamless.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And digestible way. So just think about that. You don't have to communicate any of these like main learnings or teachings early on, but.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Just be thoughtful about it. Yeah, what's up?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Hey, Kevin, thanks for this. Just curious, is there, talk about teaching, is there Is there, I don't know, best in class way or do you have a thoughtful approach to balancing the emotional side of versus just dropping numbers?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Cause I've seen obviously like that can be really powerful introduction. Just curious, in your opinion, how you approach that.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Yeah. So I might give a cop out answer, but I think ideally it's both. Ideally it's an emotional story that you can weave in.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Statistics throughout that that doesn't feel forced but i always think that telling a story that might be more emotional is always more engaging for a general audience member, maybe less so an investor per se, but for people that are trying, people that are trying to get broad attention from I think being able to tell a very coherent story that might be more on the emotional appeal can help.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But again, you do want to be able to make sure that. You not only give one specific example, right, but then are able to zoom out and think about the broader landscape, especially when you're talking about the problem.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So ideally I would try and have a little bit of a blend if you can. And then yeah, like you don't have to do all your teaching upfront.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
You can always, Do some in the QA, right? They might say, oh, what's your business model?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And then you explain your pricing there and why you decided to do that. The QA is actually a great time to do a lot of that because they're specifically asking you questions that they want to learn more about.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Another thing that I think, is really important as well is like staying consistent with your tone as a founder and like who you personally are.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I think a lot of times what makes your company so special and so recognizable are the founders and the founding team and the CEO.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And I just don't want any of the like, founders to lose that when they're pitching.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I think oftentimes people will kind of suppress their personality or suppress their. Just like kind of ways of communicating because it is a pitch.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And there's obviously a balance that you need to strike between being professional and kind of like communicating very authentically.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
But a pitch really should feel like a conversation. It should feel like something your. You could do like on the couch hanging out and having a conversation as much as on a stage presenting to hundreds of people.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So Like definitely own the type of founder that you are, like an example of this. And that Neil was talking about was like when I was pitching at one of these competitions, I would always just wear a suit and tie.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I don't know why, but I just really would. And like other people show up and they're like founder t-shirts or whatever and like, I think that's pretty common out in the bay to like have a load with your company and present in that.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I just like kind of thought because I was young I wanted to present myself in a very professional way and that's just what I did and I think that it has worked out for me in the past.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So I'm not saying dresses the most important thing. I'm just saying that, being able to communicate yourself more authentically is really important.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So don't lose sight of that when you're trying to develop your pitch.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And then I think one of the biggest challenges that people have when they're pitching really is taking advice from other people and getting that sort of feedback.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:38.000
A lot of times implicitly, we're really willing to listen to feedback and consume feedback. So If I gave you feedback or anyone else gave you feedback, you would think about.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:47.000
You know, how that applies and if you would want to implement or not. I think ultimately you have to be confident in the pitch that you're developing for yourself.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:00.000
But I do think getting advice is really important. And I think there's kind of a method to this madness of the balance of writing a pitch yourself versus getting pitch feedback and kind of knowing when you're at a point that you're happy with the pitch.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And my biggest advice is get a high quantity of advice all at once. So I'm sure by now there are trusted mentors that you have or people like Lilian or Neil.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
In your kind of community that can give you pitch feedback. But I would try and do it.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
At a very high volume in a short amount of time because then you can see the patterns much more clearly.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
If you get pitch advice from someone on Tuesday and then a week from Tuesday. You're gonna kind of not be able to identify the patterns as quickly.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So, I am kind of surprised that oftentimes people do have similar feedback if you talk to enough people and that really helps you understand what actually needs to be changed and what is more of like a like investor preference or a mentor preference because a lot of times they will like not force their own preferences on you but give you advice that is very specific to the way they like to do things which at times

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000
could be really helpful but again this is your pitch and your decision so you should feel confident you know. Giving the pitch how you want.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So definitely get a high quantity of advice at once and then like I would iterate multiple times. And I think one misconception here is that It's the advisor or the mentor's job to iterate the pitch.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It really is like the onus is on you for sure to be the one taking those iterations and being proactive if you want secondary advice from someone and you just iterated the product like go ahead make that pitch again and then give it to the, the mentor again.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
But there comes a point where feedback is only so helpful. So at some point, you do have to finalize your pitch and kind of stay grounded in what you've built.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:55.000
A lot of the pitches that have gone poorly for me have been when I've tried changing my pitch the night before or 2 nights before or even 3 or 4 nights before and I think just having like that mental reassurance that your pitch is it finalized it's exactly where you want it to be.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.000
4 days to a week out really is essential. Because I think you're just going to be way more anxious, nervous.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Like lack the confidence if you are changing things last minute. And I've seen this before with tech stars founders as well.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So I think it's really, really important to have your pitch finalized multiple days before. And that you feel confident about it.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So that's kind of more of just like my broad advice for each of these like for the pitch as a whole, but I'm gonna go into.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
The each component some areas I feel like I have more knowledge on than others trans apparently I think the demo is where I have the least amount of knowledge.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:45.000
But I'm just gonna kind of share my experience and what I think will be helpful. But does anyone have questions about what I said before just broadly.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Maybe there are questions that you're wrestling with in your pitch. Happy to answer them now or we can just keep moving whatever works best

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Alright, well I'll keep going.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Hey, Gavin, sorry, Lasco. Just curious, what's your mental prep look like?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
You mentioned a week out, like, I know everyone can be different, but, like, what's your prep look like?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
How do you do?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Yeah, I think something that's really important is actually presenting the information out loud in front of other people.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And recording yourself. I honestly think recording yourself is the most important thing. I've learned so much about how I pitch, how I walk on stage, what my tics are when I say, when I am lacking confidence, all from recording myself.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000
So I think it's really important that you record yourself. You don't need to be on a big stage to like mimic what that's going to be like.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:53.000
But I think it's really important that you do record yourself and then also everyone has their own way like my co-founders like to record themselves and put it in their ears when they're like walking to and from places like to record themselves and put it in their ears when they're like walking to and from places.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I like to just practice it a certain amount of like time per day. I also think it's important to get comfortable with the visuals behind you, like, whether you'll have them or not, I think.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Correct me if I'm wrong. Typically, usually there's only one type of visual plus the demo.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
That gets shown, but I think it's really important to be like comfortable with those as well.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000
So I would just do everything you can to replicate what will actually happen. At the time of the presentation and it's likely that you'll have some sort of dry run through the morning of as well.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And I think that if you are confident with your pitch and what you've created shouldn't be a big adjustment.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.000
You know, the comfort of your apartment if you were talking to multiple people. And just presenting in front of anyone and everyone, you can get your hands on.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000
So yeah, I think just having conversations with people's most important thing. But, moving into the elevator pitch.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I think it's really hard to

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Communicate everything that you want in a very short amount of time and 60 seconds transparently is a pretty short amount of time but it forces you to really synthesize the most important information that you want to tell and One way that I like to think about this is the 60 second elevator pitch gives you a chance to answer the very simple question of like, what do you do?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Like who are you? What are you building? What are you trying to solve? Like literally what does your company do?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Cause if they can walk away. 60 seconds into your pitch and say, all right, you know, this is the founder.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:29.000
He runs this type of company and they're focused on this. You're pretty successful.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
So kind of leading with that simple thought in mind. I've structured these into more of like a dues and don't.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:45.000
This is again just my personal preference. But I think it is important to write a script out when you are editing a document live, it's so helpful to be able to visually see.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:20:07.000
How you can connect words and create transitions that are more authentic and more like powerful. And I think it's really important to also like fight for every word that you put on that page because even things like transitioning between sentences or introducing topics or concluding topics.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:21.000
When you only have 60 seconds, they really matter. But one thing that happens as a result of this sometimes is people try to over memorize so they don't sound authentic and they also stumble on any miss words that they have.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:33.000
I see this a lot with tech stars founder sometimes is. When you have such an important event they've worked very hard to prepare for if you do mess up live on stage it can be hard to like get back into it.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000
So what I always like to do is make sure that you have the mental points in your head of like the 6 things you're trying to say in your 60 seconds, right?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
So you might have your 60 second pitch all written out in like a paragraph, but I would also have 6 bullets like, alright, I want to tell that story, then I want to bring that stat in.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Then I want to introduce myself. You know, then I want to explain the problem and then I wanna, you know, lead into the demo.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Because if you have that built into your mind. Even if you do kind of fumble and you have challenges.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Saying the things that you memorize, you can still run through that mental picture in your logic and be able to like recover in a very clear way.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
The other thing is no one knows what your what your you know word document said they only know what you're saying.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Live so it doesn't matter if you. Mess up truthfully I have completely BS things on stage live multiple times and People truly don't know if you're confident and able to actually just like.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Articulate the information that you want to say, even if it isn't in the exact language that you might have intended to.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I really think that's the right telling is important. I think that it's the best way to engage an audience in the most authentic way.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So I'm a big proponent of storytelling. Whether it's a customer story, whether it's a personal story, something that you can really bring the audience in because if you're able to explain very specifically how your product might support one specific user.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:11.000
It's much easier for them if they have a very deep understanding of that one user to be able to broaden it out and say, okay, well, they're in this, you know, they're in this one.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Customer segment but we also have a broader vision to tackle these other. Markets as well. You can justify that a lot easier if you have a very clear picture in your mind of how your product will solve problems for one specific user group.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I think. One challenge though is you're not going to be able to say everything that you want.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000
In that you might have in a given deck, right? If you're pitching to an investor, it's gonna be, you know, 10 plus minutes with a deck.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
This isn't that type of pitch. And I think that's really important to kind of note.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:23:05.000
So It's more about giving your listeners a more holistic. You of your company. More from some sort of birds eye level, I think when you're answering those Q&A, you're able to kind of dig much deeper and answer some of the specific topics that are critical to your business, but I think of it a little bit more of a bird's eye view.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Then a deck might be. People have a lot of different viewpoints on like when to introduce yourself.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Some people think that it's bad to introduce yourself in the very beginning. Some people think that you should introduce yourself in the middle.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:28.000
My only thing is do it whenever you want but don't shy away from it. I feel like because sometimes it is like a concern that a lot have.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
You are the founder, you have a CEO, right? Like you want to be able to communicate.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
And introduce yourself in a very confident way. So definitely don't shy away from that introduction. It can feel like you're a little bit ruining the flow.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Yeah, what's up Jennifer?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Okay, so in the very beginning. When they're like introducing us and having us come to the stage, they are gonna introduce us.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Huh?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
And then I think we have the choice of doing video first, st then pitch then QA. Or pitch then Q and or pitch then video than QA.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Yep.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
So just cure. Oh, you won't be introducing us.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Hmm. Okay.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Okay, so then. You recommend like any specific flow whether we do the video 1st or the pitch 1st and then introducing ourselves or not.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Yeah. I'll defer to Lily on it for a second if. Yeah, I think.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Yeah, most people do pitch first, st but if you have a specific reason why you think video 1st might be better, maybe like your company J.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Lo, then we let you do video first.st But most people do pitch first.st So that they know who you are and what's going on.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
And then the video will enhance the pitch.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Okay, cool. That makes sense.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Yeah, I I would kind of agree. I think introducing yourself and getting to know like who is building the company who's founding the company before they show the demo actually builds a lot of trust with the user.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And with the audience, so I'm always a promotion of showing the, the pitch first.st

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:05.000
And then, yeah, I guess if you're not introducing yourself, they're not introducing you, definitely find a way to weed that in.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
What's up?

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Yeah, so it just a comment, following up to what art said. I heard the same thing that you guys will introduce ourselves and and I think some mentor recommending not to.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Put on quote waste time introducing ourselves because it's just 60 seconds. So which one is the final call Please.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Yeah, can someone unmute and remind me where you guys heard that because I don't think I've ever said that.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
We've always done the demo.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I think it was Troy. Troy, I think if I if I remember Troy, said, do not, don't waste time introducing yourself in 60 seconds.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Yeah.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
He said that.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Yeah, yeah, it was on that.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Jerry was not, that was not accurate.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
No, no, no, when he's saying, what he sings actually legit. So he's saying don't waste time introducing yourself, which is good advice.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
But I don't think it doesn't sound like he said that someone else will be introducing you.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Cause that's not necessary.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:09.000
He always says don't spend time introducing yourself because no one cares. So like when you say like, hi, I'm this and this is my company, everyone will tune you out.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I remember he says that every time. Like just start with a story.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And by the way, when we say introductions, I think there might be some confusion where it's like, and the next company is Doug prime.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
That's going to happen. So we know who to go up. Who's going up and when?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
No.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
No, you'll know your order and you'll be lined up and I'll be queuing you up and your walk up music will play.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:38.000
But you all know your order. You'll know it way before and we'll rehearse it and you'll be sitting in your order and then we'll put you up there.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
It flows just fine guys like I wouldn't I wouldn't overthink the logistics of this.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:54.000
It's super smooth the music you pick is really it's a seamless experience.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
If there's any lingering questions about that, we can answer them as well, but.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Again, like answering what they do with that pitch, I think it's the most helpful information. I think getting creative with this is great.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:14.000
One thing that I found a lot of value in has been rainstorming just like very creative ways to present your information.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:23.000
It's hard to be creative in a pitch sometimes because I think we've seen so many of them that we want to create our own like version of whatever we've seen in the past.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I would definitely spend some time brainstorming, just like ways that you want to be able to tell your story, that you might not have already thought about before trying something completely new on demo day may not be the best way to approach it but there might be different variations or ways to communicate that you haven't fully thought of in depth before that might be worth thinking about.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Yeah, exactly. I think the comment about, about experience is pretty relevant. I actually saw a post about this on a with a tech stars founder from my cohort, a few years ago, like they really care more about what you're building than who you are.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
And the impact that it's gonna have on your customers and the like problem that you're solving.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
So, definitely.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:21.000
And then the last thing is. Focus, I think it's sometimes overlooked, but definitely important to focus on like the posture, the way that you're walking in the presence.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000
That you have on stage. It's best practice to not walk all over the stage when you're talking.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I think that you can move around a little bit, but. When you're speaking, especially important like sentences, like I would kind of plant your feet and just speak.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:47.000
If you're like transitioning from 1 point the next you can move around a little bit but definitely try and kind of plant your feet here.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
So that's more like logistical, but yeah, what's up?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Okay, so we have one slide that we have presented while we're doing Or is it only during our QA or during our pitch?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Yep.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
It's only during your QA.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Got it. So when we walk up and we do our 60 second pitch, essentially the screens blank.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Yeah, and this is spotlight on you. So it's like that in all the examples if you want to see an example.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And also I'm going to upload my demo day format slide where I walk through the format because it says that like very explicitly, so I'll just post that on base camp right now in case anybody needs to see it.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Got it. Okay, cool.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Okay.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.000
It may also make sense for some of you all to rewatch the demo day, workshop that Lilian gave where she kind of talked to all these things.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I know I was there and I also went to demo day. I just like For some reason, can't visualize it at the moment, but thank you.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
So once your pitch is done, you'll start to. Yeah, let's wait. Let's answer all those.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Intro questions. Any questions about introductions or the format or? Things like that.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Yeah, lots to make sure this is clear because everything Kevin's gonna say is very important. So I wanna make sure that we are on the same page altogether.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:15.000
I appreciate whoever told me that. There was that misconception. Thank you for bringing that up.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Okay, I think we're good to move on Kevin and Jeremy I completely agree if the story is part of your pitch you should do it I think Troy was saying more like a lot of people will like tell a bunch about themselves and then introduce themselves and only spend like 30 seconds on the business.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
A lot of people do that when they 1st try to write a pitch like hi I'm Blink and I'm building Blink.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
It's not going to be a very good pitch. So just cutting that already before you guys even.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Start writing it. That's what Troy was trying to do last week.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Great advice. Alright, so moving on, you'll walk up on stage, you'll have the music, you'll give your 60 second pitch live spotlights directly on you, then the demo is going to come up.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
I think that the 1st piece of advice. With this demo is this is your chance to basically showcase the progress that you've made.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Taking your like idea and your pitch and making it very real for the customers. Or for the listeners.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
So I think it's important to thank here, this is your just your chance to communicate. Hey, this is what we've built.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:23.000
This is the traction that we have. Here's how people are interacting with the product. And when you get to the demo, I think that People by nature are going to handle this a little bit differently.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000
I always think that it is and can be helpful to start blending in like more of a user centric approach towards this product demo.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
So thinking about ways that like the user would actually interact with the product, what are the like. How would it flow?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
What are the values that they're going to be getting out of this product? What's the traction that you have?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:48.000
So just think about ways that you can maybe incorporate things that you might have wanted to say in your QA or in your pitch that you can infuse into your demo.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Because The demo shouldn't be, you know, log in page, then all these other things, right?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
We, I think that you've heard that information before you wanna be able to like still tell very cohesive narrative.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Still be able to like, extract really important and meaningful like insights during those 60 seconds. So again, like maybe treating this as a little bit of a continuation of your pitch, but don't, use this as time to like say things that you wanted to fit into your 60 second pitch that you couldn't.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:23.000
This is a demo I want. Like definitely to make it clear that you should be spending your time showcasing your product, the thing that you have built.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And how it actually functions. But like painting that story line, I think is still important. Maybe you can bring in the user that you mentioned from your 60 second pitch into your demo or maybe you can now talk about what people are saying about your product and the like the value that you're adding for them.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:33:01.000
So definitely think about that. And then I think it is important to make sure that your product demo is like visually peeling that you've spent a lot of time, energy.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Then if you want to invest in, you know, the quality of your video, you're more than welcome to do so.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:22.000
I've seen a very big mix. I've seen, you know. As far as like, the like one example is there is a company that their wives recorded the video and did the voice over and I think that they did it themselves, but it looks really, really nice.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:36.000
And that was great. They were very resourceful, like very entrepreneurial of finding a way for the demo to look sound and feel good without spending, you know, a lot of money or, going overboard on it.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
So definitely put some time into it. Don't throw it together last minute, but as long as you're proactive, I think that it will turn out nicely.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Think about how you want to incorporate, you know, what your branding looks like, how you are presenting yourself in a creative way.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
And I think that you'll be in a good spot.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:02.000
I think there also is a way to kind of like not put enough effort into it because we watched Bloom filters with them and he had his wife do a voiceover into it because we watched Bloom filters with them and he had his wife do a voiceover and it sounded so robotic and it was not.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Yeah.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:15.000
If you remember, so like there were our groups that do it low-cost and it looks really nice like the unbuilt video you saw with the furniture company that cost them basically nothing like they just did it themselves.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
There were like a

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:32.000
But yeah, make sure that it's at least high enough quality that you would be proud of it and you're not just mailing it in because like we still tell Andrew that you would be proud of it and you're not just mailing it in because like we still tell Andrew that that was a really bad video and he knows it and like I'm sure if he just put in a little bit more effort even low cost

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Yeah.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
no money he would be happier with it. So just remember that your future self will thank you for that extra effort.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Yeah.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:45.000
If you all want a pro perspective on it, Max Temkin. Has done amazing professional video work. He does it himself.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Self-taught and he's incredible at it. So talk to Max if you really feel like you're stuck on the video front.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Awesome.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Alright. Yeah, David?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Yeah, could you go back one slide and I guess. I guess could you paint more color around build the video?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Don't build the video around users. This is a product demo I guess something we were considering was kind of communicating how our product impacts the users.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Kind of wanna understand a little bit if maybe What you're kind of saying in this don't so just so we're not doing anything that you think could be detrimental kind of thing.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
I think that's a great piece of advice. Like I think that the way that you're thinking about it is totally on track.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:39.000
I wouldn't be overly concerned. I just don't want you to take all of your time away from actually showcasing what you've built.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:51.000
As long as there's like, as long as there's a balance between talking about how the users are interacting with the product and actually showcasing the product.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Thank you.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
I think that you're in a pretty good spot. Antonio?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Yeah, very similar question. We are pre product. We were thinking of using the 1st 10 seconds for putting some highlights from the GTPD interviews.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Yeah.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Just some recordings and I guess it's that's okay correct like As long as it doesn't take the whole video you're saying but 10 seconds of users feedback or users input should be okay, right?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.000
I think so. I don't know if Neil or Lily, I don't have any comments on this, but the best way to show that people are liking your product is by having words and like things from your user saying that they get value out of it.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
So I don't see any problem with it.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
I agree.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Cool. Good. Awesome. Alright.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Moving on. Sorry, this is supposed to say 4 min, but. I think the last 4 min really gives you a chance to like lean into everything that you've learned.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Over your time at Techstars. I think this is a way to build a lot of trust with your audience to be able to showcase a vast amount of your learnings in a very short amount of time.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:04.000
It's kind of nice that you will, Liliana, correct me if I'm wrong, have some sort of insight into the questions that will be asked ahead of time.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Yeah, it'll be completely scripted with your ER.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Right. So. That's great, right? So you'll be able to kind of manufacture the conversation that you want to have.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:24.000
And I think being very like transparent and honest and communicative about your experience and what you've learned is the best way to have a really good.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:36.000
So I think designing the QA for what you wanna say is really, really important. Spend a lot of time thinking about the questions that you might want to get asked and how you want to answer them.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
So. I think there's definitely a unique balance of like how many questions you get asked. I would I would imagine it'd be between like 4 and 6, but I'm not sure.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Leon, do you have any thoughts on that?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
It's as many as you can comfortably answer. So I always say it's better to break them up.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:01.000
So don't have like 3 with super long answers like a minute each people are gonna have their eyes glazed over but having those same answers split up amongst 4 or 5 questions is probably the sweet spot.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:13.000
It depends how long your answers are, how the pace that you go at is, so it'll be different for each of you, but I would agree with Kevin between like 4 and 6 is probably where you'll land.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And the last question for everyone will be, how can the audience here help you today? And that'll be your closing statement.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000
So it'll take like 10 seconds so you can make your whole set without that and we'll go over that with you in the final week and everyone will have a closing statement for about 10 seconds.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And that'll be, you know, whatever your goal is and you're asking the audience for that and then you thank them and leave.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Awesome. So one thing that I think is helpful here, is to be like very answer 1st with your, with your QA.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000
So what I mean by that is if I ask you who your target customers are starting with like my target customers are.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:05.000
You know, all the insights that you found from your JTVD. And then if you want to add any more commentary after that being able to like kind of go back set a little context communicate but I think.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
You don't wanna wait 45 seconds to get the answer to a question. You wanna be able to get the answer upfront.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
So, just be thoughtful about that.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:32.000
And then. I think it's important to like sequence the questions, right? And the way that you're thinking about your demo and your 60 second pitch you wanna be able to let the story flow in a like a narrative that works best for you and for, what you've built.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:40.000
So feel free to sequence the questions in any way that you think is best. This is kind of like in my opinion a little bit of a hack, because And it does set you up very nicely if you are thoughtful about this.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Don't overthink it. Like I think you know your company pretty well. So, if there is an order, they think it's best just kind of lean in and jump into that.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Yeah, Neil.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
So just a reminder to folks, the, the notion here is that it's connected to your goal.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Some of you have a goal of investor conversations and fundraising. Some of you have partnership or customer acquisition goals, whatever it is.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Be brutally like focused on orienting your conversation with your EIR. Around speaking to those people in the room.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And for the video that you'll have that you can share afterwards. You don't have to cater to everyone at once.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Definitely.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:33.000
It's not important to do that. It's much more important for you to get your full value from the experience by directing the energy and the conversation in the way that would be optimal for your goal.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Great point. And I think that's where the ask becomes, you know, even more critical. As well, right?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Ending the conversation with being very poignant about what you want and what you're trying to get out of this.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.000
And I think answering that question now is a great way to structure your entire pitch around that. To get the most out of it.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
So. At the end, definitely have a formal well thought out question to ask, so that you can target the people in the room that you care about most.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:04.000
I think it's important to only make one ask. I've seen some founders try and make multiple asks and I think that it adds some complexity.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:18.000
So just be very targeted and what you're asking for. And then I think it's great to answer like hard questions and to be transparent and be honest, people know that entrepreneurship is hard that you're working through a lot of big challenges and it is really helpful.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:26.000
I think that you build a lot of trust when you have transparency and what you're building and the way that you've been going about this process.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000
So definitely don't be afraid to answer challenging questions. Because You guys are all really smart.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
You're able to kind of work through that as well. So.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
It's more impressive and more memorable if you address challenging questions. It's, honestly like.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Yeah.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Kind of a let down, I think to some folks investors that I've spoken to when they feel like.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:53.000
For anybody who knows baseball, cream puffs. Anybody know this analogy? Cream puffs.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
So I didn't know this either, but Brad taught us because he's a baseball player. But cream puffs are basically like really, really easy pitches to hit.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:08.000
So you don't want the softballs.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
And to be honest, oh, Okay, so that's most of what I have. So I've gone through those.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000
I'm gonna give you some last like parting tips and then, we can use the rest of at the time however you think is most helpful.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
But. I think the most important thing here is like you really have to love your pitch more than anyone.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
If you don't love your pitch, you're not gonna feel confident on stage. You're gonna be nervous when you go up and present.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:37.000
And I think All of that really just comes with time and patience and continue to revisiting of your of your pitch.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:50.000
So make sure that you are proactive. Starting now all the way through demo day. I know that you're trying to also build a company at the same time that you're trying to prepare for demo day, which can create some unique challenges, but.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:43:02.000
I mean being thoughtful about this everyday blocking out just a small amount of time, I think will go a really long ways and create a pitch and a product and a, you know, a storyline that you're really proud of.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Okay, and can you make that more practical and real what you just said because I kind of want you to say it louder for the people in the back what you just said about practicing every day.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Yeah.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Like one practicing every day to recording all of your pitches and 3 having a spreadsheet or a database of all of your pitches and recordings and formats.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:31.000
I'm saying all this because I've seen a few founders do it. Not most. But a few meticulously have recorded and tracked and organized.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:41.000
All of their pitches that they've. Attempted and have shared versions of their pitches with different people for that kind of feedback because of how seriously they were taking it.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Yeah, it's a really great way of looking at it. So trying to be as concrete as possible, I think Blocking out it.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:44:00.000
30 min to an hour, at least a day, starting now, moving forward. If you're thinking about something continuously from now until demo day, you're just going to do a much better job.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
And I think it's starts with getting your 1st version of what you want your pitch script to look like.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:17.000
What you want your demo layout to be, what questions you want to be asked and how you want to create those answers and being very specific about what your ask is and then backtracking that to create a very coherent pitch overall.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
I think you guys are working on that right now, getting as close as you can and finalizing that this week is really important.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:33.000
And then start getting pitch feedback. As Neil mentioned, you can send different versions of different pitches to different people to get various types of feedback. Logging it is critical.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:56.000
I think like notion or drive or any way of documenting and maintaining that is great because oftentimes Probably what will happen is you'll create version one and then you'll share it and then you'll create version 2 and then you might end up going back to version one at version 8 because you realize that you actually communicated it in the best way.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Is really important because there might be things that you've said in other versions that you want to bring back later.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:07.000
And the worst thing is not remembering what you said. Do you have a question?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Yeah, so and you might have said that before on other calls, but, to get feedback besides our leave mentors, who can we send these information, LL, or what's the best way to get feedback from the staff and mentors?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Any ER that you have, me, Neil, the whole team, Chloe, put it in your base camp.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.000
A lot of people already have put it in your individual base camp and tag us and ask for feedback or send it to your EIR or both.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Thank you.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
And then yeah, a lot of people on the network like Becky from AWS is very interested in helping you guys a couple other people.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:48.000
So if you want us to help you find some mentors to help, we can do that as well.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Yeah.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:57.000
I think you should also share it with founders who've done it. Pitches that you like founders that you're connected to that you've met throughout this program experience, people who've given pitches in some of the videos you saw that you thought were phenomenal.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:04.000
You can reach out to those CEOs, are all in the family. You have a lot of options to get feedback and input.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I also always like to plug the cohort that you're in right now like your other founders are the best resource possible like building alongside them trying to brainstorm together ways that you can create you know creative pitches and demos.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
The most help I've gotten are people from vastly different industries. So I think sharing your pitch and getting feedback from your own peers is also just like a really, really great way.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:32.000
To accelerate your growth, and getting feedback from your own peers is also just like a really, really great way, to accelerate your growth, Yeah, I would get a lot of high quality feedback in a short amount of time.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:40.000
It looks like you only have about 3 weeks before demo day, which is a little bit of an accelerated timeline.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:52.000
So, make sure that you're like revising and iterating constantly. If you break out like an hour a day to iterate, you'll feel much more confident because you have seen it time and time and time again.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
And just like make sure you love it. I think that's really important. It gives you that confidence.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
And then once you have everything where you want it to be, like do as much as you can to relax.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:07.000
And just practice, because you do wanna have that finalized. You know, as far out in advance as possible.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
So that you can go up and crush it and, at the end of May, but That's everything that I have.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:19.000
That's my email. It's my phone number. You can also find me on LinkedIn pretty rarely available.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
So, Please feel free to reach out. You know, someone asked. Who can help? I'm more than happy to like.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Find time one on one with you guys, if that would be helpful. So please feel free to reach out.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I'm more than happy to help, but,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
I love that you have the Mill Village, photo for the final slide here. It's really good.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
It's it's 1 of my favorite pictures of all time. Yeah.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Yeah, it's really good one.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:49.000
For those wondering this was. Helping elderly people get meal delivery and the woman in the back on his Q&A slide was giving a testimonial on how changed her life in his video so he just wanted to hammer that home and put her back on the screen for his one slide.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Which was a very creative use of it. I thought it was really powerful.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:07.000
And it doesn't sound like a very like. You know, sexy business, but I think Ravi was between one or 2 million in ARR at the time, right?

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Yeah.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Yeah.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Good. Company. Kevin, thank you so much. This was awesome.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
I recommend that everybody go back and watch this again with the Do's and Don's write down what you think that you need to work on for each section.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Each of those are extremely potent. I've helped people try and do or do not do each of those points that Kevin has put.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Yep.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
So really, really important there. And Neil wanted to just add one more thing with product demo. Kevin, if you still have more time, just stick around so you can comment as well.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Yeah, for some bonus time, are you cool if I share my favorite product demo video? Is that cool?

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Yes, please.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Alright, so this is the old, it's 1 that I share with, my all my Northwestern students over the past 10 years.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000
I don't think I've ever shared it with my tech stars founders because it's a 4 min.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Product video. But there's a reason given all the questions and energy that I'm picking up on with y'all that I want to show you this 4 min product video.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:17.000
So some of you might know this. Has anyone ever seen the Dropbox MVP video. Anybody here?

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
No hands? Oh hell yeah. All right. All right, game.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Oh, Valeri has seen it. You've seen it? Alright, good. Alright, so I have something to say about it, but I want you to pay attention to it.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Like, whatever you're doing, if you got text messages, notifications on your phone, you doing multi-tasking, video off, whatever.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Give me 4 min and 19 seconds of your time plus another minute or 2 to talk about it. I promise you it'll be worth it.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Alright, here we go. Go here. Do this. I need to choose to share sound.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Let me see. Am I smart enough? Okay, kind of pull this off.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Let me share. Share computer sound.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Alright, good to go.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000
We'll be taking a quick tour of Dropbox, which is a better way of keeping your important stuff synchronized across your PCs.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.000
What makes Dropbox different is that it just works meaning that there's no complicated setup or configuration.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000
And if you're familiar with development tools, Dropbox is kind of like taking subversion and our sync and making them easy to use.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:29.000
So here we'll walk through a concrete example. And so I just got a new laptop and I've got some important files on my desktop that I like to keep synchronized across both machines.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
And to set up Dropbox, all you really have to do is install the application, which I did a moment ago, and then link it to an account.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:42.000
So I typed in my information there. And it brings me to this web interface where I can see recent changes to the files in my Dropbox.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:55.000
And I can actually get the files directly. So in addition to synchronizing files across PCs, Dropbox also securely backs them up and synchronize them to the web so you can click on any of these files and it does what you'd expect.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
In case you're not at one of your computers. As far as the Windows

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000
That's actually not it. Let me fix it. One second. That is the second video that they did.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000
This is the first.st My bad.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
One second. Let's pull this out.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Share. So you all remember this though, like the all remember Dropbox came out or like back in the day when like you couldn't actually do that functionality.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Does anybody, anybody old enough to remember that? Where you had to carry these giant hard drives around when I was in college on campus.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:37.000
But anyway, this is better. There we go. So let's go here. We'll jump ahead.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Different is that it just works and there isn't any complicated setup or interface to learn So let's get started.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
I've already installed Dropbox on a Windows PC and put a bunch of files in.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:57.000
And now I want to sync these files to my Mac. So to do that, I just installed Dropbox and now I'm linking my Mac to my account.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
So in a second, my account will be linked and you can see that the files that were on my Windows PC will start coming down.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000
And what we're looking at is my Dropbox folder, which looks and acts like any other folder except for 2 things.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:15.000
One, these little green icons that indicate files are up to date. And 2, anything in my dropbox is synced across all my computers into the web.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:24.000
And you'll notice that when I make changes, everything sinks up pretty quickly. And as another example, I'm going to log in my Windows PC.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Where you'll see that not only are the changes for my Mac already here, But if I make another change to a file, so for example this picture of a platypus.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000
And then I hit save.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:48.000
The change begins uploading immediately. And when I go back to my Mac, the change is reflected in a matter of seconds.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:56.000
So the point is if you've ever worked with multiple computers or carried on a USB drive or emailed yourself files from work, You can see this is a much easier way of managing your stuff.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000
And we also protect you from the bad things that can happen to your files. If I delete a bunch of stuff.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:10.000
We have this web interface. Where you can not only get to your files in case you're not at one of your computers, so here are the contents of my Dropbox here.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.000
But we have this show deleted files link where you can select a file that you've deleted and then you have an option to bring it back.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:27.000
And a couple of clicks. So I'll do that. And instantly the files back. And not only do you have the option of restoring the most recent version, but actually any vert, any prior version of a file.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Because every time you make a change Dropbox save the snapshot. And Dropbox is also very efficient about the way it handles changes to files.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:42.000
And sends only the pieces that change. So in the case of the plot-upus picture, just sending the delta saved over 80% of the bandwidth.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:50.000
So that covers a lot of how we make it easy to access and protect your own files, but the other half of what we do revolves around making it really easy to share and put files online.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000
So normally if I want to share something, I have to send an email attachment or something like that.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:01.000
But Dropbox has a special public folder. Where every file you put in here has a URL associated with it.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:08.000
So I can get a public link. And then I can paste that into an IM window or an email.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Or blog post and it does what you'd expect. So that's great for individual files, but we also make it possible to share entire folders.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.000
So hopefully that gives you an idea of how much easier Dropbox makes it to share files. And with that, we'll wrap up.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
We're still in private beta, but you can visit us and sign up to give it a shot at www.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Dot com. Thanks.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Alright, so the most interesting thing about this video to me was one. It went viral back in the day when it went out.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:06.000
It got them in the white combinator and I think got them over 500 K in funding and like I think over a hundred 1,000 people signed up for their wait list to learn more from that link at the end.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
What is most fascinating about that product demo though is that you all kind of look at that function.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:21.000
And I go, yeah, yeah, cool. We get it. Turns out most of that functionality had not yet been implemented.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:29.000
It was a fake. It was like, it was like a fake it to you make it situation where they were presenting the functionality they intended to.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Develop once they brought on the full engineering team that they needed to do so. But they wanted to demonstrate their intent of what they wanted the product to do.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:45.000
So that is actually the most interesting part of the video that doesn't get talked about enough. Which is you can show what I call the happy path.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Of your product even before the full functionality is there. So I didn't win as much money as Kevin, but I did win over a hundred $1,000 winning hackathons back in the day.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Because I understood this lesson. Which is it's less about having everything done and more about communicating your vision for what benefits the product will afford the user.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
So, so this video literally went viral back in the day and it's like the quintessential Silicon Valley tech product demo because they knew their audience did a bunch of quirky Easter eggs and funny references.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:18.000
They knew who they were trying to appeal to with this, you know, message. So I share that with you.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:27.000
All to hopefully inspire you to help you realize like you don't have to have your product done done.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:35.000
To render a version of it that communicates what you intend to do with it down the road. And how it's gonna help.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
And.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Yeah, and on those lines, Neil, you're saying basically as long as we are confident that we can accomplish those those features.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.000
We the good engineering team that we are gonna be hiring after the fundraising, then it's totally fine to put it, right?

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.000
I mean, we know that was what features will work. It just we we don't have the resources to implement them.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Is that is that the point and

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Yeah, yeah, I mean you wanna be honest you don't want to oversell right you don't want to overplay your hand and say something you don't know how to do Drew himself the founder technical.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:26.000
So he understood what was possible with what he intended to do. So he wasn't over promising on the functionality front, but he was taking some liberties about how everything worked at that point.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Was that helpful to share? How about invoice people's time? Okay, good.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Yeah, very helpful.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Right.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.000
But I guess the last thing I'll say though, Kevin, is just like. Look, we can tell when somebody is stressed out.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Talking about their business versus when somebody's super proud, confident, and excited to talk about their business.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:56.000
So I think practice is going to enable you to feel very confident about what you're saying and doing and also authenticity.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:04.000
To trigger like your genuine interesting commitment to building this great business of yours and how excited you are to make that happen and work with people who mean well and want to help you.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:12.000
It doesn't have to be this like tense. Awkward, you know, stressful, you know, like, like I, I hate that.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Like that's not a fun way to live or to run a business or anything. So just if that's what you're feeling, let us help you get over that hump so that you're actually jamming and enjoying the process in the journey.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Great point. That's all I got. So if you guys have any questions, happy to. You know, stay in touch, but.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Thank you
