1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:11.447
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, everybody. We're gonna jump right in to use every single minute. We have Kevin Casper here. Kevin has been on our team for 2 programs. I think right? And then.

2
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.780
NSG: Yeah. And he was at the farm.

3
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:43.079
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, in Chicago. And then after that, as a pitch specialist for many programs after that. So he has come back to help. And the reason that we have Kevin back so often is because he has won more pitch competitions than anyone I know. So he knows so much about pitching we met when he came into undergrad and was really interested in entrepreneurship. He made his own startup Inferno guard, which I think he might talk about when he talks about pitching and worked on that for all of college. So

4
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:51.779
Lilliana Robinson: there's an end to that story here. I'll let Kevin tell it. But kevin has won over what half a mill in pitch competitions and.

5
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.410
Kevin Kaspar: About.

6
00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:06.609
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. And Ca, that is free money, and always comes back to teach our founders the tips and tricks on how he does it. So this is perfect. Because last week, Kevin, we introduced Demo Day and pitching. And so they've all started iterating on their pitches. So today is perfect for all of your.

7
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.090
Tunde: But that's.

8
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.430
Lilliana Robinson: Stuff. They can implement

9
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.710
Lilliana Robinson: perfect. Okay, Neil.

10
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.769
NSG: How much, how much is venture cat worth?

11
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.929
NSG: How much is that.

12
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.019
Kevin Kaspar: 100 and $60,000 when I.

13
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.549
Burhan: And stop there.

14
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.179
NSG: Yeah 168, because I judged that one right?

15
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.870
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah.

16
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.919
NSG: Yeah, I remember that. So I was a part of the like that 500 K for 160 k. Of it. That was when I,

17
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.419
NSG: Kevin? I didn't. I knew you, but I didn't really know you that well, and so it was mostly like older teams with, like, you know

18
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.699
NSG: sophisticated reason agents and plans, or whatever.

19
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.530
NSG: And then Kevin shows up you were what a sophomore I think.

20
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.380
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah.

21
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.849
NSG: Yeah, he was like.

22
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.569
NSG: you know, barely an adult. And he stepped in there.

23
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.980
NSG: and it was like, not even a question. Like as the judges. We looked around. We were like, Okay, well, clearly, this guy's gonna win.

24
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:08.119
NSG: So it was like, yeah, like, he has a way of like, kind of commanding the room and knowing exactly what he's there to do, and to say that I think everybody here could learn from and and appreciate so half a million pitch prizes ain't no chump change.

25
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.581
Kevin Kaspar: Well, thanks. Now I appreciate it.

26
00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:17.269
Kevin Kaspar: Alright cool. So I'm I'm just gonna share a presentation with you guys that I've been using for the past few times I've helped

27
00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:34.589
Kevin Kaspar: other cohorts out. Please like jump in with any questions at any time. That's the best way to do it, for sure. Just like unmute, or whatever but I'll go through it. I checked in with Lilian and everyone about the format so similar to what I'm used to. So I'm just gonna share my screen.

28
00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.569
Kevin Kaspar: And then we can go from there.

29
00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.389
Kevin Kaspar: Can everyone see this

30
00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.379
Kevin Kaspar: hopefully? Cool, alright, cool.

31
00:02:45.539 --> 00:03:10.589
Kevin Kaspar: great. So Liliana already talked about me. But I've worked at techstars for a while. I run a company called Inferno Guard that I've been working on all throughout high school. It's about wildfire detection and notification so pretty timely out in the Bay area. I'm actually moving out to the bay after I graduate so excited to be out there and stay connected with the entrepreneurship ecosystem. But I'm still at Northwestern. I'm a senior. I have

32
00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.679
Kevin Kaspar: like a month left of school, but

33
00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:39.229
Kevin Kaspar: I've been to at least 2 or 3 demo days, maybe more. So definitely, I'm comfortable with the format and helping you guys out as much as possible at the end of the like presentation. I'll leave my email, my phone number by Linkedin, whatever just like, please feel free to reach out. Text your email, whatever is easiest. I'm more than happy to help out. However, I can. But alright. So from my understanding, the format is 60 s elevator pitch 60 s

34
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:45.461
Kevin Kaspar: demo, and then oh, 4 min QA. Not 6 min Liliana gave that to me earlier. But

35
00:03:45.839 --> 00:04:00.939
Kevin Kaspar: I think the most important thing to talk about early on is that, like all the whole story, arc must be fluid across all sections of the pitch. I think that one misconception that a lot of people have when they're presenting for Demo Day is that the

36
00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:22.726
Kevin Kaspar: 60 s pitch and the demo and the QA. Are very separate from one another. But really you wanna be able to tell a coherent story across all 3 components of the pitch to make it seem like all of those are flowing really well between one another. So you can do that in a lot of different ways. Right? You can kind of have like a story arc. You can

37
00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:38.939
Kevin Kaspar: bookend the beginning to the end, create a very memorable moment. But there has to be a way for you to be able to streamline what you're trying to say. And even though they might fall under different buckets of the demo, the QA. Whatever. You want to be able to kind of

38
00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:52.819
Kevin Kaspar: visualize what that storyline might look like. And it's really going to be different for every founder and for every company especially with techstars, with so many different industries. So I think one thing that's important to keep in mind is

39
00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:15.679
Kevin Kaspar: like that you will have a very different storyline from someone else. And that's totally okay. But you guys know your company best, and we'll be able to make those decisions on your own. But one thing I like to recommend is thinking about it very visually. So I've worked with like a graphic designer in the past who literally will map out the storyline like the positive moments, the negative moments, the

40
00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:28.187
Kevin Kaspar: moments that there are drama or like concern or negativity. And you wanna just be able to visualize what that actually could look like for your pitch and for your product.

41
00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:46.509
Kevin Kaspar: And I think that now is a great time to be able to actually start thinking about things like that because you are in the earlier stages. I know that your demo days coming up right at the end of May. So you still definitely have time to do this. But when you're going through all of it, I definitely would think about how the storyline actually will look.

42
00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:47.599
Kevin Kaspar: And

43
00:05:48.119 --> 00:06:00.409
Kevin Kaspar: one piece of advice that I always like to give, that my dad actually gave to me when I was younger is like, you have to teach everything that you're trying to explain like, you're 10 years old, basically because

44
00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:17.219
Kevin Kaspar: people really consume information at a very basic level, especially when they're listening to pitch after pitch after pitch and I think it's really important that you're able to synthesize all of your learnings into a very easy.

45
00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:18.989
Kevin Kaspar: tangible, digestible

46
00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:38.489
Kevin Kaspar: way of communicating. I almost like to think of it like a funnel. There's probably a million things that you wanna say, or that you could say, because you've been working on your business so diligently throughout techstars. But there's going to be like one specific narrative that will come out of it at the end. That, I think, is really important to keep in mind.

47
00:06:39.109 --> 00:07:03.894
Kevin Kaspar: assume that your audience knows absolutely nothing about what you're building. I think that's really important. A lot of times when you're building a product. There are things that are you. You have that are almost assumed where you're like. Oh, I know. I would assume that you know they know how the app works, or how the user interface looks, or how to download it, or things like that. But I think it's good to just assume that you literally know nothing.

48
00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:12.709
Kevin Kaspar: And then the goal is to walk out excited. I think if you can pay attention for 8 min straight and have someone excited to.

49
00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:20.279
Kevin Kaspar: you know, get on your website. Talk to you afterwards. Have a conversation with you, that's all that you can really ask for. So

50
00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:28.619
Kevin Kaspar: I think the responsibility is definitely on you as a founder, and not as the listener to be able to make that information digestible. So it really is

51
00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:51.999
Kevin Kaspar: important that when you're developing your pitch, you kind of do the hard work for the listener. You explain things that need to be explained a little bit more clearly. You dumb down the information so that everyone can understand it. You create, you know, recurring themes in the pitch so that people can understand all 8 min of it. So definitely keep that in mind as you are going out and presenting.

52
00:07:52.999 --> 00:08:03.529
Kevin Kaspar: And I think this relates to something that's really important. About the amount of like education or teaching that you might have to do, and this will vary from every company that

53
00:08:04.535 --> 00:08:21.064
Kevin Kaspar: is here today. But there is a certain amount of information that any audience members just will not know about your product, your company, your vision, and you have to think very critically about how much teaching or education you actually have to do

54
00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:24.539
Kevin Kaspar: And I think oftentimes

55
00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:36.559
Kevin Kaspar: founders will think that they have to over, explain or over communicate. When I think in reality, you can just be very specific about what you communicate, and very intentional about what you communicate.

56
00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.899
Kevin Kaspar: And

57
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:52.449
Kevin Kaspar: I think it's important to also think about like where this information should go so oftentimes I like to do all a lot of my teaching upfront, so I'll usually lead with some sort of story or some sort of.

58
00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:57.757
Kevin Kaspar: should we? Oh, just checking the chat, should we avoid jargon? Where possible? I definitely think so.

59
00:08:58.119 --> 00:09:11.098
Kevin Kaspar: because the the pitch is so short? I think that it's really important to just create a vision that anyone can understand. And oftentimes, like there is a certain amount of jargon that just creates some complexity there.

60
00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:36.969
Kevin Kaspar: and that kind of relates to this like this teaching piece, too. Right? Is that there might be something that you have to teach the audience. Maybe it's about, yeah, maybe you have to teach them about the problem. And that's not as clear. Or maybe you have to teach them about what the users are saying, and like your jobs to be done. Conversations, what you've learned there? So I think there's definitely different ways or amount of teaching that you're going to have to do. But I think that it is important that you do it somewhat in the beginning, because

61
00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:39.549
Kevin Kaspar: that's when you have the audience's most

62
00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:41.869
Kevin Kaspar: attentive, like.

63
00:09:42.009 --> 00:10:06.893
Kevin Kaspar: focus on you. But that strikes a little bit of a challenge as well. Right? Because if you're trying to teach the audience a lot of information very early on you might lose them with any of the complexity which kind of goes back to the point of you have to be able to communicate this in a very seamless and digestible way. So just think about that. You don't have to communicate any of these like main learnings or teachings early on. But

64
00:10:07.599 --> 00:10:09.239
Kevin Kaspar: just be thoughtful about it.

65
00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:10.749
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah, what's up.

66
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.962
Malc: Hey, Kevin? Thanks for this. Just curious, is there? Talk about teaching, is there?

67
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:28.340
Malc: Is there? I don't know best in class way, or do you have a thoughtful approach to balancing the emotional side versus just dropping numbers? Because I've seen obviously like that can be really powerful introduction. Just curious in your opinion how you approach that.

68
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:30.670
Kevin Kaspar: So

69
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:36.449
Kevin Kaspar: I might give a cop out answer. But I think ideally, it's both ideally. It's an emotional story that you can weave in

70
00:10:36.844 --> 00:10:45.450
Kevin Kaspar: statistics throughout that that doesn't feel forced. But I always think that telling a story that might be more emotional is always

71
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.439
Kevin Kaspar: more engaging for

72
00:10:47.460 --> 00:11:16.339
Kevin Kaspar: a general audience member, maybe less so an investor per se. But for people that are trying people that are, you're trying to get broad attention from, I think, being able to tell a very coherent story that might be more on the emotional appeal can help. But again, you do want to be able to make sure that you not only give one specific example right, but then are able to zoom out and think about the broader landscape, especially when you're talking about the problem so ideally, I would try and have a little bit of a blend if you can.

73
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.652
Kevin Kaspar: and then, yeah, like, you don't have to do your all your teaching upfront. You can always

74
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:36.539
Kevin Kaspar: do some in the QA. Right, they might say, oh, well, what's your business model? And then you explain your pricing there, and and why you decided to do that. The QA. Is actually a great time to do a lot of that, because they're specifically asking you questions that they want to learn more about.

75
00:11:38.950 --> 00:12:08.084
Kevin Kaspar: another thing that I think is really important as well as like staying consistent with your tone as a founder, and like who you personally are, I think, a lot of times what makes your company so special and so recognizable are the founders and the founding team, and the CEO and I just don't want any of the like founders to lose that when they're pitching. I think oftentimes people will kind of suppress their personality or suppress their

76
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:25.059
Kevin Kaspar: just like kind of ways of communicating, because it is a pitch. And there's obviously a balance that you need to strike between being professional and kind of like communicating very authentically. But a pitch really should feel like a conversation. It should feel like something your

77
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:32.910
Kevin Kaspar: you could do like on the couch, hanging out and having a conversation as much as on a stage, presenting to hundreds of people so

78
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:55.311
Kevin Kaspar: like definitely own the type of founder that you are like an example of this. That Neil was talking about was like when I was pitching at one of these competitions, I would always just wear a suit and tie. I don't know why, but I just really would and, like other people, would show up in their like founder T-shirts, or whatever, and like. I think that's pretty common out in the bay to like. Have a logo with your company and present in that. But

79
00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:14.249
Kevin Kaspar: I just like kind of thought because I was young. I wanted to present myself in a very professional way, and that's just what I did, and I think that it has worked out for me in the past. So I'm not saying dress is the most important thing. I'm just saying that being able to communicate yourself more authentically is really important. So don't lose sight of that when you're trying to develop your pitch.

80
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:22.789
Kevin Kaspar: and then I think one of the biggest challenges that people have when they're pitching really is

81
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.209
Kevin Kaspar: taking advice from other people and getting that sort of feedback

82
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.070
Kevin Kaspar: a lot of times

83
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:36.709
Kevin Kaspar: implicitly. We're we're really willing to listen to feedback and and consume feedback. So

84
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.909
Kevin Kaspar: if I gave you feedback or anyone else gave you feedback you would think about.

85
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.741
Kevin Kaspar: You know how that applies, and if you would want to implement it or not.

86
00:13:45.090 --> 00:14:13.530
Kevin Kaspar: I think ultimately you have to be confident in the pitch that you're developing for yourself. But I do think getting advice is really important, and I think there's kind of a method to this madness of the balance of writing a pitch yourself versus getting pitch feedback and kind of knowing when you're at a point that you're happy with the pitch, and my biggest advice is, get a high quantity of advice all at once, so I'm sure by now there are trusted mentors that you have, or people like Liliana or Neil

87
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:19.420
Kevin Kaspar: in your kind of community that can give you pitch feedback. But I would try and do it

88
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:34.201
Kevin Kaspar: at a very high volume and a short amount of time, because then you can see the patterns much more clearly if you get pitch advice from someone on Tuesday, and then a week from Tuesday. You're gonna kind of not be able to identify the patterns as quickly. So

89
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:45.870
Kevin Kaspar: I I am kind of surprised that oftentimes people do have similar feedback if you talk to enough people. And that really helps you understand what actually needs to be changed. And what is more, of like a

90
00:14:46.184 --> 00:15:03.549
Kevin Kaspar: like investor preference or a mentor preference, because a lot of times they will like, not force their own preferences on you, but give you advice that is very specific to the way they like to do things which at times could be really helpful. But again, this is your pitch and your decision. So you should feel confident, you know.

91
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:13.159
Kevin Kaspar: giving the pitch how you want so definitely get a high quantity of advice at once, and then, like I would iterate multiple times. And I think one misconception here is that

92
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.610
Kevin Kaspar: it's it's the advisor or the mentor's job to iterate the pitch.

93
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:33.369
Kevin Kaspar: It really is like the onus is on you for sure to to be the one taking those iterations and being proactive. If you want secondary advice from someone, and you just iterated the products like, go ahead, make that pitch again, and then give it to the the mentor again. But

94
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:50.850
Kevin Kaspar: there comes a point where feedback is only so helpful. So at some point you do have to finalize your pitch and kind of stay grounded in what you've built a lot. All of the pitches that have gone poorly for me have been when I've tried changing my pitch the night before, or 2 nights before, or even 3 or 4 nights before, and

95
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:58.540
Kevin Kaspar: I think just having like that mental reassurance that your pitch is finalized. It's exactly where you want it to be for

96
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.640
Kevin Kaspar: 4 days to a week out really is

97
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:20.119
Kevin Kaspar: essential. Because I think you're just gonna be way more anxious, nervous like. Lack the confidence. If you are changing things last minute. And I've seen this before with techstars, founders as well. So I think it's really really important to have your pitch finalized multiple days before and that you feel confident about it.

98
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:39.750
Kevin Kaspar: So that's kind of more of just like my broad advice for each of these like for the pitch as a whole. But I'm gonna go into the each component. Some areas I feel like I have more knowledge on than others. Transparently. I think the demo is where I have the least amount of knowledge. But

99
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:51.594
Kevin Kaspar: I'm gonna just kinda kind of share my experience and what I think will be helpful. But does anyone have questions about what I said before, just broadly. Maybe there are questions that you're wrestling with in your pitch.

100
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.240
Kevin Kaspar: Happy to answer them now, or we can just keep moving whatever works best.

101
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.929
Kevin Kaspar: Alright. Well, I'll keep going.

102
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:13.390
Malc: Hey, Kevin? Sorry. Sorry last. Just curious like. What's your mental prep. Look like you mentioned a week out like, I know everyone can be different. But like, what's your prep look like visualization? So how do you? What do you do to lead up.

103
00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:38.269
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah, I think something that's really important is actually presenting the information out loud in front of other people. And recording yourself, I honestly think recording yourself is the most important thing. I've learned so much about how I pitch, how I walk on stage, what my ticks are when I say when I am lacking confidence all from recording myself. So I think it's really important that you record yourself.

104
00:17:38.269 --> 00:17:59.252
Kevin Kaspar: You don't need to be on a big stage to like mimic what that's going to be like. But I think it's really important that you do record yourself. And then also, everyone has their own way, like my co-founders like to record themselves and put it in their ears when they're like walking to and from places I like to just practice at a certain amount of like time per day.

105
00:17:59.719 --> 00:18:06.159
Kevin Kaspar: I also think it's important to get comfortable with the visuals behind you like whether you'll have them or not, I think.

106
00:18:06.429 --> 00:18:20.769
Kevin Kaspar: correct me if I'm wrong. Typically, usually there's only one type of visual plus the demo that gets shown. But I think it's really important to be con like comfortable with those as well. So I would just do everything you can to replicate what will actually happen.

107
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:33.959
Kevin Kaspar: At the time of the presentation, and it's likely that you'll have some sort of dry run through the morning of as well, and I think that if you are confident with your pitch, and what you've created shouldn't be a big adjustment from, you know

108
00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:46.079
Kevin Kaspar: the comfort of your apartment if you were talking to multiple people, and just presenting in front of anyone and everyone you can get your hands on. So yeah, I think just just having conversations with people is the most important thing.

109
00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:46.829
Kevin Kaspar: But

110
00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:49.769
Kevin Kaspar: moving into the elevator pitch.

111
00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:52.109
Kevin Kaspar: I think it's really hard to

112
00:18:53.549 --> 00:19:01.409
Kevin Kaspar: communicate everything that you want in in a very short amount of time and 60 s transparently is a pretty short amount of time, but it forces you to really

113
00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:05.319
Kevin Kaspar: synthesize the most important information that you want to tell. And

114
00:19:05.509 --> 00:19:29.339
Kevin Kaspar: one way that I like to think about this is the 60 s elevator pitch gives you a chance to answer the very simple question of like, what do you do like? Who are you? What are you building? What are you trying to solve? Like literally? What does your company do cause. If they can walk away 60 s into your pitch and say, alright, you know this is the founder. He runs this type of company, and they're focused on this.

115
00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:31.147
Kevin Kaspar: You're pretty successful.

116
00:19:31.959 --> 00:19:35.079
Kevin Kaspar: so kind of leading with that simple thought in mind.

117
00:19:35.099 --> 00:19:47.409
Kevin Kaspar: I've structured these into more of like a do's and don'ts. This is again just my personal preference. But I think it is important to write a script out when you are editing a document. Live. It's so helpful to be able to visually see

118
00:19:47.469 --> 00:19:55.347
Kevin Kaspar: how you can connect words and create transitions that are more authentic and more like powerful.

119
00:19:56.069 --> 00:20:02.349
Kevin Kaspar: and I think it's really important to also like fight for every word that you put on that page. Because

120
00:20:02.529 --> 00:20:09.279
Kevin Kaspar: even things like transitioning between sentences or introducing topics or concluding topics.

121
00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:26.649
Kevin Kaspar: When you only have 60 s, they really matter. But one thing that happens as a result of this sometimes is people try to over memorize, so they don't sound authentic, and they also stumble on any missed words that they have. I see this a lot with with tech stars. Founders sometimes is

122
00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:27.939
Kevin Kaspar: when you

123
00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:53.239
Kevin Kaspar: have such an important event that you've worked very hard to prepare for. If you do mess up, live on stage, it can be hard to like get back into it. So what I always like to do is make sure that you have the mental points in your head of, like the the 6 things you're trying to say in your 60 s. Right? So you might have your 60 s pitch all written out in like a paragraph, but I would also have 6 bullets like, alright, I wanna tell that story. Then I wanna bring that stat in. Then I wanna introduce myself.

124
00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:59.739
Kevin Kaspar: you know. Then I want to explain the problem. And then I wanna, you know, lead into the demo. Because if you have that built into your mind.

125
00:20:59.829 --> 00:21:03.769
Kevin Kaspar: even if you do kind of fumble, and you have challenges

126
00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:26.149
Kevin Kaspar: saying the things that you memorize. You can still run through that mental picture in your logic, and be able to like recover in a very clear way. The other thing is, no one knows what your what your you know. Word, document, said. They only know what you're saying, live. So it doesn't matter if you mess up truthfully. I have completely. Bs things on stage live multiple times, and

127
00:21:26.259 --> 00:21:38.121
Kevin Kaspar: people truly don't know if you're confident and able to actually just like, articulate the information that you want to say, even if it isn't in the exact language that you might have intended to.

128
00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:57.939
Kevin Kaspar: I really think that storytelling is important. I think that it's the best way to engage an audience in the most authentic way. So I'm a big proponent of storytelling. Whether it's a customer story, whether it's a personal story, something that you can really bring the audience in, because if you're able to explain

129
00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:26.089
Kevin Kaspar: very specifically how your product might support one specific user. It's much easier for them if they have a very deep understanding of that one user to be able to broaden it out and say, Okay, well, they're in this, you know, they're in this one customer segment. But we also have a broader vision to tackle these other markets as well. You can justify that a lot easier if you have a very clear picture in your mind of how your product will solve problems for one specific user group.

130
00:22:28.229 --> 00:22:29.179
Kevin Kaspar: I think

131
00:22:29.989 --> 00:22:35.509
Kevin Kaspar: 1 one challenge, though, is, you're not going to be able to say everything that you want in

132
00:22:35.779 --> 00:22:47.659
Kevin Kaspar: that you might have in a in a given deck. Right? If you're pitching to an investor, it's gonna be, you know, 10 plus minutes with a deck. This isn't that type of pitch, and I think that's really important to kind of note. So

133
00:22:47.779 --> 00:23:04.559
Kevin Kaspar: it's more about giving your listeners a more holistic view of your company. More from some sort of bird's eye level. I think, when you're answering those QA. You're able to kind of dig much deeper and answer some of the specific topics that are critical to your business. But

134
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:07.816
Kevin Kaspar: I think of it a little bit more of a bird's eye view

135
00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:09.499
Kevin Kaspar: than a deck might be.

136
00:23:10.935 --> 00:23:22.183
Kevin Kaspar: People have a lot of different viewpoints on like when to introduce yourself. Some people think that it's bad to introduce yourself in the very beginning. Some people think that you should introduce yourself in the middle.

137
00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:30.979
Kevin Kaspar: My only thing is, do it whenever you want, but don't shy away from it. I feel like, because sometimes it is like a concern that a lot of people have.

138
00:23:31.069 --> 00:23:35.169
Kevin Kaspar: You are the founder. You're the CEO right like you want to be able to communicate

139
00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:44.739
Kevin Kaspar: and introduce yourself in a very confident way, so definitely. Don't shy away from that introduction. It can feel like you're a little bit ruining the flow. Yeah, what's up, Jennifer?

140
00:23:45.631 --> 00:24:05.879
Jennifer Loh: Okay? So in the very beginning, when they're like introducing us and having us come to the stage, they are gonna introduce us. And then I think we have the the choice of doing video first, then pitch, then QA. Or pitch, then QA. Or pitch, then video, then. QA. So just curious. Oh, you won't be introducing us.

141
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.280
Jennifer Loh: Okay.

142
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.770
Jennifer Loh: so then.

143
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.849
Jennifer Loh: do you recommend, like any specific flow, whether we do the video first or the pitch first.

144
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.420
Jennifer Loh: and then introducing ourselves or not.

145
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.410
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah.

146
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:19.980
Jennifer Loh: Yeah.

147
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.500
Kevin Kaspar: I'll I'll defer to Liliana for a second if yeah.

148
00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.700
Kevin Kaspar: I think.

149
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:40.189
Lilliana Robinson: Most people do pitch first. But if you have a specific reason why you think video first might be better, maybe like your company. Jlo. Then we let you do video first. But most people do pitch first so that they know who you are and what's going on. And then the video will enhance the pitch.

150
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.899
Jennifer Loh: Okay, cool. That makes sense.

151
00:24:45.620 --> 00:25:07.330
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah, I would. I would kind of agree, I think, introducing yourself and getting to know, like, who is building the company who's founding the company before they show the demo actually builds a lot of trust with the user and with the audience. So I'm always a proponent of showing the the the pitch first, and then, yeah, I guess if you're not introducing yourself, they're not introducing, you definitely find a way to weave that in.

152
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.660
Kevin Kaspar: What's up.

153
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:20.479
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah. So it just a comment of the following up to what Art said I, I heard the same thing that you guys will introduce ourselves, and and I think some mentor recommending not to

154
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:25.370
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: quote unquote waste time introducing ourselves because it's just 60 s. So

155
00:25:25.843 --> 00:25:28.990
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: which one is the the final call, please.

156
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.679
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, can someone unmute and remind me where you guys heard that cause?

157
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.845
Lilliana Robinson: I don't think I've ever said that we've always done the same.

158
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:44.679
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: That was Troy, Troy. I think if I, if I remember, Troy, said, do not belong. Waste time introducing yourself in 67.

159
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.400
Kevin Kaspar: Like that.

160
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.139
Art-ClubReq: Yeah, it was on.

161
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.910
Jennifer Loh: He said that.

162
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.160
Art-ClubReq: Always. Call, yeah.

163
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.660
Lilliana Robinson: Troy was not. That was not accurate.

164
00:25:50.660 --> 00:26:01.569
NSG: No, no, no! What he's saying, what he's saying is actually legit. So he's saying, don't waste time introducing yourself, which is good advice, but I don't think it doesn't sound like, he said, that someone else will be introducing you.

165
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.389
NSG: because that's not necessary.

166
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:15.359
Lilliana Robinson: He always says, Don't spend time introducing yourself, because no one cares so like when you say like, Hi, I'm this, and this is my company, everyone will tune you out. I remember, he says, that every time, like just start with the story.

167
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:23.989
Doug Rogers: And, by the way, when we say introductions, I think there might be some confusion where it's like, and the next company is dub prime

168
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.640
Doug Rogers: that's going to happen. So we know who to go up.

169
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:39.590
Lilliana Robinson: So you'll know your order, and you'll be lined up, and I'll be queuing you up, and your Walkup music will play. But you all know your order. You'll know it way before, and we'll rehearse it, and you'll be sitting in your order, and then we'll put you up there.

170
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:49.989
NSG: If if it flows just fine guys like I I wouldn't. I wouldn't overthink the the logistics of this. It's super smooth. The music you pick is really, it's a seamless experience.

171
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:55.790
NSG: Great.

172
00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.927
Kevin Kaspar: If there's any lingering questions about that, we can answer them as well. But

173
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:06.129
Kevin Kaspar: again, like answering what they do with that pitch, I think, is the most helpful information

174
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:16.013
Kevin Kaspar: I think getting creative with this is great. One thing that I've found a lot of value in has been brainstorming just like very creative ways to present your information.

175
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:45.614
Kevin Kaspar: it's hard to be creative in a pitch sometimes because I think we've seen so many of them that we wanna create our own like version of whatever we've seen in the past. I would definitely spend some time brainstorming just like ways that you want to be able to tell your story. That you might not have already thought about before trying something completely new on Demo Day may not be the best way to approach it. But there might be different variations or ways to communicate that you haven't fully thought of in depth before. That might be worth thinking about.

176
00:27:46.400 --> 00:28:05.968
Kevin Kaspar: yeah, exactly. I think the comment about about experience is pretty relevant. I actually saw a post about this on A, with a text founder from my cohort a few years ago, like they really care more about what you're building than who you are. And the impact that it's gonna have on your customers. And the like problem that you're solving

177
00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.180
Kevin Kaspar: so definitely

178
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.480
Kevin Kaspar: doing.

179
00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.830
Kevin Kaspar: And then

180
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.760
Kevin Kaspar: the last thing is focus.

181
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:25.930
Kevin Kaspar: I think it's sometimes overlooked, but definitely important to focus on, like the posture, the way that you're walking and the presence that you have on stage.

182
00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:34.749
Kevin Kaspar: It's best practice to not walk all over the stage when you're talking. I think that you can move around a little bit, but

183
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:48.991
Kevin Kaspar: when you're speaking especially important, like sentences like, I would kind of plant your feet and just speak if you're like transitioning from 1 point to the next, you can move around a little bit, but definitely try and kind of plant your feet here.

184
00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.410
Kevin Kaspar: so

185
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.149
Kevin Kaspar: that's more like logistical. But yeah, what's up.

186
00:28:54.530 --> 00:29:00.200
Jennifer Loh: Okay, so we have one slide that we have presented while we're doing.

187
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.569
Jennifer Loh: or is it only during our QA. Or during our pitch.

188
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.299
Lilliana Robinson: It's only during your Q. And A.

189
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:10.619
Jennifer Loh: Got it. So when we walk up and we do our 60 s pitch essentially, this screens blank.

190
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:25.669
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, and this is spotlight on you. So it's like that in all the examples. If you wanna see an example. And also I'm gonna upload my demo day format slide where I walk through the format because it says that like very explicitly. So I'll just post that on base camp right now, in case anybody needs to see it.

191
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.300
Jennifer Loh: Got it. Okay, cool.

192
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:37.380
NSG: It. It may also make sense for some of you all to re-watch the the demo day workshop that Liliana gave, where she kind of talks through all these things.

193
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:41.759
Jennifer Loh: I know I was there, and I also went to Demo Day. I just like.

194
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.560
Jennifer Loh: for some reason, can't visualize it at the moment. But thank you.

195
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.760
Kevin Kaspar: So once your pitch is done, you'll start. Turn.

196
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:58.270
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah, let's wait. Let's answer all those intro questions. Any questions about introductions, or the format, or things like that.

197
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:04.430
Lilliana Robinson: Pause to make sure this is clear, cause everything Kevin's gonna say is very important. So I wanna make sure that we are on the same page altogether.

198
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.149
Lilliana Robinson: I appreciate whoever told me that

199
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.999
Lilliana Robinson: there was that misconception. Thank you for bringing that up.

200
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:35.769
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I think we're good to move on, Kevin and Jeremy, I completely agree. If the story is part of your pitch, you should do it. I think, Troy was saying. More like a lot of people will like, tell a bunch about themselves, and then introduce themselves, and only spend like 30 s on the business. A lot of people do that when they first try to write a pitch like Hi, I'm Blink and I'm building blank.

201
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:43.770
Lilliana Robinson: It's not going to be a very good pitch, so just cutting that already before you guys even start writing it. That's what Troy was trying to do last week.

202
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:45.790
Kevin Kaspar: Advice!

203
00:30:45.910 --> 00:31:08.679
Kevin Kaspar: Alright! So moving on, you'll walk up on stage. You'll have the music. You'll give your 60 s pitch live spotlights directly on you. Then the demo is gonna come up. I think that the first piece of advice with this demo is this is your chance to basically showcase the progress that you've made, taking your like idea and your pitch and making it very real for the customers, or for the listeners. So

204
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:18.168
Kevin Kaspar: I think it's important to think here, this is your just your chance to communicate. Hey? This is what we've built. This is the traction that we have. Here's how people are interacting with the product.

205
00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.320
Kevin Kaspar: and when you get to the demo, I think that

206
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:38.850
Kevin Kaspar: people by nature are going to handle this a little bit differently. I always think that it is and can be helpful to start blending in like more of a user centric approach towards this product. Demo. So thinking about ways that, like the user would actually interact with the product. What are the like?

207
00:31:39.010 --> 00:32:04.780
Kevin Kaspar: How would it flow? What are the values that they're gonna be getting out of this product. What's the traction that you have? So just think about ways that you can maybe incorporate things that you might have wanted to say in your QA. Or in your pitch, that you can infuse into your demo, because the demo shouldn't be, you know, login page. Then all these other things right? We, I think that you've heard that information before you wanna be able to like, still, tell a very cohere cohesive narrative, but

208
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:11.760
Kevin Kaspar: still be able to like extract really important and meaningful, like insights during those 60 s.

209
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:25.240
Kevin Kaspar: so again, like maybe treating this as a little bit of a continuation of your pitch but don't don't use this as time to like. Say things that you wanted to fit into your sex 60 s pitch that you couldn't. This is a demo. I want

210
00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:52.045
Kevin Kaspar: like definitely to make it clear that you should be spending your time showcasing your product. The thing that you have built and how it actually functions. But like painting, that storyline, I think, is still important. Maybe you can bring in the user that you mentioned from your 60 s pitch into your demo. Or maybe you can now talk about what people are saying about your product and the like, the value that you're adding for them.

211
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.850
Kevin Kaspar: so definitely think about that.

212
00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:03.190
Kevin Kaspar: And then I think it is important to make sure that your your product. Demo is like visually appealing that you've spent a lot of time energy.

213
00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:12.360
Kevin Kaspar: Then if you want to invest in, you know the quality of your video, you're more than welcome to do so. I've seen a very big mix. I've seen you know.

214
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.971
Kevin Kaspar: as far as like

215
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.430
Kevin Kaspar: the

216
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:38.820
Kevin Kaspar: like. One example is, there was a company that their wives recorded the video and did the voice over, and I think that they did it themselves. But it looks really really nice. And that was great. They were very resourceful, like very entrepreneurial, of finding a way for the demo to look sound and feel good without spending, you know, a lot of money or going overboard on it so

217
00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:54.009
Kevin Kaspar: definitely put some time into it. Don't throw it together last minute, but as long as you're proactive I think that it will turn out nicely. Think about how you want to incorporate. You know what your branding looks like, how you are presenting yourself in a creative way, and I think that you'll you'll be in a good spot.

218
00:33:54.570 --> 00:34:05.206
Lilliana Robinson: Evan, I think there, there also is a way to kind of like not put enough effort into it because we watched bloom filters with them, and he had his wife do a voiceover, and it sounded so robotic, and it was.

219
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.100
Kevin Kaspar: But.

220
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:18.452
Lilliana Robinson: If you remember. So like, there were groups that do it low cost. And it looks really nice, like the unbuilt vert video you saw with the furniture company that cost them basically nothing like they just did it themselves.

221
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:37.839
Lilliana Robinson: but yeah, make sure that it's at least high enough quality that you would be proud of it. And you're not just mailing it in cause, like we still tell Andrew that that was a really bad video, and he knows it, and like I'm sure if he just put in a little bit more effort, even low cost no money, he would be happier with it so just remember that your future self will thank you for that extra effort.

222
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:53.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you all want a pro perspective on it. Max, Tim has done amazing professional video work. He does it himself. Self taught, and he's incredible at it. So talk to Max. If you really feel like you're stuck on the video front.

223
00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.120
Kevin Kaspar: Awesome.

224
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.020
Kevin Kaspar: Alright.

225
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.090
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah. David.

226
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.570
David Akinyemi: Yeah, could you go back? One slide? And I guess.

227
00:35:05.922 --> 00:35:13.019
David Akinyemi: I guess, could you paint more color around? Build the video, don't build the video around users. This is a product. Demo.

228
00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:20.600
David Akinyemi: I guess something we were considering was kind of communicating how our product impacts the users.

229
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.770
David Akinyemi: Kind of want to understand a little bit, if maybe.

230
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:29.229
David Akinyemi: what? What you're kind of saying in this don't. So just so we're not doing anything that you think could be detrimental kind of thing.

231
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:45.855
Kevin Kaspar: I think that's a great piece of advice like I think that the way that you're thinking about it is totally on track. I wouldn't be overly concerned. I just don't want you to take all of your time away from actually showcasing what you've built as long as there's like a you like, as long as there's a balance between

232
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:52.501
Kevin Kaspar: talking about how the users are interacting with the product and actually showcasing the product. I think that you're in a pretty good spot.

233
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.560
David Akinyemi: Thank you.

234
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.180
Kevin Kaspar: Antonio.

235
00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:08.100
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, very similar question. We are Pre product. We were thinking of using the first 10 s for putting some highlights from the Gtb interviews just some recordings. And

236
00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.576
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I guess it's that's okay, correct, like,

237
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.480
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: as long as it doesn't take the whole video, you're saying. But 10 s of a users, feedback or user users input should be okay. Right?

238
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:32.220
Kevin Kaspar: I think so. I don't know if Neil or Liliana have any comments on this, but the best way to show that people are liking your product is by having words and like things from your user saying that they get value out of it. So I don't see any problem with it.

239
00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.720
Lilliana Robinson: Agreed.

240
00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:34.610
Lilliana Robinson: Goal.

241
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.790
Lilliana Robinson: Good.

242
00:36:37.853 --> 00:36:39.360
Kevin Kaspar: Awesome alright

243
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:40.500
Kevin Kaspar: moving on.

244
00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.930
Kevin Kaspar: Sorry. This is supposed to say 4 min, but

245
00:36:43.330 --> 00:37:06.660
Kevin Kaspar: I think the last 4 min really gives you a chance to like. Lean into everything that you've learned. Over your time at techstars. I think this is a way to build a lot of trust with your audience to be able to showcase a vast amount of your learnings in a very short amount of time. It's kind of nice that you. Will liana correct me if I'm wrong, have some sort of insight into the questions that will be asked ahead of time.

246
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.200
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, it'll be completely scripted with your eir.

247
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:10.750
Kevin Kaspar: So

248
00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:19.009
Kevin Kaspar: that's great. Right? So you'll be able to kind of manufacture the conversation that you want to have and I think, being very

249
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:27.480
Kevin Kaspar: like transparent and honest and communicative about your experience, and what you've learned is the best way to have a really good QA. So

250
00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:38.909
Kevin Kaspar: I think, designing the QA. For what you want to say is is really really important. Spend a lot of time thinking about the questions that you might want to get asked and how you want to answer them. So

251
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.843
Kevin Kaspar: I think there's definitely a unique balance of like, how many questions you get asked?

252
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:49.029
Kevin Kaspar: I would. I would imagine it would be between like 4 and 6. But I'm not sure, Leona, do you have any thoughts on that.

253
00:37:49.300 --> 00:38:07.740
Lilliana Robinson: It's as many as you can comfortably answer, so I always say it's better to break them up, so don't have like 3 with super long answers like a mini each people are gonna have their eyes glaze over, but having those same answers split up amongst 4 or 5 questions, is probably the sweet spot. It depends how long your answers are. How

254
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:14.880
Lilliana Robinson: the pace that you go at is so it'll be different for each of you, but I would agree with Kevin. Between like 4 and 6 is probably where you'll land.

255
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:36.610
Lilliana Robinson: and the last question for everyone will be W. How can the audience here help you today, and that'll be your closing statement. So it'll take like 10 s, so you can make your whole set without that, and we'll go over that with you in the final week, and everyone will have a closing statement for about 10 s, and that'll be, you know, whatever your goal is, and you're asking the audience for that, and then you thank them and leave

256
00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:38.640
Lilliana Robinson: great.

257
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.890
Kevin Kaspar: Awesome.

258
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:47.073
Kevin Kaspar: So one thing that I think is helpful here. Is to be like very answer first with your

259
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:55.500
Kevin Kaspar: with your QA. So what I mean by that is, if I ask you who your target customers are starting with, like my target customers are.

260
00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:08.308
Kevin Kaspar: you know all the insights that you found from your Jtbd. And then, if you want to add any more commentary after that, being able to like, kind of go back, set a little context communicate. But I think,

261
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:16.070
Kevin Kaspar: you don't want to wait 45 s to get the answer to a question. You want to be able to get the answer upfront. So just be thoughtful about that.

262
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:18.740
Kevin Kaspar: And then

263
00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:42.050
Kevin Kaspar: I think it's important to like sequence. The questions right and the way that you're thinking about your demo and your 60 s pitch, you wanna be able to let the story flow in a like a narrative that works best for for you and for what you've built, so feel free to sequence the questions in any way that you think is best. This is kind of like, in my opinion, a little bit of a hack. Because.

264
00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.030
Kevin Kaspar: Ed.

265
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:54.473
Kevin Kaspar: it does set you up very nicely. If you are thoughtful about this don't overthink it like I think you know your company pretty well. So if there is an order that you think is best, just kind of lean in and jump into that.

266
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.360
Kevin Kaspar: yeah, Neil.

267
00:39:57.568 --> 00:40:08.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just a reminder to folks. The the notion here is that it's connected to your goal. Some of you have a goal of investor conversations and fundraising. Some of you have partnership or customer acquisition goals, whatever it is.

268
00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:14.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: be brutally like, focused on orienting your conversation with your eir

269
00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:33.019
Neal Sáles-Griffin: around speaking to those people in the room, and for the video that you'll have that you can share afterwards. You don't have to cater to everyone at once. It's not important to do that. It's much more important for you to get your full value from the experience by directing the energy and the conversation in the way that would be optimal for your goal.

270
00:40:35.580 --> 00:41:00.679
Kevin Kaspar: Great point, and I think that's where the ask becomes, you know, even more critical as well, right ending, ending the conversation with being very poignant about what you want and what you're trying to get out of this. And I think, answering that question now is a great way to structure your entire pitch around that to get the most out of it. So at the end definitely have a formal well thought out question to ask so that you can target the people in the room that you care about most.

271
00:41:00.929 --> 00:41:09.900
Kevin Kaspar: I think it's important to only make one ask. I've seen some founders try and make multiple asks. And I think that it adds some complexity. So just be very targeted. And what you're asking for

272
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:37.390
Kevin Kaspar: And then I think it's great to answer like hard questions and to be transparent and be honest like people know that entrepreneurship is hard, that you're working through a lot of big challenges, and it is really helpful, I think, that you build a lot of trust when you have transparency and what you're building and the way that you've been going about this process so definitely. Don't be afraid to answer challenging questions. Because you guys are all really smart. You're able to kind of work through that as well. So.

273
00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:49.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It. It's more impressive and more memorable if you address challenging questions. It's it's honestly like kind of a let down, I think, to some folks investors I've spoken to when they feel like

274
00:41:49.496 --> 00:42:02.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for anybody who knows baseball cream puffs. Anybody know this analogy cream puffs. So I didn't know this either, but Brad taught us because he's a baseball player but cream puffs are basically like really really easy pitches to hit.

275
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you don't. You don't want the softballs.

276
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.410
Kevin Kaspar: And to be honest. Oh, right?

277
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:23.670
Kevin Kaspar: Okay. So that's most of what I have. So I've gone through those I'm going to give you some last like parting tips, and then we can use the rest of the time. However, you think is most helpful, but

278
00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:42.439
Kevin Kaspar: I think the most important thing here is like you really have to love your pitch more than anyone. If you don't love your pitch, you're not gonna feel confident on stage. You're gonna be nervous when you go up and present and I think all of that really just comes with time and patience and continue to revisiting of your of your pitch, so make sure that you are proactive.

279
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:52.300
Kevin Kaspar: Starting now all the way through Demo Day. I know that you're trying to also build a company at the same time that you're trying to prepare for Demo Day, which can create some unique challenges. But

280
00:42:52.890 --> 00:43:04.540
Kevin Kaspar: I mean being thoughtful about this every day blocking out just a small amount of time, I think, will go a really long ways and create a a pitch and a product and a you know a storyline that you're really proud of.

281
00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:24.691
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And can you make that more practical and real? What you just said? Because I kind of want you to say it louder for the people in the back what you just said about practicing every day like W. One practicing every day to recording all of your pitches, and 3 having a spreadsheet or a database of all of your pitches and recordings and formats.

282
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:33.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm saying all this because I've seen a few founders do it. Not most, but a few meticulously have recorded and tracked and organized

283
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:42.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: all of their pitches that they've attempted, and have shared versions of their pitches with different people for that kind of feedback because of how seriously they were taking it.

284
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:49.199
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah, so really great way of looking at it. So trying to be as concrete as possible, I think.

285
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.450
Kevin Kaspar: blocking out

286
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:55.809
Kevin Kaspar: 30 min to an hour at least a day starting now moving forward.

287
00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:22.819
Kevin Kaspar: If you're thinking about something continuously from now until Demo day, you're just going to do a much better job, and I think it starts with getting your first version of what you want your pitch script to look like what you want your demo layout to be, what questions you want to be asked, and how you want to create those answers, and being very specific about what your ask is, and then backtracking that to create a very coherent pitch overall, I think. Do you guys are working on that right now.

288
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:43.700
Kevin Kaspar: getting as close as you can and finalizing that this week is really important and then start getting pitch feedback. As Neil mentioned, you can send different versions of different pitches to different people to get various types of feedback logging. It is critical, I think, like notion or drive, or any way of documenting and maintaining that is great because oftentimes

289
00:44:43.700 --> 00:45:06.480
Kevin Kaspar: probably what will happen is you'll create version one, and then you'll share it, and then you'll create version 2, and then you might end up going back to version one at version 8, because you realize that you actually communicated it in the best way earlier on so documenting all of your progress. Is really important, because there might be things that you've said in other versions that you want to bring back later. And the worst thing is not remembering what you said

290
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:08.360
Kevin Kaspar: you have a question.

291
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:23.530
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, so, and you might have said that before on other other calls, but to get feedback. Besides our lead mentors, who who can we send these information, Liliana, Neil, or what's the best way to get feedback from the staff and mentors.

292
00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:35.820
Lilliana Robinson: Any eir that you have me, Neil. The whole team, Chloe, put it in your base camp. A lot of people already have put it in your individual base camp and tag us and ask for feedback, or send it to your eir, or both.

293
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.923
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Thank you.

294
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:48.259
Lilliana Robinson: And then, yeah, a lot of people in the network like Becky from Aws is very interested in helping you guys a couple of other people. So if you want us to help you find some mentors to help, we can do that as well.

295
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think you should also share it with founders who've done it.

296
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.630
Kevin Kaspar: Yeah.

297
00:45:52.110 --> 00:46:04.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Pitches that you like founders that you're connected to, that you've met throughout this program experience, people who've given pitches in some of the videos. You saw that you thought were phenomenal. You can reach out to those. Ceos are all in the family. You have a lot of options to get feedback and input.

298
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:34.041
Kevin Kaspar: I also always like to plug the cohort that you're in right now, like your your other founders are the best resource possible, like building alongside them, trying to brainstorm together ways that you can create. You know, creative pitches and demos. The most help I've gotten are people from vastly different industries than me. So I think, sharing your pitch and getting feedback from your own peers is also just like a really really great way. To accelerate your growth. And confidence. So

299
00:46:34.600 --> 00:47:01.699
Kevin Kaspar: yeah, I would get a lot of high quality feedback in a short amount of time. Looks like you only have about 3 weeks before Demo Day, which is a little bit of an accelerated timeline. So make sure that you're like revising and iterating constantly if you break out like an hour a day to iterate. You'll feel much more confident, because you'll have seen it time and time and time again, and just like, make sure you love it. I think that's really important. It gives you that confidence. And then, once you have everything where you want it to be like.

300
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:14.439
Kevin Kaspar: do as much as you can to relax and just practice because you do want to have that finalized, you know, as as far out in advance as possible. So that you can go up and crush it. And at the end of May. But

301
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:22.418
Kevin Kaspar: that's everything that I have. That's my email. That's my phone number. You can also find me on Linkedin pretty rarely available. So

302
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:27.539
Kevin Kaspar: please feel free to reach out. You know, someone asked, who can help. I'm more than happy to like

303
00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:34.285
Kevin Kaspar: find time, one on one with you guys. If that would be helpful. So please feel free to reach out. I'm more than happy to help, but

304
00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I love that you have the meal village photo for the.

305
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.160
Kevin Kaspar: It's my! It's one of my favorite pitches of all time.

306
00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:40.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Good. Yeah.

307
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One for the.

308
00:47:42.240 --> 00:48:01.460
Lilliana Robinson: I was wondering this was a helping elderly people get meal delivery and the woman in the back on his QA. Slide was giving a testimonial on how it changed her life in his video. So he just wanted to hammer that home and put her back on the screen for his one slide, which was a very creative use of it. I thought it was really powerful.

309
00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:03.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And it doesn't sound like a very like.

310
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:10.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, sexy business. But I think Robbie was between one or 2 million in AR at the time. Right? Yeah, yeah.

311
00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:12.660
Lilliana Robinson: It was an outstanding company.

312
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:40.922
Lilliana Robinson: Kevin. Thank you so much. This was awesome. I recommend that everybody go back and watch this again with the do's and don'ts write down what you think that you need to work on for each section. Each of those are extremely potent. I've helped people try and do or do not do each of those points that Kevin has put so really, really important there. And Neil wanted to just add one more thing with product. Demo Kevin, if you still have more time to just stick around so you can comment as well.

313
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:49.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. Can can. For some bonus time. Are you all cool if I share my favorite product, demo Video, is that cool? Alright? So this is the Oldie, but a goodie.

314
00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:52.427
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's one that I share with.

315
00:48:52.980 --> 00:49:01.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: my, all my Northwestern students over the past 10 years. I don't think I've ever shared it with my tech stars founders because it's a 4 min

316
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: product video.

317
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:11.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But there's a reason, given all the questions and energy that I'm picking up on with y'all, that I want to show you this 4 min product video. So some of you might know this.

318
00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:13.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: has anyone ever seen

319
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:15.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the dropbox.

320
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Mvp. Video.

321
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Anybody here? No hands.

322
00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:40.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, hell, yeah. Alright! Alright game. Oh, Valeria seen it! You've seen it. Alright! Good! Alright! So I have something to say about it. But I want you to pay attention to it, like whatever you're doing. If you got text messages, notifications on your phone, you doing multitasking video off whatever. Give me 4 min and 19 s of your time, plus another minute or 2 to talk about it.

323
00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I promise you it'll be worth it. All right. Here we go.

324
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:46.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Go here.

325
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: do this.

326
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I need to choose to share sound. Let me see, am I smart enough?

327
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Can I pull this off

328
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: share.

329
00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: share, computer, sound

330
00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright good to go.

331
00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:09.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We'll be taking a quick tour of dropbox, which is a better way of keeping your important stuff synchronized across your Pcs.

332
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:15.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And what makes dropbox different is that it just works, meaning that there's no complicated setup or configuration.

333
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:25.019
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you're familiar with development tools, dropbox is kind of like taking subversion and our sink and making them easy to use. So here we'll walk through a concrete example.

334
00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:40.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And so I just got a new laptop, and I've got some important files on my desktop that I like to keep synchronized across both machines and to set up dropbox. All you really have to do is install the application which I did a moment ago, and then link it to an account. So I typed in my information there.

335
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:57.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it brings me to this web interface, where I can see recent changes to the files in my dropbox, and I can actually get the files directly. So in in addition to synchronizing files across Pcs dropbox also securely backs them up and synchronize them to the web. So you can click on any of these files, and it does what you'd expect

336
00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in case you're not at one of your computers.

337
00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And as far as the windows interface.

338
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's actually not it. Let me fix it 1 s.

339
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:11.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That is the second video that they did. This is the first, my bad

340
00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 1, s.

341
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: pull this out

342
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then

343
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: share.

344
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:32.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you all remember this, though like, do you all remember when Dropbox came out, or like back in the day when, like, you couldn't actually do that functionality does anybody? Is anybody old enough to remember that where you had to carry these giant hard drives around when I was in college on campus.

345
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:35.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But anyway, this is better. There we go. So let's go here.

346
00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: jump ahead.

347
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:44.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Part's different is that it just works. And there isn't any complicated setup or interface to learn.

348
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let's get started.

349
00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I've already installed Dropbox on a windows. PC, and put a bunch of files in.

350
00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:57.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And now I want to sync these files to my Mac. So to do that I just installed Dropbox. And now I'm linking my Mac to my account.

351
00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:04.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So in a second my account will be linked, and you can see that the files that were on my windows. PC. Will start coming down.

352
00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:21.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and what we're looking at is my dropbox folder, which looks and acts like any other folder. Except for 2 things, one, these little green icons that indicate files are up to date, and 2, anything in my dropbox is synced across all of my computers into the web, and you'll notice that when I make changes, everything syncs up pretty quickly.

353
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:26.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And as another example, I'm going to log in my windows. PC.

354
00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:34.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Where you'll see that not only are the changes from my Mac already here, but if I make another change to a file. So, for example, this picture of a platypus.

355
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:38.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then I hit save

356
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the change begins uploading immediately.

357
00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and when I go back to my Mac.

358
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the change is reflected in a matter of seconds.

359
00:52:50.360 --> 00:53:03.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the point is, if you've ever worked with multiple computers or carried around a USB drive or emailed yourself files from work. You can see this is a much easier way of managing your stuff, and we also protect you from the bad things that can happen to your files. So if I delete a bunch of stuff.

360
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:06.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we have this web interface

361
00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:12.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: where you can not only get to your files in case you're not at one of your computers. So here are the contents of my dropbox here.

362
00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:18.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But we have this show deleted files link where you can select a file that you've deleted, and then you have an option to bring it back

363
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and a couple of clicks. So I'll do that.

364
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and instantly the file's back.

365
00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:33.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And not only do you have the option of restoring the most recent version, but actually any prior version of a file, because every time you make a change. Dropbox saves a snapshot

366
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:44.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and dropbox is also very efficient about the way it handles changes to files, and sends only the pieces that change. So in the case of the plateau's picture, just sending the Delta saved over 80% of the bandwidth.

367
00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:52.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that covers a lot of how we make it easy to access and protect your own files. But the other half of what we do revolves around making it really easy to share and put files online.

368
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:59.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So normally, if I want to share something, I have to send an email attachment or something like that. But Dropbox has a special public folder

369
00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:03.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: where every file you put in here has a yeah URL associated with it.

370
00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:05.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I can get a public link.

371
00:54:06.562 --> 00:54:14.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then I can paste that into an IM window or an email or a blog post. And it does what you'd expect.

372
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:20.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's great for individual files. But we also make it possible to share entire folders

373
00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:46.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so hopefully. That gives you an idea of how much easier dropbox makes it to share files. And with that we'll wrap up. We're still in private, Beta, but you can visit us and sign up to give it a shot at Www. Get dropbox. Com. Thanks

374
00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:50.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright. So

375
00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the most interesting thing about this video to me was one.

376
00:54:54.530 --> 00:55:02.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It went viral back in the day when it went out it got them in the Y combinator, and I think, got them over 500 k. In funding, and like.

377
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:08.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think, over a hundred 1,000 people signed up for their wait lists to learn more from that link at the end.

378
00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:18.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what is most fascinating about that product, demo, though, is that you all kind of look at that functionality? Go, yeah, yeah, cool we get. It

379
00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: turns out

380
00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: most of that functionality had not yet been implemented.

381
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:39.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It was a fake. It was like a it was like a fake it till you make it situation where they were presenting the functionality they intended to develop. Once they brought on the full engineering team that they needed to do so, but they wanted to demonstrate their intent of what they wanted the product to do.

382
00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:43.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that is actually the most interesting part of the video that doesn't get talked about enough.

383
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:50.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which is, you can show what I call the happy path of your product even before the full functionality is there.

384
00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:58.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I didn't win as much money as Kevin, but I did win over $100,000 winning hackathons back in the day because I understood this lesson.

385
00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:06.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which is, it's less about having everything done and more about communicating your vision for what benefits the product will afford the user.

386
00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:29.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So when would? So this video literally went viral back in the day. And it's like the quintessential Silicon Valley tech product Demo cause they knew their audience. They had a bunch of quirky Easter eggs and funny references. They knew who they were trying to appeal to with this. You know, message. So I share that with you all to hopefully inspire you, to help you realize, like you don't have to have your product done done

387
00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:33.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to render a version of it that communicates what you intend to do with it down the road.

388
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:35.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and how it's going to help.

389
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:39.280
Lilliana Robinson: Antonia.

390
00:56:40.240 --> 00:57:02.010
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah. And on those lines, Neil, you're saying, basically, as long as we are confident that we can accomplish those those features with a good engineering team that we are gonna be hiring after the fundraising. Then it's totally fine to put it right. I mean, we we know that was what features will work it. Just we have. We don't have the resources to implement them. Is that is that the point? And.

391
00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:09.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, yeah. I mean, you want to be honest. You don't want to oversell right? You don't want to overplay your hand and say something you don't know how to do. Drew himself. The founder of Dropbox

392
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:22.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is technical, so he understood what was possible with what he intended to do. So he wasn't over promising on the functionality front, but he was taking some liberties about how everything worked at that point.

393
00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:32.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Was that helpful to share? Hope? I didn't waste people's time. Okay? Good.

394
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:34.130
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah, very helpful.

395
00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:40.490
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: But I.

396
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Guess the last thing I'll say, though, Kevin is just like.

397
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:51.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Look, we can tell when somebody is stressed out talking about their business versus when somebody's super proud, confident, and excited, to talk about their business.

398
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think

399
00:57:52.680 --> 00:58:09.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: practice is going to enable you to feel very confident about what you're saying and doing, and also authenticity to trigger, like your genuine interest and commitment to building this great business of yours, and how excited you are to make that happen and work with people who mean well and want to help you. It doesn't have to be this like tense.

400
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:25.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: awkward, you know, stressful, you know, like like I I hate that like that's not a fun way to live or to run a business or anything. So just if if that's what you're feeling like. Let us help you get over that hump so that you're actually jamming and and enjoying the process in the journey.

401
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.280
Kevin Kaspar: Great point.

402
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:34.080
Kevin Kaspar: that's all I got. So if you guys have any questions happy to you know, stay in touch. But.

403
00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:39.550
Lilliana Robinson: Thank you. Kevin. Okay, I'm gonna end the recording here, and then we'll stick.
