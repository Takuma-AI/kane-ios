### Key Insights

> "Kevin Kaspar: to give you feedback, which has never happened before, which is really cool. So I wanna make sure you guys are prepared. Remember, from Jcbd, part 4 when I did understanding your customers part 4, the final series in the lecture series."

> "Kevin Kaspar: So it's really important that each one is supported by detailed evidence. What do you mean? What do you mean by detailed evidence"

> "Kevin Kaspar: and which cluster are you going after? That's what we really want to hear tomorrow. Okay, here's high level. Here are the 2 clusters we identified. We're going after the second one, because Xyz, here's a key insight. Here's a quote that we found or a key insight was the poll from this cluster. Because, Xyz, just whatever is relevant to you and any implications that you're thinking about going forward. We'll probably that'll be our question in the Q&A, okay. So what are you doing next with this? So start thinking about that."

> "Kevin Kaspar: it's really up to you guys to think about what's most important to share. You're not gonna share all of this, but you do need to have it in your report. So some people write this all up in a Pdf. And then just make like 2 or 3 slides that they share, or you can put it all in slides, and you just know what you're gonna cover during the presentation. And then you post the whole thing. It's up to you guys. But you're not going through the whole report. You're only gonna have 4Â min."

> "Kevin Kaspar: So I think, presenting what you have and clustering what you have. And if you're not done, you can explain, like what you have left to do or what you're going to do, and you can always book time with us to do to show your synthesis when you are finished. So if you're not done, and you don't want to do the full, clustering exercise because you don't have enough like. If you only have 4 you can't really cluster. Just tell us what you've learned so far."
