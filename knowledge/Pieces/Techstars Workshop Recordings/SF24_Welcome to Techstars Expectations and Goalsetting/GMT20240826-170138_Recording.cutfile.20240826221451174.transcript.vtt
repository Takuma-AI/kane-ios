00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.849
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I just started.


2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, lilliana, my, my wi-fi should be good. But if if, in case I chop out or I get slow, just let me know, and I'll make sure that


3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm a.


4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, adjusting. I'll switch to my phone, if need be.


5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But good morning. Good early morning. Good afternoon to some of you. But this is it. I hope you all are ready to kick off pre-program for techclair San Francisco.


6
00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:26.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But we couldn't be more excited. This is like.


7
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, Christmas morning for some of us opening up our our gifts of seeing all the best companies that we could possibly find from all over the world.


8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: all coming together for


9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: our inaugural program. Nsf, so thanks everybody for being here. I hope you feel good. I hope you're excited to get to work.


10
00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:57.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So lilliana and I will be driving through this setting expectations. But the rest of the team will be here to help, too. Our goal here is to not only set the stage for the coming months, but also make sure that we address any and all questions that you all may have, and you get to know each other a little bit, too.


11
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Is that right, lilliana?


12
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:19.939
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, so you can look around. It's the 1st time any of you have seen your classmates which is so exciting, and in a second, we'll let you introduce yourself so you can get to know each other even better. But it's so good to see each and every one of you again. I mean, our team knows each of you, and it's great to see you guys. We've been so excited. So we'll go ahead and go to the next slide. Akadena.


13
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:51.240
Lilliana Robinson: so quick you'll you'll soon learn that I start every single session with announcements, because there's always so much admin to be done. The Ceos should have received pre program, update one which is a massive email with a bunch of really important information that went out in the middle of the day on Friday. Pacific time. So all of our Ceos should have received that and forwarded it to their relevant team. Members


14
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.790
Lilliana Robinson: make sure that you take time to read through that thoroughly. Every single word in there is extremely important.


15
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:10.569
Lilliana Robinson: and we made sure that, like everything you need to know is written out there. So if you have any questions on that, we can answer them at the end of this session. But I wanted to call out 3 important deliverables that are listed in there.


16
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.079
Lilliana Robinson: The 1st one.


17
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.330
Lilliana Robinson: the 1st one I'll skip to the second bullet is class roster forms, which is


18
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:35.329
Lilliana Robinson: how you kind of sign up to be a full time participant in our program. So I listed the considerations in whether all of your team should be a full time program member or not. There are the expectations of you being here for every single required session. But you do get a lot of perks.


19
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:52.339
Lilliana Robinson: such as swag, which is the welcome kit. So once you fill out the class roster, if you are going to be a full time program, participant, you should fill out the welcome, Kit, that does have a deadline because they need to be shipped by a certain time with our fulfillment center. So make sure that you fill out both of those by this Wednesday.


20
00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:08.689
Lilliana Robinson: and it's kind of up to the Ceos to make sure that everyone who's going to be full time is filling that out and then pre work packets. So one of you has already completed this, which is awesome. But we gave you a lot of time because there is a lot to think about in those packets, and we want it to be kind of an exercise. So


21
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.600
Lilliana Robinson: if you need more time, that's totally fine. I gave you a week and a half.


22
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:31.370
Lilliana Robinson: So Wednesday, September 4.th Next week is the deadline. Feel free to finish at any time before then, and send it in, and we will send you a calendar link to have a 1 on one to go over it. And that's kind of your 1st exercise getting ready in the thinking mode of goals and evaluating yourself diagnostically as we're going into program.


23
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.730
Lilliana Robinson: So those are our announcements. I'll go over them again at the end.


24
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.669
Lilliana Robinson: But we can go to the next slide.


25
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.980
Lilliana Robinson: So we'll start with introductions from you guys. You're gonna do your name.


26
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.590
Lilliana Robinson: your company name, and if you're the 1st person to introduce your company. You can give a little one-liner and then tell us what you're most looking forward to in program.


27
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.709
Lilliana Robinson: So I will pop that in the chat. And then, Akkadina, you can go ahead and stop screen sharing for a second while we.


28
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.610
Lilliana Robinson: while we do some intros.


29
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.049
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, here's the prompts.

119
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.650
Lilliana Robinson: Do you want to pick someone from the list? And in the chat.

Kirimgeray Kirimli: Oh, yes,

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:32.000
Yogesh Sabareenath: it's been a big dream come true, to be part of Texas and to be coming to San Francisco. I expect


126
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.300
Yogesh Sabareenath: to have a good connections, good learning, and a better


127
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:41.740
Yogesh Sabareenath: product by our product becoming a better version from the program.


128
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.659
Yogesh Sabareenath: Yeah. So now I'll be picking up


129
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.030
Yogesh Sabareenath: Dominic.


130
00:13:49.740 --> 00:14:07.877
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, awesome. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I just wanna awkwardly address the background. 1st and foremost. This is my family homes office, which is an accolade of my childhood pictures. So start up life trying to figure out where to work from. So there you go.


131
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Looks great.


132
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:23.850
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, yeah. My mom just loves me so much. In all seriousness, I'm I'm Dominique. I'm CEO and co-founder of Agent Luna. We're building AI agents that automate sales and marketing for Smbs.


133
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:34.460
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: What am I most excited for? I mean, there's been so many answers that I relate to here, and I think definitely the one that resonated so sorry to steal it. But it's


134
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:57.100
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: it's not being as lonely, I mean co-founders, great, but actually sharing the successes and and challenging each other as well, rather than just your friends telling you, hey, I love the product like, let's get some real honest feedback from from trusted people, so really can't wait to meet you all. We're also relocating to San Francisco. From England, so great to see so many cultures as well.


135
00:14:57.475 --> 00:15:23.019
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I'm not popcorn in, I mean Williams in the room. I cannot popcorn him and popcorn someone else. But maybe it makes sense to popcorn to William, for now that's all right, sure. Sure. So yeah, there's there's some awards. There's a lot of awards on the other side of the room, but she's Dominique's chosen. The the school picks instead. But pleasure to meet everybody. I'm William the CEO of Agent Luna.


136
00:15:23.536 --> 00:15:46.720
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I think I again I echo. What everyone said really excited to meet you, all super excited about the founders retreat, and yeah, really excited that we're an AI company so excited to see what everyone else is working on, and how they're tackling some of the challenges, and then from a learning perspective as well, really trying to


137
00:15:47.078 --> 00:15:55.320
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: dive under the hood and see how we can get Pmf. As quickly as possible. And yeah, learn from each other so


138
00:15:55.979 --> 00:16:00.470
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: alright popcorn time, who is up I'll go to


139
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:01.600
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: at.


140
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.870
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I'll go 1st off the list. Is it? Narat? Over to you?


141
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:11.960
Nirat Attri: Alright, it's Nero. So Hi, guys, I'm neera, and I'm the founder of health blogs.


142
00:16:12.361 --> 00:16:25.328
Nirat Attri: So help blocks is trying to take on the inefficiencies in the healthcare industry. And what we're trying to do is build automations that are electronic health record centric. So it's like a small peat about us.


143
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:41.660
Nirat Attri: everybody's taking the good points with respect to why, we're excited for tech stars. I think I'm gonna echo the same sentiment I think the entrepreneurial journey tends to be very lonely, and, like you often find yourselves in echo chambers, or like not getting yourself challenged enough, or


144
00:16:42.227 --> 00:16:50.989
Nirat Attri: the variety of feedback that comes in so exceptionally looking forward to the kind of po network that we would have during the program.


145
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:59.889
Nirat Attri: And of course looking forward to getting the right mentorship and the right guidance that helps us build something cool.


146
00:17:00.557 --> 00:17:04.082
Nirat Attri: So yeah, that's me. That's us.


147
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.859
Nirat Attri: I'd like to pass it on to Ugur. Is it.


148
00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:14.659
Uğur Koç | dert: Pretty close. Hi! I'm more. I'm the chief science officer of cogniscope.


149
00:17:15.196 --> 00:17:33.459
Uğur Koç | dert: But it's already talked a bit about us for the company that does Mo. Emotion talks and behavior analysis on you know, player data. And I'm super excited to bunch of things that was previously stated before. But I found out that you know


150
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:45.019
Uğur Koç | dert: founders often have really good stories about. You know how they came to where they are today, and I'm really looking forward to hearing those. Since I like this story.


151
00:17:45.019 --> 00:18:07.859
Uğur Koç | dert: and also I I like. While while listening to everyone over here, I felt like I felt an overwhelming sense of joy, because there's so many good ideas to think stuff about. And, you know, grow. And, you know, build on upon. So I think it's gonna be really good. I have great vibes about this entire thing. So I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone.


152
00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:12.689
Uğur Koç | dert: and I should go to if lilliana could give me a queue.


153
00:18:12.889 --> 00:18:14.009
Uğur Koç | dert: Political.


154
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.189
Lilliana Robinson: And the chat. Yep, exactly.


155
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.950
Uğur Koç | dert: Thanks, lifesaver.


156
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.159
talitha.abraham@ehl.ch: Wait, he said. Talitha right.


157
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.368
Uğur Koç | dert: Yes, I I hope so.


158
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:43.169
talitha.abraham@ehl.ch: Yeah. Hi, my name is Talitha, and I'm the CEO of Collab. You already met my co-founder, Flo, and our CTO Yogash. I think the part that I'm most excited about is being challenged being pushed to the brink. And hopefully, the tech stars helps us sort of rethink how we approach building our business. And the problem that we're solving. So yeah.


159
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.730
talitha.abraham@ehl.ch: and the next person I'm going to choose is Nicholas.


160
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:59.309
Nicholas Li: Hi, Hi, everyone, yeah, you can just call me Nick. I'm building 2 to me with Kevin. And yeah, I think, Evan, or explained, we're just building a virtual classroom powered by AI


161
00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:05.359
Nicholas Li: and I guess for me, what I'm ex excited about is yeah meeting everyone going on this journey like this


162
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.980
Nicholas Li: pretty long journey with everyone and getting some outside perspective. So yeah.


163
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.360
Nicholas Li: Look forward to seeing everyone like next week.


164
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:20.539
Nicholas Li: Oh, sorry yeah. For the next it will be for Liz. Sorry if I pronounced it wrong.


165
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:34.286
Filiz Yönyüksel: Oh, it's right, Phyllis. Hi! I'm the head of psychology of cogniscope you already talked with. We already heard, I'm very sure, and what I'm most excited about is actually again saying the same things. But


166
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:46.719
Filiz Yönyüksel: coming to San Francisco to live and connect with everyone also the networking, I mean with everyone, with you guys and the other people we will meet with the like tech week and other things.


167
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:55.921
Filiz Yönyüksel: I'm so excited about everything so overwhelmed. It's it's so nice, and I'll give the microphone to cholu my CEO.


168
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.090
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: Hi! All I'm Churrov, the CEO of cogniscope.


169
00:20:01.841 --> 00:20:10.609
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: My team already explained what cogniscope is, so I'm really excited to like be a part of the world's like largest tech ecosystem.


170
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.739
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: and see like brilliant people, and learn from them from you guys as well


171
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:24.109
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: like. I think it will be a. It will be a really good story like to tell after 3, 4 years, maybe few.


172
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.070
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: But I feel like this is just the beginning of many great things.


173
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.959
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: So I'm really excited to be here.


174
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.540
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: And I,


175
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.850
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: Nicholas, have you? Yeah, you I I was. I was the last one. Yeah.


176
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.989
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: I think that was.


177
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.460
Lilliana Robinson: Did we miss anybody? Feel free to raise your hand? Don't be shy


178
00:20:44.530 --> 00:21:01.169
Lilliana Robinson: cool. Okay. Well, I saw so many like eyes just like light up hearing each other's businesses. You guys probably didn't notice. But that's what's so great about having an industry agnostic program which Neil and I have always had. That it just goes


179
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.100
Lilliana Robinson: across such a large


180
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:28.749
Lilliana Robinson: variety of subjects, and that's the best part, so that you can help each other. So some of you who are building Sas heard some others that are maybe in healthcare or gaming, or all these different things, and you'll see that variety is exactly what's going to help you guys grow because it brings such a diverse perspective and things you might not have thought about for your own company or hearing someone else do. And it's just amazing. So that's 1 of my favorite parts of the programs we get to run here at techstars.


181
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:29.850
Lilliana Robinson: The other thing.


182
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:44.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 1. 1 quick thing, lilliana. Sorry to jump in. I just want to clarify and acknowledge that these introductions, so that I think there's 2 companies that are are missing from today that you'll meet probably in the coming days who weren't able to make it today. They let us know ahead of time. But


183
00:21:46.180 --> 00:22:13.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we're looking at these like, you know, little squares and rectangles on the screen with names and faces through this. But what's really crazy is that you all made it through probably the most rigorous selection process that we've ever had in the history of tech stars, because not only did we do the most with our unique process. But tech stars, added another layer with this investment committee business that I know you all know about now, where literally our board members, and CEO directly reviewed


184
00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:38.129
Neal Sáles-Griffin: each of your businesses that we had to actively defend. So the fact that you all are standing here today, when there were many, many, many, many, many other businesses. Don't quote me, but over you know well over a thousand that were buying for these exact spots that you all have it means a lot that you all are all together today, and I I hope you'll recognize that when you meet each other, what you all did. To get here means something about what you're going to do next.


185
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just wanted to acknowledge that.


186
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.069
Lilliana Robinson: I love that


187
00:22:43.447 --> 00:22:54.810
Lilliana Robinson: on a much more tedious note, it is very important to me to pronounce your names correctly. So during these 2 weeks pre program. Prep. If you ask a question or we call on you, and we don't say it correctly.


188
00:22:54.810 --> 00:23:19.309
Lilliana Robinson: please correct us and correct us until it's correct. So like you can say it every time until we get it right. Because it's very important to us. We have an international class here learning about many different cultures, and it's very helpful to us to be prompted by you guys so that we can pronounce every single name correctly, and your fellow co-founders and classmates here make sure that we're respectful to each other, and if someone says your name incorrectly don't take offense, we're all learning so


189
00:23:19.823 --> 00:23:26.290
Lilliana Robinson: just know that I'm very excited to learn each of your names perfectly, so we can throw the slides back up. Akadena.


190
00:23:50.070 --> 00:24:02.269
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect. Okay, so we're going to kick off this orientation here with our team, so I think we'll start with Akkadina, and then we'll go to Chloe, me, Neil, and then George will round out with you.


191
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.780
akadinayadegar: Sorry I had to get out of the full screen to unmute myself.


192
00:24:08.147 --> 00:24:22.080
akadinayadegar: I'm Akkadina. I am the program associate on the team. I'm brand new to the team. So I'm super excited to meet you all learn alongside you. This is my 1st textors program. So I'm super excited.


193
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.950
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome, Ellie!


194
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:38.570
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: Hey? I'm Chloe. This is my 6th tech Stars program on the PC. Here. Some of you might have seen me in your screening committee or past screening committees. It is great to see you all here in the same room


195
00:24:38.872 --> 00:24:44.619
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: I moved to San Francisco like 2 and a half weeks ago. So let me know if you want to try a new restaurant always down.


196
00:24:46.470 --> 00:25:10.288
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. I'm lilliana Robinson. You guys met me in the selection process. This is my 12th program with Neil. Here at Techstars. We've been doing this for over 5 years. I also took a stint in there, going to be a software engineer. So that's kind of my background. I studied software engineering, and I worked for a startup on front end. Dev, so that's still a passion of mine. I love helping and critiquing like


197
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:34.069
Lilliana Robinson: landing pages and web apps and everything like that. I also have a strong passion for customer discovery, which is where I got my start helping Neil teach that at Northwestern. So that's something else I'm excited to delve into with you guys. But you'll see I'm the accelerator lead here. So everything program related. Anything is what I can help with, and I'm excited for you guys to go through this. We've been waiting.


198
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, lilliana.


199
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you also want to add, maybe some of the other programs that you've helped and worked with.


200
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cause, it's not just.


201
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:46.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. It's not just ours. You've been working with a lot of other tech source programs, too.


202
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.140
Lilliana Robinson: Like around the country, like all of our.


203
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, and Australia and everything else.


204
00:25:53.550 --> 00:26:15.890
Lilliana Robinson: I love to help and mentor other new teams. So there are a lot of things that Neil and I have like kind of invented for the techstars program that other people have adopted. So yeah, techstars. Sydney is a major one. Tech stars anywhere. Does a lot of things like that. I've been mentoring techstars, Boston, because they have a young team. Now. The Twin cities in Minneapolis also does stuff like us


205
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:28.879
Lilliana Robinson: as well as techstars in Ohio, Columbus, that that Md. Is a former mentor of our ecosystem. So Neil and I had our start in techstars, Chicago, for those of you who don't know. That's like


206
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:53.199
Lilliana Robinson: everything to us that we started, that it sunsetted about a year ago, which was perfect timing for our team to be chosen to come out and start the Bay Area programs, which was a huge honor. So we've been out here for about a year. And I split my time between Seattle and San Francisco, because my husband works for salesforce up here in Seattle. So some of the time I'm calling from Seattle some of the time I'm down in San Francisco. But I'm there quite a bit.


207
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.729
Lilliana Robinson: Anything else about renewal. I feel like that covers.


208
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I think that's a good start. That's a good start. We'll get the rest over time, I'm sure.


209
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.369
Lilliana Robinson: Go ahead, Neil!


210
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That we're doing. George. George, did you already go.


211
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.380
Lilliana Robinson: George didn't go yet.


212
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:15.760
George H: Yeah, I can jump on. How you guys doing? I'm George, just super excited to be here helping the tech stars team and


213
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:24.689
George H: getting to meet and learn from each of you and figure out you know what makes you uniquely, you and how you apply that to your business, and we're super excited to learn


214
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.149
George H: and hopefully find ways that we can help.


215
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:43.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, George and I originally connected through the legend that is the man named Bob Mesta, who you all will hopefully meet. But he's the creator of the jobs to be done. Framework which I'm vehemently passionate about, as you all know, so happy to have him on board. Does that leave me, lilliana?


216
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.029
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, and they've all heard Bob on the mattress interview in the selection.


217
00:27:47.030 --> 00:28:14.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, that's right. Yeah. So you know his voice. So I I won't take much time here, because I think Lilian's gonna have me do like a proper story for y'all at the Retreat. But Neil, from Chicago, now living in California Bay area kicked off the San Francisco Ebay program in Oakland out there last year. So I've been living in Oakland, and I'm looking to move to San Francisco soon, so I'll be commuting across the bay bridge. In the meantime it'll be fun


218
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:35.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but no, I it's been fun getting to know California and like being new energy. So bringing tech stars to the bay for the 1st time ever. It's that that like, lilliana said, it's been an honor, and a lot of people in the Bay have been really curious about us, like, what's up with tech stars. And we're we're the new kids on the block. So everyone's gonna want to get to know you all, and


219
00:28:35.220 --> 00:29:01.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they're gonna check out your T-shirts and your swag and come up to you and talk to you and try to get the tea. So just know that you all have a little bit of wind in your sales where there's a lot of curiosity about the very 1st group of Techsar's companies to emerge in the bay. So I I plan to work with you all strategically to take advantage of that with investors and and beyond. So more about me later. But if you really want to know anything sooner, I'm sure it'll eke out as we go through the sessions this week and next.


220
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:31.419
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, you'll learn a little more in the customer discovery sessions this week. About Neil. But some of you might be wondering, since we keep saying, this is the inaugural program first, st ever San Francisco program. But Neil and I are also saying we've been in the bay for a year. That's because we kind of soft launched the Bay area with 2 different programs that we're not running right now. Tech stars. Oakland, powered by Jp. Morgan was part of a fund for underrepresented founders that we partnered with Jp. Morgan, for in select cities across


221
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:45.379
Lilliana Robinson: America, and Oakland was one of them. So we ran 3 cohorts of that and then we also ran a tech stars, feature of e-commerce, powered by ebay, so that one was also kind of located in Oakland because we ran it simultaneously.


222
00:29:45.680 --> 00:30:06.699
Lilliana Robinson: So that's what kind of why we soft launch the bay area. We came out here started those programs. Those have wound down. And now tech stars has put full force investment into a city program for the 1st time ever in San Francisco proper. So you guys truly are the inaugural program, the real like full launch into the bay, and we can't be more excited.


223
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But what's great about that soft launch is that we have


224
00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:40.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: dozens, if not over 100 tech stars, companies and alumni in the Bay area want to help and get involved. And then we also have now 3 classes of companies that we've directly invested and worked with. So there's 36 companies that we know in the past year that we've invested in, many of whom are doing quite well, who want to come back and give back to you all, and help connect you to the investors that they raise money from, and all the other thinkers and and great mentors that we've been able to secure over the past year to support us. So you've got even more wind in your sales.


225
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.040
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. Okay? I think we're ready to go to the next slide.


226
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.929
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, our mission.


227
00:30:50.130 --> 00:31:02.129
Lilliana Robinson: I actually included our mission statement in the selection process when you guys were making your commitment statements. But we can just reiterate, and I'll just say it shortly. And maybe, Neil, you can expand upon it.


228
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:02.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But our mission.


229
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:31.440
Lilliana Robinson: To help founders succeed. And that's the global mission of techstars. Our CEO David Cohen is extremely founder focused. He started the very 1st Tech Stars program and our mission as a whole company as well as our mission as a team is to help founders succeed. So everything that we do in this program is geared toward just that. There's no busy work. There's no wasting your time. There's there's nothing that we will give to you. Prescribe to you, or or have you sit through. That isn't to help you succeed. That is our 1st and foremost, highest mission.


230
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And if for some reason there is something that isn't a good use of your time.


231
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we'll adapt and adjust accordingly.


232
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:46.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Like we're human, you know. So we've been iterating for a long time. So we have this process pretty dialed in. But every now and then there's always something that we can improve.


233
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:52.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we treat every program like it's our first, st as far as humility. So with that being said I, I guess I'll just be


234
00:31:53.170 --> 00:32:00.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: more even more human to you all for a moment, and say that I don't think I've ever felt more excited and encouraged


235
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.099
Neal Sáles-Griffin: working at Techsaras, and I am right now.


236
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:05.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I've been at the company for 5 years and 2 months.


237
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.712
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and we recently


238
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: got David Cohen stepping in as the CEO.


239
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:18.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And there's a whole story with that that will give you the entire detail on, if you're curious. In in a in a bit. But


240
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: suffice to say.


241
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:23.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: our


242
00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: clear orientation as a business right now


243
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is all about being the best possible business that we can be


244
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for our founders, for all of you right now.


245
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:40.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the big question that was posed to the company was, How can textiles right now be even better for founders?


246
00:32:40.740 --> 00:33:03.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's the conversation that we've been having internally, as as an entire company. Lots of changes are underway to address that question. But we're really proud as our core team as a program team that that has always been our focus in North Star. And now we feel like we have even more empowerment to make that even more real directly for you. So it's a great time to be at tech stars, because when we say we help founders succeed.


247
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:11.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it can mean so many different things for each and every one of you given your unique situations. So our job is to figure out all the puzzles


248
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:20.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that we can solve for each of you on how we can individualize and customize your progress, which is why I think, like tech stars itself is a unique


249
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: offering in that.


250
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:33.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's it's not a batch. You know it's not like this large group of of businesses, and nothing nothing against that model. But there's just a trade off and a difference in in the experience, whereas I think


251
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we're kind of more like a tailored outfit


252
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:42.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or tailored suit, where each of you are going to have a different set of measurements and and needs to address, and I'm ready to do that for all of you.


253
00:33:45.530 --> 00:34:01.819
Lilliana Robinson: And everything we're saying here will be sent out in a recording, but also it's written out in our program handbook that you'll receive on by Wednesday this week. So everything that we're going to go over of expectations wise, which brings me to the next slide, which is your role.


254
00:34:02.515 --> 00:34:30.309
Lilliana Robinson: So I'll go over it. But you can read more about this in the Handbook. It's really 4 parts. Your role 1st is attendance. So all full time program participants are expected to show up to every required program session. Now, when we say expected to show up, it's not without exceptions. So of course, sales calls really important investor calls anything personal matters that come up. Things happen and life happens. We're not


255
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:38.929
Lilliana Robinson: a butts and seats kind of program where you're going to be in trouble if you're not there. However, we are expecting you to communicate.


256
00:34:38.929 --> 00:35:01.390
Lilliana Robinson: So for some reason you can't come to something where we would be expecting you just sending a message to me, Chloe Akadena. That would be extremely helpful. So that we're not looking for you a lot of times we'll wait to start a session, because we're expecting all 12 teams. If for some reason one of you is not there, we'll be waiting or trying to track you down, and it's much more helpful to know ahead of time when you have to miss, but over like overall


257
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:27.976
Lilliana Robinson: making your best attempt to be at every single required program. Session will only yield the best program experience for you. And that's because you're getting a lot of things in return. So, being a full time program participant. While you have that expectation. You're also getting a lot of things you get to come on the retreat. Stay at the mansion in Tahoe. You get all of the swag. You get access to the office. We have a limited number of memberships we can give out, so it is very important that there are these trade offs.


258
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:57.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I would also add, lilliana, that it makes it easy for us to promote you as well, so we we would never, ever say anything to the contrary or negative about any of our businesses. We don't do that. We only give feedback internally, not externally, to anyone, but at the same time allowing us to have effusive praise for all of the the positive traits and qualities that not only investors, but other, you know, partners and other supporters of you want to look for if we can just say that in unison for all 12 companies throughout the entire program, that is always a gift.


259
00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we really appreciate everybody being in alignment there with decorum.


260
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.300
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, and it'll say this in the Handbook. But


261
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:15.034
Lilliana Robinson: we didn't used to fully require attendance at all of our sessions. But after a certain point, so many iterations and design.


262
00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:41.200
Lilliana Robinson: thinking went into the program that we're very confident in in asking you guys to be there and asking for your time. This is something that we take very sensitively is your time and prioritizing certain things for you, and we try to make sure that we're good stewards of your time in addition to attendance, the second part of your role is engagement. So, not only being here, but being present, so keeping your video on and being fully present and engaged in our program sessions.


263
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:47.669
Lilliana Robinson: Really important to us, multitasking is just not going to work because of the density of the


264
00:36:47.930 --> 00:37:11.659
Lilliana Robinson: curriculum that you're going to be given. So you're going to be learning very deep things. Someone said, it sounds like we. You might be going back to university it. It is very similar to that. Neil and I are actually both faculty at Northwestern University, and we use very similar teaching styles at the college. So it is going to be pretty dense, and you do want to make sure you're paying attention. If for some reason you need to step out.


265
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:25.609
Lilliana Robinson: you can leave and come back. It's totally fine. It's it's not drill, Sergeant Time, but just making a promise to yourself to be engaged, and it's also respectful to all of our presenters that we're bringing in. We're going to be bringing in experts from around the world who will be zooming in.


266
00:37:25.882 --> 00:37:42.790
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, Dave, you can absolutely take notes. That's more than encouraged. But just making sure you give that respect because these people are not getting paid. They're coming to give their time just by our give 1st motto of tech stars. And so the best thing we can do to put our good foot forward for them is to be engaged.


267
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:49.409
Lilliana Robinson: Ask questions when they ask you to participate. Make sure that we have a lot of people raising hands. All of that good hygiene.


268
00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.340
Lilliana Robinson: The 3rd part is being collaborative. So, yeah, is there a question.


269
00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:07.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, Lily, I was just gonna add that the the engagement part also benefits you because we've had mentors, workshop presenters, and others who come, visit, and, you know, present to you all.


270
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:27.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: take a liking or curiosity to specific founders who stand out in those interactions and engagements. So the ones who are the most inquisitive, who seem to apply what they're learning as they go follow up afterwards they end up getting angel checks, they end up getting additional advice and guidance for free. They end up getting a lot more benefits than what they originally thought they were signing up for


271
00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:35.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because they're demonstrating how, how you know. Significant and and important they're they're taking what they're learning.


272
00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:41.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So all of these different inputs are signals about whether a founder is likely to succeed or not.


273
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:59.800
Lilliana Robinson: The 3rd part is being collaborative. So your role is also, you have the expectation that you guys are collaborating with your classmates. Neil and I always say the biggest value that you're going to get out of this program. Apart from the design curriculum, the funding, the


274
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:22.769
Lilliana Robinson: optics of getting to be in tech stars, which is a huge deal. The biggest value you're gonna get is the classmates you're gonna meet here. So part of your role is to be collaborative with them, working together, learning about each other's backgrounds, learning about each other's companies, helping each other with your problems, and just collaborating on everything, putting your heads together, problem solving together. It is


275
00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:45.890
Lilliana Robinson: the highest value. I can't say it enough that you're going to get from this, and the more you lean in, the more you'll get out of it. A lot of class classes are still meeting monthly, helping each other because they got so close during program. And I say this at the beginning of every single program, and a lot of people aren't aren't sure they're like, that's not really why I came to Texters. I'm here for the learning. I'm here for all of that. And every single person on the last day is


276
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:55.779
Lilliana Robinson: saying, Wow! My class is exactly the biggest thing I got out of Flextars. So I'm just giving you that warning now, and telling you to lean in as much as possible.


277
00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:03.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 1. 1 more thing to acknowledge about that. You'll hear me say this a few times. It's going to come up as we, as we continue to iterate, reiterate that point. But


278
00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:26.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there are probably some companies in this group right now that are going to build multimillion dollar businesses, and not only will you all be able to work together with the founders who do that hopefully, it's all of you. But definitely some are going to do that. But there have been times in the past where founders have pulled together resources and found a way to share with that particular company success.


279
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:37.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You all put a little, put a little capital together, and you end up investing in that business that's taken off. So even if it's not everyone, if some of you succeed, and you end up looking out for each other. Everybody gets to ride the wave.


280
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's a lot of really cool stories like that that happen in Techsar's classes.


281
00:40:44.740 --> 00:41:06.590
Lilliana Robinson: And then the 4th one is staying communicative. So communication is something we very highly value. You'll see tomorrow we're going to do our base camp training. We'll talk more about communication. And then next week Neil and I will do project management day with you guys. But outside of just digital communication and good hygiene of keeping us up to date. There's also intellectual honesty. So making sure that


282
00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:29.969
Lilliana Robinson: any key updates that are happening, anything like that, you're coming to Neil, to myself. We're like your co-founders now. So we want to stay up to date with your business, with what's happening with what you need, even if it's bad. So a lot of people are kind of like intimidated to give bad news to Neil. But that's actually exactly when you should come to him. So we really value staying extremely communicative during and after the program.


283
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:50.909
Lilliana Robinson: And that starts now. So you should treat us as your co-founders. We're in the weeds with you. We want to know what's happening. The good, the bad, the ugly, anything like that. And that's also day to day. That's telling us when you can't come to a session that's telling us you have to drop early for something that's also telling us, hey, we lost a customer today. So, whatever it is staying communicative is extremely important for your role here.


284
00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:55.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, and I can't say that there isn't any like. There's nothing I haven't seen.


285
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:58.059
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But I've made a hundred 50 investments


286
00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: over the past 5 years.


287
00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:12.680
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I've seen a lot. So whatever you're going through is probably not going to phase us like we're ready for it. It doesn't matter what it is, you can trust us. We have seen a lot, and we can hopefully draw from those experiences to help you.


288
00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.290
Lilliana Robinson: So that's your role. We can go to the next slide.


289
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.949
Lilliana Robinson: Do you want to explain Eirs? Now.


290
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.902
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, happy to. So one really, really cool


291
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:33.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: addition to the tech stars program that's happened in recent years is with


292
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:51.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the scale of the organization expanding to over 30 different cities. Now all over the world, we've had to find ways to augment what I do as managing director with each with each of our classes. So my perspective and experience only goes so far. I'm 1 person with, you know, 1 1 set of things. It's always nice to have


293
00:42:52.090 --> 00:43:08.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a few other people who are just as qualified to weigh in and spend time with each of your your businesses. So we actually deliberately hire 3 people per class of 12 companies to directly work with the companies on a weekly basis in addition to myself.


294
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:34.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So these are our called eirs, entrepreneurs, and residents, and each class we kind of hand pick people and recruit them, who, we think, would be a great fit to spend some of their time. We can't afford their time to be honest, but we offer up a stipend as a formality, because every program we've had we have these mentors who end up spending a disproportionate amount of time working with the companies. And they they're so awesome, and all the founders say they're awesome, but they're spread too thin.


295
00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:53.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this is a way for us to formalize our relationship with some of our smartest and most effective entrepreneurs and operators. Give them a little bit of money so that they have a formal time commitment to specific companies at specific phases of the program experience. So you'll you'll find out who they are, and and meet them in the in the coming weeks.


296
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.220
Lilliana Robinson: I'm excited for you to meet them. Okay, next slide.


297
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.579
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect. So communication protocol. This is 2 parts.


298
00:44:08.862 --> 00:44:20.989
Lilliana Robinson: One. You're gonna learn a lot about tomorrow. So our hub for the program is base camp. And I wrote this out in my email on Friday, everything you'll need to know. We take pride in it all being a 1 stop shop.


299
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:40.180
Lilliana Robinson: So everything is in there. That's where we'll communicate. That's where you'll submit things from your team. That's also where you'll communicate with your classmates, there will be an Hq. Where all of you are. There will also be an individual company project where our team works hands on with your team in the weeds of your business. And then the second part is for more immediate


300
00:44:40.720 --> 00:45:00.860
Lilliana Robinson: quick responses. We have another app that's on your phone called Voxer. And this is like an Async walkie talkie. A lot of venture capitalists use this. Our CEO David Cohen is on there. Most managing directors are on there, and this is how we communicate with our founders for direct or urgent things. Think of it as a direct line to Neil.


301
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:22.020
Lilliana Robinson: so whenever you need him you can send a little voice. Memo. You'll hear back from him 24 to 48 h. Pretty immediately. Basecamp is, we're also pretty much on there every single day. But if we happen to be in a meeting or something, and you just need to quickly box us we can. We can get that. So all of the information on how to download that and everything is in the program handbook which we'll get later this week.


302
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:29.609
Lilliana Robinson: and then for base camp. You'll get access at the end of the day tomorrow, after I train you guys in the morning and kind of just show you everything that you need to know.


303
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:35.676
Lilliana Robinson: The only other thing that we use is Google Calendar, slash zoom to do all of our virtual


304
00:45:36.470 --> 00:46:00.869
Lilliana Robinson: programming as well as email to communicate with external members. So like our mentors, our workshop hosts, people like that are not going to be in base camp with us. That's just for the founders and our program team. So we do have to use email to communicate with the outside world, as I say. But everything, for the program will be centered in base camp, and the main reason for voxer is because Neil's inbox is extremely flooded by


305
00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:24.319
Lilliana Robinson: thousands of other founders who want his attention kind of same with mine. And so it's not a great way to communicate with us. When you guys send us emails, they get buried under hundreds of emails per day with other people. But voxer is a direct line that we only give to you guys same with basecamp. So only our founders and our internal team are on voxer and basecamp. So you get this direct line straight to us.


306
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:28.319
Lilliana Robinson: Do you want to add anything about communication. Maybe, like Async stuff, Neil.


307
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:42.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, we we value asynchronous communication. First, st because it's such a treat to have time for flow, as many of you all, I'm sure, would appreciate. I come from a programming background myself, and


308
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:49.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: having 3 4 blocks of uninterrupted time per day is golden to me, and I want to give you all that same gift if we can.


309
00:46:49.883 --> 00:47:09.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That being said, when it's time for real conversation and real time discussion, we're there for it, and we're happy to do it. We just want to make sure that we've gone through the layers of understanding whether it's the right thing to do so just trust our process. And I think, especially as co-founders and leaders of your businesses as you scale them up. You're going to appreciate some of our techniques


310
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right.


311
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.280
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, next slide


312
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:37.100
Lilliana Robinson: weekly expectations. So the 1st month, which I'll go over in the next slide. Is kind of crazy because we have an inundation of workshops in the 1st week purposefully, so we can give you as much info as quickly as possible, so that that can start being implemented as early as possible, and then we go into mentor madness.


313
00:47:37.100 --> 00:48:01.320
Lilliana Robinson: So the 1st month is very unique, and it's kind of a very busy time. But months, 2 and 3 get into a rhythm. So once we pass weeks 5 and 6, and we're in that second and 3rd trimester of the program, you'll see that we get into this weekly cadence. So on a week to week basis what you can expect once we get into that flow Kpis weekly with your Eirs


314
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:30.900
Lilliana Robinson: CEO and Cxo small groups, which I'll be groups of 4. That's where you guys will get pretty close. That's kind of to support each other personally and professionally, and to just have a more intimate setting outside of the larger group to support each other. You'll have CEO roundtable every other week with Neil, and sometimes myself. And that's where we. It's with the Ceos, where we hear the problems that you're facing, and all of the Ceos, as well as part of our program team, put our heads together to try and solve those problems


315
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:46.070
Lilliana Robinson: for each of the Ceos. And then the last thing is 12 by 12. So you'll see that written as 12 x 12, that is, 12 companies by 12 noon on Fridays, it is basically an end of week Round Table, where we close out the week. We'll have it every other week.


316
00:48:46.390 --> 00:49:11.282
Lilliana Robinson: and we give our highs and lows of the week and kind of reflect. Give gratitude things like that, and that's where we can come together and kind of learn more about each other, and hear about each other's weeks and bond, and I really like those. The 12 by 12 are some of my favorite parts of the program. Sometimes we'll have themed 12 by 12, so we'll have like a Halloween one for costume. Contest things like that. So there are fun things sprinkled in. Those are your weekly expectations.


317
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:26.119
Lilliana Robinson: you will also get a base camp to do list every week with certain deliverables that won't happen as much in the 1st few weeks of program. You might have one for week. One, but it'll happen a lot more in that second and 3rd month where you'll have these deliverables every single week.


318
00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:48.429
Lilliana Robinson: Some of them go with the workshops that you'll have that week, and some of them are outside of that and just part of our program. So make sure that you're looking at Base Camp. If, after I give the training tomorrow, you still don't understand base camp, or you need help, it's very crucial that you make sure that you understand it, and you reach out for help, because then you will be held to delivering these assignments and things like that. And so you want to make sure that you know where to find them.


319
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:52.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And just to illuminate a little bit of what we mean by that. Like, we're talking


320
00:49:52.950 --> 00:50:05.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: data, room stuff, financial models, certain things to prep for sales, workshops, all types of things that are additive to your progress with your business, but, like more uniquely catered to the particular programming we have that week.


321
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:08.760
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly.


322
00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:10.729
Lilliana Robinson: We can go to the next slide.


323
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:40.030
Lilliana Robinson: So program structure, I was kind of hinting at it in the last one. But the program is kind of broken up into 3 months. The 1st month is introduction and mentor madness. It's just full of programming. You should think of month one as just. You're just here to learn. Your brain's gonna be full of knowledge. You're going to have pages of notes. The second week is going to be arena week, where you kind of give presentations on some of the stuff you learned, and we tell you where you're at for each subject.


324
00:50:40.270 --> 00:51:02.850
Lilliana Robinson: and then we'll have 2 weeks of mentor madness. And that concludes month, one month, 2 it'll start with Sf. Tech week, which is kind of unique for this program. It's pretty cool that's happening during your program. I wrote a lot about it. And Chloe also made you guys a guide. It's all in the email that I sent on Friday. But we will have no programming in week 5, so that you guys can attend that if you choose to do so.


325
00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:10.760
Lilliana Robinson: and then week 6, we'll start growth month. So month 2 is growth month. We'll start by being all in person with some experts flying in


326
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:24.020
Lilliana Robinson: for our mid program meet up, and then the rest of the the weeks of that month are just filled with growth sales like growth, hacking sales and all these different things that'll just like help. You take the knowledge that you learned in month. One.


327
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:24.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Development.


328
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:53.729
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, actually iterate and develop your product launch start making money, iterating on experimenting, and all of those different things validating your assumptions. You've made all of that. And then the 3rd month we go into fundraising. Prep and demo day prep. So pretty much. Every workshop will be there like pitch practice helping you with your product, Demo, or getting you ready to launch a fundraising round. So that's how we break up our program. And then, obviously, it culminates in Demo Day, which will be the 1st week of December.


329
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:59.829
Lilliana Robinson: That's the basic structure. I think the next slide is about it being hybrid. Can you click the next slide.


330
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:20.140
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, so it is a hybrid program. And when I say hybrid, it is an in person program that is remote, accessible. So in person program meaning we have an office. Our team will be there. It'll be available for the entire duration of the program to all full time participants. For the non full time program participants. We'll have a


331
00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:31.170
Lilliana Robinson: daily rate that you guys can pay to have your part time people in there. But for all of our full time program participants. You'll be a full member for these 3 months, and you'll have full 24, 7 access to the office.


332
00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:56.349
Lilliana Robinson: But there will be weeks that are remote, accessible. This is extremely helpful to our founders, so you can take meetings in other cities. You can do any sort of obligations you need personally, if you need to be somewhere else. And then we just have certain weeks where it's immersive. And we're all gonna be there required. Our host will be in person things like that. So that's kind of where we get the hybrid we are very prepared to run a hybrid program where everything is streamable.


333
00:52:56.350 --> 00:53:19.410
Lilliana Robinson: We also have a lot of international founders who might not make it to week one because of visa issues. So we'll be streaming every single in person, thing to be completely accessible. Remotely so, even if you have co-founders who aren't going to be joining us in person, maybe they're part time or something. They can join every single session, or maybe 98% of the sessions. Virtually every single thing will be also hosted on zoom.


334
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:25.139
Neal Sáles-Griffin: lilliana. I think, technically speaking, we've only ever run hybrid programs.


335
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:31.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't think we've run any other kind of program ever. This is our 12th program, and every single one has been run in this hybrid format.


336
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.550
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. And I would say, this is


337
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:43.480
Lilliana Robinson: probably the most in person program we've ever run. Having a full time. Office is not something we've ever really done before.


338
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:44.536
Lilliana Robinson: We've had


339
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:55.900
Lilliana Robinson: an office during the immersive weeks, but this one is the 1st time we'll have like a fully staffed office for the entire duration of the program accessible to our every single founder which is really.


340
00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. So we'll we'll learn new things based on that, too.


341
00:53:59.357 --> 00:54:22.650
Lilliana Robinson: I'm very excited for you guys to see the office, it is within galvanize, galvanize San Francisco, which is kind of like a we work, and they are so excited to meet you all the members of galvanize that already work there, they're working on their own startups and the staff there. They're so excited that tech stars is coming. So I know that they're going to want to like talk to you in the kitchen, and everything like that. So it'll be a great community for you guys. I can't wait.


342
00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:26.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There are lots of places for you all to carve out to work.


343
00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:34.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you don't want to be in the main spaces that we already have dedicated, and there are multiple floors for you all to occupy as well. So


344
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:39.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I feel like the tech stars companies are just gonna like, take over that building.


345
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:47.860
Lilliana Robinson: Okay? And the last slide is our commitment. So.


346
00:54:48.534 --> 00:55:07.129
Lilliana Robinson: we have this written out more fully. We wrote a commitment statement for you guys just like you wrote one to get into program. But the highlights here, I'll let you read the full thing in the handbook. The highlights are. We know we're expecting a lot from you, but it goes both ways. So we hold ourselves to operational excellence. We hold ourselves to always being here to help you guys


347
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:28.540
Lilliana Robinson: through the thick and thin of making a business, and we know that we can do that because we've done this many, many times before. The highest value at techstars is give. First, st you'll hear us say that a thousand times, and you'll hear the members of our network say that but we also value. Do what's right for founders and win as a team. So our highest value is ensuring your success.


348
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.619
Lilliana Robinson: So that's kind of our commitment to you.


349
00:55:31.215 --> 00:55:34.649
Lilliana Robinson: I think the next slide is questions. Did you want to add anything now?


350
00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You nailed it. We're good.


351
00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.339
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So I have some.


352
00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 30 min to spare. That's good.


353
00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:49.339
Lilliana Robinson: I know I figured there might be quite a few questions, so hit me with all of them, and then I'll go through some announcements, and then we'll break for lunch.


354
00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:53.199
Lilliana Robinson: Don't be shy, I'm sure everyone has questions.


355
00:55:55.070 --> 00:56:03.739
Kevin Su: Yeah. I guess in terms of updating for not being able to make certain meetings do. Who do we reach out to for that. And do we want to do that through Boxer email?


356
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.640
Kevin Su: I don't know. I missed.


357
00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:21.729
Lilliana Robinson: You want to do it through base camp base camp. I'll show you how to do it tomorrow. Chloe and Akidina are our like program managers, program, coordinator and program associate are their titles. And so they'll be the ones that are in charge of attendance and things like that. So you can. You can message either of them in base camp.


358
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.690
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.


359
00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:23.260
Kevin Su: Thank you.


360
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:44.360
Uğur Koç | dert: Well, if you could go into a bit more detail on what the you know you were talking about the CEO change. We already read about it a couple of weeks ago. You could go into more detail about what this text arch 2 point O thing is, because


361
00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:49.770
Uğur Koç | dert: you know, sure it looks exciting, but I don't get what it is, and I don't like things that I don't get so.


362
00:56:50.730 --> 00:57:19.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, no, I understand. And I feel the same way. I don't like things that I don't get either. So there were just a lot of performance improvements that were planned for techsars overall, and many of them are still underway. Some of them are changing with new leadership, stepping in for techsars. So there was a plan to, you know, roll back pro Texas programs to certain markets that plan is in part still in motion, but is also in part being


363
00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: paused or rolled back.


364
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:24.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So, without saying too much, I'll just say that


365
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: one of the most important aspects of Texar's historically, has been community.


366
00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:30.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's really important for us.


367
00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:51.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: even if we're entering new communities to make sure that we're maintaining strong relationships in the communities that helped this organization get off the ground in the early years. So we're doing a lot of work right now as a company to make sure that with alumni all over the world, and currently and actively operating in 30 different cities. With this text, our 2 announcement that was happening earlier this year.


368
00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:58.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there were changes that were happening that made San Francisco like a key market for us now going forward. New York, Boston, and La.


369
00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:06.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That also came with an announcement that there were some other markets and communities that we operated in, that we are no longer operating in


370
00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:09.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right. That was Seattle, Chicago, Austin


371
00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Boulder.


372
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:16.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I think we're in conversation right now to maintain activity in in some of these places. Still.


373
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's kind of what it means. Right now. I'll share a much more unvarnished


374
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:24.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: version of this story when we're on the retreat


375
00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:30.087
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's not recorded.


376
00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.479
Lilliana Robinson: That's what I call it off the record.


377
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:33.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah.


378
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.110
Lilliana Robinson: And.


379
00:58:35.832 --> 00:58:40.620
Annie Brown: I had a quick question. Oh, Dominique, you have your hand raised.


380
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:42.069
Lilliana Robinson: And then we'll go back.


381
00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:44.710
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I'll go after you. Go ahead. It's fine, all good.


382
00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:57.461
Annie Brown: Okay, yeah, just a quick question, when can we start using the office space? I'm just excited to see it use it. Get out of my little studio apartment.


383
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:16.140
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I'm excited for you guys, too. September 9.th Our 1st day is gonna be when you can get in there we'll do a tour we'll kick off with like a little quick orientation with the staff, and then we'll all be in there right now. We're getting it ready. We're putting up some decals and like just finishing touches, and then they'll be ready for you guys. On September 9.th


384
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:19.099
Annie Brown: Awesome. That's such a great resource. Thank you.


385
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:23.539
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I'm excited for you guys, Kevin. Oh, let's go back to Dominique. And then Kevin.


386
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:31.730
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Oh, thanks, thanks, Kevin. No, it was just a question regarding communication, so I'm conscious of


387
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:51.099
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: add in another communication to the cohort. But I hear that Fox, I hope I've said that correctly is is the direct communication to Neil, and so forth. Then we've got base camp, which I'm super excited about. But I'm just thinking in terms of a group between the cohort. That's


388
00:59:51.100 --> 01:00:03.190
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: more for, like I don't know socially like, Hey, I'm I'm here to someone. Want to grab a coffee, or shall we do this? I don't know. It's just an idea I'm I'm just nervous to suggest it. And everyone's like.


389
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:04.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh no!


390
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.170
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Asian Channel.


391
01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:07.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Of course. No, no, that's going to happen like that's.


392
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:08.230
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Okay.


393
01:00:08.547 --> 01:00:14.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's always going to be a group that gets formed. We don't necessarily dictate what form that is.


394
01:00:14.854 --> 01:00:19.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: My, my recommendation would be to like. Try out my little boxer thing because you can form your own private group.


395
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.940
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: I think.


396
01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:43.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Each other there. Yeah, you could do it there for sure, and have it as your own like, meaning not something that we're overseeing or managing ourselves. So I think you'd appreciate that to keep things simple. However. We can't tell you what to do. You. You all are your own founders in your own skin. So if you all decide, another channel makes sense, by all means do that. But I would definitely recommend trying out what we're recommending to start.


397
01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:48.890
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Yeah, no, I totally misunderstood. I thought I didn't realize you could do that on Vox. So my bad.


398
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:49.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, yeah.


399
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:50.300
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: The.


400
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:54.160
Lilliana Robinson: We didn't do anything wrong. I love that idea, Dominique. I think.


401
01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:01.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I mean, I mean, for that matter, you can also have your own base camp, too, like that. You could have your own project, that we're not a part of. That's also an option. So.


402
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.171
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Okay, I wasn't thinking about disincluding you guys.


403
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:35.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: No, no, but but it's it's very important. Actually, we recommend it like we strongly encourage, like you all, having your own space to talk amongst each other. It's not enough like. And, by the way, like I'm with you like, I'm a founder, like I'm just like a cool person like I don't want you all to think that I'm like overseeing and monitoring you, or anything like that, like I can hang just like the rest of us. But sometimes you all are more comfortable, sharing like certain things just with the group, just with your fellow class members. And and we want to make sure you have that space.


404
01:01:36.020 --> 01:02:00.910
Lilliana Robinson: It's also social like you said like you'll all be in Sf, most of you will be an Sf. Most of the time. So like, I want you guys to hang out as much as possible self organized when there's not official programming. I think that's great. I will say, like the I think the most successful groups. In the past. Every single class we've done have had their own private channels. The least platforms you can use the better. I've seen that it does. You do get platform fatigue.


405
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, it gets spread out. Yeah.


406
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:17.340
Lilliana Robinson: We require you guys to use these 2 like you're gonna miss out on huge parts of communication if you don't have these 2. So, adding, a 3rd does inundate you guys quite a bit. So the most you can keep it on to those 2 I highly recommend. But, like Neil said we. We don't really oversee that. So that's totally up to you.


407
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:21.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, but everybody gets passionate about their own tool.


408
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:35.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Some people like slack some people like Whatsapp. Some people like, you know, whatever like thing you want to choose dealers choice, but it gets a little messy when everybody's got opinions about what tools the best and what features they want. So just be wary of that.


409
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:43.930
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: See a lot of our channels. Now get over to box, just to make it easier, because I agree on the fatigue. So no, that's all


410
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:48.699
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: to meet everyone socially and have some fun. Yeah, thank you.


411
01:02:48.700 --> 01:03:00.110
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I'm excited for you guys to see base camp tomorrow, because usually like at least half the class is like, I'm just gonna use base camp for my company now, and they stop using everything else because they just want everything in one place which is awesome.


412
01:03:00.536 --> 01:03:01.960
Lilliana Robinson: Kevin, you are next.


413
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:24.399
Kevin Su: Yeah, so there's some really cool tech stars past startups that I don't want to reach out to. I know the acceptance was a confidential acceptance. So we weren't necessarily able to tell people that we're part of this upcoming tech stars cohort. When can we start? I guess, announcing that just for me, in terms of like connecting with previous previous tech star startups.


414
01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:29.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, well, I mean, you can introduce yourself to those companies.


415
01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:56.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Now, that's okay. You can say, Hey, I'm I'm entering the next upcoming class of San Francisco really excited. I want to get to know you or get connected, or you have specific questions. Just make sure you come correct and like not every founder is going to be as responsive as another right? So just assume good intent, and that they're not ignoring you. If for some reason it takes more time to get a hold of somebody that you're trying to reach out to, but you're more than welcome to reach out to founders now that are in the techsarge network to let them know what you're doing.


416
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.850
Kevin Su: Okay, cool. Appreciate that.


417
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:05.889
Lilliana Robinson: Just to clarify for things outside of that kind of like one on one communication. We do want to wait until September 9.th


418
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:10.019
Lilliana Robinson: That is the date of like where we're the press. Release goes out so


419
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:14.940
Lilliana Robinson: as much as it can help you on these kind of one, on one settings, recruitment, investing


420
01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.349
Lilliana Robinson: networking things like that. Just extend that same confidentiality. Let them know it's not super public yet.


421
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.760
Lilliana Robinson: And then, September 9, th it'll be all over social media.


422
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:26.780
Lilliana Robinson: Any other questions.


423
01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:35.635
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: I would like to know a bit more about the demo they actually like. I know you guys like, did it all did a lot of them


424
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:44.760
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: like, what's different? Are you expect expecting? Because I'm I can see that your guys are really excited about the San Francisco batch.


425
01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:49.270
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: And what do you think how it will go and like? What is the.


426
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:50.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sure.


427
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.080
Çoruh Şimşek | CogniScope: People are going to be there. And what do you expect.


428
01:04:55.110 --> 01:05:22.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We we give, we give a whole session to prepare you all for Demo Day, where we share all the past videos from the previous demo days we've run. We set expectations. We explained you what to get from it and what you know you shouldn't expect from it anymore. Demo day amongst accelerators has evolved a lot over the years. There was a time, many years ago, when I was early on in my entrepreneurial journey, where it was like everything. People flew in from all over the world just to come to a demo day, and it was a big deal, whereas now it's become almost like


429
01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:38.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the culmination of your experience. There's sourcing of meaningful connections, meaning certain investors and people you want to have in the room. It's all good. But I will say that Demo Day is not nearly as important for the overall success of the founder experience in the accelerator program than it was.


430
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:45.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I I it is helpful that you asked that because it's important to set that expectation right now that, like Demo Day is not


431
01:05:45.620 --> 01:06:01.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the answer to our problems here like it's not going to trigger like it's not going to make it rain, like all the money isn't going to come from it, and like it's not going to be like the biggest deal. Whereas before I think it stressed people out because people had to do a lot of practice memorization stress. And like, it was like this whole pageant


432
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:26.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of a thing. And now it's like a little bit more chill like I have. You guys get up there. You do a 1 min pitch. You have a QA conversation with your eir, and you also do a product demo and product video. So that's the format for demo day that we do we found a lot of success in it, so much so that many other tech stars programs have adopted our design for how we run our our demo days.


433
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:52.939
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I would say to view Demo Day. It's so good that you asked that, Shara. Thank you. As a celebration of your experience like, Neil said. I see it as like an entering into society kind of like we're doing like a debutante kind of thing, because everyone from the community will be there. But it's not a fundraising event. The money comes from the hard work that you'll put in in the months coming after program. So setting up those meetings, working hard, doing intros, using all of the


434
01:06:52.940 --> 01:07:01.789
Lilliana Robinson: tools that we will teach you in month 3, and putting those into action as well as having an investable and fundable business that people find attractive, which is what the entire program is about.


435
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:15.739
Lilliana Robinson: So all of the work and months that come right after program is where that fundraising and money and whatever else you need activation of customers, all of that will come after the demo day is just a single day. And it's just a celebration kind of graduation for you guys to enter into the community of startups.


436
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:25.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You do get a really nice artifact, though. So we hire a video production company to do a really well produced recording of your pitch.


437
01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:41.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so that you can use that afterwards to send out. So if there are people not in the room that you wanted to extend the experience to, you can say, Hey, check out this, you know, my my Demo day video, can we have a conversation? So that's another really helpful resource. A lot of our founders utilize afterwards.


438
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.700
Lilliana Robinson: Dominique.


439
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:53.922
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Trying to get off mute, hey? It's William here. So this is


440
01:07:54.330 --> 01:08:16.059
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: change of direction. But for the Sf. Folks I'm a big coffee lover so really keen. We're going to be out next week, but if you've got any recommendations on coffee spots near the near the office, or downtown. We've heard fields. Coffee is the place to go, but any other recommendations we'd love to hear your thoughts. Yeah.


441
01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:17.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Acadena.


442
01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.640
Lilliana Robinson: You have any for us? Yeah. Akadina is the Sf. Native on the team.


443
01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:23.249
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: You got us.


444
01:08:23.952 --> 01:08:26.060
Lilliana Robinson: Born and raised.


445
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:26.885
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: No.


446
01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:32.009
akadinayadegar: Yeah, I'll definitely send you some Recs. I can't think of them off the top of my head, but I'll send them your way.


447
01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:48.699
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: You know. Will is just desperate for a coffee buddy in this cohort, because I drink monster like that's not great, but I do so he's just desperate for a coffee lover. So anyone who wants to go for coffee with Will he'll be very happy. Yeah.


448
01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:53.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I will out myself as a coffee snob. So I'm with you on that.


449
01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:54.909
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: To, the.


450
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:57.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Gram to the Gram to the degree I'm with you.


451
01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.990
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Leave from Melbourne.


452
01:09:01.969 --> 01:09:03.769
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Adelaide, boy.


453
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:05.775
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Okay, I'm in Melbourne right now.


454
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:07.180
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Times.


455
01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.604
George Reed - CEO and Founder: I recognize the coffee snob.


456
01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:11.659
George Reed - CEO and Founder: Yeah.


457
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:13.299
George Reed - CEO and Founder: that's us.


458
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.269
Lilliana Robinson: It sounds like Kevin wants to be your buddy.


459
01:09:15.847 --> 01:09:21.242
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Okay, there's a few of us. Yeah. If anyone's a monster lover, we can, you know.


460
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:28.772
Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: Awkward, cool going back on mute.


461
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:32.000
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, remind me how to say your name. Is it Uber.


462
01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:34.379
Uğur Koç | dert: It's all.


463
01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.970
Lilliana Robinson: Or okay, or.


464
01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:44.420
Uğur Koç | dert: It's a way, it's a weird one. My question is basically about galvanize. It? Does that come with? Does that place come with like a you know.


465
01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:47.629
Uğur Koç | dert: some sort of facility where we can exercise or


466
01:09:48.115 --> 01:09:54.339
Uğur Koç | dert: that do we have any good recommendations, for, you know, spots to exercise, I guess.


467
01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:02.099
Lilliana Robinson: That is a good question, George. I remember you said they have like a locker room with showers, but I don't think they have a gym. Is that correct?


468
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:03.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I don't think.


469
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.600
George H: Yeah. No. Jim.


470
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.840
George H: yeah.


471
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:23.809
Lilliana Robinson: But there, I promise you, there will be like, probably like 5, right around, because it's it's right in the area where a bunch of people are working, and so I know that there are going to be a bunch of little gyms. There are a bunch of lunch spots when you walk out. There are all these like tech professionals walking around. So it's very much in like the work district.


472
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:27.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, we'll we'll. We'll work your brain. It's on you to work your body.


473
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:40.800
Lilliana Robinson: I love that question, though, because taking care of yourself is a huge deal. I I will talk to you guys countless times about making sure you're exercising, sleeping, eating all of that, because you'll be surprised at how many people let that falter during program.


474
01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:42.160
Lilliana Robinson: All right.


475
01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.170
Lilliana Robinson: How do I say your name, Kirim, jury.


476
01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.559
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Yeah, Kurum Getai, but Karim is the short convert.


477
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:50.110
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.


478
01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:50.740
Kirimgeray Kirimli: Yeah.


479
01:10:51.270 --> 01:11:00.278
Kirimgeray Kirimli: I have a question about neighborhoods. And where we where do you guys recommend that we stay? I've been asking around


480
01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.260
Kirimgeray Kirimli: where, we should say whether we should be in downtown


481
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.180
Kirimgeray Kirimli: San Francisco or Berkeley? Or should we try somewhere a little bit outside?


482
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:12.759
Kirimgeray Kirimli: What are people's recommendations. Where are


483
01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.480
Kirimgeray Kirimli: where's everyone else staying.


484
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:40.630
Lilliana Robinson: So we made a little guide for you. Of the only the only part that we think you shouldn't stay in is the Tenderloin, and some of the like kind of veins that outspread from that. So within San Francisco kind of close to the office, there will be an area that you want to make sure you don't stay in. A lot of founders will accidentally stay there because you you like the cheap rates, but you'll see like the rates go down much, much lower when you're over there, so be careful of that, and check out the guide. We made better.


485
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:46.600
Lilliana Robinson: I'm interested in all of the natives here who who live in San Francisco. If maybe you can help.


486
01:11:46.600 --> 01:12:03.699
Morgan Stanton: Yeah, I'm happy to. I've lived here 5 years now I'm happy to talk neighborhoods. If I live right near Golden Gate park. So I, you know, when we get set up tomorrow on Base Camp, I can send you a few recommendations for some some areas that I think are nice, and I've worked in the the dog patch a lot, so I know they very well.


487
01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:13.030
Morgan Stanton: I disagree with Neil. I'm giving you. You're commuting over the bridge. That's crazy. Get a place in San Francisco, Berkeley, or Oakland. That's the long commute of the traffic.


488
01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:19.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, I I mean, I agree with you. I I'm not doing it by choice. It's it's more of a


489
01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:24.497
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know I got. I got dealt that card, and I just gotta deal with it. Now.


490
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:31.210
Morgan Stanton: Places to live. It's just you. You better like, you know, taking an Uber for a while, or have great podcasts in your car.


491
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:55.169
Kevin Su: Also at, like Facebook, Sf, roommate groups, there's a lot of sublets around this time as well. Generally like pretty good areas. I mean, Sf. Is only 7 miles wide, 7 miles long, so there's only so many neighborhoods you can be in. But I re repeat the thought of like Tenderloin stay out of Oakland's a little bit far. But yeah, there's a lot of sublets during this time that's perfect for the timing of this program as well.


492
01:12:58.980 --> 01:12:59.640
Uğur Koç | dert: Also.


493
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.860
Annie Brown: Not Illino.


494
01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:01.200
Uğur Koç | dert: Sorry.


495
01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:08.380
Annie Brown: Walkable to the to the Tech Stars office. So I like, I like kind of not uphill area.


496
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:38.330
Uğur Koç | dert: Yeah, I was just gonna add, like as someone who's been looking around the homes or around the you know, sf, area, like the like. You better be quick, I guess, because in my experience they constantly change. They come. They go especially since you know the kids around the block also, announced the cohort in, you know, right in the middle of San Francisco for the 1st time.


497
01:13:38.682 --> 01:13:49.129
Uğur Koç | dert: You know, if you can get a deal going you probably should, because it it felt like like I. I was looking at the home one day, and then the next day it was completely gone, so.


498
01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:57.549
Lilliana Robinson: Cool. I love that. See, we're already helping each other. That was a great question, Krim. I'm sure a lot of people were wondering


499
01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:00.960
Lilliana Robinson: any other final questions before I go over some announcements.


500
01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:11.330
Lilliana Robinson: and if you remember something later, you can ask me. Tomorrow I'll have a little question segment at the start of every call.


501
01:14:14.690 --> 01:14:17.599
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, can we pull the slides back up a Kadina


502
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:30.340
Lilliana Robinson: alright


503
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:32.830
Lilliana Robinson: next slide?


504
01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:53.269
Lilliana Robinson: Okay? So tomorrow's session. So I've talked a lot about the base camp onboarding. But I haven't talked about the second session. We're gonna have tomorrow. So as I put in the email, I wrote it out for you as well as our Ceos, who are on the Google Calendar. You'll see there's this 12 to 1 30 Pm. Pst. Session called. So what are you building?


505
01:14:53.270 --> 01:15:22.059
Lilliana Robinson: This is a new session, we added. I'm extremely excited about it, because the last cohort asked for this and said that it's something you guys would like. It's so that you can introduce your companies to one another in depth to actually tell each other what you're working on. They said that without that it seems like it takes a couple of weeks to truly like. Get what each other is working on, so the sooner that you can like understand it. The more you can start helping each other, sharing connections, sharing ideas, things like that. So what you'll want to prepare


506
01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:28.209
Lilliana Robinson: it's super low key. It's not like any any sort of formal thing, so you can just like wing it if you don't have time.


507
01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:56.289
Lilliana Robinson: But you'll have 4 min with or without slides, like. If you want to show pictures of something you can 4 min to present anything you'd like about your company, anything you'd like your classmates to know. So it's not for us. We already in depth know what your company is pretty well cause we had to present them. But for your classmates what would be helpful for them to know? What do you want them to understand about who you're targeting, what you're building? Why, you're building it things like that, and then we'll have time for like 2 questions each.


508
01:15:56.574 --> 01:16:14.179
Lilliana Robinson: So we'll let some of your classmates ask you a couple of questions about the business, and then we'll move on, so we'll do 4 min each with or without slides. You can show visuals if you want and we'll just hear from each other, and it'll be pretty fun. I'm really excited for it. I wanted to give you a heads up in case you wanted to prepare. That'll be at noon tomorrow.


509
01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.799
Lilliana Robinson: Cool. Okay. Next slide.


510
01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:49.829
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, let's review your pre programmed to dos. So you're gonna await the second pre program. Update. That will be coming by Wednesday. It might come on Tuesday. That will have the program handbook that each of you is expected to read in its entirety. There is a lot of information we did not cover in this session because it's just more tedious and in the weeds. So it's expected that you read that it's pretty short. It's like 5 pages. Team reflection exercise is going to be something that will send to you. That's just going to be a short


511
01:16:49.960 --> 01:17:03.969
Lilliana Robinson: one to 2 h meeting you should have with your team to reflect on some things and consider some questions. We'll give you you'll also get the pre programmed prep week, 2 schedule written out, and a couple more things. Some highlights of


512
01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:23.246
Lilliana Robinson: to do's reviewing the mattress interview by Wednesday. Neil has asked that you guys review that I linked it in the email? I know you all listened to it during the selection process. That's how you got here. That was a while ago. So go back. Listen to it again. And just remember, because we're going to be referencing it a lot. So if you don't remember


513
01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:34.529
Lilliana Robinson: the customer's story as well. Things like that, ways that Bob asks these questions. All of that is going to get analyzed. And if it's not fresh in your brain. It's going to be a little hard to follow the workshop


514
01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:35.830
Lilliana Robinson: starting on Wednesday.


515
01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:41.749
Lilliana Robinson: Remember to order your welcome kits and complete the class roster and then start working on your pre-work packets.


516
01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.929
Lilliana Robinson: I think there's 1 more slide, a Katina.


517
01:17:45.530 --> 01:18:08.809
Lilliana Robinson: So the rest of this week we're Gonna give you base camp access, you'll introduce your company to each other. We'll then go into customer discovery immersive Week. We'll hit you back to back with 3 customer discovery workshops and just completely immerse you into the framework. It's going to be a lot of learning, but I think it's going to be so fun. That's Neil, and my favorite thing to teach, and it's really the bread and butter of our program. Then.


518
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:22.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's not. It's not a mistake to say that. I mean, we. We go deeper on that than any program anywhere like there's no program that comes even close, I think even throughout techsars they spend a good 2 h on it in one session, but for us we do at least 4, probably more.


519
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:33.070
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, yeah, plus presentations and one on one help. It's it's honestly a good quarter of our program. It's very important to us, because that's the cornerstone of your business. You're literally.


520
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:35.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Lisa, sales. Yeah.


521
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:37.140
Lilliana Robinson: Exactly.


522
01:18:37.150 --> 01:19:06.840
Lilliana Robinson: Sales is everything. We're here to help you build investable fundable businesses, and part of that is making money. So then, following week, we'll do project management. We'll go over Okrs, and then Chloe will follow up with goal setting meetings with you all. I'll do my business blueprint workshop, which is kind of a follow up to customer discovery. It's 1 of my favorites, and then there's a new workshop. That all of textures is getting that I will be presenting to you guys, which is assumptions and experimentation, and that one will also kind of cover a little bit about spending.


523
01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:14.979
Lilliana Robinson: So that is our week, and next week I'm really excited for you guys. We will meet back here. Can you go to the next slide? Akadena?


524
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:17.580
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, go one more.


525
01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:45.400

Invite for 12 pm. But just go ahead and save this link. This is a special like platform where we're going to do icebreakers together. We do it every program. So just kind of open this in a tab or copy this. We'll join it at noon. And then one more link. Can you go back? One slide, Akadena?


526
01:19:45.600 --> 01:20:01.200
Lilliana Robinson: One more link is, we have a very rudimentary company. Lookbook for you guys. Keep it super super super confidential, but it just has some one liners, and like a little bit more about each of you, so that you guys can get to know each other before tomorrow we'll drop that link in the chat as well.


527
01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.170
