WEBVTT

1
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Contrary or negative, about any of our businesses. We don't do that. We only get feedback internally, not externally, to anyone.


2
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
But at the same time.


3
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Allowing us to have praise for all of the the positive traits and qualities that not only investors, but other, you know, partners and other supporters of you. Wanna look for.


4
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
If we can just say that in unison for all 12 companies throughout the entire program, that is always a get.


5
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
So we really appreciate everybody being in alignment there with decorum.


6
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Yeah, and it'll say this in the Handbook. But.


7
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:16.000
We didn't used to fully require attendance at all of our sessions, but after a certain point, so many iterations and design


8
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Thinking went into the program that we're confident in asking you guys to be there and asking for your time. This is something that we take very sensitively, is your time and prioritizing certain things for you, and we try to make sure that we're good stewards of your time. In addition to attendance. The second part of your role is engagement. So not only being here, but being present. So keeping your video on and being fully present and engaged in our program sessions, as well.


9
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Really important to us. Multitasking is just not going to work because of the density of the.


10
00:36:48.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Curriculum that you're going to be given. So you're going to be learning very deep things. Someone said, it sounds like we. You might be going back to university it. It is very similar to that. Neil and I are actually both faculty at Northwestern University, and we use very similar teaching styles at the college. So it is going to be pretty dense, and you do wanna make sure you're paying attention. If for some reason you need to step out.


11
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:26.000
You can leave and come back. It's totally fine. It's it's not drill, Sergeant Time, but just making a promise to yourself to be engaged. And it's also respectful to all of our presenters that we're bringing in. We're gonna be bringing in experts from around the world who will be zooming in.


12
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Yeah, Dave, you can absolutely take notes. That's more than encouraged.


13
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:43.000
But just making sure you give that respect cause these people are not getting paid. They're coming to give their time just by our give 1st motto of tech stars, and so the best thing we can do to put our good foot forward for them is to be engaged.


14
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Ask questions when they ask you to participate. Make sure that we have a lot of people raising hands. All that good hygiene.


15
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
The 3rd part is being collaborative. So, yeah, is there a question.


16
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Okay.


17
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Well, Lily, I was just gonna add that the engagement part also benefits you because.


18
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
We've had mentors, workshop presenters, and others who come visit, and for you know, present.


19
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
To you all.


20
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Take a liking or curiosity to specific founders who stand out in those interactions and engagements. So the ones who are the most inquisitive.


21
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Who seem to apply what they're learning as they go follow up afterwards they end up getting angel checks. They end up getting additional advice and guidance for free.


22
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
They end up getting a lot more benefits than what they originally thought they were signing up for.


23
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Because they're demonstrating how you know significant.


24
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
And and important. There.


25
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
They're taking what they're learning.


26
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:44.000
So all of these different inputs are signals about whether a founder is likely to succeed or not.


27
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000
The 3rd part is being collaborative. So your role is also, you have the expectation that you guys are collaborating with your classmates.


28
00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Neil. And I always say the biggest value that you're gonna get out of this program. Apart from the design curriculum, the funding, the


29
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Optics of getting to be in techstars, which is a huge deal. The biggest value you're gonna get is.


30
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
The classmates you're gonna meet here. So.


31
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Part of your role is to be collaborative with them, working together, learning about each other's backgrounds, learning about each other's companies.


32
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Helping each other with your problems and just collaborating on everything, putting your heads together, problem solving together. It is.


33
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:46.000
The highest value. I can't say it enough that you're going to get from this, and the more you lean in the more you'll get out of it. A lot of class classes are still meeting monthly, helping each other because they got so close during program. And I say this at the beginning of every single program, and a lot of people aren't aren't sure they're like, that's not really why I came to Texas. I'm here for the learning. I'm here for all of that, and every single person on the last day is.


34
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Saying, Wow, my class is exactly the biggest thing I got out of techstars. So I'm just giving you that warning now and telling you to lean in as much as possible.


35
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:04.000
1. 1 more thing to acknowledge about that. You'll hear me say this a few times. It's gonna come up as we, as we continue to iterate, reiterate that point, but.


36
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000
There are probably some companies in this group right now that are gonna build multi 1 million dollar businesses.


37
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And not only will you all be able to work together with the founders who do that hopefully, it's all of you, but definitely some are gonna do that but there have been times in the past where founders have pulled together resources and found a way to share with.


38
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
That.


39
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Particular company, success.


40
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
You all put a little full little capital together, and you end up investing in that business that's taken off so.


41
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Even if it's not everyone. If some of you succeed and you end up looking out for each other, everybody gets to ride the wave.


42
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:45.000
So there's a lot of really cool stories like that that happen in tech stars.


43
00:40:45.000 --> 00:41:07.000
And then the 4th one is staying communicative. So communication is something we very highly value our base camp training. We'll talk more about communication. And then next week Neil and I will do project management day with you guys. But outside of just digital communication and good hygiene of keeping us up to date. There's also intellectual honesty. So, making sure that.


44
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Any key updates that are happening. Anything like that. You're coming to Neil. To myself. We're like your co-founders now. So we want to stay up to date with your business, with what's happening, with what you need, even if it's bad. So a lot of people are kind of like intimidated to give bad news to Neil, but that's actually exactly when you should come to him. So we've really value staying extremely.


45
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:45.000
And that starts now. So you should treat us as your co-founders. We're in the weeds with you. We wanna know what's happening. The good, the bad, the ugly, anything like that. And that's also day to day. That's telling us when you can't come to a session that's telling us you have to drop early for something.


46
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.000
That's also telling us, hey, we lost a customer today. So whatever it is staying communicative is extremely important for your role here.


47
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And I can't say that there isn't any like. There's nothing I haven't seen.


48
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
But I've made 150 investments.


49
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Over the past 5 years.


50
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
And I've seen a lot.


51
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:16.000
So whatever you're going through is probably not gonna phase us like we're ready for it doesn't matter what it is. You can trust us. We have seen a lot, and we can hopefully draw from those experiences to help you.


52
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
So that's your role. We can go to the next slide.


53
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Do you want to explain, Eirs now.


54
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Yeah. Happy to. So one really cool?


55
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Addition to the tech Stars program that's happened in recent years is.


56
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
With.


57
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:49.000
The scale of the organization expanding to over 30 different cities now over the world, we've had to find ways to augment what I do as managing director with with each of our classes. So my perspective and experience only goes so far. I'm 1 person with.


58
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
You know 1 1 set of things. It's always nice to have.


59
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
A few other people who are just as qualified.


60
00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
To weigh in and spend time with each of your businesses. So we actually deliberately hire.


61
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:10.000
3 people per class of 12 companies to directly work with the companies on a weekly basis. In addition to myself.


62
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
So these are called eis entrepreneurs and residents, and each class we kind of hand pick.


63
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:28.000
People and recruit them. Who, we think would be a great fit to spend some of their time. We can't afford their time to be honest, but we offer up a stipend as a formality, because every program we've had we have these mentors who end up spending.


64
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000
A disproportion amount of time working with the companies, and they they're so awesome, and all the founders say they're awesome, but they're spread too thin.


65
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
So this is a way for us to formalize our relationship with some of our smartest.


66
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
And most effective entrepreneurs and operators.


67
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Give them a little bit of money so that they have a formal time commitment to specific companies at specific phases of the program experience, so you'll you'll find out who they are and and meet them in the in the coming weeks.


68
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
I'm excited for you to meet them.


69
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Okay, next, slide.


70
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Perfect.


71
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
So communication protocol. This is 2 parts.


72
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:32.000
One, you're gonna learn a lot about tomorrow. So our hub for the program is base camp. And I wrote this out in my email on Friday. Everything you'll need to know. We take pride in it all being a 1 shop. So everything is in there. That's where we'll communicate. That's where you'll submit things from your team. That's also where you'll communicate with your classmates. There will be an Hq. Where all of you are. There will also be an individual company, project.


73
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Where our team works hands-on with your team in the weeds of your business. And then the second part is for more immediate.


74
00:44:41.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Quick responses. We have another app that's on your phone called Voxer. And this is like an Async Walky. A lot of venture capitalists use this. Our CEO, David Cohen, is on there. Most managing directors are on there, and this is how we communicate with our founders for direct or urgent things. Think of it as a direct line to Neil.


75
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
So whenever you need him you can send a little voice. Memo. You'll hear back from him 24 to 48 h.


76
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Pretty immediately. Base camp is. We're also pretty much on there every single day. But if we happen to be in a meeting or something, and you just need to quickly box us. We can. We can get that. So all of the information on how to download that and everything is in the program handbook which we'll get later this week.


77
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:30.000
And then for base camp. You'll get access at the end of the day tomorrow after I train you guys in the morning and kind of just show you everything that you need to know.


78
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
The only other thing that we use is Google Calendar to do all of our virtual.


79
00:45:36.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Programming as well as email to communicate with external members. So like our mentors, our workshop hosts, people like that are not going to be in base camp with us. That's just for the founders and our program team. So we do have to use email to communicate with the outside world, as I say, but everything for the program will be centered in base cam, and the main reason for Boxer is because Neil's inbox is extremely flooded by.


80
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Thousands of other founders who want his attention kind of same with mine. And so it's not a great way to communicate with us. When you guys send us emails, they get buried under hundreds of emails per day with other people.


81
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:25.000
But voxer is a direct line that we only give to you guys same with base camp. So only our founders and our internal team are on voxer and base camp. So you get this direct line straight to us.


82
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Do you wanna add anything about communication? Maybe like Async stuff, Neil.


83
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Yeah, we we value asynchronous communication, because.


84
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
It's such a treat to have time for flow.


85
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
As many of you all, I'm sure, would appreciate.


86
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
I come from a programming background myself and.


87
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Having 3 4 blocks of uninterrupted time per day is golden to me.


88
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
And I want to give you all that same gift if we can.


89
00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:01.000
That being said when it's time for real conversation, we're there for it, and we're happy to do it. We just wanna make sure that we've gone through the layers of understanding whether it's the right thing to do.


90
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
So just trust our process. And I think.


91
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Especially as co-founders and leaders of your businesses as you scale them up. You're gonna appreciate some of our techniques.


92
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Great.


93
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Okay, next, slide.


94
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Weekly expectations. So the 1st month which I'll go over in the next slide is kind of crazy because we.


95
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Have an inundation of workshops in the 1st week purposefully, so we can give you as much info as quickly as possible, so that that can start being implemented as early as possible.


96
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
And then we go into mentor. Madness.


97
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:47.000
So the 1st month is very unique, and it's kind of a very busy time. But months 2 and 3 get into a rhythm. So once we pass weeks 5 and 6, and we're in that.


98
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Second and 3rd trimester of the program. You'll see that we get into this weekly cadence. So on a week to week basis what you can expect once we get into that flow.


99
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Kpis weekly with your Eis.


100
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:26.000
CEO and Cxo small groups which I'll be groups of 4. That's where you guys will get pretty close. That's kind of to support each other personally and professionally, and to just have a more intimate setting outside of the larger group to support each other. You'll have CEO roundtable every other week with Neil, and sometimes myself. And that's where we. It's with the CEO's over here, the problems that you're facing and all of the Ceos.


101
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
As well as part of our program team, put our heads together to try and solve those problems.


102
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:46.000
For each of the Ceos, and then the last thing is 12 by 12. So you'll see that written as 12 x 12, that is 12 companies by 12 noon on Fridays. It is basically an end of week round Table where we close out the week. We'll have it every other week.


103
00:48:46.000 --> 00:49:12.000
And we give our highs and lows of the week and kind of reflect things like that. And that's where we can come together and kind of learn more about each other, and hear about each other's weeks and bond, and I really like those. The 12 by 12 are some of my favorite parts of the program. Sometimes we'll have themed 12 by 12, so we'll have, like a Halloween one for costume contest things like that. So there are fun things sprinkled in those are your weekly expectations.


104
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:26.000
You will also get a base camp to do list every week with certain deliverables that won't happen as much in the 1st few weeks of program. You might have one for week one, but it'll happen a lot more in that second and 3rd month where you'll have these deliverables every single week.


105
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Some of them go with the workshops that you'll have that week, and some of them are outside of that and just part of our program. So make sure that you're looking at Base Camp. If, after I give the training tomorrow, you still don't understand base camp, or you need help, it's very crucial that you make sure that you understand it, and you reach out for help, because you will be held to.


106
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Delivering these assignments and things like that. And so you wanna make sure that you know where to find them.


107
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
We can get.


108
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
And just to illuminate a little bit of what we mean by that, like we're talking.


109
00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Data, room stuff, financial models, certain things to prep for sales, workshops, all types of things that are additive to your progress with your business, but, like more uniquely cater to the particular programming we have that week.


110
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Exactly.


111
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
We can go to the next slide.


112
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:23.000
So program structure. I was kind of hinting at it in the last one, but the program is kind of broken up into 3 months. The 1st month is introduction and mentor, madness.


113
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:32.000
It's just full of programming. You should think of month one as just. You're just here to learn. Your brain's gonna be full of knowledge. You're gonna have pages, notes.


114
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:40.000
The second week is going to be arena week, where you kind of give presentations on some of the stuff you learned, and we tell you where you're at for each subject.


115
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000
And then we'll have 2 weeks of mentor madness, and that concludes month one.


116
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Month.


117
00:50:46.000 --> 00:51:03.000
It'll start with Sf, tech week, which is kind of unique for this program. It's pretty cool that's happening. During your program I wrote a lot about it. And Chloe also made you guys a guide. It's all in the email that I sent on Friday. But we will have no programming in week 5. So that you guys can attend that if you choose to do so.


118
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
And then week, 6.


119
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:12.000
We'll start growth month. So month 2 is growth month. We'll start by being all in person with some experts flying in.


120
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:19.000
For our mid-program Meetup, and then the rest of the weeks of that month are just filled with growth sales like growth, hacking sales.


121
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:25.000
And all these different things that'll just like help. You take the knowledge that you learned in month one, and then.


122
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Product development.


123
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Yeah, actually, iterate and develop your product launch, start making money.


124
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Iterating on experimenting, and all of those different things validating your assumptions. You've made all of that. And then the 3rd month we go into fundraising. Prep and demo day prep.


125
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:54.000
So pretty much. Every workshop will be there like pitch practice, helping you with your product, Demo, or getting you ready to launch a fundraising round. So that's how we break up our program. And then, obviously, it culminates in Demo Day, which will be the 1st week of December.


126
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
That's.


127
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:02.000
The basic structure. I think the next slide is about it being hybrid. Can you click the next slide.


128
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Yeah, so it is a hybrid program. And when I say hybrid, it is an in person program that is remote, accessible. So in person programming. We have an office. Our team will be there. It'll be available for the entire duration of the program to all full time participants.


129
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
For the non full time participants. We'll have a.


130
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Daily rate that you guys can pay to have your part time people in there. But for all of our full time participants, you'll be a full member for these 3 months, and you'll have full 24 7 access to the office.


131
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:38.000
But there will be weeks that are remote, accessible. This is extremely helpful to our founders, so you can take meetings in other cities.


132
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:56.000
You can do any sort of obligations you need personally, if you need to be somewhere else. And then we just have certain weeks where it's immersive and we're all gonna be there required. Our host will be in person things like that. So that's kind of where we get the hybrid we are very prepared to run a hybrid program where everything is streamable.


133
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:20.000
We also have a lot of international who might not make it to week one because of visa issues. So we'll be streaming every single in person thing to be completely accessible. Remotely so, even if you have co-founders who aren't going to be joining us in person, maybe they're part time or something. They can join every single session, or maybe 98% of the sessions. Virtually every single thing will be also hosted on zoom.


134
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
lilliana. I think, technically speaking.


135
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
We've only ever run hybrid programs.


136
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Yep.


137
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.000
I don't think we've run any other kind of program ever. This is our 12th program, and every single one has been running this hybrid form.


138
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Yep, and I would say, This is.


139
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Probably the most in person program we've ever run. Having a full-time office is not something we've ever really done before.


140
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
We've had


141
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:57.000
An office during the immersive weeks. But this one is the 1st time we'll have, like a fully staffed office for the entire duration of the program accessible to our every single founder which is really exciting.


142
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Yeah. So we'll we'll learn new things based on that, too.


143
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000
I'm very excited for you guys to see the office, it is within galvanize, galvanize San Francisco, which is kind of like a, we work.


144
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:23.000
And they are so excited to meet you all the members of galvanize that already work there. They're working on their own startups and the staff there. They're so excited that tech stars is coming. So I know that they're gonna wanna like talk to in the kitchen and everything like that. So it'll be a great community for you guys. I can't wait.


145
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000
There are lots of places for you all to carve out to work.


146
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
If you don't want to be in the main spaces that we already have dedicated.


147
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
And there are multiple floors for you all to occupy as well. So.


148
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
I feel like the tech stars companies are just gonna like.


149
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Take over that building.


150
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Okay? And the last slide.


151
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Is our commitment so.


152
00:54:48.000 --> 00:55:07.000
We have this written out more fully. We wrote a commitment for you guys just like you wrote one to get into program. But the highlights here. I'll let you read the full thing in the handbook. The highlights are. We know we're expecting a lot from you, but it goes both ways. So we hold ourselves to operational excellence. We hold ourselves to always being here to help you guys.


153
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Through the thick and thin of making a business, and we know that we can do that because we've done this many times before. The highest value at techstars is give. 1st you'll hear us say that a thousand times, and you'll hear the members of our network say that but we also value do what's right for founders. And when, as a team, so our highest value is ensuring your success.


154
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
So that's kind of our commitment to you.


155
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000
I think the next slide is questions. Did you want to add anything? Now?


156
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000
You nailed it. We're good.


157
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Yeah. So I have some announcements.


158
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
30 min to spare. That's good.


159
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
I know.


160
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000
I figured there might be quite a few questions, so hit me with all of them, and then I'll go through some announcements, and then we'll break for lunch.


161
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Don't be shy. I'm sure everyone has questions.


162
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Yeah. I guess in terms of updating for not being able to make certain meetings do. Who do we reach out to for that? And do we wanna do that through Boxer email.


163
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
I don't know. I missed that part.


164
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Base. Count. Okay.


165
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:21.000
You'll wanna do it through base camp base. I'll show you how to do it tomorrow. Chloe and Academia are our like program managers. Program. Coordinator and program associate are their titles. And so they'll be the ones that are in charge of attendance and things like that. So you can, you can message either of them.


166
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:27.000
In base, camp.


167
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Well, if if you could go into a bit more detail on what the.


168
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
You know.


169
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000
You were talking about the CEO change. We've already read about it. A couple of weeks ago.


170
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:45.000
If you could go into more detail about what this tech starts to point out, thing is because.


171
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Sure.


172
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
You know it looks exciting, but I don't get what it is, and I don't like things that I don't get so.


173
00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Yeah, no, I understand. And I feel the same way. I don't like things that I don't get either. So there were just a lot of performance improvements that were planned for techs overall.


174
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:08.000
And many of them are still underway. Some of them are changing with new leaderships. So there was a plan to.


175
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
You know.


176
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Roll back text Us programs to certain markets.


177
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
That.


178
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Plan is in part still in motion, but is also in part being.


179
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Paused or rolled back.


180
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000
So, without saying too much, I'll just say that.


181
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000
One of the most important aspects of techs, historically, has been community.


182
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
So it's really important for us.


183
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Even if we're entering new communities to make sure that we're maintaining strong relationships.


184
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
The communities that helped.


185
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000
This organization get off the ground. In the early years.


186
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
So we're doing a lot of work right now as a company to make sure that.


187
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
With alumni all over the world, and currently and actively operating in 30 different cities.


188
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
With this text our 2 announcement that was happening earlier this year.


189
00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:00.000
There were changes that were happening that made San Francisco like a key market for us now going forward. New York, Boston, and La.


190
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000
That also came with an announcement that there were some other markets and communities that we operated in, that we are no longer operating in.


191
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Right. That was Seattle, Chicago, Austin.


192
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Boulder.


193
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:17.000
And I think we're in conversation right now to maintain activity in in some of these places. Still.


194
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000
So that's kind of what it means. Right now. I'll share a much more unvarnished.


195
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Version of this story when we're on the retreat.


196
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
That's not recorded.


197
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000
That's what I call it off the record.


198
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
It.


199
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
I have a quick question oh, Dominique, you have your hand raised.


200
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
And then we'll go back to you, Annie.


201
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
No, it's fine. I'll go up to you. Go ahead. It's fine, all good.


202
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Okay, yeah, just a quick question, when can we start using the office space? I'm just excited to see it use it.


203
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Get out of my little studio apartment.


204
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Yeah, I'm excited for you guys to September 9.th Our 1st day is gonna be when you can get in there we'll do a tour we'll kick off with like a little quick orientation with the staff, and then we'll all be in there right now. We're getting it ready. We're putting up some decals and like just finishing touches, and then they'll be ready for you guys. On September 9.th


205
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Awesome. That's such a great resource. Thank you.


206
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Yeah, I'm excited for you guys.


207
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Kevin. Oh, let's go back to Dominique, and then Kevin.


208
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Thanks, thanks, Kevin. No, it was just a question regarding communication, so I'm conscious of.


209
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Add in another communication to the cohort, but.


210
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
I hear.


211
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:43.000
And Fox. I hope I've said that correctly is is the direct communication to Neil, and so forth.


212
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Then we've got base camp, which I'm super excited about. But I'm just thinking in terms of a group between the cohort that.


213
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
More for like.


214
00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I don't know socially like, Hey, I'm I'm here. So I wanna grab a coffee or.


215
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Oh no!


216
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Shall we do this? I don't know. It's just an idea. I'm I'm just nervous to suggest it, and everyone's like, Oh, not.


217
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Patient channel.


218
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Okay.


219
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Of course. No, no, that's going to happen like that's inevitable. There's always gonna be a group that gets formed. We don't necessarily dictate what form that is.


220
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
My my recommendation would be to like, try out my little boxer thing because you can form your own private group.


221
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
On, that.


222
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Amongst each other there. Yeah, you could do it there for sure, and have it as your own, like, meaning not something that we're seeing or managing ourselves. So I think you'd appreciate that to keep things simple. However. We can't tell you what to do. You. You all are your own founders and your own skin. So if you all decide, another channel makes sense. By all means do that. But I would definitely recommend trying out what we're recommending to start.


223
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Oh, yeah.


224
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Yeah, no, I totally misunderstood. I thought I didn't realize you could do that on Vox. So yeah, like.


225
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Oh, you didn't hear anything wrong. I love that idea, Dominique.


226
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I think.


227
01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I mean, I mean, for that matter, you can also have your own base camp, too, like that. You could have your own project, that we're not a part of. That's also an option. So.


228
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Okay, I wasn't thinking about discluding you guys. It was more just.


229
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Nope, that's it's something that.


230
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Ask this.


231
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
No, no, but but it's it's very important. Actually, we recommend it like we strongly encourage, like you all having your own.


232
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Space to talk amongst each other. It's not enough like a and, by the way, like.


233
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I'm with you like I'm a founder, like I'm just like a cool person like I don't want you all to think that I'm like overseeing and monitoring you, or anything like that like I could hang.


234
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Just like the rest of us. But.


235
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Sometimes you all are more comfortable.


236
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Sharing like certain things just with the group.


237
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Just with your fellow classmates, and and we wanna make sure you have that space.


238
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Yeah. Awesome.


239
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Yeah.


240
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It's also social like you said like, you'll all be an Sf. Most of the time. So like, I want you guys to hang out as much as possible. Self organize when there's not.


241
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Official programming. I think that's great. I will say, like the I think the most successful groups.


242
01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.000
In the past. Every single class we've done have had their own private channels. The least platforms you can use the better. I've seen that it does. You do get platform fatigue.


243
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Yeah, it gets spread out. Yeah.


244
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Yeah.


245
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
We require you guys to use these 2 like you're gonna miss out on huge parts of communication if you don't have these 2. So adding, a 3rd does inundate you guys quite a bit. So the most you can keep it onto those 2 I highly recommend. But, like Neil said, we? We don't really oversee that. So that's totally up to you guys.


246
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Like.


247
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
But everybody gets passionate about their own tool.


248
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Hi.


249
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Some people like slack. Some people like Whatsapp. Some people like.


250
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You know, whatever like thing you want to choose choice, but it gets a little messy when everybody's got opinions about what tools the best what features they want, so just be wary of that.


251
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Yep.


252
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I can see encouraging a lot of our channels. Now get over to box, just to make it easier, because I agree on the fatigue. So no, that's awesome to me, everyone socially, and have some fun.


253
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Yeah, thank, you.


254
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
You're not.


255
01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I'm excited for you guys to see base camp tomorrow. Cause usually like at least half the class is like, I'm just gonna use base camp for my company now, and they stop using everything else because they just want everything in one place which is awesome.


256
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Yeah, see?


257
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Kevin, you're next.


258
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Yeah, so there's some really cool tech stars that I don't wanna reach out to I know the acceptance was the confidential.


259
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Acceptance. So we weren't necessarily able to tell people that we're part of this upcoming tech starts cohort.


260
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
When can we start? I guess, announcing that just.


261
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
For me in terms of like connecting with previous texts or startups.


262
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Oh, well, I mean you could introduce yourself to those companies.


263
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Now, that's okay. You can say, Hey, I'm I'm entering the next upcoming class of San Francisco, really excited. I want to get to know you or get connected, or you have specific questions. Just make sure you come correct.


264
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And you you like. Not every founder is gonna be as responsive as another right? So just assume good intent, and that they're not ignoring you. If for some reason it takes more time to get a hold of somebody that you're trying to reach out to.


265
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000
But you're more than welcome to reach out to founders now that are in the tech network, to let them know what you're doing.


266
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Okay, cool. Appreciate that.


267
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Just to clarify for things outside of that kind of like one on one communication. We do want to wait until September 9.th


268
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
That is the day of like where we're the press. Release goes out so.


269
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
As much as it can help you on these kind of one, on one settings.


270
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Networking things like that just extend that same confidentiality. Let them know it's not super public yet.


271
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And then September 9, th and it'll be all of our social media.


272
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Any other questions.


273
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I would like to know a bit more about the demo day actually like


274
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I know you guys.


275
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Like did it all. There's a lot of them.


276
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Like.


277
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000
What different are you expecting? Because I'm I can see that your guys are really excited about the San Francisco batch.


278
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And what do you think how it will go and like.


279
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Sure.


280
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Yeah.


281
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
What is the format? People are going to be there, and what do you expect? Different.


282
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:09.000
We we give, we give a whole session to prepare you all for Demo Day, where we share all the past videos from the previous demo days we've run. We set expectations. We explained to you what to get from it and what you know you shouldn't expect from it anymore.


283
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Demo day amongst accelerators has evolved a lot over the years. There was a time, many years ago, when I was early on in my entrepreneur journey, where it was like everything.


284
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
People flew in from all over the world just to come to a demo day, and it was a big deal, whereas now it's become almost like.


285
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
The culmination of your experience.


286
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:38.000
There's sourcing of meaningful connections, meaning certain investors and people you want to have in the room. It's all good, but I will say that Demo day is not nearly as important for the overall success of the founder experience and the accelerator program than it was.


287
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So I. It is helpful that you asked that because it's important to set that expectation right now that, like Demo Day is not.


288
01:05:46.000 --> 01:06:02.000
The answer to our problems here like, it's not gonna trigger like it's not gonna make it rain, like all the money is gonna come from it and like, it's not gonna be like the biggest deal. Whereas before I think it stress people out because people had to do a lot of practice, memorization, stress, and like. It was like this whole pageant.


289
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Of a thing.


290
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And now it's like a little bit more chill, like I have. You guys get up there. You do a 1 min pitch.


291
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:18.000
You have a QA conversation with your, and you also do a product demo and product video. So that's the format for demo day that we do.


292
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
We found a lot of success in it, so much so that many other tech programs have adopted.


293
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Our design.


294
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
For how we run our our demo days.


295
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Yeah, I would say to view Demo Day. It's so good that you asked that. Thank you. As a celebration of your experience like, Neil said. I see it as like an entering into society, kinda like we're doing like a debutant kind of thing, because everyone from the community will be there. But it's not a fundraising event. The money comes from the hard work that you'll put in in the months coming after program. So setting up those meetings, working hard, doing intros, using all of the.


296
01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Tools that we will teach you in month 3, and putting those into action, as well as having an investable and fundable business that people find attractive, which is what the entire program is about.


297
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So all of the work and months that come right after programs where that fundraising and money and whatever else you need, activation of customers. All of that will come after the demo day is just a single day. And it's just a celebration kind of graduation for you guys to enter into the community of startups.


298
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You do get a really nice artifact, though. So we hire a video production company to do a really well produced.


299
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Recording of your pitch.


300
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
So that you can use that afterwards to send out. So if there are people not in the room.


301
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:44.000
That you wanted to extend the experience to, you can say, Hey, check out this. You know, my, my demo date video, can we have a conversation. So that's another really helpful resource. A lot of our founders.


302
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Dominique.


303
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Trying to get off mute. Hey? It's William here. So this is


304
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Change of direction but for the Sf.


305
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Folks. I'm a big coffee lover, so really keen, we're gonna be out next week. But if you've got any recommendations on.


306
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Coffee spots near the near the office, or downtown. We've heard coffee is the place to go, but any other recommendations would love to hear your thoughts.


307
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
That's Acadena.


308
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
You have any for us. Yeah. Is the Sf. Native on the team.


309
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
So you guys.


310
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Thank you.


311
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Yeah. Born. And raised.


312
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
No.


313
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Yeah, I'll definitely send you some wrecks. I can't think of them off the top of my head, but I'll send them your way.


314
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Perfect. Thank you, you know. Will is just for a coffee in this cohort, because I drink monster like that's not great, but I do so he's just desperate for a coffee lover. So anyone wants to go for coffee with Will. He'll be very happy. Yeah.


315
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I will out myself as a coffee, so I'm with you on that.


316
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
To the Gram, to the Gram to the degree I'm with you.


317
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Willie, from Melbourne.


318
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Adelaide, boy.


319
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Was it Nahu.


320
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
You bet. Yeah.


321
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I like, okay, I'm in Melbourne right now.


322
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Aye.


323
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I recognized the copy.


324
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Yeah.


325
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Yeah.


326
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
It sounds like Kevin wants to be a buddy.


327
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Okay, there's a few of us. Yeah.


328
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000
If anyone's a monster lover we can.


329
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Awkward, cool, going back on mute.


330
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Okay, remind me how to say your name, is it.


331
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It's all.


332
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Or okay, or.


333
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It's a way, it's a weird one. My question is basically about galvanize. It? Does that come with? Does that place come with like a.


334
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
You know.


335
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Some sort of facility where we can exercise or.


336
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.000
That do we have any good recommendations, for, you know spots to exercise, I guess.


337
01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:03.000
That is a good question, George. I remember you said they have like a locker room with showers, but I don't think they have a gym. Is that correct?


338
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Yeah, I don't think they have it, Jim.


339
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Yeah. No. Jim.


340
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yeah.


341
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:24.000
But there, I promise you, there will be like, probably like 5, right around, because it's right in the area where a bunch of people are working. And so I know that there are going to be a bunch of little gyms or a bunch of lunch spots when you walk out there all these like tech professionals walking around. So it's very much in like the work district.


342
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Yeah, we'll we'll work your brand. It's on you to work your body.


343
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I love that question, though. Cause taking care of yourself is a huge deal. I I will talk to you guys countless times about making sure you're exercising, sleeping, eating all of that, because you'll be surprised of how many people that falter during program.


344
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Alright!


345
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
How do I say your name?


346
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Cure, injury.


347
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Karim.


348
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Yup, I couldn't get I Butam is the short for.


349
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Okay.


350
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I have a question about neighborhoods, and where we.


351
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Where do you guys recommend that we stay? I've been asking around


352
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Where we should say whether we should be in downtown


353
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000
San Francisco or Berkeley, or should we try somewhere a little bit outside.


354
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
What are people's recommendations? Where are.


355
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Where's everyone else staying.


356
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:41.000
So we made a little guide for you. Of the only the only part that we think you shouldn't stay in is the tender line, and some of the like kind of veins that outspread from that. So within San Francisco kind of close to the office, there will be an area that you wanna make sure you don't stay in. A lot of founders will accidentally stay there because you you like the cheap rates. But you'll see like the rates go down much, much lower when you're over there, so be careful of that, and check out the guide. We made.


357
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
But I'm interested in all of the natives here who live in San Francisco. If maybe you can help.


358
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Yeah, I'm happy to. I've lived here.


359
01:11:49.000 --> 01:12:04.000
5 years now I'm happy to talk neighborhoods. I live right near Golden Gate Park. So I you know, when we get set up tomorrow on Base camp. I can send you a few recommendations for some some areas that I think are nice, and I've worked in the the dog patch a lot. So I know the area well.


360
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I disagree with Neil. You're commuting over the bridge. That's crazy. Get a place in San Francisco, Berkeley, or Oakland. That's a long commute of the traffic.


361
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Yeah, I I mean, I agree with you. I'm not doing it by choice. It's it's more of a.


362
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
You know I got I got that card, and I just gotta deal with it. Now.


363
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:32.000
They're great places to live. It's just you. You better like, you know, taking an Uber for A while, or have great podcasts in your car.


364
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Oh, yeah.


365
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:45.000
If you also at, like Facebook, Sf, roommate groups, there's a lot of sublets around this time as well. Generally like pretty good areas. I mean, Sf is only 7 miles wide, so.


366
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
There's only so many words you can be in, but I.


367
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Re repeat the thought of like tenderloins. Stay out of Oakland's a little bit far. But yeah, there's a lot of subless during this time. That's perfect for the timing of this program, as well.


368
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Also.


369
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Yeah. Go. Ahead. Sorry.


370
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I'm in Knob Hill, and I'm walkable to the to the Tech Stars office. So.


371
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I like, I like, kind of area.


372
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Yeah, I was just gonna like someone who's been looking around the homes around the you know, Sf, area.


373
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Like the like. You bet to be quick, I guess, because in my experience they.


374
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Constantly change. They come, they go especially since you know.


375
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000
The kids around the block also, announced the cohort in, you know, right in the middle of San Francisco, over the 1st time.


376
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
You know, if you can get a deal going.


377
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:52.000
You probably should, because it felt like I. I was looking at the home one day, and then the next day it was completely gone.


378
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I love that. See, we're already helping each other. That was a great question. I'm sure a lot of people were wondering.


379
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Any other final questions. Before I go over some announcements.


380
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And if you remember something later, you can ask me. Tomorrow I'll have a little question at the start of every call.


381
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Okay.


382
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Can we pull the slides back up.


383
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Alright!


384
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Next slide.


385
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Okay. So tomorrow session. So I've talked a lot about the base camp onboarding. But I haven't talked about the second session. We're gonna have tomorrow.


386
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So as I put in the email, I wrote it out for you as well as our Ceos, who are on the Google Calendar. You'll see there's this.


387
01:14:48.000 --> 01:15:13.000
12 to 1 30 Pm. Pst. Session called. So. What are you building? This is a new session, we added. I'm extremely excited about it because the last cohort asked for this and said that it's something you guys would like. It's so that you can introduce your company's to one another in depth to actually tell each other what you're working on. They said that without that it seems like it takes a couple of weeks to truly like, get what each other is working.


388
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:22.000
On so the sooner that you can like understand it, the more you can start helping each other sharing ideas things like that. So what you'll want to prepare.


389
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000
It's super low key. It's not like any sort of formal thing, so you can just like wing it if you don't have time.


390
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:39.000
But you'll have 4 min with or without slides, like if you want to show pictures of something you can 4 min to present anything you'd like about your company, anything you'd like your classmates to know.


391
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:56.000
So it's not for us. We already in depth know what your company is pretty well, because we had to present them. But for your classmates what would be helpful for them to know? What do you want them to understand about who you're targeting, what you're building? Why, you're building it things like that, and then we'll have time for a like 2 questions each.


392
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So we'll let some of your classmates ask you a couple of questions about the business, and then we'll move on, so we'll do 4 min each with or without slides. You can show visuals if you want and we'll just hear from each other, and it'll be pretty fun. I'm really excited for it. I wanted to give you a heads up in case you wanted to prepare.


393
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
That'll be at noon tomorrow.


394
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Cool.


395
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Okay, next, slide.


396
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Okay, let's review your pre-programmed. So you're gonna await the second pre program. Update. That will be coming by Wednesday. It might come on Tuesday. That will have the program handbook that each of you is expected to read in its entirety. There's a lot of information we did not cover in this session because it's just more tedious and in the weeds. So it's expected that you read that it's pretty short. It's like 5 pages.


397
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Team reflection exercise is going to be something that we'll send to you. That's just going to be a short.


398
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
One to 2 h.


399
01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Meeting you should have with your team to reflect on some things and consider some questions. We'll give you. You'll also get the pre-programmed prep. Week to schedule written out, and a couple more things.


400
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Some highlights of.


401
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:24.000
To dos. Reviewing the mattress interview by Wednesday. Neil has asked that. You guys review that I linked it in the email. I know you all listened to it during the selection process. That's how you got here. That was a while ago. So go back. Listen to it again. And just remember, because we're gonna be referencing it a lot. So if you don't remember


402
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:35.000
The customer's story as well. Things like that, ways that Bob asks these questions. All of that is going to get analyzed. And if it's not fresh in your brain. It's gonna be a little hard to follow the workshop.


403
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Starting on Wednesday.


404
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Remember to order your welcome kits and complete the class roster and then start working on your prework packets.


405
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I think there's 1 more side.


406
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:54.000
So the rest of this week we're gonna give you base camp access. You'll introduce your company to each other. We'll then go into customer discovery immersive week.


407
01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:08.000
We'll hit you back to back with 3 customer discovery workshops and just completely immerse you into the framework. It's going to be a lot of learning, but I think it's going to be so fun. That's Neil and my favorite thing to teach. And it's really the bread and butter of our program. Then the fall.


408
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I think it's not. It's not a mistake to say that. I mean, we. We go deeper on that than any program anywhere like there's no program that comes even close, I think, even throughout Texars they spend a good 2 h on it in one session, but for us we.


409
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Do at least 4, probably more.


410
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Oh, yeah, plus presentations and one on one help.


411
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Yeah.


412
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
It's honestly a good.


413
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Quarter of our program. It's very important to us, because that's the cornerstone of your business. You're literally building this.


414
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Leads to sales.


415
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Yeah.


416
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Problem.


417
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Exactly.


418
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Sales is everything. We're here to help you build investable fundable businesses, and part of that is making money.


419
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
So.


420
01:18:46.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Then following week we'll do project management. We'll go over Krs. And then Chloe will follow up with goal setting meetings with you all. I'll do my business blueprint workshop, which is kind of a follow up to customer discovery. It's 1 of my favorites, and then there's a new workshop. That all of tech stars is getting that I will be presenting to you guys, which is assumptions and experimentation. And that one will also kind of cover a little bit about spending.


421
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
So that is our week, and next week.


422
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I'm really excited for you guys. We will meet back here. Can you go to the next slide?


423
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Oh, go! One more!


424
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Okay, we will meet back here at noon. Pst, so that's in 40 min via gather round. So.


425
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Chloe's gonna put the link in the chat.


426
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Right here, and we'll also add it to the calendar. Invite for 12 Pm. But just go ahead and save this link. This is a special like platform where we're gonna do icebreakers together. We do it every program. So just kind of open this in a tab or copy this. We'll join it at noon.


427
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And then one more link. Can you go back one side.


428
01:19:46.000 --> 01:20:02.000
One more link is, we have a very rudimentary company. Lookbook for you guys, keep it super super confidential, but it just has some one-liners, and like a little bit more about each of you, so that you guys can get to know each other before tomorrow. We'll drop that link in the chat, as well.


429
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Chloe.


430
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:16.000
But yes, this gather round Link. Make sure you save that, and we will not be joining Zoom. We'll just go straight into there at noon, so have a nice lunch break. It was so great to meet all of you. I'm so excited, so I hope that you guys are.


431
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Hope we started this off right? Yeah.


432
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Nice to see you.


433
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I'm hope, feeling good.


434
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Awesome. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Everyone see you soon.


435
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Bye.


436
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:25.194
Aye.
