### Frameworks & Methodologies

- carloscaglia: Cool. Thanks. Yeah. I want to use the Q&A to go into a little bit more of the process and the details while keeping the 1 min pitch a little bit more more high level. But yeah, the timing is good, and I think I should definitely, as you say, take a little bit more time at the start.

### Key Insights

> "Mircea Gogoncea: well, I have 2 comments. But 1st of all, yeah, I must admit that I didn't immediately remember what Exordi did before you said it, and as soon as you started saying it, it took maybe 1015 seconds for me to realize sort of what what is going on. What your business does, I know that's going to be explained more in the next sections of the pitch. But"

> "Andrew Penner | Milo: liked a lot of that pitch and always, I mean, I'm sure you guys have heard this from a thousand people. But we're an end of one, right? So occasionally, we're gonna agree with each other or disagree with each other, whatever it might be. And just take our feedback into consideration, maybe nothing more. But"
