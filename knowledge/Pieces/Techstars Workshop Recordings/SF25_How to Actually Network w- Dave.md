### Key Insights

> "Dave Scott: yeah. So so by the way, State, not so much state. But city is really important. Because."

> "Dave Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think. I think just through networking. You'll find someone who's in one of those groups, and they'll probably invite you because they're always desperate to grow. And then I think you go from there. So you know, I was just. I literally was talking to this ex tech stars, Guy, about the previously exit founders. And I said, How did you raise your round? He goes. Oh, my God! I just met this group"

> "Dave Scott: And so like. This guy's like a legend, right? But like it's just random like she happened to know him, and whatever. And then I actually flew down to La to speak to one of his classes. And you know, so it's just this weird how things get connected, which means super be. Have a super open mind, and don't be like attitudinal about who you talk to, because you never know what that next person is that they'll know"

> "Dave Scott: another example. I talked to a random producer. That produces Jj. Abrams films right? And the guy absolutely had 0 interest at all in investing in my company. But then he was like, Well, what kind of license do you like me? And I said, Oh, man, anything cool, sci-fi, and he's like, well, I know the producer of Westworld, and I'm like I make a game out of Westworld. And so he just recommended me to the producers of Westworld. So now we're going to do a deal. So it's just, you never know kind of what's going on."

> "Dave Scott: make deals like when you got on the phone, like, what were you setting out to do? Yeah. So I always set a 15Â min phone call. And it's literally just, hey."
