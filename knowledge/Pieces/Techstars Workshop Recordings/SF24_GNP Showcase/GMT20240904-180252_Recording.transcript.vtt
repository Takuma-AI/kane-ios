4
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:10.039
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: And then we're going to run through that and the latter half of the meeting. We are going to open breakout rooms, and so each of our gnps will be in their own breakout room, and then you will be able to navigate

5
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:25.430
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: to each breakout room. If you want to talk to aws, if you want to talk to Hsbc, so again, this is just a really good way for you guys to start getting a feel for our Gmps here and that partnership that we offer.

6
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.090
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: So let me just

7
00:01:31.847 --> 00:01:45.120
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: make sure everyone's in here. We are recording beautiful. All right. So I am going to go ahead and kick this off. Let's have Grant Evans from stripe.

8
00:01:46.200 --> 00:02:05.140
Grant Evans | Stripe: Thank you so much, Brittany, and and thank you all so much to to the founders for taking some time to to listen to a couple of gnps. Blab about all the fabulous things they can do. Really appreciate your time. Again. My my name is Grant. I'm going to share a couple of slides. Just so you don't stare at my face the entire time, so I'll go ahead and share that very quickly.

9
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:29.480
Grant Evans | Stripe: Amazing! So 1st of all, congratulations to all of you for getting into tech stars. I can imagine most of you very excited, a little nervous, little apprehensive. Very quick overview about stripe again, can happy to talk about more questions or more specific use cases in the breakout rooms. But we take the financial infrastructure piece of it out of the equation. Right? One less thing for you guys to worry about. So again, the kind of tagline to remember is build and get paid

10
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:52.650
Grant Evans | Stripe: with stripe. Very, very quick. Bio for myself again. My my job here at stripe is a startup partner. Lead. So I lead relationships with some of the very best accelerators and venture capital firms like techstars in the country. My background. I was a early stage startup operator at a company that I helped raise 30 million dollars for get to 4 million arr before that I was an investment. Banker Goldman Sachs, for 5 years, got a little bit tired of sleeping under my desk so switched into tech

11
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.899
Grant Evans | Stripe: instead a lot of spreadsheets, as you can probably guess.

12
00:02:56.355 --> 00:03:19.889
Grant Evans | Stripe: A very quick overview. There's a lot of stuff on this slide, but wanted to kind of focus on the 1st 2 columns. Right? So again, stripe offers financial infrastructure for the Internet and a lot of services around that right? So all the way from validating idea, incorporating your company, using our Atlas products all the way up to embedding financial services like capital, you know, embedding loans embedding bank accounts embedding, you know, card issuance.

13
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:34.480
Grant Evans | Stripe: Happy to chat. Kind of about everything between. I I generally tend to think that most folks who are joining tech stars are kind of in that that start business vertical. Here again, happy to chat through any use case you might be contemplating. We can support businesses from the earliest age startup all the way up to the largest enterprises, and of course

14
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.019
Grant Evans | Stripe: many startups like Slack, like Lyft, like Doordash started with this, startups, went on to become the businesses they are today.

15
00:03:41.090 --> 00:04:07.680
Grant Evans | Stripe: We're here to help that. That's really like the message I want everyone to take away is that if there are stripe questions amazing. If there's something that you think that I have expertise or that someone at stripe has expertise, and you want to get in touch with us. Please do couple of ways to do that right office hours. I'll make sure everyone gets this link after the call. I'll make sure that the tech source team is able to distribute that to anyone who is interested. We also do lots of workshops exactly like this where we tackle specific problems that tech source founders also face. And then, of course.

16
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:19.890

18
00:04:44.870 --> 00:05:09.309

For when to reach out to stripe again, I always love seeing the cool new feature or hearing like where you guys are building again. So many of you guys that have been admitted. Tech stars have amazing companies. Amazing ideas. But again, I I won't read all the examples off the slide here. But if you're contemplating a marketplace, a platform, you want financial services. You want to just take payments as fast as possible.

19
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:19.820
Grant Evans | Stripe: We can help with that. So please reach out anytime. I'll skip right back to my email right here, just in case you want to get in touch and thanks again for your time. Congrats on on getting in.

Kobina Ansah | AWS: I mean, with that said

34
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.250
Kobina Ansah | AWS: as a Techstars Company, you get access to an array of services through us.

35

Kobina Ansah | AWS: Including, but not limited to, things like access of the lifetime of a company up to $100,000 of

36
00:07:50.040 --> 00:08:14.000
Kobina Ansah | AWS: aws credits. And this program has actually changed in the last year to help companies have a better chance of actually accessing and utilizing all the credits made available to them. And so how that starts is, it provides tech stars companies with access to 25 k of credits that are good for up to 2 years, and then, based on other hurdles, unlocks additional credits there on

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:31.439
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Alright amazing! Thank you. All right, let's do a read. And Jimmy from Brex next.

45
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:49.285
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): Amazing. Thank you, Brittany. Great to meet all of you awesome founders also love all the other partners that are here today, I would say, when you think about your startup stack as a founding team. Most all of us that are on this call today are kind of a a part of that that team. So

46
00:09:50.034 --> 00:09:54.409
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): few things that I will share my screen on right now.

47
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.230
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): Awesome.

48
00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.800
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): So

49
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:27.979
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): Brex plus tech stars a little bit about me. I am the head of startups at Brex. I've been here for 6 years, so ever since we launched the company officially. I've seen us go from a few $1,000 of revenue to hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue. So happy to help talk about. How you're going to scale your company as as you get everything off the ground, and we'll do as as many master classes as you want

50
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:42.340
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): but a little bit about Brex. So we are built by founders for founders. Ultimately, both of our founders, Pedro and Enrique founded their 1st companies back in 2,012 together.

51
00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:59.210
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): built a pretty successful company. They were called the Stripe of Brazil. I was a company called Pagarming. After selling that business they came to the Us. And went to Stanford, ultimately dropped out in that 1st semester and decided to start their 1st company.

52
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.949
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): The 1st company that they founded it.

53
00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:32.350
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): Got accepted into yc, but they didn't know anything about that specific industry. It was a VR. Company, and as they applied for corporate credit cards they actually got declined for all of the cards they applied for. They didn't have an established credit history in the Us. They didn't have access to credit in other ways. They didn't have collateral ultimately that they wanted to provide. So they actually pivoted and founded what was the 1st corporate credit card for startups, which is Brex, as we know it today.

54
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.080
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): From there we've continued to launch additional products and features

55
00:11:37.483 --> 00:12:00.509
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): and and truly scale the company to where we're at today. So I just checked all of this. Currently, 35% of all venture back companies are using Brex. So we have a pretty sizable market share and then that is on both banking and credit cards. So if you actually look at oh, slice not on here. If you actually look at

56
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:29.730
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): all of the products that Brex offers just wanted to quickly go through those. The 1st one is banking which offers a checking account a Treasury account as well as a vault account. So you can get up to 4.9% yield on any of the funds held in Brex. So as a tech stars founder as you're getting those $120,000 in, you can actually have that stored in. Brex. Put some funds in checking store everything else in treasury, and actually get some money back in your pocket.

57
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:49.830
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): On top of that you get free wires free. Ach! Payments and free checks. You then move on to the credit card solution. We issue credit with no personal guarantees and no collateral. So you're gonna be able to start spending right off the bat and add team members not only here locally but globally. Right. Brex is a a global 1st mobile 1st company.

58
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:56.169
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): and then when it comes to spend management as a young startup, you might not have a lot of those needs quite yet.

59
00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:12.790
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): But Brex now supports 150 plus I companies that have ipo'd, and so, whether you are a 1 or 2 person founding team, or a public company, Brex will scale and grow with you and manage all of your spend management. That includes Bill pay

60
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.810
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): that includes reimbursements

61
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.499
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): that includes travel.

62
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.920
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): So all of those core features are part of Brex's free solution

63
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.720
Jimmy Stephens (brex.com/techstars2024): so very good product to sign up. For if you're interested, and then once again.

64

If you're in the Texas area, you know. Please hit me up. I'll kind of run through a few slides here, and then pass it to my friend Ahmed to kind of dive into a specific offering that we have. But deal at a high level is a global Hr platform. We do a lot of

68
00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:34.070
Kyle Croyle | Deel: different things. At the earliest of stages, you know, hiring is important. It may not be your number one focus right now. You might be focused on product development

69
00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:58.139
Kyle Croyle | Deel: go to market strategy product market fit fundraising all of that good stuff at some point. If it's not now, you will be growing your team. That could be through contractors or full time employees deal is here to help you both now and well into the future. So you can think of us as a you know, not just a payroll and Hr. Company but a compliance tool.

70
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.680
Kyle Croyle | Deel: an immigration service, and many more things.

71
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:29.839
Kyle Croyle | Deel: This is a very busy slide I'll let you guys read through that if you would like. Where we really see a lot of tech stars companies during program leverage deal. And our resources, even if you just want a kind of a mentorship touch point is, if you're looking to hire contractors globally, we support 150 plus countries where the market leader. If you're looking to pay yourself as a founder, your founding team.

72
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:57.240
Kyle Croyle | Deel: whether that's in the Us. Or abroad, we are a great partner in those efforts. If you're an international founder coming to the Us. For a program, you may. But you might be on what's called an esta. You might be looking to do an o. 1 or Hb. One at some point we acquired legal pad. A Texas or Seattle company about 2 and a half years ago. And they are one of the market leaders in that area. And so, while we have a

73
00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:13.179
Kyle Croyle | Deel: wide variety and a robust product suite. That may be useful. Down the road we see we see a lot of tech service companies using us for those early contractor and employee hires, so making sure that they are hired compliantly and paid.

74
00:16:15.087 --> 00:16:17.310
Kyle Croyle | Deel: Kind of a little bit of a

75
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:41.880
Kyle Croyle | Deel: representation of you know how we see companies growing. Their head count. So you know again, when you start out, you're likely gonna be on the contractor side of things. I won't dive into those reasons you may look into leveraging an employer of record or Eor service, which basically means, if you are looking to hire a full time employee in a country where you do not have an entity.

76
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:56.730
Kyle Croyle | Deel: Deal is the largest and highest rated in that space. We have entities in 125 plus countries. And then, as you grow, have successful business outcomes, fundraising outcomes. There's other ways that we can support.

77
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:08.819
Kyle Croyle | Deel: We've only been around for 5 and a half years. We're also Yc company. Like Brex. Our founders are very, very close with each other. We're one of the fastest growing Saas companies of all time. We work with

78
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:34.170
Kyle Croyle | Deel: 35,000 plus organizations, many tech stars, alumni and current cohort companies. And again, the used cases are vast. So I encourage you guys to not just with deal, but all of the Gnp. Sponsors set up some time to chat, see if they can help you, not necessarily from a product and service perspective. But we also have very deep networks of

79
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:40.988
Kyle Croyle | Deel: partners and customers and prospects that we're happy to. See if we can make intros into

80
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.659
Kyle Croyle | Deel: and overall. We want to make sure that

81
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.599
Kyle Croyle | Deel: the last thing you want to deal with is payroll headaches, hiring headaches.

82
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:54.233
Kyle Croyle | Deel: Let us be a resource there. We have a lot of great free data. And Intel,

83

Hesitate to reach out if you think we can help and again, the visa immigration side for international founders highly encourage you to start those conversations as soon as possible.

84

Kyle Croyle | Deel: goes without saying. We have access to a number of of discounts and perks, so please feel free to to reach out if interested. And with that being said, I'm going to pass it to my friend Ahmed.

85
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:37.200
Ahmed  | Deel: Yeah, thanks, Kyle. Everybody congrats again on getting into tech stars. Kyle said that anybody who needs a visa green card should start the conversation early. So great segue to me.

86
00:18:37.606 --> 00:18:48.139
Ahmed  | Deel: A little bit of a backstory about us. If we can switch to the next slide. Yeah. So I. Although I now work for deal, I used to work for legal pad, which was also a tech Stars company.

87
00:18:48.715 --> 00:18:53.169
Ahmed  | Deel: So the story goes. We I, our CEO and co-founder Todd

88
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.149
Ahmed  | Deel: 1st filed an o. 1 visa for Yc. Founder back in 2,015,

89
00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:06.199
Ahmed  | Deel: started legal pad in 2,018 and went through techstars is Seattle Branch, with the mission of making it super quick and easy for founders to navigate

90
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.230
Ahmed  | Deel: the Us. Immigration process.

91
00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:13.279
Ahmed  | Deel: We got a visa for Deal, CEO and co-founder Alex. In 2,019

92
00:19:13.844 --> 00:19:15.900
Ahmed  | Deel: we hired folk overseas

93
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.529
Ahmed  | Deel: through Deal. They use legal pad to get visas for their team members, and there was just great

94
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.530
Ahmed  | Deel: partnership and collaboration there.

95
00:19:23.922 --> 00:19:32.380
Ahmed  | Deel: And eventually Deal acquired us in 2,022. So now we can say that we were both the Tech Stars and Nyc. Company, which is kind of exciting.

96
00:19:32.806 --> 00:19:48.919
Ahmed  | Deel: So I with deal immigration. What you can do is hire people in more than 44 countries around the world. If deal makes it easy for you to hire anyone anywhere. My team focuses on that anywhere, part of the equation.

97
00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:53.009
Ahmed  | Deel: And we offer 2 models of support here.

98
00:19:53.337 --> 00:19:59.880
Ahmed  | Deel: The 1st is standalone. So this is what's most common for techsource founders. Let's say that you are a non us

99
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:09.083
Ahmed  | Deel: national and you want to be in the Us. So that you can grow your company, because this is where your investors or your market is, or, you know, just easier to build in in. Sf,

100
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:14.770
Ahmed  | Deel: you can use your own entity to sponsor your visa directly.

101
00:20:15.403 --> 00:20:23.559
Ahmed  | Deel: If you want to hire somebody in the Us. And you know you don't want to set up an entity here, or you're a us company, but you want to hire somebody overseas, or whatever.

102
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.620
Ahmed  | Deel: We can also sponsor your visa directly, as the as the employer of record, because deal legally hires people

103
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:42.929
Ahmed  | Deel: in 100 plus countries around the world. We can also sponsor visas in many of those countries again, right now, we're at around 44 plus but hope to be at a significant number by the end of the year.

104
00:20:43.354 --> 00:20:54.359
Ahmed  | Deel: So most people when they're go when they're going through program, want to talk about us immigration, because again, they might be from overseas. And they're in the Us. Just to do the program. And they want to stay here stay here longer. Term

105
00:20:54.770 --> 00:21:00.499
Ahmed  | Deel: we offer support with all types of us visas. I don't think there's a single Us. Work visa that we don't support.

106
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:09.520
Ahmed  | Deel: Some of these you can do standalone. Some of these you can do through deal. There's some overlap. But what I want to do real quick is just kind of walk, you guys through the o 1

107
00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.820
Ahmed  | Deel: visa. It's the most common one that we do for founders. So if we move over to the next slide.

108
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:22.369
Ahmed  | Deel: What the o 1 is is. It's often called the startup visa. Almost every tech stars founder qualify. So just know if you got into techstars.

109
00:21:22.783 --> 00:21:30.386
Ahmed  | Deel: You accepted the 120 K things are going okay. And during the program and you want to stay here, you you should be able to do so.

110
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:44.149
Ahmed  | Deel: under very few circumstances. Should you be distracted by any other types of visas. What's great about the o. 1 is that there's no minimum salary requirement, no lottery that you have to go through. There's no requirement that you remain in the Us.

111
00:21:44.437 --> 00:22:03.240
Ahmed  | Deel: You can renew the visa every 3 years until the end of time, or use it as an upgrade to a green card. It's pretty sweet for founders. I'd love to walk you through the process. We've done more than 1,200 at this point, with approvals above 98%. Again, almost every tech stories founder qualifies we can skip this. I I don't want to take up too much time.

112
00:22:03.561 --> 00:22:12.660
Ahmed  | Deel: So what I'm going to do here is just share my contact info. I know that we have the the breakouts later. I'm actually at the airport right now, so I don't know how long I'm going to be able to stay for

113
00:22:13.038 --> 00:22:20.579
Ahmed  | Deel: but I'm going to drop my contact information in just a sec in the chat, and then, if anybody wants to schedule a call with me. I would love to be a resource.

114
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.700
Ahmed  | Deel: make it super quick and easy. Usually a 15 min call is is enough time to cover all your immigration.

115
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.769
Ahmed  | Deel: plans. Thanks everyone so much. Congrats again on getting to tech starts. Have fun.

116
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:39.609
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Alright, and last, but certainly not least, Andrew from Hsbc.

117
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.940
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: Hello! Welcome, everybody!

118
00:22:42.689 --> 00:22:44.669
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: I'm going to share my screen.

119
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.219
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: I could get maybe a thumbs up that this is working

120
00:22:50.900 --> 00:23:09.400
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: Nice to be back nice to to see everybody. Virtually, I mean, I feel like it's such a joy to see all the other partners in the connection points deal like we should be talking international connections, Kavina. I think I met you when I was a mentor at Techstar. So a bit more on me. I've been a mentor at techstars for the past 5 years or so.

121
00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:21.170
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: And prior to that, I basically had a 360 degree view of the innovation ecosystem here in New York where I sit. So I was a operating team member and sales leader at 2 startups that went on to exit.

122
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.790
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: precede through Series C. So I know that journey, and I'm always happy to chat on that.

123
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:36.980
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: After that I was a Vc. Here in New York, and we certainly supported and talked to many techstars, founders, and post, that I actually led the Startup banking team at Svb. Here in New York, where we worked with many techstars founders.

124
00:23:37.365 --> 00:23:58.104
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: I'm now, obviously over at Hsbc as part of our innovation banking team. And I'll tell you a little bit about our story, and I think the theme you should take away is Wow, Big Bank. But this is where they can really become targeted and supported on the local level for me, and then I want to tell you about our practice and what we're offering for you all. And so when it comes to Hsbc,

125
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:22.319
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: 160 year Old Bank almost, and really started off serving entrepreneurs who wanted a bank for them right these were for tradesmen in Southeast Asia way back then, but has since continued to evolve with small businesses wherever they may be. And so today we are a 3 trillion dollar balance sheet bank, which makes us one of the 10 largest banks in the world. We have a presence in 60 plus countries

126
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:33.860
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: with 200,000 plus people, but when you bring that down to the micro level of what you're all thinking about, and that is, how do I survive the next 3 months? Right? Get this startup off the ground, get it funded.

127
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.490
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: and and on to the next stage. We've

128
00:24:37.590 --> 00:25:02.420
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: carved out and dedicated an innovation banking practice within this. And so I like to think of what we're doing as the best of both worlds. You have this storied and hugely supported bank, but on a local level we have a thousand plus people in our innovation banking team. Now across the world. We have one of the most connected venture coverage teams in the world. So I, I focus on that specifically, in New York, we work with 400 plus Vcs here and

129
00:25:02.727 --> 00:25:30.809
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: the State specifically. And our job is to support their founders and introduce them to more founders. So that's a part of what we do. And we hope to be your banking partner, and eventually a capital partner as well for the entire existence of your business. So many folks will come to us day one. We will help them, of course, with the core banking account and getting off the ground. Everybody is matched with an Rm. And I'll go to this next slide also, or if you look on the left hand side. Here we start to outline this. Everybody gets a sector specific. Rm.

130
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:55.420
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: you're not coming to this bank and ending up with people who are not working with tech founders day in and day out. Many of us happen to be X Vcs or founders ourselves. And so you have folks that are speaking the language. And in the beginning your needs are basic. But our hope is that there's never a need that we can't serve for your entire time with us, so we will work with you down the line on wealth management if you need it. We have an investment bank that helps to think through

131
00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:09.339
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: the end of the journey as well. We also ourselves are massive consumers of tech. We spend about 10 billion dollars a year. And so we actually have a lot of buyers of tech internally, who will do round tables for our clients to learn more about how they can scale.

132
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:15.979
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: What does this look like in practice for you today? Because maybe those aren't things that keep you up at night. You have a lot to think about.

133
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:38.749
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: Everybody who comes on board gets that dedicated relationship manager. As I mentioned, everybody starts to get into the stream of our community as well. We had tech stars founders over the summer, sitting alongside our CEO at lunch, and investors with an event we did here in New York. We have many such events throughout the year. And the beginning of the journey is this, we set you up with a bank account. It's free. For the 1st 2 years

134
00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:52.389
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: our onboarding time is actually a little quicker than what it says. There, it's closer to 2 days that we can get you onboarded. Again. You meet a dedicated relationship manager along the way. This package includes unlimited transactions, wires, and Ach!

135
00:26:52.674 --> 00:26:56.240
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: Fraud mitigation as well. You know, we've seen fraud on the rise across some.

136
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.899
Chelsea Hamlet: How much did that cost you.

137
00:26:58.568 --> 00:27:07.200
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: Think someone might be commenting. If you're able to mute, we can answer questions. Certainly. In the breakout rooms competitive money market rates. We have a variety of different

138
00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:31.430
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: rates for money market accounts to off balance sheet investments that'll get you into the 5 plus percent range depending on what you're putting your money into and that's us right. I think the theme to again take away from this is, think of this as one of the biggest banks in the world, right? That is really leaning in at the early stage, to be personal, to be quick to match you up with expertise that you deserve as a founder

139
00:27:31.675 --> 00:27:48.094
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: and we're thrilled to to play a part. Small part in your journey. Excited to meet you all throughout the program. You can get in contact with us. By the way, in the bottom left at techstars@us.hsbc.com. We actually have a whole team that's dedicated to this. Many of them are new and shadowing me today because we're hiring quick.

140
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:55.820
Andrew Oddo | HSBC: doubled the team size in the last year, so we're excited to hopefully help you out, as you double and triple everything on your end. So thanks for having it.

141
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.719
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: All right.

142
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:10.589
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Alright, Andrew, I think you might still be perfect. Okay. Alright. So, founders. So the next part of

143
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:36.523
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: this showcase is, we are going to go ahead and open up the breakout rooms, so you will be able to chat one on one with each of the folks that we just heard from for those of you who have not done breakout rooms before. At the very bottom toolbar of your like zoom window. You're gonna see? 4 little squares. That is how you navigate in and out of the breakout rooms.

144
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:42.735
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: There is no requirement that you stay and

145
00:28:43.790 --> 00:29:03.605
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: navigate throughout the breakout rooms. If you have other things that you want to. Go work on. You by no means need to stay my colleagues and I will stay in this main room in case you need any help with anything or have any additional questions. But really this is just your time to go pop in and out, and

146
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:28.120
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: get to know some of our gmps again. If there is no need to stay on the meeting or in this main room. If you don't want to go into breakout rooms, or if you, you know, have other things that you need to work on. So. I am going to open up the breakout rooms here in one moment, Deanna, can you make sure that that little thingy is selected on your side as well.

147
00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.750
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: We've had some

148
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:36.219
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: funny breakout room glitches in the past. So there's this one setting that likes to

149
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:53.690
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: toggle off alright. So I'm gonna go open all the rooms, all of our Gmp. Folks will be automatically put into their respective rooms, and then you founders will be able to weave in and out of the rooms as you so desire. So let's get it going

150
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.560
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: alright. Looks like things are good.

151
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.569
Osazomon I: Where are the breakout rooms? I'm a little confused.

152
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:26.460
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Yup, yeah, absolutely. So. In your zoom window at the very bottom toolbar, you're gonna see an icon with like essentially 4 little squares, 4 little white squares you might need to like elongate your toolbar.

153
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.480
Osazomon I: Yeah, I see it. Thank you. So.

154
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.910
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Okay, yeah, of course.

155
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:34.989
HanhLinh Ho | Gateway (careergateway.io): Hey, Brittany? Is Hubspot going to be here today at all?

156
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:38.399
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Hubspot is not here today, but they are a Gnp

157
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:45.700
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: you can reach out to your program team and they can provide you with the correct contact information for them.

158
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.089
HanhLinh Ho | Gateway (careergateway.io): Okay. Thank you.

159
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.119
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Yeah, sure thing.

160
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:16.863
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Alright. And the for those folks that are still out in this main room, let us know if you're having any technical issues. And again, if

161
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:23.960
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: you don't want to go into the breakout rooms, you don't need to, and you can absolutely take your time back and leave the meeting.

162
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.969
Felix: Hey? This is Felix from Atrax. I'm gonna stay in the main room. Is that cool?

163
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.030
Felix: For now.

164
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:58.790
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Yeah, yeah. So it's it's the main room is just gonna be Deanna Andrea and Matt, from Texas. Our side. We're just essentially hanging out. So there's really no need for you to be on this meeting anymore. It's really just we keep this room open in order for the breakout rooms to run, and that's really all the the purposes there's there's not no more content or anything being shared in this room.

165
00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:05.559
Felix: Oh, perfect! And I can reach out to the the company, right for contact information and

166
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.200
Felix: and info right? I can reach out to the companies that presented.

167
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:21.739
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Yes, yeah, absolutely. And then your your program team should be able to help you navigate again, who all of our Gmps are, as well as the specific contacts for each Gmp.

168
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.430
Felix: Perfect. Thank. Thank you so much. Yeah.

169
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:25.430
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Course, have a good luck.

170
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.030
Felix: That's that. Thank you.

171
00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:58.500
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Alright, and again, folks that are still in this main room. If you do not want to go into a breakout room. There's no need to be in this main meeting anymore.

172
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:05.069
Pat: I think everybody's spamming Linkedin right now.

173
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:13.770
Brittany Wimmer | Global Business Operations: Alright, I'm gonna actually remove some of these note takers. I'm gonna stop recording.
