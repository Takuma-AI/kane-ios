For when to reach out to stripe again, I always love seeing the cool new feature or hearing like where you guys are building again. So many of you guys that have been admitted. Tech stars have amazing companies. Amazing ideas. But again, I I won't read all the examples off the slide here. But if you're contemplating a marketplace, a platform, you want financial services. You want to just take payments as fast as possible."
