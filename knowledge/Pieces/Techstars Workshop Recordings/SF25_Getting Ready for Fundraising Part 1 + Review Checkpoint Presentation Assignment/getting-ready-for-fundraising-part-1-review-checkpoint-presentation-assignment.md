Just to get like we're trying to get step one, and I imagine probably more, maybe focus on that. And then the other one is so relaxing.
- Neal Sáles-Griffin: like mitigate any sort of market challenges that you see, like the market can go up. It can go down more companies one year. They're less the next year, like it, really. But, like Neil said, like these 3 things, to have a tight process, a broad and thorough investor pipeline, and then your pitch, your decks, your traction, like everything you have, super clean and ready to go. You're giving yourself the best chance

### Key Insights

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: I did. Vc relations and negotiation. So this is like how you like close the deal and close the line. That's where I spent most of the time helping founders. Sylvia has experience across all 3 of these categories, so it'll be great to kind of have her eyes on it. But today we'll just talk about some of the things that you guys already know. But I also wanna make a few important points. I'm curious to hear from you guys. You have other perspectives to share with one another, and then also dig into some key questions"

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: are starting to have more European President there, like a lot of excel. I mean not that these are necessarily the best ones to really work with for every founder. But that does signal that like there is interest from, you know, there's a lot there's more investor activity now, there was like 5 years ago. So it's it's never a bad strategy to, you know."

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: cost table. That's obvious. But it also comes with terms, things you have to do. And I think that's also very important to take into account, like we're saying about Angel versus many of you. I think it also"

So it's typically ill advised unless you do a lot of work upfront to set the right expectation with them, but it almost puts you in a bad spot, because you're like, hey? The only I can tell you is that you're only investing in me. The chances are you're not."

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, so don't just take it from us. Like I. I will always be a source of truth for you, and you can always allow me to like, dig deep and find something if it's missing or unavailable. But just know that, like our alumni network, is even more powerful like there's things that they know that I know"
