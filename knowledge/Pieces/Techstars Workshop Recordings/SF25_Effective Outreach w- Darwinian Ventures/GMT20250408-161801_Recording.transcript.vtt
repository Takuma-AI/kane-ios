1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.795
Techstars 312: Actually not good

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.340
Techstars 312: works. We we actually ended up getting possibly acquired. A few years later we moved here, and I've been here ever since. So I've been here for a long time.

3
00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:12.459
Techstars 312: I've done a bunch of startups.

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:36.179
Techstars 312: My current company is called about 8 years. Basically, all we do is sales and go to market setup for you. I used to be someone just like you. It's kind of like circle, and we've done close to a hundred 30 companies. Where we come where we jump in, we build out their work environment for sales. So we put together the tools there. There's a bunch of data workflows we use now

5
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.400
Techstars 312: put in their Crm emails polls. Any of that stuff.

6
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.638
Techstars 312: And our whole goal

7
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:57.530
Techstars 312: is close. My chaos, that's great. We try to get up to a million or 2 million revenue, but more important than the dollars of revenue. We try to build a repeatable system. So- so the dollars are a little bit less important. What we want to do is find repeatability, because usually

8
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.160
Techstars 312: sales is where you start. And it's not that you're pulling on relationships. You're using every trick in the book. You're also often just

9
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.969
Techstars 312: think of things differently. But we'd like to figure out a way with our clients to get them to a point where

10
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.389
Techstars 312: some higher can also do that. And- and I think the biggest, most valuable thing for the shareholder, for the business is

11
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:47.559
Techstars 312: what does like what's a monthly output for a regular salesperson? Not account. Because once you get that building block, you can actually model that figure out. You know how much pipeline are you gonna build every month you can build quotas, you can build expectations for your hires once you sort of know what that output is per month. You can model that forward. You can say, Hey, if I have more people, this will happen. This is how long it takes to ramp. Once you start to see those deals that you source that like source from

12
00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:09.159
Techstars 312: the outside world, not from your relationships, your contacts. Again, those are helpful. Use them, but they're not going to help you past a certain point, because you're going to run out of it. So we want to do is. Figure out how long it takes for a totally cold source deal to close. And then again, you can model out all the way to 10 million 100 million like this is honestly what even the big companies do. And even giant companies out there

13
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:19.060
Techstars 312: have armies of people doing exactly this stuff that we're gonna talk about today. So it never ends. It's not the most glamorous stuff. I'll say that right now. It's like

14
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:31.699
Techstars 312: pretty hardcore. You make phone calls and emails. You're gonna know a ton of times. But honestly, like even the big, the-, the big companies out there like we work closely with.

15
00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:40.169
Techstars 312: And all these big companies. They've got armies of folks out there doing exactly the same type of stuff to try and build pipeline and

16
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.350
Techstars 312: other businesses.

17
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.959
Techstars 312: So that's what we're gonna talk about. We

18
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.970
Techstars 312: do a couple of other things as well. That's my business partner. She's on here as well. She'll get into some of the some of the really tactical stuff.

19
00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:17.980
Techstars 312: But that's kind of what you does. We, you know, set up systems, we staff in people of our own faster that way, and if our client companies want to hire them they can. So that's kind of option. And again, the big goal is around finding repeatability in sales. And then, once you have that repeatability modeling that forward to today or get to whatever milestone is that you need to get to.

20
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:26.929
Techstars 312: we also invest. So we make a big part of what we do. We're not. But we write small text sometimes in the companies when we see them really start to take off.

21
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:41.120
Techstars 312: and we do a little bit of fundraising coaching, too. So we have a whole seminar on how to raise companies, and we'll do some sort of

22
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.930
Techstars 312: kind of like one off advisory. Sometimes, if a company really wants to work with this closely, I have a whole sort of framework on how to get acquired to. If you don't do like an early acquisition.

23
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.077
Techstars 312: it's a lot more complicated than a lot of people think. My very 1st job was in merchant acquisition. So

24
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:08.850
Techstars 312: so that's what we do. Most of our clients are. B, 2 B, so if you're B to C,

25
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:19.189
Techstars 312: it might not be as relevant, but at least just for for revenue. It is very relevant for everything else, including fundraising, including partnership acquisition.

26
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.589
Techstars 312: And then for really anything else.

27
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.490
Techstars 312: So that's- that's kind of a really quick overview. What do you wanna give a quick intro on yourself and into some

28
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.450
Techstars 312: into some material.

29
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.280
Laura Garrison: Yeah. Wonderful great to see you all can. Can you just confirm that you can hear me? Okay.

30
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.120
Techstars 312: Yep, yeah. We got you. Now.

31
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.010
Laura Garrison: Alright. I've got a little bit of echo.

32
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.310
Laura Garrison: I think it. Actually, I think it just went away. I think we're good. And you guys

33
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.690
Laura Garrison: say it again.

34
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.429
Techstars 312: If we can't hear it. Okay, wonderful.

35
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.010
Laura Garrison: And you can see my screen. Darwinian ventures track record.

36
00:04:53.575 --> 00:05:11.170
Laura Garrison: Okay, perfect. My, my technical questions are are complete. I'm ready to go then. It's great to meet you guys. My name is Laura Garrison as Andrew mentioned. Run, run the go to market business here at Darwinian. I've been here 4 years, and I've worked with

37
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.730
Laura Garrison: about

38
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:22.395
Laura Garrison: 30, 35 startups to date. Just helping them create a repeatable sales process so that they can scale

39
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:44.959
Laura Garrison: or get get get purchased right? So that's kind of the the 2 things that that I work on here. What I love is creating frameworks and creating like actionable content that you guys can can take right away. And so what what we've done today is we've shifted the content

40
00:05:45.010 --> 00:06:01.869
Laura Garrison: that we would normally give to like a founder with a team or a founder with their own like full time. Bdr sourcing, you know, sourcing deals for them and opportunities for them. And we've created something that is going to be

41
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:17.150
Laura Garrison: directly actionable for you like today. So feel free to take screenshots. Of anything that's up here. I've got a lot of checklists and frameworks. So if if we're good, I'm gonna kind of jump into the content here.

42
00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:29.140
Laura Garrison: And if anyone has questions, someone probably is gonna have to either put it in the chat because I cannot hear very well like the room super echoey. So if you've got questions, I'll need a I'll need an interpreter. Please

43
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.056
Laura Garrison: alright cool. So here's what we're gonna cover. Today we're gonna dive into

44
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.200
Laura Garrison: As I mentioned the say, it again.

45
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.899
Techstars 312: Yeah. Can you hear me? Yeah.

46
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:51.809
Laura Garrison: What I was gonna say was, I can sort of help repeat questions back. But what I wanted to do before we jump into the content is, just get a quick lay of the land, and and let these folks introduce themselves, and just get a sense for where they're at.

47
00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:04.000
Techstars 312: Just so that we sort of know who we're talking to. It'd be really helpful. And and usually what we try to do is like, pull some examples and do some case studies and stuff like that.

48
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:16.420
Techstars 312: So if any of you are running into anything and you want to go through it. Chances are a lot of folks in the room are running through the same thing. So get together.

49
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:33.592
Techstars 312: So yeah, we'd love to. Are you guys all?

50
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:48.779
Techstars 312: Ron. Okay, well, I'd love to, for each of the founding teams would love to just get a quick order really short of what you're doing and what your revenue level is, and

51
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.279
Techstars 312: I think that's probably about it. Maybe who your buyer is. That would be good just to see sort of

52
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.700
Techstars 312: what you know already.

53
00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:06.140
Techstars 312: So please go ahead, and my name is Alex.

54
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:24.389
Techstars 312: We have sold it to higher ed institutions like colleges, universities in France. That's why, in the example I think somebody introductions

55
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:46.459
Techstars 312: some phone calls, and I think one of the things that I'm looking for here is more about like setting like messaging, of course, but also setting up things that can do everything from one

56
00:08:49.331 --> 00:09:02.739
Techstars 312: to save time and money.

57
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.899
Techstars 312: We've had to do about 3 or 4

58
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.889
Techstars 312: in the sales process. You have to make a lot of people calls.

59
00:09:19.473 --> 00:09:33.100
Techstars 312: Vendors are perfect.

60
00:09:34.814 --> 00:09:47.369
Techstars 312: We're from sales. And so sales software for strategic selling and looks like all the same groups and

61
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.929
Techstars 312: 520.

62
00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:15.004
Techstars 312: But yeah, I think the time to actually prospect, not necessarily because so like, so like, want to do.

63
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.880
Techstars 312: yeah, looked at this.

64
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:32.750
Techstars 312: Don't know if I know any of those we believe.

65
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:57.221
Techstars 312: and then, as well as the invoicing part right now, I guess revenues negligible. We're still very early stage, most of our sales motion navigator. And then we did email marketing campaign. But I think for us,

66
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:08.369
Techstars 312: it's a couple of things one is like, think the or like the messaging is one thing that we

67
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.930
Techstars 312: alright

68
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.710
Techstars 312: settings.

69
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:47.049
Techstars 312: My background is haven't done much selling after that have been watching.

70
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:50.015
Techstars 312: Yeah.

71
00:12:04.016 --> 00:12:11.970
Techstars 312: Think it's

72
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.625
Techstars 312: 50.

73
00:12:21.556 --> 00:12:30.140
Techstars 312: Think it's not always on the phone, a random project or Meta.

74
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:42.679
Techstars 312: Unlike events I like this, quote

75
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.400
Techstars 312: any of the other data.

76
00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.503
Techstars 312: Come on.

77
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:15.980
Ankur Toshniwal: Hi, my name's Ankur. We Andrew and I are co-founders of harvest. We help insights, based software products, automate their extensive web research using browser agents.

78
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:35.730
Ankur Toshniwal: And we when it comes to kind of go to market. Yeah, we we do a lot of outreach. A lot of that in the beginning was to even like, kind of understand our direct segment. And now we're we're starting to hone in on that. A lot of cold emails and a lot of

79
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.150
Ankur Toshniwal: outreach with warm intros.

80
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.540
Chloe Lannert: Right Trina.

81
00:13:43.200 --> 00:14:03.630
Trina Das: Yeah, Hi, I'm Trina. I'm running. A company called Trains Trends is actually making radiologists and pathologists read like radiology reports much faster, with far more accuracy. And we are targeting diagnostic labs in New Jersey, Newark region, doing 3 specific blood smear and imaging tests.

82
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:24.399
Trina Das: The way we are reaching out is through warm intros in networks and trying to get our clients referred to other labs. We haven't found a lot of success with cold emailing the labs, but we would love to learn like how we can incorporate some of these techniques or strategies in our specific case.

83
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.130
Trina Das: Thank you.

84
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:42.520
Techstars 312: It's actually pretty B to B heavy, and it sounds like there's real fraction. And I'd love to sort of some of that. But that's all portable stuff. So

85
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.320
Techstars 312: okay, Laura, back over to you. Sorry. Now we know who we're talking to.

86
00:14:46.550 --> 00:15:04.449
Laura Garrison: No, no problem at all. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much, guys, for kind of taking us through that. So now we'll get to to the agenda and what we're gonna what we're going to dive into today. So again, this is specifically for early stage founders, I was able to take a look at the lookbook that Chloe sent over, and I see that

87
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:30.090
Laura Garrison: you know you guys have a team surrounding you, but it sounds like sales is all on your shoulders. So we're gonna go through a framework that that Darwinian uses. So we'll start with kind of debunking. What makes cold most cold outreach fail. I'll show you exactly what to do instead. We'll walk through that 3 by 3 framework, which is our go to structure right now for crafting.

88
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.289
Laura Garrison: short messaging. That is kind of like

89
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:58.070
Laura Garrison: high signal. And I'll and I'll talk to you about that, too. That's gonna get get great replies. And then from here we'll break down the 5 elements of founder messaging that consistently convert. So even without fancy design, intent data, big, huge list, you can still create some great messaging that converts. Then we're gonna look at how to scale

90
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:11.140
Laura Garrison: for right now without losing your voice. So it's a little different than than how we've maybe presented this content in the past. But we think it's a good way to kind of lock on to this early traction.

91
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.420
Laura Garrison: and following up

92
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:43.832
Laura Garrison: like a human like yourself, leaning into that piece to find out if your messaging is actually working, then we're gonna put it all into action. So we've collected cold messages from you guys or Chloe has. So if you sent those in before yesterday, we're gonna break those down live. We're gonna look at what's working. What's missing? I spent a couple of hours today yesterday digging through those and providing some great well, hopefully, will be great feedback for you guys, and some some small tweaks

93
00:16:44.820 --> 00:17:11.409
Laura Garrison: to to hopefully unlock some, some traction for you, and then we'll go through kind of a self check that you can use on those messagings going forward. So at the end of the session, you're gonna have a complete system for founder led outbound. So from your 1st send to your 5, th follow up. What do I do? If they're not responding? How do I know this is working? How you know what are the best ways to make tweaks? All without sounding like a robot. So let's let's jump in

94
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.359
Laura Garrison: all right. So

95
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:23.337
Laura Garrison: these might be a little uncomfortable in terms of of the truths related to why outbound fails. Most cold, outbound fails.

96
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.860
Laura Garrison: it's not because you're not charismatic. It's not because you're not ultra smart. It's just

97
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:34.560
Laura Garrison: knowing the rules of the game. So you may just be playing the wrong game. So you're trying to scale

98
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:40.760
Laura Garrison: the impossible. You're relying on intros, your brand

99
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:55.439
Laura Garrison: SEO that maybe hasn't fully had time to mature yet. But when you're in that early stage, you know, under a million arr, you've got one job. Basically, you want to create conversations with people that have your problem.

100
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.880
Laura Garrison: That's it. So you don't need a 20 step cadence.

101
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.460
Laura Garrison: You need a message

102
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:09.590
Laura Garrison: that hits you need a process that doesn't rely on luck. And that's what this workshop is going to be about. So

103
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:21.830
Laura Garrison: this is what outbound feels like when you are the product owner, recruiter, CEO, all, all of the things at one time. So let me show you what one of these emails I'm talking about looks like

104
00:18:22.416 --> 00:18:30.840
Laura Garrison: we call it the 3 by 3. So it's 3 reasons that they'll reply, and 3 lines to say it in. So

105
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:38.829
Laura Garrison: in this case, the the question, the 3 questions you're gonna answer are, why you? Why me? Why now?

106
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:45.219
Laura Garrison: Why you why me? Why now? So why you in this case. Just saw you raised a seed seed round. So there's your signal.

107
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:50.649
Laura Garrison: It's going to imply new pressure right for them to grow faster.

108
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.310
Laura Garrison: Why, me?

109
00:18:52.520 --> 00:19:04.909
Laura Garrison: Usually it means go to market is on your radar, and that's where we help. So you're anticipating that there's a problem that often follows the trigger, and then why, now, is it worth a quick chat? So you've got a soft desk?

110
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.139
Laura Garrison: It's low friction. You'll hear me talk about this more, and you're not

111
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.010
Laura Garrison: pitching a demo. You're inviting that relevance.

112
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.680
Laura Garrison: Right? So you don't

113
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:22.712
Laura Garrison: have to have a clever subject line. You don't need a long signature. You don't need

114
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:27.940
Laura Garrison: Hope you're doing well, right? This just needs to be relevant to the right now.

115
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:41.970
Laura Garrison: So showing, you know, showing you guys how to think like a prospect, and that edge is going to be psychological. That's where that's kind of one of the approaches that we always take. So you know your train. You're

116
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.219
Laura Garrison: this training is gonna be

117
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.619
Laura Garrison: creating your message in terms of business impact, not the features of your product, right?

118
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.579
Laura Garrison: No one really cares what the solution is

119
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.700
Laura Garrison: initially, it's just, Hey, I have this pain, and

120
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:13.970
Laura Garrison: you know I want to solve it. So it's going to get them to ask about what that is so. This is the the breakdown of the of the framework. It's a backbone of every cold message that we build at Darwinian, and you've seen something similar to before. Right? It's

121
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:19.540
Laura Garrison: this is a common framework. We've just kind of adapted it for founder usage, because

122
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:27.999
Laura Garrison: most founders don't have a known brand, and your pitch is shifting like what weekly daily

123
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:38.139
Laura Garrison: you know, as you're trying to find what resonates. So this is the core structure I was talking about. Why you so this is your, this is your hook to relevancy.

124
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:49.770
Laura Garrison: Did you see something in, you know in their world that triggered this email so that could be job change funding a new hire, something that they posted.

125
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.650
Laura Garrison: You know, online. Why, me connect that trigger to the problem that they're likely having.

126
00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:04.709
Laura Garrison: and then offer that one line insight as to how you could help. I'm going to flip back for a second and show you this. I always say a great. A great 1st email looks like the letter F,

127
00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:12.280
Laura Garrison: so you have a line and a space and another line and a space, and then a short line at the bottom, right? So if it looks like an F,

128
00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.582
Laura Garrison: then you get an A, maybe we'll we'll see what what goes into it.

129
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.517
Laura Garrison: And then the the why now?

130
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:35.469
Laura Garrison: that you want this to be frictionless, so something easy. Are you open to learning more? Can we? Can we chat for 30 min, maybe not even 30 min, maybe that's a little bit a little bit too much or a little bit.

131
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:43.620
Laura Garrison: aggressive, you know, and and we're kind of taught to to ask that thing. You know, for 30 min.

132
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.330
Laura Garrison: So

133
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:56.169
Laura Garrison: what makes a great outbound messages that actually convert so let's stop thinking about outbound as getting someone to buy something.

134
00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:01.760
Laura Garrison: because that's not what it is right. Anybody want to take a stab at what that 1st message is about.

135
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.520
Laura Garrison: What are you trying to generate, or what are you trying to start?

136
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.850
Laura Garrison: Just just a conversation? Right?

137
00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:16.210
Laura Garrison: You're not going to sell them anything. You're not going to close them anything. You just you literally want a response, right? Even if that response is like.

138
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:23.369
Laura Garrison: kick rocks. Right? Okay, cool, great. I'll I'll you know. I'll I'll reach out to someone else. But

139
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:44.059
Laura Garrison: You know, it's not trying to get you to convert. It's just trying to get you to start a conversation. So one that is going to be rooted in like, what's the shared pain? What's the aligned timing? What's the you know? That's kind of the 1st thing to to understand. So your goal is not to get someone to buy your goal is to get someone to say.

140
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:49.840
Laura Garrison: Huh, yeah, that's actually interesting. I've I've dealt with that. Tell me more.

141
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.620
Laura Garrison: Right? So

142
00:22:52.180 --> 00:23:08.970
Laura Garrison: when your message leads with you know I'd love to book you 30 book 30 min. I'd love to show you a demo. You're trying to close on that 1st meeting or on that 1st handshake. And it's rarely gonna work at this stage, right? You are trying to schedule some time with them and things like that. But

143
00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.409
Laura Garrison: it's a little forward, so open with insight.

144
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.620
Laura Garrison: close with close, with that curiosity. Right?

145
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:38.739
Laura Garrison: Your your messaging should be written for one person, not a persona. So you may write your initial messaging based on a persona. Right? So you've kind of got your your core message, but then you want to take it a step further and write it for the person. And that's usually your trigger, right? It's going to be specific to that to the person inside of that that persona.

146
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.740
Laura Garrison: So there's a huge difference between.

147
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:56.059
Laura Garrison: we help operation. We help OP. Ops leads optimize workflow efficiency. Right? So, couple, that next to hey, I just saw that you stepped into new a new director of Operations role.

148
00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:08.850
Laura Garrison: I bet I bet the systems audit is already killing your calendar. Right? So you're kind of saying the same thing. But the second one is going to be built to the person not built to the, to the persona. So the second, that second

149
00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:14.839
Laura Garrison: example sounds like it was built for the person, and that's why it works

150
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:24.360
Laura Garrison: right. Other characteristics of outbound that converts is gonna be that it leads with the pain, not the pitch. So

151
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.349
Laura Garrison: every startup says what they do.

152
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.539
Laura Garrison: almost none say what they solve for.

153
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:38.680
Laura Garrison: So you're not selling tracking software. You're selling recovery from billing leakage right?

154
00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:46.470
Laura Garrison: When you describe the pain. First, st people will want to know what you've built all right. It offered.

155
00:24:46.929 --> 00:24:48.841
Techstars 312: Real quick. What does this remind you of?

156
00:24:51.586 --> 00:24:52.219
Techstars 312: To me?

157
00:24:53.266 --> 00:25:01.060
Techstars 312: Jobs? Everything is jobs which is just like that.

158
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.830
Laura Garrison: Cool, nice

159
00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:14.249
Laura Garrison: so great outbound that converts is gonna offer a reason to care right now. So even if your product is great, it's not gonna matter unless it's connected to timing.

160
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:22.300
Laura Garrison: So again, what's changed? Did they hire someone new? Did they launch a product? Did they lose a deal? Did they raise around? Did

161
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.709
Laura Garrison: regulations in the space shift? Right? So understanding that

162
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:47.460
Laura Garrison: urgency isn't pressure, it's it's relevance in context, right? That's how you create that that urgency. And then, finally, this is going to sound like a human, like a founder, not a funnel so outbound that is going to convert sounds like a real person wrote it. You can be imperfect, you can be honest.

163
00:25:47.560 --> 00:26:01.949
Laura Garrison: you can even swear not looking at anyone in the room who has the F bomb in their 1st email, and we'll get to that later. But I absolutely love it. Because it fits the brand right? So if that's not who you are. Don't do it.

164
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.070
Laura Garrison: but

165
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:12.320
Laura Garrison: you know, don't default to emails that sound like, I hope this finds you well, I'm reaching out, because unless that's who you are right, and

166
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:34.489
Laura Garrison: it's probably a great way to get ignored. But that's probably not you. That's a hubspot ghost that's saying, hope this finds you. Well, I'm reaching out, because so your founder voice is going to be your edge. And at this stage you should lean into that and use that founder voice. So the kind of Key point here. The best outbound doesn't try to win the deal. It earns the reply.

167
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:44.349
Laura Garrison: Alright. So let's talk about kind of zoom out and show you a pattern that we see over and over, whether the messages

168
00:26:44.600 --> 00:27:01.790
Laura Garrison: good, bad, or, you know, on the edge of of glory. Here there are 5 elements that we see show up consistently in outbound messaging that gets responses, especially from early stage founders without a brand, without a team, without Sdr support.

169
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:28.609
Laura Garrison: If your message has 3 or more of these, you're in the game right? And, by the way, you guys, your messaging looks looks really good. So a lot of these get hit on, and I'll go through these specifically and show you where you really nailed it, and then some ways to tune it up. Specifically. But if you're hitting all 5, you're probably booking meetings, so we'll go through some examples. I'll keep referring back to these. But think of this as kind of your your checklist.

170
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:39.470
Laura Garrison: So number one. The fastest way to prove the messages for me is by having trigger-based relevance

171
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:47.250
Laura Garrison: again to trigger something that's happened recently funding around new hire. We've kind of gone through those, maybe even a change in the tech stack.

172
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:55.810
Laura Garrison: so example would be, hey? I saw that you're hiring your 1st Cx lead. It usually means that churn is is creeping into the dashboard right.

173
00:27:58.389 --> 00:28:06.129
Techstars 312: Alright. Thank you.

174
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.519
Techstars 312: How do you balance being that short.

175
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:16.779
Techstars 312: having some personalization? So if you're in some kind of personalization ground, just call me back

176
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:29.019
Techstars 312: hundreds of funds raises around. So it's personalized exactly. And then adding some kind of like proof that your social work with.

177
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:41.349
Techstars 312: So I'm just wondering about how you're thinking about the balance between adding more personalization to email and then keeping it really concise.

178
00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:47.415
Techstars 312: Yeah, I can. Well, I can just give my thoughts, I think. And then, if you have some examples too. But

179
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:54.488
Techstars 312: the one, the one thing I was gonna I was even thinking about adding this to what she was saying earlier. The way that you think about this is

180
00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:01.169
Techstars 312: You're not selling yourself. You're not selling your product. You're not selling really much at all at the beginning. You're really.

181
00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:10.620
Techstars 312: You're not well, you're sort of selling a 30 min meeting, but even at the very beginning you're not even selling that you're just trying to get a reply like she said it there pretty well. You're just trying to earn the right to reply.

182
00:29:11.054 --> 00:29:14.620
Techstars 312: I think a lot of people will make the mistake of

183
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:25.530
Techstars 312: like trying to skip some steps and trying to close the deal and say, like, Hey, we're great. We do this, we do this, we do this, we work with these guys, these guys, these guys, our product, does this this.

184
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:37.739
Techstars 312: what a no brainer like, please be with me, and that really, that that doesn't help as much as you might think. So you're right. I mean, maybe if there's a really short way to add a little bit of relevance to it.

185
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.509
Techstars 312: That's great. But really what you're and then the other thing is targeting. So if you target

186
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.620
Techstars 312: people who just raised a seed round.

187
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:52.830
Techstars 312: Many of them might not want to talk. Many of them, maybe, are sales leaders themselves, like they're not really your buyer, like, at least in that example. They're maybe not your buyer, anyways.

188
00:29:52.920 --> 00:30:18.969
Techstars 312: but a few of them will, at the very least reply. And that's really what you're trying to optimize, for you're trying to optimize for someone who happens to be stressing about that exact problem at that exact time, and they'll get, they'll get back and say, Hey, tell me more, and they'll even tell you like, hey! Who you work with it like? Prove it to me like, how do you do it. Who do you work with? Do you have any references whatever? And just that reply like that takes 2 seconds on an iphone, you know, and then you're then you're playing ball, and then you can answer the question.

189
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:31.999
Techstars 312: And so in the beginning, you're just trying to sell. You're not trying to sell anything. You're just trying to get them to reply. And even then you're still not trying to sell them much. And people fall into this trap all you're trying to sell them on is taking 10 min on a quick

190
00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:41.839
Techstars 312: intro call right? And even then you're not really necessarily trying to close them. You're trying to sell them on the fact that maybe you actually understand the problem. So it's all about incremental steps. It's kind of like

191
00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:49.989
Techstars 312: being a friend or dating, or anything like that. You can't. You can't skip to the end, and whenever you try to do that you'll you'll you'll find yourself putting too much

192
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:57.520
Techstars 312: data, too much content in there, and it'll it'll turn people off. So, Laura, I don't know if you had something you want to add to that. But that was just. That was my thought.

193
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.190
Laura Garrison: Yeah.

194
00:30:59.385 --> 00:31:00.240
Techstars 312: Yeah.

195
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:16.799
Laura Garrison: I'll I'll say, stay tuned, because the like. The 1st example I gave was very short, but the examples I'll give you moving forward do have a little bit more meat on the bone. I just wanted to give like something really, really simple for the 1st example. But I I'm hearing what you're saying like.

196
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:35.730
Laura Garrison: hey? It may not be enough, because other people may be sending that same type of message. So you've gotta you've got to hit on your relevance, and it doesn't have to be a case study. It can just be one sentence, so I'll I will show you that. It kind of as we go through the exercise. So those are 2 2 really great.

197
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:40.050
Laura Garrison: really great questions, and agree with what you're saying. There, Andrew, for sure.

198
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:47.900
Ankur Toshniwal: I I sorry I had another one. I don't know if you guys are, gonna get to it. But subject lines is that something you guys talk about later. Then I don't. I don't wanna ask.

199
00:31:48.490 --> 00:32:13.683
Laura Garrison: I. I give some examples. But we actually don't talk about about subject lines. We we can. I mean, you know, there's a lot out there. It's a lot of just testing, you know, to see what's resonating, because I don't think I think there are definite knows, you know, like you don't want, like all the trigger words right? That that trigger, the spam filter. You don't want to use those you don't want to use a bunch of emojis. Right?

200
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:23.150
Laura Garrison: You don't want to do like all caps or a bunch of punctuation, but I think I think I think the subject lines are about testing.

201
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:36.929
Ankur Toshniwal: Gotcha. So the 3 wise do. Is there any one of the any one of those that's most particularly like useful in the subject line, because you probably only have space for like one? Or is it just not connected to those.

202
00:32:37.932 --> 00:32:43.979
Laura Garrison: No, I think it can be. I mean, I think you can maybe come up with a list that you want to test.

203
00:32:44.120 --> 00:33:11.110
Laura Garrison: And what I talk about a little bit later is the, you know. Obviously, it's tied to the open rate. Open rates. You don't really want to track them anymore. So you want to do it sparingly, like, maybe just on day one to kind of see where it's tracking. So I talk a little bit about about testing that, but not specifically about hey? How to fashion a great subject line. But I've got some recommendations for you guys, are you? Tell me the name of your company again. Are you harvest.

204
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.770
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah.

205
00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:21.489
Laura Garrison: Yeah, I think I've I've got yours in here so we can. We can kind of go through some things I recommend. But but truly, you know, it. Subject lines really are just just try and see.

206
00:33:22.001 --> 00:33:23.510
Laura Garrison: You know what comes back.

207
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.110
Laura Garrison: Thanks for the questions, though, guys.

208
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.934
Laura Garrison: So I think just finishing up the trigger base part.

209
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.793
Techstars 312: Any question about open rates.

210
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:52.652
Techstars 312: Yeah, open rates can can. Yeah. Do you want to go through that real quick just on open rates, Laura, like you can't always

211
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:55.110
Techstars 312: They're not the most reliable. Yes.

212
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:59.660
Laura Garrison: Yeah. So so sign the the way that it works is.

213
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:23.639
Laura Garrison: excuse me, Shady at best, because it's just based on a pixel that's in the email, and if that pixel gets scrolled past, it registers as an open. So essentially, someone could leave a message in their inbox scroll past it 20 times, and it registers 20 opens right? So Hubspot doesn't even offer a report when they use. They don't even offer a report around open rates, because it's

214
00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:36.969
Laura Garrison: not a super reliable metric. Also, the email could be opened by spam filters and things like that and and trigger open. So not really a great a great indicator it can be an indicator of.

215
00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.960
Laura Garrison: If you're landing in the inbox.

216
00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:49.489
Laura Garrison: Right? That that may. If if your emails aren't being opened at all. You may not be landing in the inbox, but in the last, like 5 or 6 months.

217
00:34:49.679 --> 00:35:18.080
Laura Garrison: the that pixel has been associated with like phishing attempts. And so a lot of or that type of of technology. And so it's triggering a lot of spam filters just because you have open rates turned on. It was kind of working against you in that way. So that's why we don't recommend using them anymore. And if you do, just make it for a short test one day, maybe 20 cents, just to kind of stick your toe in the water and and see what comes back, but not long term tracking.

218
00:35:24.054 --> 00:35:25.110
Techstars 312: Yeah. Any other questions.

219
00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:32.011
Laura Garrison: Okay, cool, sorry guys. I don't mean to talk over you. I just cannot hear.

220
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.240
Techstars 312: Yeah, yeah.

221
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.440
Laura Garrison: Okay, perfect. So.

222
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:37.700
Techstars 312: Wrapping up.

223
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:52.180
Laura Garrison: Based relevance. What this is going to separate you from is like you want to get out of that. I help companies like yours crowd right? You don't want to be in that group. You want people to think you know what this person did. 45 seconds of research on me.

224
00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.029
Laura Garrison: you know. Maybe it's worth reading reading their email.

225
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.480
Laura Garrison: Pain is bigger than product. So early founders love. You know, we love talking about the product.

226
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:15.399
Laura Garrison: But your product is not interesting. Sorry. The problem that you solve is what is what is super interesting to to your prospects. So nobody wants a time tracking tool.

227
00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.890
Laura Garrison: They want to stop

228
00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:24.990
Laura Garrison: leaking hours that they can't bill for right? So lead with the problem. And if they relate to it, they're going to ask about your solution.

229
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:43.899
Laura Garrison: Number 3, 1 line proof. So you need to earn belief quickly. And this is something that the gentleman in the front row, I believe, was asking about is you know, one line of proof is going to create that trust, and it doesn't have to be a full case study. So you could just say, Hey, you know

230
00:36:44.700 --> 00:37:14.649
Laura Garrison: we built this after losing 2,000 bucks a month to unbuild time when I was running my own firm. Right? That's credibility. You've been there. You had the problem. You've been in my seat right? Super valuable. Hey? This was used by the team at Raytheon, you know to meet a 6 week prototype deadline. Oh, shit, Raytheon cool! That's awesome, right? So you know, it's going to tell the reader that you've actually done something that you're not guessing at it. But but all you need is that one line? Because that's probably all they're going to read

231
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:15.600
Laura Garrison: right

232
00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:30.490
Laura Garrison: number 4, low friction. Cta, so this one's really big. You don't want to overcomplicate the ask here, and you actually want them to know what the ask is. Right? So you don't want them to read the message and go all right. That's cool. Now, what what am I supposed to do with this right?

233
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:46.859
Laura Garrison: I wouldn't do the 30 min ask? I wouldn't ask for their calendar, and I would not send the scheduling link as your 1st message. I would say something like, Are you open to a quick, quick thought. Exchange like, use your own language here, right? But you know, can I ask you how you're handling this? Now

234
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:52.609
Laura Garrison: keep it casual, you know, respect their time, and make it really easy for them to say.

235
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.750
Laura Garrison: Yeah, sure, you know, I'll have a chat with you on this.

236
00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:00.820
Laura Garrison: So this is your true superpower. This is your founder founders. Voice. So

237
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:25.050
Laura Garrison: you are a builder. You are not a Bdr. Reading off of a script, so when you sound like the founder, people are going to give you more credit at this stage, right? So you can use that honesty can use that imperfection with a little bit of edge. So one of your cohort members here has a cold, outbound message that says, honestly, fuck the pitch. I just want to gut check on this right? And

238
00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:31.299
Laura Garrison: you know it worked. In that case I'm I'm sure that it's continuing to work, and it works because it's real

239
00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:56.300
Laura Garrison: is there a chance that there's going to be some people that that are turned off by that? Sure. But in this, in this culture, people are turned off by, you know the color of shirt you have on. So why not, you know. Be yourself and be authentic in that. So, you know. Don't write like you're trying to sound professional, right? Like you're trying to start that real conversation. And I thought this message, you know, I hadn't seen it that way before, and I really appreciated that so nice nice job there.

240
00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:04.330
Laura Garrison: So here's your checklist. If you want to screenshot this do I have a trigger? Am I leading with the pain instead of the product?

241
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.109
Laura Garrison: Does the one liner earn? Belief?

242
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.930
Laura Garrison: Is the Cta light? And does it sound like me right

243
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:23.769
Laura Garrison: outbound? That works isn't magic. It's messaging that's going to respect the time of the buyer. It shows you did your homework, and it feels like something that they would actually respond to here.

244
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:38.550
Laura Garrison: So keeping the the founder voice, I think it's 2 parts. It's the mindset shift. And then there's the actual tactics and execution to make it happen. So let's talk about the the mindset shift here.

245
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:46.120
Laura Garrison: Scaling shouldn't mean writing worse messages faster.

246
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.930
Laura Garrison: That's where a lot of people in your seat can get it wrong, so that

247
00:39:51.380 --> 00:40:06.939
Laura Garrison: you know the voice that you have is going to be your superpower, and if you hand it over to a tool, or you dilute it with automation too early. You're not building that trust. So you're just another message in someone's inbox and that they're hitting. You know they're deleting 50 of them before breakfast.

248
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.710
Laura Garrison: So

249
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:24.090
Laura Garrison: what you're going to scale is your is your structure. But that soul that you bring to it is not what you're going to automate, or, you know, put in someone else's hand. So use the frameworks like Darwinian's 3 by 3, because they let you repeat

250
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:31.789
Laura Garrison: the format without repeating words. So it's how you stay consistent without sounding like a a bot in this case.

251
00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.060
Laura Garrison: And then.

252
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:44.260
Laura Garrison: you know, personalization is not saying, hey, I saw your post on Linkedin like you've got to kind, or I saw you raised around. You gotta take it a little bit further than that, showing that you understand

253
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.570
Laura Garrison: their world. What's changing?

254
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:51.359
Laura Garrison: You know? What are they dealing with? And why does that matter now?

255
00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:57.830
Laura Garrison: The other part is going to be the tactics and execution portion. So

256
00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:02.500
Laura Garrison: you know how you scale without losing that edge. I would start with

257
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:10.220
Laura Garrison: a doc or a notion page anything like that, and I would write down the phrases that you actually use. So

258
00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:18.589
Laura Garrison: you know, get someone to record your pitch at an event. Use your 30. Second explainer that you, you know, would give to an investor

259
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:24.759
Laura Garrison: the line that you say when someone says, Hey, what like? What do you do? You know? We we probably all have.

260
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:34.980
Laura Garrison: I know I do a bunch of family gatherings where people just go. What do you do again? Right? And you you have to explain it in a different way. So think about those things.

261
00:41:35.258 --> 00:41:57.789
Laura Garrison: Because I think that's the real, the real gold. Put that in into your messages. Put that into your subject line. Put it into your Cta, into your call openers. Right? Let your voice kind of show in that copy. So subject line question. You know that it it'd be great to just. You know. What am I not seeing in my inbox that this person may, you know, may offer up? Because I think that's going to be a great.

262
00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.280
Laura Garrison: great disruptor.

263
00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:07.510
Laura Garrison: Only automate where it makes sense. So you know, use the tooling for your signals

264
00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:17.830
Laura Garrison: to find out tech stack changes things like that, you know, funding and and job changes. But don't let that replace the part where you understand the context.

265
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.480
Laura Garrison: And then the biggest one here is going to be to iterate.

266
00:42:22.088 --> 00:42:29.409
Laura Garrison: You know, we say, when we're building, when we are working from these massive lists, and we've got kind of a large tam.

267
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:48.119
Laura Garrison: we may say, Hey, I want 250 people to go through us. A set of messages from start to finish, or a sequence from start to finish before you iterate. But I think for the seat that you guys are in. I think every 30 to 50 messages. You should know what's landing and what's falling flat. So

268
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:54.260
Laura Garrison: you know the the messaging that you're creating here is just like your product. You've got to have.

269
00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:59.700
Laura Garrison: you know, message market fit, if you will, before you can scale it.

270
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:06.505
Laura Garrison: if it. If if the messaging sounds like you, then you know I think you're I think you're doing it right.

271
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.769
Laura Garrison: in that way.

272
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.599
Laura Garrison: So what happens if if no one replies.

273
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:18.430
Laura Garrison: right? So let's let's talk about the the follow up piece.

274
00:43:18.957 --> 00:43:24.900
Laura Garrison: This can be a place where you know.

275
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:34.269
Laura Garrison: you can kind of ghost your own pipeline in this way, or you can overcorrect and start sounding like every other automated sequence, that that you've probably ignored yourself.

276
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:39.740
Laura Garrison: So most prospects are not going to respond to your 1st email.

277
00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:51.469
Laura Garrison: And it's not because you wrote a bad message, it's because the timing wasn't right. Right. Think about yourself. You're busy. You forgot the pain wasn't super urgent that week.

278
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:58.639
Laura Garrison: right? And then once it slips below the line on on your inbox. Right? How how quickly does that screen fill up!

279
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:06.890
Laura Garrison: You totally forget, despite having great intentions, or you know something catching your attention. So here's what does not work

280
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:11.490
Laura Garrison: anymore. Used to work bumping your last email.

281
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:17.090
Laura Garrison: That was big. 6 months ago. I would have told you to bump the email or or 9 months ago. Right?

282
00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.220
Laura Garrison: Don't bump anymore. Everybody. Everybody's bumping emails.

283
00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:29.900
Laura Garrison: Don't say that you're checking in or circling back. You've probably heard those before. Checking in circling, back, following up, and don't use any of them

284
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:37.319
Laura Garrison: and repeating the same. Cta is going to get you in trouble as well. So so you've gotta.

285
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.009
Laura Garrison: You gotta change the bait

286
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:52.809
Laura Garrison: right? You've got to change your approach every single time, and I'll show you exactly what that looks like. So follow up is not about reminding them that you exist. It's about earning that second chance at relevance.

287
00:44:53.960 --> 00:45:01.770
Laura Garrison: So what we recommend is you want to follow up 3 to 5 times across a two-week period?

288
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:10.100
Laura Garrison: Okay, it's gonna give you enough touches to engage or re-engage without being spammy

289
00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:15.450
Laura Garrison: right, and the key is each message that you send should feel new.

290
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:22.620
Laura Garrison: So follow up to. I would jot this down if I jotted down anything. Follow up 2 is gonna be

291
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.680
Laura Garrison: a 1 line insight or trend.

292
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.360
Laura Garrison: Right?

293
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:37.920
Laura Garrison: Follow up 3 reference, some type of social proof or a mini case study.

294
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:43.970
Laura Garrison: Right. You're changing up your your bait here, follow up 4 could be, you know.

295
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:49.530
Laura Garrison: a light cta reset like, hey? Is it worth a 10 min conversation, or should I close the loop?

296
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:54.070
Laura Garrison: Sometimes we'll do an offer for follow up for

297
00:45:54.570 --> 00:46:02.750
Laura Garrison: right? So if I'm reaching out to someone, and I say, Hey, this is what you know. This is what Darwinian does, or actually hey? I saw blank.

298
00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.010
Laura Garrison: you know this usually means blank.

299
00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:10.332
Laura Garrison: you know. Is it worth chatting about? Right. The second message may be that

300
00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:23.129
Laura Garrison: you know some type of insight, then we do our social proof. And then our 4th message is is some type of an offer, and I'll say, Hey, we do a totally free go to market audit.

301
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:39.060
Laura Garrison: and and we create a 30, 60, 90 day plan for you that you can take with you that you can get someone else to do, or you can come back to us when the time is right. Right. You can, diy this thing, whatever. So we give those insights. And so I don't really want to lead with that, because I

302
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:59.779
Laura Garrison: I just don't right like, I don't want to do 50 of those things, but if it's what's gonna you know, move the needle on a new prospect absolutely. I'll I'll be glad to do that. So think about incorporating some type of value driven offer? Something that's like low input for you. That's not gonna take you a million hours to do.

303
00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:06.019
Laura Garrison: But again, you know, you're you're changing the bait on your on your hook for that

304
00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.380
Laura Garrison: And then, you know, interesting.

305
00:47:11.018 --> 00:47:26.551
Techstars 312: Yeah. Why don't we pause for a pause for discussion here, just a little bit. This applies to Linkedin Sales navigator as well when you're kind of doing the messaging. Yeah, okay? And then the second one is

306
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:35.630
Techstars 312: Oh, shoot. I forgot the second question. Okay, we're not going anywhere. Yeah, no worries

307
00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:52.840
Techstars 312: intro messages when someone reach out to them, because I often find myself when it's totally when someone like say, Oh, contact them from from me

308
00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:58.299
Techstars 312: tend to then say something about me. And

309
00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:02.189
Techstars 312: how do you think about those things right like, oh.

310
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:15.519
Techstars 312: Chloe told me to reach out to you? Should you keep those things and like talk about problem, but just mentioned the name of the person, how do you think about those that are just?

311
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:29.303
Techstars 312: Well, okay. So when you're getting introduced, the rules are totally different. Chances are you can screw up one. It doesn't matter because they want to be respectful to the person that introduced you to a certain degree. It depends on. Yeah. It depends on the trust level of the introduction. But

312
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:38.899
Techstars 312: even if those at least now I don't type much at all, I might say, hey, heard great things. Your background was relevant. We're doing Xyz, very, very short.

313
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:43.140
Techstars 312: But really, again, you're just trying to get them on the phone like you're trying to get them on a meeting. So like.

314
00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:52.649
Techstars 312: always say great things about you, you're doing some stuff that's relevant. We do this this but very, very short. I'm really excited to meet you properly.

315
00:48:53.260 --> 00:49:09.600
Techstars 312: Can you send some times? Here's a link that's kinda that's kinda how I do it. But- but you probably won't get negative signal. If you do type out too much, I just. I just tend not to do it. But you you chances are you'll still get to chat with the person because they don't want to be disrespectful to whoever sent the intro

316
00:49:10.199 --> 00:49:25.370
Techstars 312: for Linkedin. One thing that you can actually figure out is whether they're looking at your message or not. See their profile like picture, like kind of covering. There. Is there any like? Does that change? Or do you

317
00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:29.872
Techstars 312: like? Because we know that we have something like.

318
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:35.620
Techstars 312: Yeah, I mean, if you're going that granularly, there's nothing wrong.

319
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:41.139
Techstars 312: We know they're reading the message, but they're just not replying or like.

320
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:51.929
Techstars 312: it's a little cringy if you're like, Hey, I noticed you're reading my message. I wouldn't. I wouldn't do that just because it's uncomfortable.

321
00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.559
Techstars 312: Sure, right? Okay.

322
00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:20.350
Techstars 312: if they're interested enough to keep reading it.

323
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:29.999
Techstars 312: Got it? Yeah. You can also escalate- escalate- escalate it like, send an image voice that's on Linkedin, or I can

324
00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:43.589
Techstars 312: right now, because you can't really hack us. So if you shoot a voicemail. They're gonna be like, there you go. And then, boom! You're a real person, and they'll feel a little worse for ignoring, you know, images, links, whatever like stuff like that, I would. I would treat it as like a half

325
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.119
Techstars 312: like half success, like they're not completely ignoring you, but I wouldn't reference it back, because that just feels like

326
00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:56.780
Techstars 312: if people, if you make people feel uncomfortable, they'll tend to feedback.

327
00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:03.110
Techstars 312: So I mean, you can try to be funny with it. I've seen some people try to be coy with it, and that works.

328
00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.660
Techstars 312: But but yeah, I would just leave it alone. Yeah.

329
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:12.643
Techstars 312: Another follow up on. This is like, for

330
00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:41.440
Techstars 312: one thing that we do is like we connect. We try to just like for us. It's like the 1st thing we want to just connect with them like we don't even care about sending any message, and so, like the whole goal is to connect on Linkedin. Isn't that kind of the default. 1st step you send a connection request with a note you could, or you just send a message. Yeah.

331
00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.759
Techstars 312: sure, I don't know. Do, Laura, do you see any

332
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:51.770
Techstars 312: Any difference between just sending a message on Linkedin versus sending a connection request? I don't think it's like a huge

333
00:51:54.790 --> 00:52:04.490
Techstars 312: think. That's right? Yeah, right? Right? And actually, statistically, it's 500.

334
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:29.670
Techstars 312: Oh, just connect with them. It might increase.

335
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.070
Techstars 312: It says, information

336
00:52:40.685 --> 00:52:55.529
Techstars 312: kind of agree. When someone sends me a note on a connection request. I think they want something from me. And I'm like, I don't wanna respond to this like whatever that doesn't matter what it is just like this is creating more work. This is not just above like anymore. This is an expectation. So

337
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.329
Techstars 312: yeah, there's no, there's no like

338
00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:09.970
Techstars 312: I don't. We've tried all this stuff. Haven't seen one thing where it's like, oh, you gotta do this, and it changes so much on Linkedin. It changed a lot

339
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:11.090
Techstars 312: so.

340
00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.607
Laura Garrison: Yeah, I I'll tell you. The thing that I don't like is

341
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:23.569
Laura Garrison: When I hit, accept on a connection request. And then I immediately get an email.

342
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:33.729
Laura Garrison: because, of course, it's hooked up to something. Or I get a message immediately. I do not like that. I don't know if you guys feel the same way, but it's like that's a weird one. And then

343
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.169
Laura Garrison: I think there are some people out there who will like.

344
00:53:37.310 --> 00:54:05.240
Laura Garrison: you know, like Trina. Say, you're you're in my Icp, and I send you a connect request and you accept it. And then I've got some type of reminder. 3 months down the road to reach back out to you and say, like, Hey, Trina, we've been connected for a while now, and it's like, Oh, you've waited, and now that means I should listen to you like I think that's a weird, kind of smarmy way to approach it, too. So the again, like probably more don't do's versus like, Hey, this is what's actually working.

345
00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:10.030
Techstars 312: It's sort of like awkward. I feel like.

346
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.120
Techstars 312: please don't ignore me. If I said.

347
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:16.070
Techstars 312: Yeah, I find that doesn't really tend to get you anywhere.

348
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:21.367
Laura Garrison: And I think if I if someone is, you know, going back to the question of

349
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:26.920
Laura Garrison: you know they saw my message. I know they saw it, but they didn't respond. It's like then

350
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:42.290
Laura Garrison: the message wasn't the right message right? And then you go back to that. Follow up where you say, hey? The 1st message? And I think I've got actually, it's right here on the screen. The 1st message earns the attention. The second one proves you're not a spammer. The 3rd one earns the meeting

351
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:49.569
Laura Garrison: right? So if they saw it and they did nothing. That's okay, right? You've you've got to kind of keep going

352
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:51.750
Laura Garrison: on that front.

353
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.010
Techstars 312: The maximum view don't do a gold style transition.

354
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:00.120
Techstars 312: Oh, yeah.

355
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:06.010
Techstars 312: Do you have anything else? Do you go about 5 messages? Is that kind of where you cap it.

356
00:55:08.102 --> 00:55:11.350
Laura Garrison: Yeah, because in you're talking about Linkedin.

357
00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.779
Techstars 312: Just in general, I guess.

358
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:22.809
Laura Garrison: In Linkedin. I think you have to cap it, because if somebody opens the message, and then they see all of your messages, then it kind of feels a little like

359
00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:28.820
Laura Garrison: awkward, you know, like, Wow, you know, unless you've got something super relevant

360
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.760
Laura Garrison: But for email, I mean, I think it's

361
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.459
Laura Garrison: if you're doing a a sequence.

362
00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:43.940
Laura Garrison: Yeah, I would say, 5, 6 emails would be, would be, Max, within that.

363
00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.139
Laura Garrison: you know. Couple week period.

364
00:55:49.270 --> 00:56:00.750
Laura Garrison: Then it's like, Okay, you know. Let me put them in a list to to come back in X amount of time, you know. Like, let me assume it's not the right time, and, you know, come back in 6 months, or whatever whatever. When there's another trigger.

365
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.490
Laura Garrison: you can kind of see that.

366
00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:16.610
Techstars 312: Yeah, for the follow up. It says 3 to 5 times like, Is there? Do you guys have a general guideline on like? How many days after each thing. So it's like 2 days and 3 days and 5 days, or just curious. Yeah.

367
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:20.400
Techstars 312: that sounds about right. Yeah. Couple of days.

368
00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:30.659
Techstars 312: like. Don't do it right right back to back. Don't let it sit for 2 weeks. Kind of thing. I don't think I don't know if you have any thoughts on this, but I don't have like a concrete thing, but that sounds about right. 2 or 3 days between.

369
00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.980
Laura Garrison: Yeah, I think you can do closer for email than Linkedin.

370
00:56:34.464 --> 00:56:37.209
Laura Garrison: Some people only check their linkedin once a week.

371
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:45.729
Laura Garrison: Right? So I tend to space out my Linkedin messages because you don't want them to check it for the 1st time, and you've already messaged them 2 or 3 times.

372
00:56:46.374 --> 00:56:56.370
Laura Garrison: So I tend to let those chill a little bit. But I think what's important is if you're doing multi channel, that you do those things close together.

373
00:56:57.270 --> 00:57:00.459
Laura Garrison: Right? So if your email doesn't get opened.

374
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:09.064
Laura Garrison: you know, try Linkedin with kind of a distilled version definitely, don't send the same message right? That's ultra passive, aggressive

375
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:25.129
Laura Garrison: But you know, you could also leave a really short, respectful voicemail if you, if you have a direct line. But what that variation is gonna do within that short timeline is, it's gonna increase your surface area without burning your lead.

376
00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:28.160
Laura Garrison: Right? So if you yeah.

377
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:32.330
Laura Garrison: frequency, that's it's a great, you know, spreading it out. It's a great way to do it.

378
00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:41.670
Techstars 312: To to the one comment about if you see the message gets read, but then there's no reply like I was saying, escalate like to send a voicemail whatever across the board.

379
00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:49.149
Techstars 312: you know. Be, don't be shy. Pick up the phone. If you have their phone info, leave a voicemail, send them a text, whatever like do like.

380
00:57:49.330 --> 00:58:10.669
Techstars 312: There's no downside. And so few people have the guts to do that. Even now. It's so funny. We're all kind of like back to basics like we run millions of these outbound campaigns all the time. And we're finding that a lot of text-based things are getting more and more flooded because it's easy. It's AI, whatever even making it more relevant, adding more detail

381
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.930
Techstars 312: like you can just crank those out. Personalize really quickly now.

382
00:58:15.026 --> 00:58:15.633
Techstars 312: But

383
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:22.259
Techstars 312: picking up the phones cuts through, and it's actually doing better now than most of our other channels, because of that

384
00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:25.919
Techstars 312: so we kind of look at it, as all the text based stuff

385
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:45.040
Techstars 312: sort of gives them something to reply to later, when the timing is right. And what you're trying to do is cut through the noise. Get on their radar, and a phone call is great. We do that voicemail, whatever. And again you might not get a reply for a quarter right like, maybe they don't give a shit right now, but they but you're the right person, and and it's the right thing, you know. We see that all the time. So

386
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:51.690
Techstars 312: give yourself a little bit of encouragement, even if it looks really bleak, and you're not getting a lot of responses when you're doing outbound, you have to remember conceptually.

387
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:57.800
Techstars 312: you're in the outbound. You're punching your way onto their calendar, and you have no clue whether the timing is right or not.

388
00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:16.540
Techstars 312: whereas with inbound, obviously, if you had inbound, life is good, it takes a really long time to get a lot of inbound, so you can't really do it right off the bat. But when you have inbound they, you know that it's relevant and timely for them. So it's beautiful. It's fucking awesome. You could just get inbound all day. That's great. But you can't. And when you're doing outbound, you're hoping that maybe timing's right. 90% of time is actually wrong.

389
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:31.580
Techstars 312: And you'd be surprised at how much you're you don't realize it. But you're snowballing future replies. We'll get replies 6 months later, or or 9 months later, 12 months later, from outbound, because, you know, they weren't stressing about it then. But then, all of a sudden, they're really stressed about it. And they're like, Oh, that guy sent to me.

390
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:47.049
Techstars 312: So even if you know, someone's the right person, if they're totally ghosting, whatever I usually try to say, keep sending them a ping every month or 2, if you can. If you can find a way to keep a list of long term stuff. Just keep keep in them up. If you know they're the right person.

391
00:59:47.140 --> 01:00:02.710
Techstars 312: Because you guys are founders. You want everything yesterday. But most normal people just live in their lives. They're going to wait until their boss yells at them about something, and their boss maybe, isn't yelling at them about your problem right now, but they will so give yourself a little pound back, even if you're hearing a million no's, you're still accruing

392
01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:08.039
Techstars 312: some equity somewhere, because a lot of those ghosted people will come back to you.

393
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:15.430
Techstars 312: Yeah, one more sorry.

394
01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.820
Techstars 312: How do you balance between?

395
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:30.559
Techstars 312: You know you can start on Linkedin and go into email talking with them. But like the goal there in messaging is like to really get them to give you the email.

396
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:52.939
Techstars 312: So that's the email you're like, that's the place where they're like. It's more professional. They're like, Send us calendar stuff. So I don't know if that's like a good tip, or it's like, should we stay within Linkedin and try to get in the calendar? Invite? I'm just trying to figure out the balance between Linkedin and email if they have both contacts. I don't think there's like a magic bullet there, and I also don't think what you sort of alluded to there. I don't think you need to do. You don't need to think that you

397
01:00:52.940 --> 01:01:07.389
Techstars 312: to escalate, to email to get the meeting booked man. I'm getting really into just shooting calendar links on text messages now, and all you gotta do is get them to book the thing, and they'll show up. So if they book on Linkedin that's great. If they click on email. That's great.

398
01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:17.280
Techstars 312: like, what I've started doing now at conferences is I'll just do a little phone tap, and then I'll text them, hey? The next day, hey? Great, great chat to you! Here's my calendar. Link would love to chat, and you'd be surprised most of the time that gets through.

399
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:30.189
Techstars 312: It's but if I were to go, what's your email? And I chat with them on email, tell them about what we do. And hey, okay, maybe we'll do a meeting like I'd probably lose them. So what you like, you kind of want to just be slinging out that calendar link

400
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:34.799
Techstars 312: wherever you can, because if they happen to impulsively do it, then you got them.

401
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.749
Techstars 312: That's that's how we look at it. You don't have to escalate or change channels necessarily

402
01:01:41.558 --> 01:01:54.141
Techstars 312: did it in December. And I was like, Okay, I'm getting like

403
01:01:55.831 --> 01:02:06.658
Techstars 312: and like, I love it because I was like, why do I do this all the time, because.

404
01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:27.329
Techstars 312: hey, you'll learn that you'll become closer to them, and they'll open up more because they'll see that you are. You know, they're trying to help out startup, right? So I would definitely say.

405
01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.350
Techstars 312: for sale.

406
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.880
Techstars 312: It's exhausting

407
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:48.410
Techstars 312: again to double tap. People want to be helpful if you frame cold calling around like we're a tiny startup trying to learn. Most people will give you 10 min and like, want to help.

408
01:02:49.534 --> 01:03:02.280
Techstars 312: We've been researching folks like you. You're perfect for what we've been building this for like this is this is worth 10 seconds. Do you mind if I just tell you what it is that we do

409
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:14.000
Techstars 312: flatter them a little bit. I don't know but but you can tell them, hey? Like I'm obsessed with you like, Come on like I really like. This is exactly why we're building this. And and we solve your problem is this problem you have like, can I tell you a little bit about that?

410
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:33.640
Techstars 312: I wouldn't worry about that at all. I think what a lot of people a lot of people have this like built in social awkwardness around this stuff, and you have to shed that like you gotta just shake it off like who gives a shit like you want to be successful. You want to fucking. Hear? No 20,000 times like you'll get there because you'll start getting the yeses.

411
01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.629
Techstars 312: There's there's almost like a part of your brain. You have to turn off

412
01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.906
Techstars 312: for for that to work, and you gotta be a little shameless. The other thing that's really important is that

413
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:48.648
Techstars 312: in sales. So a lot of you guys are raising money. You're talking Vcs, right? I think.

414
01:03:49.370 --> 01:04:09.580
Techstars 312: it's a very, very, very different game when you're selling. It's, in fact, the things that might work for you when you're fundraising will hurt you when you're selling, and vice versa. So you know to your point, like, if you're talking to a Vc. And you act all persistent and eager, beaver. And you're like, Hey, I've looked up a lot. You probably would turn the Vc. Off because they're like, oh, this guy's like

415
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:13.040
Techstars 312: probably low value, maybe doesn't have a lot of BC Choices, whatever. But

416
01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:28.820
Techstars 312: that's not how it works in sales, because when you're pitching the Vcs, you're the product. So if you lose face as an individual, that's actually a bad thing like you're losing face. And and you're the product that a Vc. Wants to invest in. So like you want to make sure that you're kind of coming in with stature.

417
01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:55.299
Techstars 312: it still doesn't matter at all like be annoying. It's totally fine because you're just a vehicle for them to get the product. And then the other thing is, if you're that persistent and annoying, imagine how responsive you'll be if there's ever an issue like you're sort of a trustworthy, eager kind of there to please there to please them kind of thing as a sort of servant of their mission like, that's really the mindset. It's very different. So you're allowed to be annoying. You're allowed to be super persistent. You're allowed to lose face a little bit.

418
01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:04.809
Techstars 312: and and if you, if you know, don't do that with Vcs and don't do the Vc. Thing with with customers. The other thing just I rant on this whole thing.

419
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:14.420
Techstars 312: Don't use your Vc. Language on your customers, either, and this is a massive mistake that everyone does because you're so used to doing this for Vc pitch.

420
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:38.409
Techstars 312: If you come into a customer thing and start doing the whole Ted Talk like we're transforming the shifting sands of the industry and disrupting blah blah blah, some vp of whatever in fucking middle of nowhere doesn't care at all. They just have a problem that they're sweating about, and they want to fix it so they'll actually find it condescending and rude and and kind of a little off putting. If you do the whole industry transformation, you know.

421
01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:48.027
Techstars 312: kind of thing to them. So- so just, I guess. Clear that. Mic. But yeah, you can. You tell people what's not tell people like this is the

422
01:05:48.894 --> 01:05:55.479
Techstars 312: pitching very heavily. We solve this problem. Do you have this problem? Yeah, I have your number. We're talking like, it's totally fine.

423
01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.280
Techstars 312: Yeah.

424
01:05:57.530 --> 01:06:05.350
Techstars 312: How do you handle like, let's say, like their assistant is the gatekeeper of the call so like, Oh, it's like their assistant is like kind of like

425
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:10.920
Techstars 312: managing like who gets to the actual person.

426
01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:34.549
Techstars 312: for example, like for so oftentimes they have, like a person that's on the call that's just like kind of like the filter. What's your what's your problem?

427
01:06:35.419 --> 01:06:43.520
Techstars 312: That's tough. Sometimes you're just cooked, and you can try again a couple of times. See if you get the timing better, you can. You can tell them like

428
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.460
Techstars 312: this person's relevant, or they like, you have anything like, yeah. This person downloaded from her like

429
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:56.807
Techstars 312: we've been corresponding like wanted to follow up on something. And when with our correspondence, something like that like that can sometimes cut through

430
01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:07.760
Techstars 312: We also just need to be ready to try again later. Office numbers. Yeah, for this.

431
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:18.250
Techstars 312: Oh, and if they don't do anything, got it.

432
01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:33.289
Techstars 312: But I think business.

433
01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:45.179
Techstars 312: So you have to like the actual number like for real.

434
01:07:54.900 --> 01:08:05.827
Techstars 312: but point of view, so are there any like similarity between, let's say,

435
01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:14.369
Techstars 312: how you approach a person on a dating app. And this so like, typically on a dating app. What we do is we.

436
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:17.769
Techstars 312: you say, how are you respond.

437
01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:41.450
Techstars 312: So like what I'm trying to do is take notes, guys.

438
01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:47.080
Techstars 312: long message up front. You send like a small or something like that. And then she responds.

439
01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:55.610
Techstars 312: And then you basically build it up. Do some small talk. Then she give you the give you the number. So I'm using similar techniques on the back end.

440
01:08:56.069 --> 01:09:17.810
Techstars 312: That's exactly right. So that's what I was saying earlier. It's like incremental wins, you know, like, first, st you're trying to get a reply or a match or whatever, and then, you know, and then can you get a little bit of banter, or whatever? Same with same? It's it's yeah, that's exactly right, like you're

441
01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:40.139
Techstars 312: like. Don't go straight to the marriage proposal on the dating app. Do a little bit of whatever. Try to maybe get them to chat with you on Instagram. It's all about the incremental steps, and at each point you're only trying to win that next rung of the ladder. You're not trying to win this like a whole ball game. That's true for this. That's true, for dating, it's true for anything

442
01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:44.030
Techstars 312: so so like right now on Linkedin. What I do is I don't

443
01:09:45.029 --> 01:09:52.260
Techstars 312: talk about my product or anything I just send up. How are you, or hope you're doing well, just to see if they respond.

444
01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:59.309
Techstars 312: And I think that what's happening here is there.

445
01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:06.509
Techstars 312: 1st of all, checking the credibility of who is sending the message. They're checking the the title. And who this person is.

446
01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:10.470
Techstars 312: and that's speaking their curiosity right?

447
01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:14.270
Techstars 312: So like, how far does this go? Is this the right approach?

448
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:23.310
Techstars 312: Or should I just talk about my product upfront in the 1st message it sends as soon as they accept my connection request. So

449
01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:49.879
Techstars 312: like we were talking about earlier, I think. Just a how are you like? I, personally wouldn't respond to a Linkedin. How are you? It's it's too weird. It's too big. I don't know what you want to ask, but it's really like you want something like, sometimes people try to treat Linkedin like an actual waiting app and actually use it to like reach out in a creepy way. So like, I'm just fundamentally not going to respond to how are you that might not be universal.

450
01:10:50.175 --> 01:11:14.729
Techstars 312: When you say talk about the product. I think we should circle back to what Andrew and Laura were talking about. You talk about the problem and the customers need and like why you're reaching out why you think they could be a good fit? Not just this is what I'm building. It's like, I think I think I've identified a problem. Do you want to talk more? So? I I think you were remote for the 1st part of it, but that, like initial message.

451
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:18.200
Techstars 312: like the the 3 prompt approach like.

452
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.590
Techstars 312: why, you neither like don't don't talk to your product for a while.

453
01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:39.676
Techstars 312: and then how are you meaning? You might get some folks that are bored and get back to you. I don't. I don't really react to those wouldn't do something that generic. But you know, you could start with the pain or something like use. The formula that Laura was talking about earlier and talk about how

454
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:50.649
Techstars 312: you solve something that's probably a problem for them would love to chat more like you might as well don't know if that's a lot of

455
01:11:56.706 --> 01:11:57.789
Techstars 312: yeah.

456
01:11:59.393 --> 01:12:03.356
Techstars 312: Do you want to go back to your very 1st email that you sent on behalf of.

457
01:12:06.382 --> 01:12:07.890
Laura Garrison: Do you remember?

458
01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:08.290
Laura Garrison: I'm not.

459
01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:09.250
Techstars 312: Nope.

460
01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:10.820
Laura Garrison: In my deck, or.

461
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.480
Techstars 312: That that email that you showed earlier was like, Hey, we we noticed you.

462
01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.039
Laura Garrison: Oh, yeah.

463
01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:29.188
Techstars 312: Yeah, even on Linkedin, that you can use the same stuff and and notice how short this is.

464
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:35.020
Techstars 312: you could, you could. I would actually probably propose just doing something like this and saying.

465
01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.130
Techstars 312: Hey, you're relevant. For X reason

466
01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.040
Techstars 312: we solve people. We solve this for

467
01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:50.630
Techstars 312: people. Can I tell you a little more, and then I would just sort of leave it. I wouldn't go into detail about your product. I wouldn't go detail into detail about your credibility, your profiles attached to this anyways.

468
01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:56.080
Techstars 312: I would even throw a little calendar link, see if they

469
01:12:56.310 --> 01:13:03.450
Techstars 312: see if they they bite. But I don't. I wouldn't. I wouldn't put too much. I wouldn't do the banter thing earlier. That's just my own.

470
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:04.290
Techstars 312: Well.

471
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:14.693
Techstars 312: I think that's strong dating apps, too like what the hell like I'm not here to ask. Your day is kind of like, hey? You look fun! Let's go have a drink next week like

472
01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.750
Techstars 312: that's sort of what this is doing. It's like, Hey, you're relevant. Why don't we do a thing

473
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.800
Techstars 312: like like, can I tell you more?

474
01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:29.590
Techstars 312: like, if you do the the banter thing. It gives them a reason to check out, and they don't necessarily like a lot of people don't really chit chat on Linkedin.

475
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:30.629
Laura Garrison: Of time. Waster.

476
01:13:31.626 --> 01:13:32.600
Techstars 312: Yeah, yeah.

477
01:13:33.693 --> 01:13:48.600
Techstars 312: have a question about the signature. The email signature. I see, this one is relatively simple, simpler, shorter is better. Or what's the any guidance here.

478
01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.290
Techstars 312: Yeah. Do you have anything on the email signature? Laura.

479
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:58.160
Laura Garrison: Yeah, no, but I'll tell you I mean a actually this came out of my just

480
01:13:58.883 --> 01:14:13.760
Laura Garrison: my regular inbox, but in cold outbound. I use no logo and no links at all, because links will land you in spam, and even a link or a picture in your signature counts as a link. So I just don't want to take that risk.

481
01:14:14.508 --> 01:14:17.089
Laura Garrison: So you just need a very simplified

482
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.579
Laura Garrison: signature. That's specific to cold outbound. Now, if it's people, you know.

483
01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:25.340
Laura Garrison: you can have as long of a signature as you want, but

484
01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:30.869
Laura Garrison: and as much information as you want. But for cold outbound no links, no no pictures.

485
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.720
Techstars 312: Beautiful.

486
01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:33.159
Laura Garrison: Living in the body.

487
01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:34.430
Techstars 312: Yeah.

488
01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:37.049
Techstars 312: Oh, for me, like one.

489
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:44.239
Techstars 312: if you get an email from someone with signatures and have like a logo or stuff. And it just looks kind of like.

490
01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:46.130
Techstars 312: yeah, low 5.

491
01:14:46.714 --> 01:14:48.610
Techstars 312: I don't raise it

492
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:52.940
Techstars 312: so I don't know. For me. I can make this perception of like if it's called logo.

493
01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.060
Techstars 312: maybe links to website. But it's just kind of like

494
01:14:58.041 --> 01:15:00.769
Techstars 312: of sales and eventually growth within the company.

495
01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.420
Techstars 312: Yeah, for sure. I mean, look.

496
01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:11.359
Techstars 312: run some experiments. We just find that you're in a battle with the spam filter. If you're doing this in a in any kind of scale.

497
01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:31.899
Techstars 312: and sometimes you gotta kind of probe. Where that is, you'll know if you're getting in the spam filter because you'll get 0 like 0 0 traction and and no opens like that's 1 thing where opens are useful, because if it's hard 0, then you're not even getting there. If it's some number, the number's probably wrong. But at least you know that something's happening with it. So you can. You can try some things. But our experience has just been that

498
01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:41.459
Techstars 312: the the most stripped down, the more stripped down the better for that reason. And it sucks because you're right. I mean, you're gonna lose some people because the signature maybe, doesn't look that robust.

499
01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:49.029
Techstars 312: but I don't think that's a that's not a huge detractor. The bigger detractor is getting is not getting.

500
01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:49.610
Laura Garrison: Yeah.

501
01:15:50.976 --> 01:15:57.810
Techstars 312: Wanna send to the same

502
01:16:00.387 --> 01:16:07.570
Techstars 312: mean. That's why we call. There's like so many reasons why you just do other channels. Yeah, if you you're right. I mean, if you're in the spam filter, you're gonna stay there

503
01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:16.129
Techstars 312: going out to it. So that way

504
01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:26.079
Techstars 312: of the stakeholder and learn more. So learn more.

505
01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:41.740
Techstars 312: so you can use the form for your name

506
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:57.629
Techstars 312: so that way some of it's using my name

507
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:06.410
Techstars 312: because I don't want her. My domain to be licensed files in the past.

508
01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:12.769
Techstars 312: You don't want them, but like, if it's just like, if you have a couple, then you can use one, get out of it

509
01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:22.299
Techstars 312: instantly is another one that I use for warming. That's a pretty good instantly.

510
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:49.999
Techstars 312: or, yeah, they help with like warm. They auto do the warm stuff. Get the warm outreaches, set the number that you send every day. It even separates the amount of time that you spend them like. It's pretty good, but I like it. So yeah. And the other thing is, someone was alluding to this. But like, you usually want to set up a couple other domains and like you do it off the domain. So if you really fuck up, your domain isn't

511
01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:58.280
Techstars 312: damage like we've just learned so much of this like some for a while even our domain messages to our friends were like going into spam messages because we were doing too much of this. So

512
01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:01.760
Techstars 312: you have to be careful. Use other domains do proper warming.

513
01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:09.629
Techstars 312: Be careful not to not to permit. Yeah, have you tested this cold email with the calendar?

514
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:20.540
Techstars 312: Yeah, I think Laura's actually right. If there's a link in there, it hurts, it hurts your deliverability pretty bad. So again, like this one's all you're trying to get is a reply. Once you got the reply. It's game on.

515
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:23.169
Techstars 312: All you gotta do is reply. And say, Yeah, tell me more.

516
01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:27.429
Techstars 312: You're probably not gonna get a meeting scheduled on the 1st hold email. Anyways.

517
01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:33.149
Techstars 312: if you did, that'd be amazing. But you know.

518
01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:45.989
Techstars 312: but once you have a dialogue, then, man, change your signature. Put all the cool stuff in there. Yeah, I tried putting a headshot in the signature just to show like, this is a real human. Yeah, that helpful or hurtful.

519
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:51.110
Techstars 312: I think you can get away with one image right, Laura. I mean you have the Darwinian logo in there.

520
01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:56.400
Laura Garrison: Well, I just mentioned earlier. I just did this as an example from my inbox. I would never

521
01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:11.720
Laura Garrison: like my setup, for cold outbound is through a different inbox. It's not through my regular inbox, and that signature has no like through instantly. It has no links, no images. You don't even want to do. I mean, it's up to you, but

522
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:17.269
Laura Garrison: we don't. We don't use it, not not recommended.

523
01:19:19.219 --> 01:19:32.740
Techstars 312: You're not saying that I can create multiple

524
01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:43.629
Techstars 312: like emails, disposable emails with my primary domain. Yeah, we call burner domains. I mean, companies have tons.

525
01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:47.109
Laura Garrison: But you don't want to do it with your primary, or did I hear you right.

526
01:19:47.380 --> 01:20:01.150
Techstars 312: Yeah, you don't want to use your primary like, whatever your homepage and your main email is all connected to you don't want to use that if you can avoid it, especially if it's really about volume. If you're gonna do volume, then be really careful. If you're doing 10 a day to people that are really crafted. You'll be fine.

527
01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.830
Techstars 312: But if you're gonna start doing anything automated and anything.

528
01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:14.316
Techstars 312: maybe a hundred a day or more is that

529
01:20:15.753 --> 01:20:21.949
Techstars 312: first.st And what warming is is that if there's this whole like

530
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:27.200
Techstars 312: underground world of ways to make this work, so you get a bunch of domains.

531
01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:37.870
Techstars 312: You have the domains redirect your homepage, so at least they still can see your homepage. If they go to the email, you set up email accounts on that domain. And then you use a warming service. And what a warming service does

532
01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:59.830
Techstars 312: is it starts sending what looks like regular emails for a while and builds a little bit of history. It takes a few weeks, and it tells Google or outlook, or any of the big email servers that it's nothing to see here, you know, it's just regular email set up. And then and then you can start ramping up the volume from there. Pretty standard practice. Now, like you really can't get anywhere without doing that.

533
01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:02.020
Techstars 312: If you're gonna use volume and automation.

534
01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:10.659
Laura Garrison: Yeah, and I'll mention something there. The shortcut that we're using right now is, I think I heard somebody mention it, but it's instantly. AI,

535
01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:21.299
Laura Garrison: and they will. You can either take your existing secondary domains that you own and hook them up, or you can just. It'll just give you a list of open domains like.

536
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:46.760
Laura Garrison: you know, that are available. You select them. You've you want like 3, like we do a minimum of 3. Ideally, you want 4 domains, because you need to be able to kind of titrate between those. If you see spam rates come coming up. You need to let a domain, cool down a little bit and and use another one, and what you want to keep going through the domain instead of stopping to use it altogether is just very low volume.

537
01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:54.600
Laura Garrison: And so that's kind of that toggling or titrating between domains, as you see, and then per domain you want like

538
01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.160
Laura Garrison: 2 or 3 addresses, and

539
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:09.950
Laura Garrison: instantly can do it all in one place, and it's really it's probably the most affordable way to to do all that. Now you don't own it so I don't.

540
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:10.270
Techstars 312: The worst.

541
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:17.059
Laura Garrison: When you try to move those out, so maybe you want to purchase the domains yourself and then hook them up. But either way instantly. Is the way to go

542
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:18.630
Laura Garrison: right now?

543
01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:37.690
Techstars 312: This is all stuff that, like you can do some pathfinding at a low scale first.st That's probably the best idea. I don't know how you're all at different stages of earliness, but you know, like mail, and then scale it right like, do some manual stuff lower volume. See if you can start to get some traction with it and then start bringing in the war machine.

544
01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:44.250
Techstars 312: And do set up a volume tool or something like that. You have to spend some money on licenses and

545
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:46.009
Techstars 312: data and stuff like that.

546
01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:53.809
Techstars 312: because you'll need to build lists of thousands of people, and you'll need to have a way to send all these automated things and stuff like that. So it's it's A-. It's a whole

547
01:22:53.980 --> 01:23:00.218
Techstars 312: factory that you gotta build. But in the early days. Just see what works at a lower scale, and then

548
01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:03.359
Techstars 312: look at all the other stuff.

549
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:06.219
Laura Garrison: Sorry. I heard another question.

550
01:23:07.037 --> 01:23:16.070
Techstars 312: Yeah, they're smaller scale tools, like superhuman and streak, I think, can mail merge. But space it out over time like they can spread out like

551
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:33.069
Techstars 312: your bulk emails over the course of a day. So it doesn't flare up as like a very low, superhuman and street.

552
01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:38.662
Techstars 312: It's like Street Gmail STRE. A, K.

553
01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:50.550
Techstars 312: And how are we for time? Sorry. At 11 I do have to run for something we can say. Laura could probably say a little bit longer, but we got about 20 min left, so.

554
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.970
Laura Garrison: Yeah.

555
01:23:51.351 --> 01:23:53.640
Techstars 312: You wanna keep rocketing through the.

556
01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.670
Laura Garrison: Yeah, let's type our boots here and

557
01:23:57.672 --> 01:23:59.860
Laura Garrison: so I guess wrapping up, you know.

558
01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:07.980
Laura Garrison: following up is not being annoying. It's showing that you care enough about the pain to try to solve it

559
01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:11.779
Laura Garrison: with a better angle, and that's what's going to earn you trust?

560
01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:16.099
Laura Garrison: Let me go back to where we were

561
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:18.579
Laura Garrison: on the deck. Here we go.

562
01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:31.190
Laura Garrison: So let's talk about how to actually improve the outbound, because your 1st version is not going to be your best version. We were just talking about that like figure. You know the path finding piece. So what matters

563
01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:37.799
Laura Garrison: is what you do with the signal that you're getting so outbound just like your product should live in a learning loop.

564
01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:40.860
Laura Garrison: That means you send something.

565
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:47.809
Laura Garrison: You measure the reaction you adjust, and then you repeat, based on that. So

566
01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:55.139
Laura Garrison: best in batches of 30 to 50 messages before you make decisions. If you change

567
01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:05.090
Laura Garrison: email, or you know, change your messaging every 5 emails. Then you're chasing noise because you're not gonna know what what's working and what's not working. If you wait

568
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:17.140
Laura Garrison: to send 500 emails, you've missed the mark, and you've burned half of your list already. So that sweet spot is like 50, you know, 50 messages or so. You want to track.

569
01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:19.770
Laura Garrison: the key metrics, open rate

570
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:31.539
Laura Garrison: we've already talked about. Why, that's for testing only reply rate and meeting rate. So those are the the key metrics that that matter. And then think of those like a funnel. Right? So if you're not getting opens.

571
01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:43.020
Laura Garrison: or that open rates under 40%, then the problem is going to be your subject line, or maybe the reputation of your domain. Don't ever do cold outbound from your primary domain. Ever

572
01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.610
Laura Garrison: question.

573
01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:56.279
Techstars 312: Yeah, I had questions around tracking. And like all your metrics, because sometimes you like to reach out only and you reach out on email. Sometimes you call so it

574
01:25:56.410 --> 01:26:15.889
Techstars 312: it feels a bit hard to track everything. And then also have, like, okay, what is working well, like, what is the email from. So I'm wondering, what's your system for everything? Yeah, I mean, if you if you get a tool, a lot of it can be unified. So if you get like an outreach

575
01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:28.396
Techstars 312: like it's called Outreach, outreach.com, whatever they can put all those tasks into one thread, and then you can like track the campaign. So you can have a Linkedin touch in there. You can have a call like call touches in their email touches whatever.

576
01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:32.740
Techstars 312: if you're not gonna do it all in a tool. You kind of just have to use a spreadsheet. It's really annoying, but

577
01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:35.140
Techstars 312: that's that's the trade off really

578
01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:37.999
Techstars 312: like it. It is. It is

579
01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:50.889
Techstars 312: one of those things where organization is really necessary, because the human brain can't have 500 conversations at once. You know what I mean. So you kind of have to, either. If you're gonna diy and duct tape it, then

580
01:26:51.280 --> 01:27:17.699
Techstars 312: you spreadsheet and find a way to organize it, and there's a lot of templates out there for that. But if you can spend 2, 300 bucks a month, then get one of these tools. Outreach is the one that is sort of old standard ish. I mean, the only problem with that is, it's usually like a minimum of 5 seats. And it's like 200 bucks a month per seat, or something like that. So for very early stage, it's kind of tricky. What are the what are the free sort of earlier ones that we use. Laura. We've used a couple.

581
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:19.839
Techstars 312: This is the sales team, right?

582
01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.350
Techstars 312: Mean, I teach a whole.

583
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:39.439
Laura Garrison: Class on running running an early business off of the free version of Hubspot. Right? Because you can create some custom properties. And you've got some pretty good visibility. I think the question you're asking is about attribution.

584
01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:40.680
Laura Garrison: and

585
01:27:42.230 --> 01:28:10.889
Laura Garrison: you can. You can look at a lead, and you can say, hey! Where did this lead come from? Like the 1st time I heard of this person was off of Linkedin. So the lead came from Linkedin, but then I ran into them at a conference. So now they're a conference lead, or then I saw them at an event, and they're an event. Lead what you really want to know is not where the lead came from. But what was the communication channel that caused that lead to become an opportunity? Because you can look back and see, hey, this has been an omni-channel approach right? But what's the thing that pushed it over the edge?

586
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:18.850
Laura Garrison: So when you create the deal right. When you will back up a little bit, you get a you get an opportunity right? So up until

587
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:42.359
Laura Garrison: they become an opportunity. It's just one sided. It's a crush, right? The person that's not returned. But as soon as you get that 1st date you're like sweet. I've got an opportunity here. That's when it becomes a real deal that should be in your pipeline. Right? They know it, you know it. Now, what's going to happen from here? Who knows? Right, you may not get married, but there's interest on both sides, and that constitutes a deal. And I want to know

588
01:28:42.570 --> 01:28:45.599
Laura Garrison: what caused that to become a deal.

589
01:28:45.750 --> 01:29:01.859
Laura Garrison: Was it an email? Was it a Linkedin message? What was the thing that they responded to? Even though there's been other messages or channels that I've been pursuing so communication channel is an important metric to, or an important object to be able to track.

590
01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:16.630
Techstars 312: And this is just quick question for sales. Navigator, is there any tool that you guys use to like capture all the like, you know, response rates and all that stuff, because I haven't found one yet, and I'm just curious to know.

591
01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:36.910
Techstars 312: Does it track like like open the open rates reply, rates for Linkedin sales.

592
01:29:37.976 --> 01:29:42.490
Techstars 312: I don't think it's navigator forgot about it.

593
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.710
Laura Garrison: For 2.

594
01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:45.250
Techstars 312: Nice.

595
01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:47.710
Laura Garrison: Andrew, what tool?

596
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.629
Laura Garrison: Yeah, we've used it.

597
01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:58.560
Techstars 312: Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, cool.

598
01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.420
Laura Garrison: Okay.

599
01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:00.005
Techstars 312: Okay.

600
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:02.700
Techstars 312: Yeah. I wouldn't. I mean.

601
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:05.979
Laura Garrison: I wouldn't worry too much about.

602
01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:15.809
Laura Garrison: It's hard to say right? Like I guess you that that can live in the tool. And I wouldn't worry about having to bring it into your Crm.

603
01:30:21.389 --> 01:30:34.249
Laura Garrison: so yeah, these these key metrics make sure that you're tracing reply rate can be difficult if it's not email, or if it's not messaging, right? So that may be, that may be a little more difficult

604
01:30:34.889 --> 01:30:45.740
Laura Garrison: but basically diagnosing that just like you would your your product? Right? So I think we were here. If you're not getting replies, then you know, you've probably got a messaging problem.

605
01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.430
Laura Garrison: Weak trigger.

606
01:30:47.620 --> 01:31:03.779
Laura Garrison: You know your pain's not sharp, your Cta is too vague. If you're getting replies, but no meetings, then your messaging might be getting curiosity, but not conviction. So you're not connecting the dots between what their pain is and what value you're going to bring.

607
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:07.749
Laura Garrison: So you've got to kind of run your experiments lightly.

608
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:28.159
Laura Garrison: You know A, B test your subject lines, but not your entire seats. Right? Kind of start at the top. Once your open rates are there, then kind of focus on the next thing. Try 2 different ctas, not 5 at one time. So you want a clean signal, and and if you test too many things. You're going to get chaos instead of a clean signal.

609
01:31:28.290 --> 01:31:43.740
Laura Garrison: So test one at a time, track the result, move forward to the next thing, and then, just like with your product. What matters most is that learning velocity? So the faster you test and adjust the faster you're going to hit on a message that's going to build pipeline.

610
01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:45.390
Laura Garrison: So

611
01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:58.930
Laura Garrison: just ready for some live feedback, for from your messaging, if you wanna opt out and you submitted a message. Now is the time. I don't know if Chloe will let you opt out or not. But, this is all in, you know the

612
01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:05.334
Laura Garrison: the not just like a tear down just to to tear down, or for the sake of it. These are

613
01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:13.139
Laura Garrison: kind of a coachable exercise right where you know everyone here in this room is doing the hard thing.

614
01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:14.620
Techstars 312: How you learn.

615
01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:30.100
Laura Garrison: Faster than everyone else is by getting the direct feedback. And you know, putting it into practice right? So what I've put together is a way to show for each of those that submitted a message. What's working? What could hit harder? And then maybe a few like

616
01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:45.539
Laura Garrison: surgical tweaks, if you will that could drive some better replies and book more meetings. Given the limited information. Right? Like, you guys are the experts. So just know that, you know, if if I miss the mark on something in terms of what you actually do, you know, give me a little grace. There, I see a hand up.

617
01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:46.740
Techstars 312: Oops.

618
01:32:47.060 --> 01:33:14.510
Techstars 312: Yeah, just 1st of all, because you review everything and like reading everything through. You were like, okay, those guys did not understand like things. Or or maybe there's a thing that repeats themselves among a lot of us. I think that would be helpful.

619
01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:16.869
Laura Garrison: Can you summarize that? I've just had a hard time.

620
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:22.450
Techstars 312: Yeah, he's just saying, are there any like universal things that you saw across all of them? Maybe we can start there.

621
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:35.129
Laura Garrison: Yes. So yeah, universally. I think the patterns that came up even in the strongest messages were

622
01:33:37.190 --> 01:33:39.060
Laura Garrison: hold on. I think I could just

623
01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:45.799
Laura Garrison: go there. Hold on! I have a slide for it. I'm gonna I'm gonna skip way forward.

624
01:33:49.950 --> 01:34:02.420
Laura Garrison: There we go! I'll move this in the deck for next time. If this is what you guys are interested in on the front, on the front side. So across. Sorry there's maybe something right in front of the speaker that's making like a really loud

625
01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:07.010
Laura Garrison: noise on my end. I'm not sure sure what?

626
01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:13.039
Laura Garrison: Okay, can you guys hear me?

627
01:34:14.490 --> 01:34:19.209
Laura Garrison: Okay, cool. It got really quiet over here. I'll I'll you have to.

628
01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:29.190
Laura Garrison: Maybe when that gets resolved you can unmute but common messaging across all of the the teardowns that I did, I think missing a clear trigger.

629
01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.039
Laura Garrison: the pain being too soft or generic.

630
01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:48.539
Laura Garrison: kind of bearing the value a little bit. The Cta may be a little unclear, and then a little too polished. Right? I'll take harvest AI out of the the running on that one because theirs was was super founder voice. So this is what

631
01:34:48.580 --> 01:35:09.232
Laura Garrison: I think all of the messaging had in common. And again, these were not bad messages at all. There was no cringe factor for me, or I'm like, Oh, gosh! How am I gonna deliver this? This news? Right? This is so bad they weren't. They were good messages. But I think, as I mentioned, these, these tweaks are surgical, right? They're they're small.

632
01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:17.820
Laura Garrison: you know. Try it and and see what happens. I'm gonna flip back to the to the beginning. Did that answer the question? I think I'm still muted, or the

633
01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:21.163
Laura Garrison: the okay cool. Thanks for the thumbs up. Is that you, Chloe?

634
01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:26.459
Laura Garrison: Alright amazing! All right, I'm gonna flip back to the start.

635
01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:31.859
Laura Garrison: Exordi. Am I saying that? Right?

636
01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:49.329
Laura Garrison: Alright? Let's let's dive in I'm I'm gonna let you guys kind of read messaging on your own. And I'm gonna give a little bit of commentary on each of these take a screenshot, and then I'm giving like a try this after that. Right? So.

637
01:35:50.396 --> 01:35:52.009
Laura Garrison: Carlo, so

638
01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:58.110
Laura Garrison: you're 1st up here. This message, I think, really nails a few key elements. It feels personal.

639
01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:03.300
Laura Garrison: It's got a warm tone. And I think you've really got some good social proof here.

640
01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:32.349
Laura Garrison: Okay, so those are kind of the the strengths of this, I would say, to sharpen this structurally, I think it wanders a little bit before we get to the value. I bet you also, if you guys had, if we did like a 15 min exercise or 10 min exercise for you to rewrite these messages, you would probably have come up with something similar, considering the the framework that that we've gone through. So the opportunity here is going to be to lead with the insight and make the pain a little bit sharper.

641
01:36:32.410 --> 01:36:36.780
Laura Garrison: so instead of warming them up per se, we want them to lean in

642
01:36:37.384 --> 01:36:42.715
Laura Garrison: so the a clear why, now is kind of what I've

643
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:52.240
Laura Garrison: suggested. And I think that's gonna remove this message from like, okay, this is interesting right to, hey? I'm gonna reply right now.

644
01:36:52.535 --> 01:37:21.229
Laura Garrison: And then I think this part the no stress. I think it lets them off the hook easy. It's kind of like you book a meeting, and then you may say like, but if you need to move it, no problem, right? It's like, don't you know? Don't. Don't let them off the hook so easy. So great great things about this messaging. And then again, I'm not gonna go through this, but I think this has a lot of the qualities of your original message with just a couple of tweaks, and then you still see where you get that F shape

645
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:24.559
Laura Garrison: without, even though it's a little bit longer.

646
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:36.079
Laura Garrison: So, and I can send these to you, Chloe, as well if if you want, so I will move on to the next, since we're a little short on time, is it? Is making auto easy. Do you go by? May? Does the does the product go by? May.

647
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:40.260
Techstars 312: Yeah, sorry if we skip. I need to hop at 11.

648
01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:45.367
Laura Garrison: Yeah, no problem. And I've got a little bit of time. If you guys are good. My! My next call got moved.

649
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:51.550
Laura Garrison: bye, Andrew. So me anyways right?

650
01:37:52.770 --> 01:38:03.989
Laura Garrison: Alright. So here we go. So I thought this messaging was super relatable. Everyone has felt this pain before, so I think, Vivian, you come off as helpful, not Pushy. And I think that is the right

651
01:38:04.150 --> 01:38:12.669
Laura Garrison: tone. So so nice job. There, I think the next step is to go from. Oh, wow! This is a really nice idea to

652
01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:19.130
Laura Garrison: Oh, wow! This is this is like, really for me, you know. Maybe add in a trigger related to their job or their lifestyle.

653
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:29.199
Laura Garrison: Tighten up your cta a little bit. So I came up with with this which is just a little a little tweak on that, and then, instead of happy to share, I would say.

654
01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:31.619
Laura Garrison: Do you want me to send a quick breakdown?

655
01:38:32.290 --> 01:38:35.120
Laura Garrison: Right? So I think this message is like an 8,

656
01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:40.870
Laura Garrison: and with a with a little bit of room to to grow there. So there's.

657
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:53.410
Techstars 312: Guys. I gotta I gotta get. But keep keep doing this work. I left my car there. If any of you guys want to get in touch. Take a break or take one. Thanks, guys. We'll see you soon.

658
01:38:53.410 --> 01:38:53.905
Laura Garrison: Alright

659
01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:56.719
Laura Garrison: The next one is for really.

660
01:38:57.357 --> 01:38:58.220
Techstars 312: I thought that.

661
01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:04.610
Laura Garrison: Message had really great, or I think that the product has a really great edge.

662
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.980
Techstars 312: Office.

663
01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:06.989
Laura Garrison: Are we good?

664
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:10.152
Techstars 312: Can you go with office first.st

665
01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:12.469
Laura Garrison: Can I go? Where.

666
01:39:12.670 --> 01:39:14.869
Techstars 312: Do you try harvest first? st

667
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:17.529
Laura Garrison: You want me to move on to harvest? 1st

668
01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:21.679
Laura Garrison: question for you.

669
01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:23.740
Laura Garrison: Alright, harvest.

670
01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:24.710
Techstars 312: Yeah, yeah.

671
01:39:25.821 --> 01:39:30.799
Laura Garrison: Alright I. This message is gold as kind of a personal favorite. I think it's

672
01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:35.043
Laura Garrison: humble. I think it's a clear like.

673
01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:38.850
Laura Garrison: Hold on! I'm out of. I'm out of order. Hold on.

674
01:39:39.560 --> 01:40:05.639
Laura Garrison: Nope. I know we're give me a sec, all right. All right. This one strong founder voice, absolutely high credibility. I think it's got a real problem. In other words, the Pro. The message doesn't have a real problem. The problem is real and then you've got that authenticity bomb right? Like you're just saying, Hey, you know what? Fuck the pitch? I'm just. Gonna I'm just, gonna you know, go from the the gut here. So

675
01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:16.409
Laura Garrison: this message is is close to elite in my mind. I think it can sharpen just a little bit. So lead with the pain instead of like the warm anecdote. I would

676
01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.499
Laura Garrison: just drop the problem, like, you know, like a punch, most data teams stall because

677
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:25.939
Laura Garrison: no one has the time to structure unstructured inputs. Right? That's your hook

678
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:31.110
Laura Garrison: and then your seat. I did 2 for this one, but I think the Cta. I think

679
01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:39.209
Laura Garrison: the gut check is really cool. Make it a little bit more actionable. So are you open to, you know, comparing quick notes, you know, on the topic.

680
01:40:40.570 --> 01:40:44.780
Laura Garrison: So that was my feedback, for for harvest

681
01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:52.600
Laura Garrison: all good else have to run.

682
01:40:56.410 --> 01:40:59.428
Techstars 312: No, it looks like we're all here.

683
01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:03.686
Laura Garrison: Back up to really, okay. Cool.

684
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:14.410
Laura Garrison: So I think this product has a really cool edge. Faster closings, no appraisal. Big time savings money saving for the right buyer.

685
01:41:14.807 --> 01:41:22.550
Laura Garrison: I think the order of this message may be holding you back a little bit, so we get the feature set before we feel the win.

686
01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:27.270
Laura Garrison: so I would flip that around. I would I would lead with your outcome.

687
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.799
Laura Garrison: and then I would explain the the how

688
01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:53.090
Laura Garrison: and then kind of give your Ct, the Cta a little bit of a a modern or a more modern twist. So stop by the office. I think you're probably getting at like, hey? I'm local to you, right? But it may feel a little bit legacy. So hey, is it worth a 10 min call or coffee right to see if it may, if this may fit the deals that you have.

689
01:41:54.960 --> 01:42:01.769
Laura Garrison: So that's probably a good a good thing, and then I would definitely mention Fannie Mae. I just wouldn't.

690
01:42:02.555 --> 01:42:04.220
Laura Garrison: Link it out.

691
01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:14.599
Laura Garrison: because what happens is another reason, even before this kind of was a spam concern is, if you're linking Fannie, Mae.

692
01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:18.589
Laura Garrison: and if you're doing this even in your when you're in the sales cycle.

693
01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:44.800
Laura Garrison: make sure it links to something at like a landing page on your website. Because what happens is you're you're pulling someone out of your email or your message or your, you know, interaction. And you're sending them somewhere else. And now you've lost them right. How do they get back to that place? And then they're gonna go! Oh, cool! Let me look at all. The other people that are that are on Fannie Mae's website, right? And I did the exact same thing. I got lost because I'm like

694
01:42:45.030 --> 01:43:02.360
Laura Garrison: looking around right? So that's just kind of a a word of of caution to everyone. If you ever link an article, make sure it's like housed on your website on a landing page or something like that, so that you can keep them back in the loop with the Cta right underneath that

695
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:08.790
Laura Garrison: good message, though neural defend. This is the one that I thought was

696
01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:13.559
Laura Garrison: really humble and clear, and think the genuine curiosity

697
01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:24.890
Laura Garrison: really played. Well here, I think that you've got an opportunity to crank up some urgency and some specificity. So deep fake fraud is exploding

698
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:33.400
Laura Garrison: right? So I would say that I would give the founder a reason to see themselves in the conversation, and then I would also tighten up the Cta

699
01:43:33.805 --> 01:43:45.360
Laura Garrison: instead of hey? Can I ask you a few questions? I would say, you know. Hey! Do you mind if I want run a quick scenario by you, or something like that? So it's a little faster, a little more concrete there.

700
01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:54.510
Laura Garrison: Good message, legalese. I love this name, by the way, so

701
01:43:54.750 --> 01:44:00.120
Laura Garrison: I think this really captures some great like founder to founder empathy.

702
01:44:00.774 --> 01:44:03.960
Laura Garrison: There's a lot of credibility in the story. There's

703
01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:08.329
Laura Garrison: sincerity in the tone that's being used, and I think the outcome's really clear.

704
01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:18.489
Laura Garrison: So I think this is another one where specificity could could kind of be let leveled up. So the word admin to me is kind of vague. You could say like

705
01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:26.399
Laura Garrison: missed billables or lost hours, you know, logging time at midnight, or something like that, but some type of pain that

706
01:44:26.590 --> 01:44:28.650
Laura Garrison: that people are going to be able to feel

707
01:44:29.322 --> 01:44:35.209
Laura Garrison: and then I would sharpen up the ask. So instead of happy to chat.

708
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:37.690
Laura Garrison: you know. Is it worth 10 min to avoid

709
01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.881
Laura Garrison: losing another week to tracking software, or something like that.

710
01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:51.800
Laura Garrison: you know, might have asked 2 questions about your billing process. So now they know what they're saying. Yes, to yeah. Cool. Yeah. You can ask me 2 questions about my billing process. No problem.

711
01:44:53.999 --> 01:44:57.679
Laura Garrison: And the last one that was submitted was optifab.

712
01:44:59.063 --> 01:45:10.279
Laura Garrison: I think this is another great example of a of a technical founder voice done. Well, I think it's respectful. I think it's pain aware. And I think it's

713
01:45:11.110 --> 01:45:23.650
Laura Garrison: really positioned as discovery. Not not a pitch so well well done there. I would personalize the outreach I would definitely dig into. Hey? Why this person, and why this moment?

714
01:45:24.330 --> 01:45:36.509
Laura Garrison: And then I think there's a typo. So I would, especially in the technical industries those kind of slips can can cost trust. I have heard where people say that they

715
01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:55.257
Laura Garrison: intentionally put a typo typo or like a a missed letter in a message. That's a templatized message, and I don't think you've done this, but I'm just bringing it up. Because it makes it look more authentic. But I actually don't agree with that because I think that the message should, you know especially

716
01:45:56.370 --> 01:45:58.740
Laura Garrison: you know, in the Sas space it should just be.

717
01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:04.932
Laura Garrison: you know, on point in terms in terms of those things, so I would I would stay away from that.

718
01:46:05.890 --> 01:46:15.910
Laura Garrison: add a little bit of flexibility to your Cta. Not. Everyone wants to do a 20 min call so you could do like a really fast Async version as well.

719
01:46:16.367 --> 01:46:28.230
Laura Garrison: You know. Hey, we can just swap some messages here, you know, this feels really. And I and I tried to give you guys some variety in the Ctas where each message didn't seem like the same exact thing. You know, example over and over.

720
01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:32.849
Laura Garrison: So that is optifab. Nice nice work there.

721
01:46:33.444 --> 01:46:41.135
Laura Garrison: So we talked about what's common among those teardowns. The last 2 things we have to go through. I think we have 2 slides left. One is

722
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:49.619
Laura Garrison: your outbound self check, and then the last one is, how do you know if it's working? So this is the the self check. And this is kind of a

723
01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:50.670
Laura Garrison: you know.

724
01:46:50.930 --> 01:47:18.889
Laura Garrison: If you rolled up all of this into one. This would be a good, a good thing to check through, so your outbound doesn't have to be complicated. This can be a quick gut check before you send a cold message. So if you're saying yes to all of these, then you're in the right place. Use the 3 by 3. Check your messages against the 5 elements, build your own framework for that, and then go send better cold emails this week. If you've already sent 10 awesome, you know. Send 10 more and make every single one of them.

725
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:21.430
Laura Garrison: You know 1% sharper.

726
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:24.659
Laura Garrison: Last slide. Is it working?

727
01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.110
Laura Garrison: So

728
01:47:26.290 --> 01:47:32.390
Laura Garrison: you know you've sent some messages you followed up. You've iterated. But how do you know that it's working like

729
01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:40.200
Laura Garrison: what's good? What's meh what's broken? So let's let's get tactical on this. So the point is.

730
01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:47.459
Laura Garrison: I wouldn't assume that it's the channel. I wouldn't say like cold email sucks. Linkedin's not not the right tool, right like

731
01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:52.820
Laura Garrison: cold calling is terrible. If no one's replying, I would always start with the message.

732
01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:56.429
Laura Garrison: You know your your pathfinding on this. So

733
01:47:56.570 --> 01:48:02.290
Laura Garrison: if you book one meeting for every 20 to 35 cold messages you send.

734
01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:07.049
Laura Garrison: This is exceptionally good for early stage founder led outbound.

735
01:48:07.610 --> 01:48:18.480
Laura Garrison: This isn't scaled. Sdr. Output. You're a founder with a you know you don't don't have the massive list or the big team behind you or this massive brand recognition.

736
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:25.140
Laura Garrison: People are not only replying. But they're agreeing to meet with you based on your cold message.

737
01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:30.629
Laura Garrison: Right? So that means that you're hit, that you're hitting on something real.

738
01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:34.400
Laura Garrison: You don't need a 15% conversion rate. You need consistency

739
01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:38.510
Laura Garrison: enough signal to start building that repeatable motion.

740
01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:41.100
Laura Garrison: Right? So the real unlock is

741
01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:52.980
Laura Garrison: if you're getting consistent, replies from the same type of persona, or use case. That's your early message market fit, if you want to call it that, that's how we build pipelines at Darwinian.

742
01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.980
Laura Garrison: So if you look at the flip side, if you're getting under a 2% response rate, don't panic. I think

743
01:48:59.230 --> 01:49:10.120
Laura Garrison: you know ye don't keep doing the same thing is is is my advice there. So

744
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:17.959
Laura Garrison: that's a signal to rework your message. That's a signal to look at your trigger again. Look at your pain statement. Check your Cta, is it too heavy?

745
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:20.890
Laura Garrison: Is it too vague, you know?

746
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:39.160
Laura Garrison: Fix your messaging before you blame the audience or blame the tool, basically. So 3 to 5% meeting rate conversion from cold. That is elite status. So don't don't let anyone tell you that that's just okay. It's not. You are breaking through the noise. If you're if you're if you've got that type of reply rate.

747
01:49:39.490 --> 01:49:46.510
Laura Garrison: so I'll I'll wrap up with this. I'll say the strongest signal isn't just a reply. It's going to be consistency.

748
01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:51.980
Laura Garrison: So if you're getting that, repeat interest from the same title, same pain

749
01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:57.240
Laura Garrison: or same moment, you're not guessing anymore. That's putting you like squarely in the strike zone.

750
01:49:58.994 --> 01:50:14.099
Techstars 312: Do the rates also apply to similar between Linkedin and email? Or are there like differences in like the 3 5% or any bills.

751
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:19.581
Laura Garrison: You know, it's a good question. I actually don't know the answer to that, because

752
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:22.640
Laura Garrison: we don't. We don't track

753
01:50:26.610 --> 01:50:31.720
Laura Garrison: Oh, I guess I guess they do track it. But I but I don't know the answer to that. It's a good question. I'll find out.

754
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:40.870
Techstars 312: I saw a few extra games. Is everyone kind of good

755
01:50:42.949 --> 01:50:54.690
Techstars 312: love to get your feedback on like. Personally, I don't know if, like you have time after to like like. There are certain messages. If you have tomorrow.

756
01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:55.820
Techstars 312: Okay.

757
01:50:55.820 --> 01:51:00.429
Laura Garrison: Yeah, do you? Wanna just send them? I'll put my email up if you wanna just send them to me.

758
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:07.170
Laura Garrison: And then we can just set up a few minutes to go through. I can take a look and and see what you got.

759
01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:08.820
Techstars 312: Okay.

760
01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:10.240
Laura Garrison: Yeah. Happy to do that.

761
01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:15.378
Trina Das: Hey? I also wanted to ask you.

762
01:51:17.598 --> 01:51:26.140
Trina Das: if we are like, you know, getting introd by someone else. Is there some specific tips you want to give us. Regarding writing that mail

763
01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:31.200
Trina Das: like if it is like a warm intro by someone instead of a cold outreach.

764
01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:33.710
Laura Garrison: Yeah,

765
01:51:34.590 --> 01:51:47.429
Laura Garrison: so number one, it'd be great if that person sent you the message to look at before you sent before it got sent out right, and you had a chance to kind of tweak some things. So if that's the case great, and you can kind of create

766
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:51.399
Laura Garrison: this messaging it within that context, right? That.

767
01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:58.269
Trina Das: Sometimes I would give the message, and then the person will forward it, or, like, you know, add something of his, and then send it over.

768
01:51:59.110 --> 01:52:02.089
Laura Garrison: Yeah. And then are they copying you on the message as well.

769
01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:04.100
Trina Das: Yes, most of the times. Yes.

770
01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:05.273
Laura Garrison: Okay, perfect.

771
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:14.579
Laura Garrison: I mean, I if you can prep your the person that's sending the email, that's great, because it it'd be cool if at the end they just said, Hey, I'll let you 2 take it from here, you know. Like

772
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:27.090
Laura Garrison: list, the prospect first, st hey? You know. Hey, Tom, let me introduce you to Trina. This is what, how she's helped us, and I think it would really help you. And here's why, right? And then, hey, Trina, let me introduce you to Tom.

773
01:52:27.210 --> 01:52:56.470
Laura Garrison: Tom is at this company, and he just had this happen right? And so you're taking that frame of why, now, why, me? Why, now, you know, and the problem that's being solved, and you are just kind of reframing it in that way. Also, if someone's making an intro for you, and you write the intro for them. Then all that. Then you're making it easier for them to copy and paste right? So I'll let you 2 connect. I would go straight for the meeting at that point when you respond. If if someone is is connecting you to someone else, you're

774
01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:00.680
Laura Garrison: you're communicating now out of borrowed credibility and trust.

775
01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.395
Laura Garrison: Right? So I think.

776
01:53:05.170 --> 01:53:15.279
Laura Garrison: I think that is, you just go straight for the meeting, you know, and and the way you ask for the meeting is, you say, hey, Tom, are there a few times that work well for you?

777
01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:30.669
Laura Garrison: Or let me let me link my calendar to make it. If if that's easier for you, right? And then you're not assuming, because you'll do the work right. It's it's kind of a pain when someone sends you their calendar link, because then you have to pull their calendar up and then look at your calendar and play the matching game

778
01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:34.510
Laura Garrison: right? So as the person that's booking the meeting

779
01:53:35.036 --> 01:53:47.110
Laura Garrison: or that wants the meeting, you should take as much of that lift off of them as you can. So if they just say, Hey, I'm available. These are 3 times I'm available. You're gonna make it work right like you're gonna figure out a way to do it.

780
01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.640
Laura Garrison: Yeah. Good question.

781
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:58.429
Techstars 312: Supposed to be here like 25 days timing of follow ups

782
01:53:58.690 --> 01:54:05.750
Techstars 312: on email. I know it's like 3 to 5, 1014 days that 1st follow up should always be like no sooner than

783
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:25.580
Techstars 312: so for email, Laura was saying, 2 to 3 days between emails waiting longer on Linkedin because some people don't check Linkedin every day like some people might check it once a week, and they don't want to open it to a wall of messages 2 to 3 days.

784
01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:37.259
Techstars 312: sometimes more than once. You can pull out the very next day once, and then

785
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:51.319
Techstars 312: so think about the like opening habits of your target like, how much time do commission managers spend?

786
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:58.149
Techstars 312: So you might want to slow down a little bit more if people aren't like on email all day, every day

787
01:55:02.010 --> 01:55:03.110
Techstars 312: awesome.

788
01:55:04.823 --> 01:55:14.270
Techstars 312: Get the deck later, and you can always go back to the recording, awesome

789
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:17.589
Techstars 312: Laura. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.

790
01:55:17.590 --> 01:55:20.030
Laura Garrison: Absolutely. Yeah. Great to see you guys.

791
01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:25.790
Laura Garrison: Nice to thank you all.
