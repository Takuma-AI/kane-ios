# Understanding Your Customers Workshop Part 2

**Workshop:** Understanding Your Customers Workshop Part 2  
**Cohort:** OAK24  
**Date:** February 28, 2024  
**Facilitators:** Neal Sáles-Griffin (Managing Director), Lilliana Robinson  
**Type:** Customer Discovery & JTBD  
**Tags:** #customer-research #jtbd #product-market-fit #forces-analysis #debrief-process #job-statements

## Overview

This workshop focuses on the critical debrief process after JTBD interviews, diving deep into the famous mattress interview to demonstrate how to extract and analyze the four forces of progress. Founders learn how to move from raw interview data to actionable insights through collaborative analysis and job statement crafting.

## Key Themes

1. **The Debrief is Critical**: The 10-15 minute debrief immediately after each interview is "maybe the most important part of the JTBD process"
2. **Forces Analysis in Practice**: Real-time demonstration of identifying pushes, pulls, habits, and anxieties from customer stories
3. **Context Over Demographics**: Job statements focus on circumstances, not personas
4. **Patterns Emerge Through Repetition**: Individual interviews lead to clustered insights after 10-15 conversations
5. **No Impulse Buys**: Every purchase has a chain of moments leading to the decision

## The Critical Debrief Process

Lilliana opens with the most important revelation:

> "Something that we haven't spoken about yet is very, very important. Maybe the most important part of the JTBD process, which is the debrief. Every time you do an interview... 10 to 15 minutes directly after that should always be booked out for you and your companion."

**Debrief Structure**:
- Plot the timeline of events
- Identify and categorize the four forces
- Create initial job statements
- Note patterns and surprises
- Techstars team members will join first interviews to guide debriefs

## Analyzing the Mattress Interview: Forces in Action

### Push Forces (Pain Points)

The founders collaboratively identify Brian's pushes:

1. **Physical Pain**: 
   - Back pain and tiredness
   - Deformed mattress requiring creative solutions
   - Tried sleeping on box spring, floor - nothing worked

2. **Emotional Pain**:
   - Cranky all the time
   - "He didn't feel like he was a good dad"
   - Not living up to what he wanted to be for his family

3. **Social Pain**:
   - Fighting with wife
   - Snapping at children
   - Tension carrying over to work relationships

4. **The Juxtaposition Push** (Arthur's insight):
   > "He knows it's not like a sleeping problem, because he gets great sleep when he's not there [in hotels]. So that's like really important. The push was actually probably toward the mattress, only because he knew he gets good sleep elsewhere."

5. **Time as Push** (Nelson's observation):
   - Been thinking about it for 6 months to a year
   - "The straw that breaks the camel's back"

### Pull Forces (Attractions)

The workshop reveals multiple layers of pull:

1. **Functional Pulls**:
   - Groupon coupon convenience
   - Small box, fits in car
   - Costco's return policy
   - Can touch/test in store

2. **Emotional Pulls**:
   - Looking forward to good night's sleep
   - Being a better father and husband
   - Recapturing hotel sleep quality

3. **Social Pulls**:
   - **Wife's endorsement** (massive pull)
   - She was there, touched it, approved it
   - "Her giving the go ahead, and he had her full support is a humongous pull"

Kevin's insight on Costco's return policy:
> "He was very worried that if he were to purchase with Groupon the mattress online, the hassle that it was going to be to actually get the mattress back... with Costco he had purchased products there before, he kind of knew what the return policy was."

### Habit Forces (Status Quo)

1. **Sunk Cost**: Already paid $2,000 for current mattress from uncle
2. **Travel Habit**: Away so often, he doesn't need to deal with it
3. **Life Busyness**: "Life got in the way" - selling house, kids, business
4. **Good Enough Mindset**: The entire point of habit is "overcoming every person's good enough status quo"

### Anxiety Forces (Fears)

1. **Financial Fear**: "I don't want this to be a mistake that we're $1,000 in the hole"
2. **Wife's Approval**: What will she think? They share the bed
3. **Disposal Anxiety**: What to do with old mattress?
4. **Germophobia**: Fear of mattress stores and crowds
5. **Previous Bad Experience**: Anger about uncle's budget mattress

## Deep Insights on Forces Relationships

Lilliana reveals the elegant design of the forces:

> "Just like pull and anxiety are opposites, the push and habit are opposites too. It's so cool how much thought Clay and Bob put into this!"

The workshop demonstrates how Costco systematically addressed anxieties:
- **Fear of waste** → Easy returns
- **Fear of unknown** → Can touch in store
- **Fear of hassle** → They'll pick it up
- **Fear of germs** → No traditional mattress store experience

## Crafting Job Statements: The Snickers Example

Neal guides the group through building a contextualized job statement:

**Starting point**: "When I want something to eat, grab a Snickers"
**Too vague!**

Through collaborative building:
- Add urgency: "When I'm in a rush..."
- Add intensity: "I'm starving..."
- Add constraint: "Need something to eat with one hand..."
- Add uncertainty: "While I'm on the go, and I'm not sure when the next time I'll be able to eat..."

**Final job statement**: 
> "When I'm in a rush, I'm starving, I need something to eat with one hand while I'm on the go, and I'm not sure when the next time I'll be able to eat, grab a Snickers."

Neal emphasizes: "That level of fidelity with the context of each of your customers... is what we're looking for and what most people struggle to attain."

## Critical Principles for Job Statements

Lilliana highlights two common mistakes:

1. **Being too vague**: Starting with "When I want something to eat" lacks the specificity needed for real insights

2. **Reverse engineering to fit your product**: 
   > "Don't reverse engineer your job statement to fit your product. People, well-meaning, do that. It'll be subconscious. You just have preconceived notions that you have to expel for this."

**Key insight**: The job statement should work for multiple solutions, not just yours. The Snickers statement could be fulfilled by protein bars, hamburgers, or bananas - that's the point.

## Interview Selection and Process

### Who to Interview

Christy asks about existing vs. prospective customers. Neal's clear guidance:

> "We don't recommend prospective customers who haven't experienced a switch moment... This is not sales. It's a different bucket of people."

Interview people who have:
- Recently become your customers
- Hired a competitor's solution
- Experienced actual change (not just considering it)

### The Customer Success Story Exercise

Neal introduces an optional but powerful technique:

"Write a customer success story:
- What problem is your customer currently facing?
- How does that impact their lives?
- Why is this a significant pain to them?
- What does their life look like after the problem is solved?"

This exercise "illuminates all of our biases and assumptions" before conducting interviews.

## Advanced Insights

### No Random Acts

Neal shares a fundamental principle:
> "Nothing is random and everything is caused. This is slightly hyperbolic, but I believe it. The causal mechanisms that lead people to take actions are key."

### Individual vs. Clustered Jobs

David asks about consistency across interviews. Neal's approach:

> "I have every founder I work with craft a job statement for each individual interview that they conduct. I found that to be a great starting point... to help them understand what the cluster job would look like."

After 10-15 interviews, patterns emerge:
- Different customer profiles (Brian, Lucy, Jaden)
- Different jobs to be done
- Strategic decisions about which to address

### The Observation Question

Brian asks about observation vs. interviews. Neal's response acknowledges the limitation:

> "These are easy examples because they're physical goods that you can observe someone purchasing and consuming. Not the case for most of you... observation becomes less important."

The framework works through conversation post-purchase, making it applicable to digital products and services.

## Practical Implementation

### Fight Club Rules

Neal introduces an important caveat:
> "If anyone's seen the movie Fight Club... Don't talk about it. I kind of say that with jobs. It's like our little secret weapon... When you're talking to venture capitalists, you don't have to say jobs to be done."

Instead, frame it as:
- Customer discovery
- Understanding our customers better
- Empathizing with user needs

### B2B2C Challenges

Multiple founders (Marisel, Kevin) struggle with marketplace dynamics. Neal's framework remains:

1. **Default**: "Who's gonna pay me? Whoever's paying me, I'm trying to know them"
2. **Alternative**: "Who can teach us the most about the problem?"
3. **Context matters**: Consider fundraising goals and investor expectations

## Meta-Lessons

### Every Purchase Has a Story

Lilliana's powerful insight about the timeline:
> "Every single purchase that we make, even a pack of gum in the checkout lane at the grocery store, has a multitude of little moments that lead up to that. If those little moments didn't happen, we would not have purchased it. So there's no such thing as an impulse buy."

### The Power of Specificity

Through the Snickers example, the workshop demonstrates how a few additional words of context transform understanding:
- From: Generic need fulfillment
- To: Specific circumstance with clear constraints
- Result: Actionable insights for product and marketing

### Progress Over Features

The constant theme throughout: Customers hire products to make progress in their lives. Understanding that progress - through the forces that drive and inhibit it - is the key to building products people actually need.

## Next Steps

Founders will:
1. Conduct interviews with Techstars team support
2. Practice immediate debriefs after each interview
3. Plot forces for each conversation
4. Craft individual job statements
5. Look for patterns across 10-15 interviews
6. Avoid premature clustering or generalization

The workshop sets up tomorrow's session where Neal will demonstrate a live JTBD interview, showing these principles in action.
