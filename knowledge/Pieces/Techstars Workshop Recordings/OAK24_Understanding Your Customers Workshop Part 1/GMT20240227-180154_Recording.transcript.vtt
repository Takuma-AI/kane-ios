1
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. Well.

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:18.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think we have a quorum. We're at 42, and we are recording so, Liliana, are there any logistics or important questions to address with the squad before we kick off our programming for today.

3
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.429
Lilliana Robinson: Not today. We got through pretty much all of the announcements yesterday, but as always. If there's anything please reach out to our team

4
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool, alright great. So

5
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this is like, this is one of my favorite times

6
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: during program, where I get to lean in pretty hard and like kick things off with hopefully things that are helpful and

7
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: given some of the comments that you all said yesterday about looking forward to jobs to be done.

8
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Here we are. It's game on this is kind of my tried and true form.

9
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:17.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Value. Add. So with that before I begin with, like the goal of today, is to essentially make sure that we're all on the same page with what it even is. You all have already been through the paces of applying this framework actively on your companies, so I don't want to reinvent the wheel, and I don't want to bore you.

10
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:26.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That being said, I think there's a few stories and perspectives about the origin of this framework, and how it came to be that I'm connected to and familiar with, that

11
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: by and large we found beneficial to share.

12
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:57.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's a couple of things that we prepared one. We'll be sharing afterwards, which is a few testimonials from some of our alumni who've found a lot of success in applying the framework. I think there's one video we might play for you all live. So you can kinda see and hear from at least one of them. One of the shorter ones, only on it, because a few, I think we're a little long and then but before even that I wanted to open up the floor to see if anybody had

13
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: comments or questions

14
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:12.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: about jobs to be done, anything that you wanted to clarify, anything that you want to know. I'm pretty good at operating on the fly, meaning I have hundreds and hundreds of like anecdotes, examples, slides.

15
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:31.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: references, links. So with all of those things. I can kind of customize what I share with you all today and over the next couple of days to make sure it meets your needs for what exactly you all need support on with respect to demand side sales. So given, all of that questions, comments about the framework, how it's worked for you so far, what you're looking forward to learning.

16
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Vincent.

17
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.959
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: I'd love to know about how this framework applies to what I've recently heard described as founder led sales.

18
00:02:45.110 --> 00:03:09.890
Vincent Lucero | DubPrime: Yes, so so when you say founder, let sales. What's your understanding of what that term means. So my understanding is pretty much what sounds like you. Basically, once you reach, scale you about a dedicated sales team. But the best thing you can do is have your CEO step salesperson talking to exactly talking the Yc. Brain. I hear from my co-founder is Bill. So many people want, but equivalent is yet

19
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:22.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: well, so here's the thing. Build something people want. But how do you know what people want. And I think when you said the Yc way, which I have a lot of respect for, by the way, like, we're actually supporters of Yc, in the sense that like spiritually like.

20
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: let's go, let's all win. Let's all make founder successful.

21
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the the contrast that I provide from my perspective in program, and I don't know if this is unique to techs or just me.

22
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is a lot of the times when you

23
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:44.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: bring on very young, low, cost individuals who are executing on a vision to build a start up.

24
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They can afford to iterate and screw things up time and time and time again, and there's no real downside

25
00:03:51.240 --> 00:04:01.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for those of you that are further along that have higher stakes. It may be more obligations. Maybe there's a certain timetable that you need to make progress with your business and with the funds that you have.

26
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's really valuable to do the work to get better shots on goal.

27
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:17.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So rather than kind of a scattered approach of, let's iterate. Let's build. Let's iterate. Let's build. Let's see what works there is actual work that you can do

28
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.269
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to have a lot more certainty that the bet you make is more likely to actually tap into true demand.

29
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:34.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I intuited this as a founder in my earlier years, when I was young and I started a couple of tech companies when I was a teenager and in college.

30
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:52.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But then over time. I realized from a lot of really smart people who I'm going to share some stories about today. That there are more formulaic and framework oriented ways to go about understanding your customer and what they would be willing to pay you for.

31
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Does that help? Vincent? Okay, good. Brian.

32
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.540
Brian | Circle+: Greetings everyone. So I'm just curious.

33
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.799
Brian | Circle+: Especially in

34
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:29.000
Brian | Circle+: like, I'm contextualizing the framework. I'm a very big fan of the framework. But I'm also contextualizing it. What happens it in in situations whereby. the culture has a very big intention. Adoption, Cap, you know. So, having a conversation with them in the interview, and normally they're communicating their intentions. But what they actually do is far removed from what they actually do.

35
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.140
Brian | Circle+: You know what they do, what they do help me understand what you mean by that?

36
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.069
That's what has to be.

37
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.910
Brian | Circle+: Ryan. I think you're sound cut out.

38
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You have no idea what happened. But now we can hear you. Yeah.

39
00:05:48.820 --> 00:06:16.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, great, yeah. So it's basically saying, what happens in communities where there's a high intention and option gap, you know. So basically, when you're having an interview with them. They're giving you their intentions. However, what they actually do is good question. That's a great question. I love that. That's an excellent question. Alright. So I promise to address that. And if I don't, you remind me at the end of this talk, but I will 100 address that question, because that is

40
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:29.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the secret. That is exactly what we're up to here, which is like most people have customer interviews, and the I'll meet with founders right for deals and investments, and whatever at the 4 Vcs I've worked at, and so many of them go. Well, we've done hundreds of customer interviews.

41
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:38.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I'm like, so what what does that mean? Wh, what did we actually learn? What questions did you ask? What insights did you gain? So it's not about volume

42
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:46.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: first, it's about quality reps and actually extracting the information insights you need, and the the short answer and spoiler alert, Brian, is.

43
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's not what they are saying it is at first

44
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you have to unpack the layers. That's what I've learned time and time again.

45
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so I'll get into the rest

46
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:23.280
Lilliana Robinson: really quick. What Neil is saying is huge because we have people that come in, not any of you. But we have people for years that have applied to tech stars and told us when we give them the jobs to be done. Exercise that you all did. They say, I don't need to do these yeah, here and now submit to us like here are 100 interviews I've done. The quality is not there, so we still ask them to redo it and do it in this way, because those

47
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:37.260
Lilliana Robinson: 1012 interviews that you do in a jobs to be done, session or round are worth so much more than any of those. So it's kind of like a challenge to take away those preconceived notions that many of us have, especially if you're data driven, and I'll get more into that in the lecture.

48
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:55.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. And and and I guess to to reaffirm that point, too. I love this conversation, by the way, so thank you all for raising your hand, asking questions and getting things started. It makes it easier to get into the content side once we get through this conversation. So but the other thing that that you know tends to come up a lot is

49
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:20.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's nothing special about this, like we have packaging and labels for what we're teaching you. But this is accessible information, meaning a lot of people. You can read this online. You can find this stuff anywhere for the most part. But it's about applying in a particular context and for your specific situation that makes the value unique that we offer to understanding. Did I say that? Right?

50
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:49.699
Ale: Yeah, thank you. It. It goes along the same lines. So my question was regarding, we are pre product. So our product is not out there is not accessible to users, and so doing the the jobs to be done. Interviews we had to focus on. You know how people were using alternative products and sometimes alternative pros had absolutely nothing to do with us. And maybe they are not even related to technology. So it was a little bit about like what's the best approach in those situations? Because.

51
00:08:49.700 --> 00:09:06.760
Ale: you know, you're trying to go through the layers like you said and understand. You know what drove their decision and what they're really pursuing, and then try to match that to our value. Prop. But my question was, you know, in those situations where you cannot really ask them about how they've been using your product.

52
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:36.259
Ale: They are they? In some cases they're telling you what they hypothesize is what they would do, and that has, you know, just the limited value, I guess. So. Are there any other tools that we can use to complement jobs to be done, or any specific approach that we need to take with the jobs to be done interviewing those cases with each company. But the short answer is that when you're pre product.

53
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:47.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: one of the other techniques that you can utilize before you have customers actively using your platform to gain insights in a Jtb, like fashion is by interviewing

54
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:57.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: competing hires. So whether that's a direct or indirect competitor we can help you identify very thoughtful experiments to understand

55
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:02.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: someone hiring a different solution for the same job that you're trying to address

56
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:13.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then by going deeper to understand why they're spending money to make progress with those other tools or solutions. It will provide a lot of key insights about

57
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what uniqueness you can bring to your product development process to address that

58
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we got you alright, snow!

59
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.810
Snow Lee / Runbear: Aye. of.

60
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:33.099
Snow Lee / Runbear: So II really enjoy the just to be the interview during the the application process, and

61
00:10:33.700 --> 00:11:01.899
Snow Lee / Runbear: it ha! It helped us a lot surprisingly after the after the the accepted, we started charging our product, and we even have the paying customers. But it was getting harder for me to hold the schedule. So I mean, I even reach out. Reached out to the the paying customers. They don't yeah, except the the interview request. So I it's

62
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.500
Snow Lee / Runbear: as they they

63
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:34.300
Snow Lee / Runbear: didn't didn't participate in interview, even paying for our product. But it's getting harder for me to get the interview. So it's a little bit out of the topic. But III wonder how I can get them better. There's a few things there, and there's a few layers of severity to address right. So on one hand, one way that I've always had success. Getting people to interview with me. Is by flattering them.

64
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:43.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You're saying, Hey, thank you for being a user or customer of our platform and product. And we want to find more people like you, and to understand how to better serve you

65
00:11:43.560 --> 00:12:02.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as as a user and customer of our platform. So we wanna have a conversation with you about what your needs are, and how to find other great folks like yourself. So there's a way to like frame that conversation, that invitation, so that they're almost flatter to talk to you, and they're willing to tell you more because they feel like they're making. And they are a real difference

66
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:18.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: on the direction of something that they've already signed up for. So that's one another level of severity, though, is that you have a sensitive product. Meaning like the context is more private. They may not wanna talk to you for a variety of reasons. It could be healthcare related, it could be finance related. So when you have situations like that.

67
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:27.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or even tech related like with your business. Run bear so when you have situations like that it's helpful to provide some kind of incentive.

68
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:38.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So sometimes you can offer you know, deeper utilization of the product in some way or a longer term commitment, or, you know, very frankly, cash.

69
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:54.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know, Amazon gift cards are these needs to a lot of interviewees with respect to jobs to be done. So there's a lot of ways to like. Ensure that you have people you can talk to. And then the last and final, like crazy tier that I've helped more later stage founders with, as of late is churn

70
00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:11.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: firing interviews, so the ones who leave? Why do they leave? Do they want to talk to you? How do you get them to talk to you. They're they're they're saying, No to you. Do they need you anymore? Do they even like you? Are they willing to have that conversation? So that's the ultimate tier of understanding like, alright, once they commit and they leave.

71
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:18.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how do we actually get them to talk to us? So a lot of ways to go about all of that snow. But those are excellent questions, and I love that you appreciated the framework.

72
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright, Jeremy

73
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:46.230
Jeremy Banning: Yup, no, absolutely. II actually enjoyed how conducting the jobs to be done. Interviews allowed us to really ask those quit the the 5 wise like really get into the core of what's driving this customer's decisions? We learn things that we didn't expect. A lot of our assumptions were were challenged. Because we got it signed into their lifestyles and into their true pains that they may have had, and also

74
00:13:46.230 --> 00:14:00.830
Jeremy Banning: there was a time where we able to steal down these this research into these clear, distinguished job statements that really framed up who our customer was. And what they were trying to accomplish with various tools.

75
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's much more than meets the eye. Isn't there?

76
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.120
Jeremy Banning: Absolutely. Yeah.

77
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: love that, Antonio

78
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:16.120
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I so like, I'll decide we we are pre-product, and

79
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:32.060
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: we really enjoy like I said, homework. I think we learned a lot from those interviews. I especially. You know, the journey and the diagram that to fill out it really forced us to understand the psychology the customer in the journey they go through to to to get to to the product.

80
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:40.570
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And I'm curious, by the way, to learn more about unpacking all these layers. So you're talking about one question I have is.

81
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:51.600
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and maybe maybe we'll learn it throughout the program. If if there is additional commitments that we can expect from the customers, so before the final commitment would be will be.

82
00:14:51.780 --> 00:15:06.539
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: you know, pay, you know, give us their credit card to, to to buy our products. I wonder, between the interview and and get to that point if there is additional commitment that we can expect from the customer. So from these

83
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:14.889
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: test customers to to see their their willingness to to buy our products and get more certainty tours launch.

84
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:33.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm I'm I'm I'm smirking because, like one, it just feels good to be back in the field like back doing the work and like working on jobs with a new class of companies and new problems. So just hearing you ask that question just gives me excited to to J, to jam. My answer to you is a cautionary.

85
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So here's a mistake that lots of founders make at the beginning of our techsars journey.

86
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:44.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They start doing these interviews, and some of. You have probably already done this over the application process.

87
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:52.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they get excited about the people that they're talking to, because they can tell that there's room to either upsell

88
00:15:52.820 --> 00:16:00.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or to convert into a customer. If they aren't already. I will caution you in that we do not want to

89
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  disrupt

90
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:21.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the discovery work that we're doing on the demand side with the supply side thinking and desire for progress from a sales standpoint. So it'll be a really sensitive like bifurcation of your energy to have these interviews and do these conversations in a way that doesn't

91
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:30.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: get distracted by the progress you can make on your business, and for the customer with what you have to offer that comes later, or at the end of the conversation.

92
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:41.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the answer, though to your question is, yes, of course, there are ways to enhance the offer and the deal, and the interaction you have with them. But, my

93
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.499
Neal Sáles-Griffin: my my ask of you is to wait either to the end or in a follow-up.

94
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:56.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: after you have those conversations to make those additional offers to them. But yes, of course it sweetens to deal because you understand them at a level that they never thought you could.

95
00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:11.689
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And once you get to that level of understanding, and you know exactly what they need. And you know that your product can actually deliver on that in a way that they hadn't maybe either understood or you build a new feature to address the need that you discover in your conversation with them?

96
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:23.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's such a delightful moment. It leads to so much customer loyalty and support, and it essentially turns your early stage customers into your salesforce because they start to promote you, and they start to refer other people to you.

97
00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:28.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it's a really really beautiful moment. But I would just caution you not to jump the gun on it

98
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: all right.

99
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: car squad, what's up?

100
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:50.800
Burhan: Okay? So my question is, I want to take a step back very quickly, and rather than address the interview process itself. Take a look at who you're interviewing. In the first place, I think for us is we've got 3 different types of users for a platform

101
00:17:51.130 --> 00:18:15.800
Burhan: with their own specific needs right. And how do you pay? Prioritize? Who to interview with Bill for? And your answer may be, okay. Whoever's paying for the product, but might not have the most need out of the product. So yeah, so it depends. Right? So I would say, whoever's paying for the product if our number one goal right now is to get our first customers, because we either revenue need

102
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:24.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: attraction, need a fundraising parameter. We have a deadline. We need to make or whatever, if that's not the case, and if you have a little bit more time.

103
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: my

104
00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:38.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alternative answer to what? To prioritize as far as who to interview because there's different segments. You're right. Is more about who can teach us the most about the problem we want to solve.

105
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:49.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that is, that is another way of framing like, is it a user or customer of a competitive product?

106
00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:57.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It may not be one of our new customers or our current customers. Because we're planning to change our strategic direction. We want to understand a new segment of demand.

107
00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:04.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's all types of reasons for why you would interview certain subgroups of the people that you may want to serve as customers.

108
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that is again a unique

109
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:12.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: process where there's a lot of nuance, and that nuance tends to get lost. When people

110
00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: kind of blanketly apply this framework in a way that is not as thoughtful as that.

111
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:36.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I love that you asked the question you're spot on. There's no clear objective right? Answer for who you should interview. But the more specific you get with your screening criteria and your why, the the learning questions that you have of what you actually are doing the interviews for, in the first place the more that'll be informed. Properly.

112
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'll help you all with that. Yeah, that totally makes sense. Thank you. Good Christy.

113
00:19:45.160 --> 00:20:12.259
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Th th, th. This is such a a phenomenal framework, because it kind of helps us like get deeper. Empathize with with our customers. And frankly, my co-founder, Richelle, is a much better person in doing this framework what I found just personally is is it's a little bit embarrassing when they tell me what they tell us that they

114
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:40.330
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: bought our product based on the strength of of my relationship with them. It was a little bit personal, but over time, you know we were able to kind of understand, get deeper to it. One thing that we would be helpful is, do we have more samples, or like in a B twob context cause. I know. That would help us hone our, you know, skill in doing this because it's such a phenomenal tool. I mean, it's

115
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.439
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: I haven't seen anything like it. And

116
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:56.730
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: The way we were able to unpack. Why, we're successful in developing this customer relationship. It's phenomenal, and we want to be able to do more of them.

117
00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:06.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You say you haven't seen anything like it, and and I'm we're flattered by that that being said, I think all of you have seen something like this. Never in your life. You've reached a point where

118
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:12.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you have a deeper understanding or clarity of why you purchased something.

119
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or why someone you care about purchase something. You realize that there was like a deeper why than the one that was on the surface

120
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: whenever you got to that insight, and you realize, like there was more going on than what I initially understood.

121
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's you. Knowing what this is about, we're just adding language and like

122
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:41.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: kind of parameters and like inputs to understanding how to go about that in a more systemic way. But you all intuitively, as human beings know how to understand the deeper underlying motivations and drivers for people's decisions.

123
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:57.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So but to answer your other question with B, 2 B Liliana mentioned in the chat that we're putting together examples. That was one piece of feedback we got last time, actually, for the last program, because we had a class of founders that were primarily B 2 B,

124
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:24.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so a lot of people initially think, oh, well, you know, in B Twob, there's no individual. So you can't have interviews. I'm like, Yeah, there's a decision maker. They're human beings who have needs. There's people who don't want to get fired. There's people who want to get promoted. There's people who want to look like they're the Savior for their company. There's new executives that step in at the sea level that wanna show that they're the the hero of the new Era for their business. And they wanna hire new cooled early stage tech companies with, you know, cheap enterprise contracts and deals that show that they're being innovative.

125
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:36.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? So like, there's all types of situations where there's human interest involved even in the B 2 B context, that we can teach you all how to get closer to an unpack. So we'll give you all those examples and help you with that.

126
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.370
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: And just one other thing. If if there's any other coaching around.

127
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:48.820
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: how we can do these interviews for our partners like our like our almost like our sales channel partner.

128
00:22:48.950 --> 00:23:03.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Because maybe there's some of that nuance there, too. How we can make successful. Sure. Yeah, I love that you're already thinking through how to help, like your your basically your your your partners succeed the people who are leading to the progress for your customers. So II love that. And happy to help.

129
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: All right. Dan.

130
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:17.379
Dan Ponomarenko | Webvizio: Yeah. Hi, have questions about practical implementation of this framework in in regards to the Mackenzie customer journey model.

131
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:33.730
Dan Ponomarenko | Webvizio: So basically, what we did with this customer interview, we covered the like part of the join you from like trigger to initial consideration set to, you know, active evaluation to the Mo. Moment and purchase.

132
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:45.160
Dan Ponomarenko | Webvizio: But is there any way to implement this framework when you try to research on the post purchasing experience and

133
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.610
Dan Ponomarenko | Webvizio: loyalty loop.

134
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:54.040
Dan Ponomarenko | Webvizio: you know. So can we use this framework to go further than just moment on purchase?

135
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, you can. You can use this framework to go beyond the moment of purchase, because the

136
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I'll and I'll cover this. The core part.

137
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That becomes important post purchase is customer success.

138
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:27.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So are we actually doing the job that they hired us for? Are we getting it done? Are the new jobs they want to hire us for? Are they gonna rehire us so? That I will if I don't address that Dan, and and what I'm gonna share you let me know. But that's something I plan to go much deeper on. And it's a sniper question. I love it.

139
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.890
Dan Ponomarenko | Webvizio: Thank you, David.

140
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:45.129
David Akinyemi (he/him): Yeah, I'd love to, I guess, learn a bit more about how we identify what should be the core foundation of our our value. Prop versus versus additional features when it comes to talking to these people. And so we're pre product. And still

141
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:56.709
David Akinyemi (he/him): trying to hone in on that, we're solving the right problem. And as new problems come up. A lot of them are kind of clustered in different areas and different spaces. We really wanna make sure we're solving like

142
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:08.940
David Akinyemi (he/him): the core value, probably not necessarily building on additional features that that may help a subset, but not necessarily everyone. So hoping to learn more about that. Well, yes, one quick comment on the last thing you said.

143
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:19.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We definitely don't want to help everyone right away. So you're still going to have to make trade offs and focus on a subgroup to make disproportionately successful before you expand

144
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:24.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: one of the trips that one of the things that trip up founders early on is like.

145
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:29.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I know all y'all want to serve millions of people. I know you want to make millions of dollars.

146
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:40.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We all want that, but if we try too soon to spin a narrative that we have that figured out. And we know who's gonna pay us all that money. And who's gonna all those millions of people and we're gonna come from. We're kind of fooling ourselves.

147
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:50.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So it was like a little bit of a trick question for me to ask each of you how you become a billion dollar company before I made the. You know, the final offer to have you all join, because it's like, the short answer is, we don't know.

148
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:59.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You have a guess. You have a thought process for what you think will work, and we'll help you with that. But yeah, David, II got you on that. That's not a problem. And that's an excellent question.

149
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:06.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Wow! That was awesome. We just took 20 min and burned through a dozen questions, and I'm couldn't be more

150
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like happy about it.

151
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:18.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we have 2 quick founder stories that we want to share. We've never done this before. So bear with us hopefully. This is helpful

152
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:40.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for you all to hear from companies that literally just applied this framework and went through our program last, and had real stories to share about what was beneficial, and addressing skepticism going into it as well. Is this a good use of my time I'm here to fundraise. I just got in the text, how do I spend a hundred 20 K. Properly? I'm trying to sell? Why do you want me to slow down and like talk to people instead.

153
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:49.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So hopefully they address some of that. So indie is the CEO of perform view. They

154
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:59.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: have been so steadfast at iterating on their progress. Throughout our program experience, however.

155
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.139
Neal Sáles-Griffin: their business scares me

156
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:12.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Indie's approach to providing art to directly compete with Netflix, as they tend to say in their tagline on the website.

157
00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:20.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  is still something that remains to be seen to me, as like we can succeed with that branding and strategy. However.

158
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:28.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the amount of traction interests and fundraising progress that's already been made since Demo Day for Nd has been impressive.

159
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:41.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Naji and I are actively advising indie on, you know, price round versus revertible note, and all these other cool details, so that all being said, here is a perspective from Indie, and then we'll follow up with another founder.

160
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:54.620
Lilliana Robinson: and like for no Sophia or Naji, can you put the perform view link in the chat. So people can see it. So we're giving a B to C example first, and then we have a B to B, but they filmed a video just for you.

161
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.649
Lilliana Robinson: So let's see.

162
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.660
Lilliana Robinson: could you hear that?

163
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think the sound may not be shared.

164
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.360
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, let's try. And

165
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.589
Lilliana Robinson: we're gonna play them

166
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.650
1.2 5.

167
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:44.999
Hey, guys! Indy Sanders here founder and CEO of Performview perform view was just in Techstar's last Oakland cohort, so was in there with the team having a lot of fun really excited for everything that's ahead of you here. But the team asked me to do a little bit of a summary on the value I found from the jobs to be done. Process I think to be transparent when I first went into it, as many of you may be sitting there thinking.

168
00:28:45.070 --> 00:29:14.529
hold on. I've done a lot of customer interviews before. Why do I need to do more now in this entirely new format. I feel like I've got a grip on on everything, and I'm just trying to build and grow but I was encouraged to turn my focus into the process, and it ended up being such a valuable experience. So for us, the main learning, outcome or learning objective was, why do people sign up to our platform. So perform viewers are. It's like Netflix for video art. Essentially. So, why do people sign up? What are they doing about it? And how can we use that insight? The learnings we got from that to then bring more people into the platform as customers?

169
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:40.509
It was a pretty awesome experience. I think we only got a a handful of interviews. We focused on interviewing our actual customers and learning about the back story, towards how they found us. What made them make that purchase? What was the emotion behind their engagement with our product? And what we ended up finding is a lot more emotional reasons for the purchase itself, we had no idea towards it, and we then took all of that insight, and reflected on our landing page, which is

170
00:29:40.600 --> 00:30:10.509
our main source of first or second step in the funnel alongside our social messaging and our social media strategy. And we completely redid it, based on those insights based on the emotive feedback we got from those customer interviews. And as a result, we actually, after redesigning, it wasn't really a design change more. So a messaging and language change. We saw our landing page to sign up page conversion rate go from 4% to 36% between November and December. So that's like a 32% jump up. And it's been sustained at that

171
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:38.980
point ever since. And I'm 100% certain it's because we have a better understanding of what that motive trigger in our customers when they go to that sign up page. Sorry that landing page is going to be. So. We're hitting it on the spot before they have to think for themselves, and that's helping us make the sale. So I think I'd really encourage everyone to go into the Jtvd process with an open mind. Try and work out what that pinpoint is, and just be critical on yourself around. How much am I actually interpreting facts versus using emotional insights

172
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:50.870
behind the purchase to make my decisions on how I bring people in, or how I structure my sales. Call so happy to answer any questions directly. If anyone wants to reach out to me, the team can can link you up. But if not, good luck to you all

173
00:30:53.600 --> 00:31:13.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: great, and then we'll follow up right now. With Nala himena does work on the Bdb side to help larger organizations. II would like to think companies like techstars get better insights about how to retain their talent and support. their employees.

174
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let's get himena's going.

175
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.250
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, give me 1 s.

176
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.309
Lilliana Robinson: This can be

177
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.080
Lilliana Robinson: but we can also pop in these

178
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.670
Lilliana Robinson: email in the chat.

179
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:49.559
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, no. I think I think I'm gonna need you to share it. I can't get out of Eddie's video

180
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright. I got you. I can get this done.

181
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:01.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Here we go.

182
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Please hold

183
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:08.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: share.

184
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.850
Lilliana Robinson: and I was just putting out 1.2 5.

185
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.170
Alright.

186
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let me know if this works.

187
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:46.759
Lilliana Robinson: So Hi, everyone. This is Kimena from Nala. I would say, there's 3 things that like very specific that I got from doing jobs to be done. The first thing was we were able to relate, identify the true value our customers had with Nala. And because of that we actually increased our prices by 25%. And every single company that's part of like our desired target. They not always said Yes, by day renew for the whole 2024,

188
00:32:46.770 --> 00:33:09.800
so we would have never been able to do that. And if we hadn't had absolute certainty that they just love their product. The second thing is that it helped us improve our marketing and sales effort. So as a startup, I'm I'm the founder that's doing founderled sales. So anything from marketing like our website, Linkedin or the sales, it's it's basically me. So really understanding what to say in any marketing initiative.

189
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:23.609
like focusing on what are the struggling moments? What are the benefits that Nala provides for companies that use us and then focusing on the sales process in explaining how Nala works, really tackling those

190
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:37.010
potential frictions or fears or things that we know we needed our clients to feel safe in order for them to make progress. and last, but not least. I would say it. It also helped us to make decision in terms of a roadmap.

191
00:33:37.020 --> 00:34:07.369
because in our case we really discovered that what they truly truly value and what was unique about Nana was how we were getting actionable data in order for them to make decisions around talent management. So it was not necessarily other things we thought they were looking, that we needed to add in a roadmap, because our competitors had. It was this very specific thing that we were doing very well. That was what caught their attention. In the first place, that's how they got the Cfo. To say yes to the budget that was required, and that was. And they were looking for that because that was going to help them with the pain. They were going like the struggling moment.

192
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:35.059
And then finally, like, whenever I'm selling right now and again, I'm on B twob. Enterprise. So it's a little different for B Twoc. Whenever I have, like a first, like a discovery call, thanks to jobs to be done, I have a completely clear understanding on where, in the progress journey they're in. So I know what it is that I need to give them in order to help them make progress in their own state, instead of me treating every single lead at the same time at the same piece, giving them exactly the same process. So

193
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:44.329
it sounds like more work. But it's not. It's actually it's it's made us more efficient and effective. And and provided a lot of clarity on different decisions we're making on a daily basis.

194
00:34:49.690 --> 00:35:01.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So you've heard from our founders. I'm ready to jam. I'm ready to get into my my talk but I will preface it with one final thing, which is

195
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:13.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you can interrupt. You can drop questions if they're relevant to address in the moment. I will otherwise do. Do your best to drop them in, so that we can go through and make sure we address them all.

196
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:36.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I might go. I would love to cover more ground, so that we have more time to do real practice in the next couple of sessions we have after this. So if I can get through as much of this content as possible. Now, great cause, then we can get real, and I can demonstrate examples. Do live interviews with you. I'll show you what that looks like, and maybe even use some of you all in the room as as a test subjects for the techniques. So that's always fun.

197
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So I'm gonna go ahead and jump in.

198
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And, Lilian, I think you wanted to say something about our credentials and teaching this framework.

199
00:35:47.580 --> 00:36:06.519
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, just that! It's really. I find it really helpful to understand that this is something that we also teach kind of at the same time as teaching at textiles to undergraduates and business students at Northwestern. So we kind of change the lecture a little bit to be more applicable to you guys who are actively working on businesses and have been for some time.

200
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:17.209
Lilliana Robinson: But it's the same content. So if you can kind of put yourself in a student context for this. I think it. It makes it a lot easier to understand almost like a class, because Neil and I are.

201
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:23.650
Lilliana Robinson: you know, essentially teachers, even though we work here at textiles. And we're also investors. That's it.

202
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right?

203
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: let's see.

204
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: said my screen sharing was pause. Let me do this.

205
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:38.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm gonna start that. And then, yeah, just very small.

206
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:40.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let me fix it.

207
00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:45.360
1 s.

208
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: one more. Try. Sorry about that.

209
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:56.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: When I do presentation, I needed to share the whole screen.

210
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.340
Right? Yeah.

211
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is that working?

212
00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:11.299
Lilliana Robinson: It's still the same size. But everyone can go to view options and make it bigger. If you'd like

213
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: weird, it says, my screen sharing is pause, and I'm not sure why

214
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm sorry about that.

215
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That doesn't make a difference, does it?

216
00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:24.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hmm.

217
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:26.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: okay.

218
00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:33.630
Lilliana Robinson: we can go with this small, everyone who wants it bigger. Can I just do it like this? Can I do it like this? And is this, okay, yeah.

219
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: okay, I'll just. I'll just do it this way.

220
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:43.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. So go explain. Jtb, and dig deeper into why people buy you get that

221
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like, I said, you can interrupt me.

222
00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:55.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I wanted to share a few quotes, because you all are going to go through mentor madness, and, as you know with mentor madness.

223
00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:07.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you're gonna meet a lot of people who have a lot of perspectives on your business, and a lot of founders tend to come out of that quite raw. So here are the most consistent

224
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:13.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: statements that we get from every mentored madness roundup of feedback that we receive.

225
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:22.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: use storytelling of current customers experiences to help sell the product. This is feedback to us about our founders. Start giving me stories about the customers.

226
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:29.500
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Don't chase your customers, understand your customers focus less on sales till you know your customers stop building out technology, focus on the business.

227
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: stop thinking of the company as technology, start thinking about it as a problem you're solving, too. Obsessed with product.

228
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:49.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hit the brakes on tech dev sharpen the story. They screen jobs to be done. So it got to the point where people realize, like what we're teaching and where the founders are at and what they need to do. So so you all know when I first started at techstars.

229
00:38:49.870 --> 00:39:06.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I wasn't teaching this framework as overtly as I am for you right now. Nor was I incorporating it into the application process. I was doing what I saw everyone else doing at tech stars and everywhere else. I was interviewing the founders, asking them tough questions, deciding if I like their business, and if I like them, and then investing

230
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:17.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: instead, I realized that the people who I helped the most are the people who resonate with this framework as being a way to better understand the people that you want to help.

231
00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:22.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you think that you can build tech and just figure out who you're building it, for.

232
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:28.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That can work. I'm just not good at teaching you how to do that. I'm good at this. So

233
00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:52.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there's a few examples of companies. I like to highlight that have seen a disproportionate amount of success over the past 4 years. And there's 2 kind of contrasting examples that I love sharing one is real crafter. You may meet these co-founders at some point but Sam and Sarah are Co. Founders of this company. Sam was a composer himself for the video game nerds in the world. He was the composer for the original score of the game mass effect.

234
00:39:52.660 --> 00:40:08.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that is one of the most epic sci fi video game franchises of all time. So I totally fan void out as a gamer but Sam's a really humble founder. He's the first one of the first companies I ever invested in, and he's thriving with this business in a way that's a little different than what you would expect.

235
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:22.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They came into my program at like 4 Kmr. They have like a monthly product that you know, a lot of musicians sign up to use. They've over the past 4 years stumbled into like, I think, 35 k. Almost 40 Kmr.

236
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:27.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And we still are struggling to like pinpoint. How they've consistently grown their sales so slowly over time.

237
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:48.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They're, you know, they've had contacts from spotify, and they work with the you know, Berkeley School of music and other university partnerships, and you know, music company tech companies that are exploring, working with them. But they haven't quite decided to turn on the venture spigot quite yet, and raise capital. So they're in in one end of the spectrum for me as an outcome.

238
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The other end is nutrense.

239
00:40:52.450 --> 00:41:06.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So they were also in the first class. So Liliana, Sophie, and others on the call know them well. They actually now come back and do workshops for us for our programs and help our founders. So you'll meet one or 2 of the Co. Founders of this company at some point. Let me tell you a little bit about them.

240
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:21.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So nutr since came into techs pretty much almost pre revenue, almost pre-product, and they provide continuous, glucose monitors to help people better understand their blood, glucose, and health when it comes to all of their daily and bodily activities.

241
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:29.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think by the end of program they reached like 20 K. Rr.

242
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:37.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and confidentially, I know this is being recorded. But please keep it in the family. I think they're

243
00:41:38.140 --> 00:42:00.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: their monthly recurring revenue right now is around. Is it like 3 million? It's 4, yeah, 4. So they make like, 4 million a month right now. And they just raise their, they raise their series. A, and I think they'll be raising their series. B. They're doing quite well. It's it's one of the shining examples I have of a company that I've seen find a lot of success.

244
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We didn't have as much to do it as you would think

245
00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:11.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when they were in program. They were so focused on sales. It was hard to get them to focus on a lot of the things that we're talking about here. But

246
00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:22.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they ended up realizing the benefit of this jobs to be done framework post program and ended up hiring some of the experts. I'm going to introduce you to like the gentleman who did the mattress interview Bob Mesta

247
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:33.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to actually actively work on them, you know, on a consulting project for their company to help them figure out the demand side when they plateaued with their sales and hit ceilings and walls with respect to growth.

248
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:47.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But they kept going, and now they come back and talk about both that and how they fundraise, and how they do a bunch of other cool stuff. So all that being said, couple of great examples of founders that I've directly invested in, who I know well and personally who we taught this framework to have found success.

249
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:51.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's the why.

250
00:42:51.370 --> 00:43:01.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And lastly, here. Don't fret if, when I speed up right now with the story I will tell, and the framework I introduce you all to again.

251
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:12.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We have this templated out very, very thoughtfully, step by step. so you will be able to follow what we're going to cover quickly here, at whatever pace you see fit.

252
00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:21.169
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Once we we finish going through it. So we have all of those recipes and formulas built out for you to know exactly what steps to take to do this proper.

253
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This list that you're looking at.

254
00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:44.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't believe exists online like, I don't think you can Google to find you know this like these steps in this way? So I'm I'm glad it exists, and I'm looking forward to one day, maybe making something a little bit more publicly available. I'm in talks with Bob Mesta, for example, and writing a book about how to apply jobs to be done more directly to startups. So we'll see how that goes.

255
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright. Now let's get to the fun part.

256
00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:53.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: actually doing the work. So defining the problem, this is the question, I get a lot as a as an investor.

257
00:43:54.340 --> 00:44:06.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I interrupt people because they always try to tell me about their solution, and I stop them. And I say, Hey, tell me a story that exemplifies the problem yourself, because you're talking to me about what features your business has, and that's irrelevant.

258
00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Before I actually know who we're who we're here to help.

259
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:15.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So whether you're seeking investors. new customers

260
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:29.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: trying to figure out what to build in your product. Next, understanding the progress of your users and customers, and what their desired outcomes are is the most important thing. So we could all nod our heads and all agree. Cause this is all like easy things to say, but

261
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:45.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the more time has gone on, the more true these words have become for me, and I hope that becomes the same for you. So the basic premise of jobs to be done, which you all know, is people don't buy products or services. They hire them to help them make progress in their life.

262
00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:55.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the age-old analogy. the one that came from when this framework first came about in the early 90 s. Is that people don't want to buy a quarter and strill. What do they want?

263
00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Feel free to unmute? Speak up.

264
00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:06.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they want the whole. Yeah. But now, Jeremy, let's keep it going. Stay off mute.

265
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:09.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What do they want the hole for?

266
00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.089
Jeremy Banning: That's a good question.

267
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.770
Naji B.: They want to hang a photo.

268
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:38.589
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, that's exactly right. So I wanted to hang a photo because I was a totally strange human being and decided to teach myself programming and software engineering and computer science after graduating, and when I did that I went mad and put like hundreds of posters all over my house to motivate me to do the one of the hardest things. So I had these motivational posters on the wall with my drill in my hole.

269
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:41.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But why do you think I put those motivational posters up.

270
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:52.530
Malc - Xsauce: perhaps reminder to yourself, right? Are you commitment?

271
00:45:52.700 --> 00:46:00.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, yeah. I was trying to be focused. I was trying to get shit done. Now, that being said, y'all

272
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at some point you have to call it.

273
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:18.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Because if you ask why, too many times you get to an existential crisis and you start questioning the nature of the universe. Why am I here? What is the point of anything? Does anything matter? The sun's gonna explode, I understand.

274
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I say all that to say. the quarter inch drill to the quarter inch, hole.

275
00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:27.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the quarter in toll, to hang a picture, the picture to be motivated, to learn programming.

276
00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:35.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The list goes on and on, but there are layers to understanding the depth of someone's underlying motivation. So with that being said.

277
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:41.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: has anyone ever heard of the 5 wise. This is like a standard like business, kind of

278
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: tool 5. Why's if you ask why, once

279
00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:56.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you'll learn something, but you won't learn what's really going on. If you ask why, 5 times you'll get a lot closer to the truth. Why? Is actually a far less effective question in the context of jobs.

280
00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:58.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Then when

281
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I'll tell you more about why later. But just keep that in mind.

282
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So progress is someone's trying to make. There's someone

283
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:19.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they are in a place. There's this is one of your customers, whether they're B to B or B to C, they're one of your customers, and they're trying to get somewhere that they're not, and that's why they would spend money to hire you to help them make that progress.

284
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So how do we make sense of that. Well.

285
00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:32.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that struggling moment that they're facing, and a desire to be somewhere, that they're not. They're trying to figure out in that circumstance what progress they need to make to do so.

286
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:40.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And we have to humble ourselves as founders that have products and solutions and remind ourselves that we are very simply

287
00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:45.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: trying to help them get across as a bridge. So a job

288
00:47:46.570 --> 00:48:06.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is just understanding the why the causality underneath that explains the choice of someone needs to make to make that progress. And you're gonna hear me say, progress. Probably too much like you're gonna get tired of hearing Neil say, progress. What progress are we trying to make when we start a meeting? What does Progress look like here? What does success look like here?

289
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:14.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You'll you'll you'll you'll decide if you if you vibe with that language or not. But I just I can't stop using those words because of the depth of their meaning for us.

290
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:19.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so that bridge, that capability, that's you. That's your entire business.

291
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So hopefully, this is a very humbling moment for all of us. We aren't the greatest thing, and the most important things in the world.

292
00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:28.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We have to make sure our customers feel like

293
00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:33.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: they're the most important thing in the world to us, and how we are going to serve.

294
00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:46.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just remember that we are the bridge to the customers progress. and to the extent that we can embody that and how we operate. you will develop a lot of of customer loyalty and better understanding of how to serve them.

295
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the circumstance language is delivered as well. So

296
00:48:51.060 --> 00:49:02.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a job can only be defined and a new solution developed or devised relative to the specific context in which it arises. So this is a bunch of fancy way, like language around.

297
00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: saying that

298
00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:15.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you start off building things for a very bespoke unique group of people, and over time you will iterate and learn what becomes mass appealing.

299
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:22.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but in the beginning and the early stages for most, if not all of you. You're not at a stage now where you're trying to figure out massive people.

300
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:30.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we we shouldn't be spending our techstars money on running ad campaigns until we have it dialed in. And we actually know how to properly spend money

301
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to acquire the customers that we truly want to serve.

302
00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:46.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Many of you are likely getting ahead of yourselves right now with how you're spending your dollars to have other people sell on your behalf, or other tools and systems selling your behalf without having a better grasp of who you should be selling to in the first place.

303
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:52.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So symptoms, problems and causes. So a lot of folks tend to react

304
00:49:52.980 --> 00:50:01.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to the symptoms of a customer's problem without understanding the underlying root causes. And this framework is meant to help you understand that. So

305
00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:05.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you all watch this video correct the milkshake video with clay.

306
00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, I'm seeing all the head nods. Love that

307
00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:15.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One of the most fascinating things about that fast food chain he was talking about with the milkshakes. Does anybody know what

308
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:21.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: franchise he was doing business with to help invent this framework in that story?

309
00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Anybody want to guess?

310
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.790
Valeria Brenner: Was it? Yeah, she got it.

311
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:32.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sorry, Valeria. What'd you say I was Gonna say, was it Chick-fil-a or Mcdonald's? It was Mcdonalds.

312
00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:41.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It was Mcdonald's. So half of all milkshakes are being purchased before 80'clock in the morning. and they didn't know why

313
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:48.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that blew my mind when I first saw this video and the fact that

314
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:52.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and there, there! It's 4 min long or 5 min long be

315
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:58.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the nuance in how Professor Christensen talks about

316
00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:03.539
Neal Sáles-Griffin: their approach is so dense. I'm telling you, if you go back and watch it.

317
00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: he'll say things like in language that they could understand.

318
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:18.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We asked, or we would go and confront these people in the drive through and talk to them. So he kind of casually tells the story about how he spoke to people, about, why they were buying milkshakes and figured it out.

319
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:33.589
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The level of of expertise required to be such an effective interviewer. Where you do a few dozen interviews at a Mcdonald's, and you're able to unpack something that the company itself couldn't figure out what the data that they had access to

320
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:43.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that was so impressive to me, and it was an early hint that I was on to something by wanting to learn more about how to go about understanding customers more effectively with this technique.

321
00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

322
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:49.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you all may know clay, not from jobs to be done.

323
00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:53.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but from coining the term disruptive.

324
00:51:53.530 --> 00:52:19.349
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So whenever people talk about disrupt and how it's like cliche, or you know it's a silicon valley thing, or we're disrupting this or you're being disruptive. Keep literally point the term in the business context by writing this book called the innovators dilemma. I believe it was in the eighties when he first started writing it. Maybe it came out in the nineties. 80, something like that. But it's a classic business book. And I couldn't recommend it more for the true.

325
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: deep

326
00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:47.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: old school business nerds in the room. So for interview that really want to understand, like the origins of like the emergence of technical innovation in America especially, you know, in the, you know, eighties and nineties, there are so many great case studies here where he talks about how competing startups would go head on with Ibm and other. You know companies that of that size, and how they went about that and the different forms of innovation that exist. So when people say they're being innovative, I usually go. What do you mean?

327
00:52:48.000 --> 00:53:03.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What does that actually mean? Cause? Do you understand the concept of innovation and how it's applied? And then what the context on? Because disruptive innovation is different than market creating innovation which is different than sustainable innovations. And there's different phases to understand that as you grow your business, that I would encourage you all to learn more about.

328
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

329
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:14.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the other book, though that Liliana loves, I know, because she was a student in my class, and now she teaches it with me but I don't have people read this book anymore, because it's

330
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: usually too dense. And there's there's too much

331
00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:25.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to unpack for a lot of folks, and there's a lot of academic rigor associated with it. But the book's called Competing against luck.

332
00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:37.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's named Nat for a very, very important and deliberate reason. But the notion here is that a lot of the times many of you all with your businesses so far likely shrugged your shoulders at 1 point, and you didn't know why

333
00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:48.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a customer behaved a certain way, or you use your intuition to figure out what to build, or who your customer was, or you made an inference from a conversation you had with the customer about what they meant.

334
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you were right

335
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:56.079
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in making any of those assumptions a lot of the times. Many of us would attribute that

336
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:57.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to this thing we call luck.

337
00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:05.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the labeling of this book is really about like, no, there's a way to actually know

338
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:17.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you don't just have to be lucky with your insights and with your realizations about how this works. We can teach you and go about a way to literally create opportunities for those insights to happen

339
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:45.110
Lilliana Robinson: so Lily on. If you want to say anything more about it's true that we don't have the undergrads read it anymore. But there's one exception, which is our Mba students at Kellogg. So if you yourself feel that you are very much interested in it. Case studies. Kind of a more traditional academic way of understanding jobs to be done. There are a lot of enterprise examples here. So a lot of people who are B Twob really benefit. But

340
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:57.659
Lilliana Robinson: even if you're not, if that's how your brain works, and you would benefit from that, I highly highly recommend purchasing it, because it goes along with everything that we're talking about here, but in a much broader like scheme.

341
00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:10.460
Lilliana Robinson: the way that Neil and I teach. It is very unique in that we are applying it to startups. So a lot of people don't know this because it is widely applied to startups now, but it just started out as an enterprise

342
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.340
consultant solution.

343
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.690
Lilliana Robinson: This is a very new.

344
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:28.670
Lilliana Robinson: maybe, like one decade old venture into applying jobs to be done into startups, and Neil has been at the head of that along with Bob Besta, who he's gonna talk about, who's our dear friend? And this is a great moment to check in really quickly and say something that

345
00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:30.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think needs to be said

346
00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:39.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: one of my colleagues, Matt Koslov, managing director in La he and I talk a lot. I look up to him. I've learned a lot from him as an Md.

347
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:43.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He starts off his program by telling his founders techstars isn't school.

348
00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:55.639
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're here to do business and build businesses and get things done. I'm not here to lecture at you and have you do homework and things like that, Antonio. I've heard you refer to this work as homework. I know a lot of people refer to it as homework. I want you all to know

349
00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:00.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this. if if you see it as homework. all love.

350
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:09.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: However, what you should see this as a better way to understand the people who are going to be funding your future progress as your customers.

351
00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:24.239
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And if you don't see that value, and this feels more like you're in school. I apologize for that. Let me know ways that I can reframe it. But what we do in the university context is fundamentally different than what we're doing at techstars. I'm telling you

352
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:42.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like, it's different to sit in a classroom, learn this stuff and think theoretically about how to apply it. It's a completely different beast to learn a literal framework, apply it and make more money because of it, and increase your prices and see that reflected your financial model and actually raise venture capital because of these new insights that you have. That's real.

353
00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:49.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And that's what those are the results that we expect and and and can facilitate here. So I'll say that to say

354
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:56.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm playing to my strengths in that I do know how to teach certain things in ways that allow founders to have new skills.

355
00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm not

356
00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:05.330
Neal Sáles-Griffin: only going to help you grow your business, but I'm also gonna empower you all with very powerful tools and frameworks that will help you all scale your businesses over time.

357
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:13.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's my view on programming and content in a tech stars context. But I just thought y'all should hear that from me.

358
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:19.289
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cool alright. So now we're getting to, I think, where Dan was asking me about where

359
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:26.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what happens after the purchase. So you all learn this, timeline. You all filled this out. But how well do we understand it? So.

360
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:41.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: strangely enough, most of the time people are doing their customer interviews around this phase right here. the buying and the deciding. This is where most of people, when they do, customer interviews, are getting insights.

361
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:53.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and we're here to tell you that there's so many other things that happen leading up to that moment that you didn't initially imagine. And I know y'all know this because you listen to the mattress interview at least once, if not multiple times.

362
00:57:53.140 --> 00:58:15.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So beyond the mattress interview there's plenty of B 2 B examples, as well of the same journey, of those struggling moments where there's going to be a multitude of events that go from a first thought to active, from passive to active looking, and then fully making a decision and going back through this cycle over and over again. So we'll help each of you all model this out for your respective businesses.

363
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:16.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: also

364
00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:25.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the forces diagram. So between the timeline and this forces, these are your 2 main tools. If there's only 2 things that you all take away

365
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:32.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: from all this talking at you that I'm doing right now. It's these 2 slides. It's the timeline and the forces.

366
00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:44.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Everything stems from these 2 resources with respect to what we're trying to help, you understand. So if we understand progress over time when I'm doing a jobs to be done. Interview. I have this timeline in front of me.

367
00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:51.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I am talking to the people about their journey, and I'm filling in the events as I go

368
00:58:51.460 --> 00:59:01.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: my job as I do. The interview is essentially a video game where I'm filling in the chain of events leading up to the moment of purchase, and thereafter, and how success is going.

369
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:08.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So each of you, as you do your next round of jobs to be done interviews and you will. That's what I'll be expecting you to fill out.

370
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:12.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So before I move on to the forces.

371
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Are there any questions about this timeline

372
00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:23.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: or comments?

373
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Nelson.

374
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:35.479
Nelson | Afford Health: yeah, do? Does this require? Having a product for sale? In order to be able to

375
00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.480
Nelson | Afford Health: understand some of these early trigger events?

376
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:42.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Great question, Nelson, and the answer is, no. So

377
00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: if you don't have a product for sale.

378
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:50.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: someone is probably trying to make progress outside of you. Right? They're hiring something else.

379
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:52.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Do I have that right?

380
00:59:54.190 --> 01:00:00.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So what I would do if I were you. This is very simple. So you and I should talk more directly about what this looks like in a nuanced way.

381
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:10.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I would go find people who've hired alternative solutions than what you plan to offer and understand what they're hiring those solutions for

382
01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what led them down this journey.

383
01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:23.649
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I love doing competitive product interviews. I love talking to people who choose something else. So, for example, one thing I'm doing right now is, I'm actually interviewing founders

384
01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:27.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: who get into Y combinator and tech stars

385
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:33.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and choose one or the other to understand why, that's how I'm applying the jobs to be done. Framework for my job?

386
01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:38.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Because why would a founder choose Niels Oakland, or San Francisco program

387
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: over y combinator? Would they even?

388
01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:45.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And what would be the context, and what value would I need to provide for that? To be true?

389
01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:50.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's an example for me of like a competing, you know. Example.

390
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:52.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: does that answer your question, Nelson.

391
01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, cool. J, lo.

392
01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.780
JLoh @ Travaras: Hi, similar question, but slightly different.

393
01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:19.700
JLoh @ Travaras: so we are working on sustainability and travel. And obviously, that's not really that doesn't fully exist. And obviously, there's a lot of travel incumbents like expedia and booking where people can choose these alternatives. But I'm curious if it if there's

394
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:40.320
JLoh @ Travaras: if it makes sense to interview a customer that might already be adopting sustainable practices in their everyday life, like interviewing someone who owns a Tesla or shops at whole foods or uses Ridwell or something like in the sustainability space in terms of their consumer purchasing behavior.

395
01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.619
JLoh @ Travaras: but not but not necessarily in the same industry.

396
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:54.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Just to understand their thought process on these changes or the forces of progress interesting. So what you're saying is fascinating because II jump back here

397
01:01:54.510 --> 01:02:07.229
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because I'm trying to understand what the examples you just provided, what the struggling moment is. because what you're describing sounds like people who have characteristics of maybe what might be appropriate for who you think you want to serve?

398
01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:12.339
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Who among them actually is experiencing a struggling moment that would lead them to want to make a purchase.

399
01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.899
JLoh @ Travaras: Right? So I guess, like the most

400
01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:22.970
JLoh @ Travaras: tangible example would be Ridwell. So every every city has recycling services, but people that want to recycle

401
01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:27.059
JLoh @ Travaras: the things that just aren't recyclable that end up in the trash anyways

402
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:36.320
JLoh @ Travaras: end up paying a premium to use a service called good. Well, to be able to recycle their batteries and clam shells, and whatever it might be.

403
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.340
JLoh @ Travaras: and so their struggling moment, maybe

404
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:48.650
JLoh @ Travaras: like, is a similar thought process like man, I really wanna recycle, I still wanna do really good. But at the end of the day there's not really good options out there.

405
01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:50.409
JLoh @ Travaras: And so then they that.

406
01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.469
JLoh @ Travaras: and they're struggling moment. They end up paying a monthly subscription for Ridwell

407
01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:07.899
JLoh @ Travaras: in the same way that, like for people that are traveling and want to travel more sustainably. since it doesn't really exist yet. Then, finding that customer is somewhat difficult.

408
01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.049
JLoh @ Travaras: I guess so. It's like pre-product. Doesn't it really exist?

409
01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:13.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We can help you with this.

410
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:30.139
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, we can help you with this like, it's it's a longer answer than probably what I should respond with right now. But, like, I have a lot of thoughts based on what you just said. And the the short answer is that we have to go way more narrow than how you're talking. Yeah, that's my my instinct right now is like, we gotta zoom in real deep

411
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:34.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cause. You start small. And when you start small and narrow.

412
01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:52.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's way easier to abstract in the other way around. If you start an abstract with these characteristics of Tesla or the shop or those kind of things. It's it's too amorphous for us to have true insights about those early stage customers that you want to acquire.

413
01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:58.480
JLoh @ Travaras: But we'll get there, we'll get there. I will definitely work with you, hands on on that. So great question.

414
01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Thank Kevin.

415
01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:12.499
Kevin: Yeah, hey, Neil? So one of the things that my co-founder, Medica and I we've been struggling with in the jobs to be done is, how do we make the determination

416
01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:42.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: on who to focus on. And I asked that because we're B 2 B to C, yeah, so who do we focus towards the business, the restaurants or the consumers. And so that's a very tricky thing that we've been struggling with. And if we should be applying it to both, yeah. So Burhan and the squad and the car asked about this? I think a little earlier in a different way. But my question to you, Kevin, is, What are your needs like? Are we? What are we trying to get done? Are we trying to earn revenue, or we trying to figure out like

417
01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like, what don't we know that we're trying to know.

418
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.790
Kevin: So it's sort of a 2 edge sword. So we found that

419
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:59.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: selling to the restaurants for us is pretty easy cause our product kind of doesn't exist out there. So it's been. That's risky.

420
01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:00.819
Kevin: It's risky.

421
01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:09.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Because if because if it's if you're saying it's easy now, and the product doesn't exist as soon as you start to get bigger other people gonna go. Oh, we like that, too. We'll take it

422
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:12.120
Kevin: right? Exactly. So

423
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:21.929
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so there's that portion of it. So right now, at this moment, in time it's easy, but yes, it will, that will trust me.

424
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.110
Kevin: The The other part is that

425
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.609
Kevin: the consumers on that side.

426
01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:54.060
Kevin: so getting to the restaurants. But I was saying, is that right now is easy to do? But then the sales actually getting the consumers to actually buy the product. We'll find that we could have, let's say, 100 different restaurants. But then, generating the actual consumer sales, that's a little more tricky. And it's tricky because sometimes right now for what we have, because it's very innovative. The mindset is not quite there yet.

427
01:05:54.060 --> 01:06:08.709
Kevin: We're slowly getting that mind set out to the consumer to sort of adapt this, but it's not there yet, so it may be a thing where, you know I might have answered my own question, even though with the restaurants it's easy to get it at this stage to them.

428
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:25.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Try to get it to the consumer. So so so a few things here and and I'll keep going. But you're asking you all are asking fantastic questions, so keep them coming. This is the best use of our time. In my opinion. Cause everyone here can learn from each other and your respective situations.

429
01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:36.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Ryan Singer, another friend of mine, who I will introduce more about him later, when we enter product development. Content and work.

430
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:45.090
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  He said this to me one day, he he goes, who can teach us most about the problem, who can teach us the most about the problem?

431
01:06:45.300 --> 01:07:09.240
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So the the problem that we wanna solve. And when I heard him say that this is like over 10 years ago. I never forgot it, because, on one hand, my default answer to most people when it comes to who to choose between B to B+B, to C or B to B, to C is, who's gonna pay me? Whoever's paying me. I'm trying to know them, because that's where I gotta start. If they're not willing to pay. I can't make progress in any other way. So that's a very simple rule of thumb that I still believe in. However.

432
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:15.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there is an alternative, and that is, if either the B or the C in your equation, Kevin

433
01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:21.340
Neal Sáles-Griffin: will mean more to you in the near term about what you end up building and how you execute your next phase.

434
01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:32.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: For example, if your goal is to raise venture capital, and you have a certain set of institutional Vcs that have a certain expectation for the strategic direction of your business, based on the limited conversations you've had with them.

435
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:46.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they set an Excalibur test for you like a goal like, Okay, great. You got in a text ours. If you hit these metrics, or get this done or explore this space, and can prove to us that there's a there. Then we're interested. Moving forward and investing will be your lead investor and write you a 500 k. Check.

436
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:55.899
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That is a worthy cause to maybe divert from. Who pays me now to who will teach me the most about solving the bigger 1 billion dollar problem down the road.

437
01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:12.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? That's just one very simple example. There's a lot of more nuanced strategic questions that you can ask. I will spin up a jobs to be done. Interview for the smallest of things, like, if I want to test like cert a subset of a feature within a product or a new business concept.

438
01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:24.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I will do a whole jobs to be done. Process that takes one to 2 weeks to get done once you're good at it. Just for that understanding in one domain without effect impacting the entire business.

439
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:35.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's where you can kind of pull in different situations. But the short answer of it, Kevin, is that it depends, and I will work with you on a very direct custom. Answer to your situation.

440
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:37.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Perfect snow.

441
01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:53.430
Snow Lee / Runbear: I'm curious about if it makes sense to conduct the interview with the people who's in the middle of the timeline. So just who just decide to purchase.

442
01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What do you think? I'm gonna say?

443
01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:05.190
Snow Lee / Runbear: So I'd like to have the interview to to understand that. But actually, there are some questions that I cannot ask.

444
01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:24.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright, I'm gonna say something, and and you will have to forgive me. for please forgive my language. But it's something that someone taught to me. Bitchin ain't switching. So that's what I heard Bob taught me this but basically what that means is that when someone's struggling with the problem, but they haven't taken action to change.

445
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you're not going to learn nearly as much as the person who ends up switching

446
01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:39.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? So what you want to study is the actual purpose of of someone saying yes or no to something like a hard decision

447
01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:41.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like the switch moment is the key.

448
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's where you're gonna find. Actually, I'm gonna skip ahead a slide. That's the energy.

449
01:09:45.979 --> 01:09:52.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is actually a part of my lecture right here. So the energy comes at the moment of the switch.

450
01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.199
Neal Sáles-Griffin: People will complain all day long about what they don't like.

451
01:09:57.350 --> 01:10:08.939
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but they still have to be the customer sometimes that's good, sometimes it's bad. right? It's bad in the context of Comcast. Anybody, a customer comcast.

452
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:15.809
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that's bad because I can't switch I have to use comcast, and that sucks but sometimes

453
01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:27.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: no one's ever going to be happy with what comes out. But at the same time it's getting the job done for you or others, so you're tolerating it, even if you're going to kick and scream along the way.

454
01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:41.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and maybe the kicking and screaming is more of the minority edge case, the super users and less about the masses, who are very happy with the product as it is. So that's why Snow, to answer your question. Talking to people

455
01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: who are potential customers of yours, but who have not made a decision to purchase.

456
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:54.249
Neal Sáles-Griffin: will give you a false sense of confidence about what they would be willing to do so.

457
01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One example of this that happens in the real world is, many of you have probably administered servants.

458
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:10.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You've probably run surveys to understand your audience, and I'll have meetings with founders, and they'll say, Oh, I have a survey with a thousand results, and that everyone says that they would be willing to pay

459
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:16.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: for this, or they'd be willing to do this, or they'd be willing to sign up if it had this.

460
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:26.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Those people are lying to you. You have no idea what they're actually willing to do yet until you ask him to literally pay.

461
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:32.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Those are hollow words. So I'll tell you. This is someone who learned the hard way

462
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:36.570
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I started the first coding school. I'll tell you that whole story later. But

463
01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:38.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: in doing so

464
01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:45.939
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I was learning this technique called the lean startup methodology. This is back in 2,009. So you know, 15 years ago.

465
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:59.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And so in the the lean, startup methodology, talk about doing customer interviews. And I did solution interviews and problem interviews. And when I did these interviews I talked to people who I thought would be great customers for my coding school.

466
01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:10.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I met with 25 people. and the vast majority of them said they would be willing to pay $6,000 to sign up for my coding program.

467
01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I launched my coding program.

468
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:37.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 0 of those people signed up for that program or anything else 0, even though they all told me that they would. So I but I ended up succeeding. And there's a whole story there. But I just want you to understand, like what people say they're willing to do, and what they actually do are 2 different things. So one thing that I always have people do when they claim that someone is willing to do something. I said, Oh, we'll ask them to do it.

469
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:47.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So you interview someone, and they say, Oh, I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to pay $30 for this. And you go. Okay, it's ready. Actually. So here's you have your credit card ready. I'll take you $30 right now

470
01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:52.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then you'll find out the truth. So I love that. You asked that snow is perfect.

471
01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.059
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, I'm gonna blaze through the rest. So

472
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:59.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: forces, we talked about timeline time, space and time, understanding customer's journey.

473
01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:07.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What are the forces that are pushing them through that timeline, or we're slowing them down from making it through to the purchase moment.

474
01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:26.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So space and time is what we're talking about. And right here. These forces are going to be the key to your understanding once you've conducted your interview. So we've kind of trained you all a little bit to do this already. But just so, you know, what happens is when you're dealing with a push. This is the most common one. Someone has a problem that they need to solve.

475
01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The example and analogy I like to use is, I have a flat tire

476
01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:40.110
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when you have a flat tire, and you're trying to get somewhere. You need to fix the flat tire. That's a problem that's a push that's a necessity to make progress on.

477
01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Can any one think of what a pull would be as opposed to a push.

478
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:49.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if it pushes a flat tire. what might a pull be with our car analogy?

479
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:54.210
Jeremy Banning: You're trying to get to your daughter's recital

480
01:13:54.390 --> 01:14:00.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that that's a push, too. You gotta be at the recital. Bro. I don't want you thinking about that being a good thing for you to do.

481
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:01.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's a push.

482
01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:05.630
Jeremy Banning: right? Yeah, sure. So what would a poll be?

483
01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.210
Sanjith Jacob Thomas: You are okay with the price.

484
01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:09.420
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What's that?

485
01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:19.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You are okay with the tires, for now you're you're okay with the tire? Sure. So what else might be going on with the car? What kind of other pool might, there exists with with a car

486
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:21.500
Pardo Walter: better performance.

487
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:33.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There we go. I like that. Better performance. What does better performance mean on a, on, on, on roads, with speed limits and and legality and and restrictions. What kind of performance are we talking about? Part of?

488
01:14:34.410 --> 01:14:36.830
Pardo Walter: There could be safety measures.

489
01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:49.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know. On the riskier roads, or depending on the sort of terrain that they're planning on traffic absolutely 100. So I'll give you an example. And this is, it'll it'll get dark for a second. But then it'll be okay.

490
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:55.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Last year, during one of my programs, right at the beginning, going into mentor madness. I was in a really bad car accident.

491
01:14:56.210 --> 01:14:58.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I was in an uber in the backseat.

492
01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:21.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I got t-boned, and I was. It was not good. It was not pretty. I had to pick glass out of my head. It was bleed. Had to go to hospital back. Anyway, I'm okay. Made it through it. Team supported me. We got it done. That being said literally like a week or 2 later, I made the mistake of taking another Uber. I think I was on a meeting with Liliana and another team member, and I was in a Tesla.

493
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:31.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and the Uber driver almost crashed into another car a week after me, getting a concussion, and like, I haven't got a hospital.

494
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.550
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But the technology auto stopped the car

495
01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it like before. He crashed the car like force stopped.

496
01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:44.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And I was like, I am taking Ubers and Tesla's forever now. I'm not riding in any other car

497
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:59.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because I didn't trust the person driving, but the technology enabled more like safety and assurance for me. So I say all that to say, my pull example, for y'all, II didn't even know I was gonna use that story. But here we are. Freestial. The pull is.

498
01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:03.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't need a new car. But that new Tesla.

499
01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:23.720
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hmm! I'm trying to get that Cybertrick. You know what I'm saying like. So there's a pull. There's like a desire to have a better status or a better version of yourself, or a better lifestyle that you want where you're not burdened by the the struggling moment. But you are excited about that future, you, or a better way of living that can enhance things.

500
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:36.170
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. So I heard a couple of you when you were guessing polls, you were saying things that may be put you away from the solution. So that direction of the arrows here is really important.

501
01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:51.009
Lilliana Robinson: So you can't see. I wish we had a whiteboard so you could see. But basically, the push is pushing you toward the new behavior, and the poll is pushing you toward the new behavior. It's just one is stronger than the other. The poll is much more about an attraction or an allure

502
01:16:51.010 --> 01:17:11.029
Lilliana Robinson: so like now we're saying the enticing nature of the safety of a Tesla. I always use Tesla as an example for the social ramifications. So a lot of people at the beginning got Tesla, not for any of its features, but because it was seen as elite, luxurious. You have made it. If you can buy a Tesla in the tech world things like that.

503
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:21.240
Lilliana Robinson: you have no main issue with your current car. Maybe nothing is even wrong with it, and you just want the Tesla for a much higher reason, much more about attraction.

504
01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:27.449
Lilliana Robinson: The push is, there's an actual problem that is hurting. So I always associate. Push with pain.

505
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:40.839
Lilliana Robinson: it says, make it better. Something is truly hurting or inhibiting you. That's the difference. But they're both moving you toward a new solution, and although on the regular push, is stronger than pull, sometimes pull can be extremely strong.

506
01:17:40.870 --> 01:18:04.490
Lilliana Robinson: A good example is a new iphones. A lot of us get new iphones without the old one being broken or made obsolete, and it's a lot more about the poll, and it is the push, and I mean they've made a huge business on that. So it's not always that push is stronger. The main thing I want you to understand is that they're both moving you toward the new solution. And the other 2 forces are moving you away from the new solution sticking to status quo.

507
01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:30.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's very well said, and it reminds me, Liliana, I would love for you to chime in more. Just so you all know the way Liliana and I have become very close as colleagues is. Through this through exactly what we're talking about right now. This is the first time she and I met is when I gave a version of this talk, and it was clear that it resonated with her. And this was like 5 years ago, and we've been applying this framework to help founders succeed ever since.

508
01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:32.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Brian.

509
01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:43.699
Brian | Circle+: So I'm just trying to make sure that I got what both you and Lilian are saying, is that especially on the pool side? Is it safe to say that there are spirational

510
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.889
Brian | Circle+: in nature?

511
01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:50.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yes, that's a great way to say you're aspiring for a better self.

512
01:18:51.040 --> 01:19:00.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So think about when you sign up for, like a gym membership or or you know, I'm thinking about

513
01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:08.189
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you know any anything where there's like a dream of being enhanced or life being better. And it's not necessarily coming from

514
01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:15.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: a major problem in your life, but just more of like a major upgrade that you're thinking of those upgrades that that's the pull force.

515
01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:20.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and there's usually a combination of them that are at play tune day. You had a question, but I don't know if you wanted to.

516
01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:24.960
Yeah, II kind of changed my mind. The question.

517
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:45.300
Tunde | Regfyl: But III guess I can ask it. And and I've I've read a lot of books around like entrepreneurship, and and I'm trying to not to conflate a lot of the concepts. And so with this push and pull analogy, what was coming to mind was, when you speak about painkillers and vitamins.

518
01:19:45.670 --> 01:20:04.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Okay, so yeah, I just wanted to know if it was kind of in the same. In this, we we could use the same, I guess, thought process to try to understand, push, and pull. This is the deep work I like this. You're doing it. So, to be clear, I will say that I will talk about

519
01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:09.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: vitamins, painkillers, and morphine, right? As levels of severity of the problem.

520
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:17.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's tangentially related to what we're talking about, but not precisely so. A vitamin is the thing that you're taking proactively to be better.

521
01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:26.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: A pain killer is something because you're reacting to an immediate pain like I have back pain. I need to go to Cbs and get some, you know, aspirin or something.

522
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: morphine is deep seeded, pain

523
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:33.459
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and need for relief.

524
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:41.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Each of you and your businesses today have respective pain levels of severity that you're addressing for your customer

525
01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:48.230
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the tried and true, like kind of reference there, with that analogy tune, day is

526
01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:55.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: by default. Ideally, you're trying to deal with the morphine level problem because by solving a morphine level problem.

527
01:20:56.390 --> 01:21:00.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: people are willing to go to much greater lengths to make progress.

528
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:06.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That isn't always true, or always the case. But in many cases, most cases, I would say.

529
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:16.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: trying to focus on the higher severity and the greater needs, even if it's a smaller sub group of potential customers, is a great starting place for most founders

530
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:30.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that isn't necessarily tracking directly to the push and pull analogy you're seeing here. The pull forces that we're talking about should very well be at the vitamin or Pain killer stage along with the pushes.

531
01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:35.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's a slight nuance to those 2 concepts that I would kind of create a separation.

532
01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:46.649
Lilliana Robinson: I can think of an example, Neil, like for B, twob, let's talk about a specific decision maker stakeholder, maybe a chief innovation officer for many of you selling tech solutions.

533
01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:58.050
Lilliana Robinson: The push would be so that decision maker messed up, and it like it's threatened that they may lose their jobs. So they want your solution to make their job better. And so they don't mess up again and keep their job

534
01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:22.710
Lilliana Robinson: a poll that is equally as strong would be. They want to move up, maybe their Vp. Of innovation right now. They wanna be chief innovation officer that poll can still be a pain killer or more team, depending on how deep the desire is. So their poll, and allure to be better, to achieve that promotion, to be the champion of their team, to bring in this new solution that streamlines their revenue and innovates the company

535
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:39.939
Lilliana Robinson: if they want that poll and it. The reason it's attractive is because they want to buy a new house for their family, or something like that. There's still not a push there. But the poll, I would say, is at that pain killer or even morphine level. But it's still an allure or an attraction, because they're not facing an immediate like pain in their job.

536
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:42.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think that's a good way to think about it

537
01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:44.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: now.

538
01:22:46.020 --> 01:23:03.380
Malc - Xsauce: and this is great. I'll I'll I'm loving. The back and forth is really good. I'm a I'm a qualitative researcher by by trainings. I'm love loving breaking it down. My only question is, is there need at this stage to quantify these trajectories? Right? Is there need to have a sense of of? Yeah, that relationship? I know you break it down, liana. But

539
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:27.759
Malc - Xsauce: just curious if we need to have numbers behind some of these relative to that morphine, I'm more simply thinking, even like a like or scale, right like are we are, we should be should. That'd be a part of the process of being able to help people understand the choices they have is right. There's there's plenty competitors, plenty of other options. I'll give it a little bit of context. We're in the Fintech space. So our kind of push and pull it's probably always a saving versus investing kind of binary right?

540
01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:32.909
Malc - Xsauce: And so for us, I'm just thinking, given other solutions, other investment options. How do we start to to?

541
01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.120
Malc - Xsauce: I'm gonna quantify some of that sensitivity.

542
01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:41.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's a great question. We can help you with that. Once we get to the research insights math gets involved.

543
01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:48.250
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Math gets involved at the later stages of having these insights, and how you process them, and what the clusters look like.

544
01:23:48.280 --> 01:24:08.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So for sure it does get quantitative, it starts off highly qualitative. Bob is still in the process of teaching me a lot of those quantitative techniques for how to actually like parse these insights further from a research standpoint, Mount. But yeah, for those of you that are trying to go full board. With this there will be room for for more of that, for sure.

545
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:10.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I love the cast.

546
01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:18.369
Valeria Brenner: Would it be okay if I offer some of my insights. So it's my I'm doing. My master's in market research. So it's all about qual and quant, and just like kind of breaking it down like

547
01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:40.189
Valeria Brenner: when typically performing any kind of like consultative aid for a business. What you first do is is the the qualitative part cause. It helps you narrow down that scope of who and what to ask, and the quantitative. Because when you get all those like hard data and numbers, you want them to be as like focused as possible, and qualitative is a great way of like getting it there. So I almost feel as like a funnel where, like

548
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:47.820
Valeria Brenner: I still do like qual and quant, but I always not always, but typically do qual first and then narrow it down to like what I want to ask about in quant

549
01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:53.410
Neal Sáles-Griffin: love it. Yeah, I'm I'm on the same page with both of you. I will offer a caveat, though

550
01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we cannot research our way to product market fit

551
01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:25.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you still have to execute. You still have to screw up. It's messy, it's unproven. That's the very nature of startups. You all are here, not because there's a formula that I can give you to be successful. You're here because there's a very painful, chaotic road to realize what kind of business you need to build in order to execute successful. So just know that we'll research our way through this, and we'll have insights and hints. But at the end of the day. What to expect from this isn't an answer.

552
01:25:25.690 --> 01:25:29.149
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's a series of of potential pathways to go down

553
01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:32.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to find the answer that you want. Matthew.

554
01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:37.290
Matthieu Bonnard: yeah. My question was, can we try to be both push and pull

555
01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:54.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and similar on the Fintech space, thinking, you know, the push could be saving money, and the pool is making more money. Can we try to be both, or I appreciate you asking? And it's interesting. I'm gonna offer up a reframe for you, because the context of this slide has nothing to do with us

556
01:25:55.330 --> 01:26:04.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and has everything to do with the person you're trying to help. So we're not even talking about, we. Yet we don't know what we want to be. We want to help them.

557
01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:16.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So if we understand what's driving them to make progress and success. We can orient ourselves to address the forces that are motivating them. To make progress has nothing to do with us yet.

558
01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:28.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I hope I'm not being too forward by saying it that way. But that is the point here is that it ain't about us yet. Just changing that language

559
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:34.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: will are assuming. This is the person you want to help Matthew, like once you tell me, I know I want to help them.

560
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:41.949
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Then we start with humility and we go. Okay, what do we need to become to actually help them make their progress? Not the other way around.

561
01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:42.920
Matthieu Bonnard: Got it.

562
01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:53.579
Lilliana Robinson: Now, if your question, Matthew is like, can someone be hiring us for both push and pull? The answer is, yes, people will have a diversity of reasons that they come to

563
01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.879
Lilliana Robinson: hire your product.

564
01:26:55.950 --> 01:27:11.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I can do the last 2 in the office. Okay, so now let's change gears for the last 2 forces. If you could go now let's change gears to what is keeping the customer at the current status quo. So business, as usual on the left side.

565
01:27:11.010 --> 01:27:31.150
Lilliana Robinson: the last 2 are forces that are against progress against them. Making that switch. We'll do habit first. That's traditionally the hardest one to understand out of the 4. But just think of it as the actual title, a habit. It's keeping someone in their current status quo. We are not creatures of change. Humans just like to stay with what they know

566
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:37.490
Lilliana Robinson: it's about comfort, it's about just accessibility. The greatest example that Neil and I always give is

567
01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:55.390
Lilliana Robinson: changing your operating system. So you're either usually a windows person or a Mac person. Sometimes you change when you're you're like super young and in school, but you're pretty much set in your professional career, and if you do change one of the things that is keeping you from making that change is the habit

568
01:27:55.390 --> 01:28:15.199
Lilliana Robinson: so apple in order to convert windows users have. They have to overcome their habit force. People are very used to the certain shortcuts. They have the certain way that things show up in their operating system, and you now have to make enough of an allure or a push on the top to overcome that negative force in people?

569
01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:31.350
Lilliana Robinson: Does that make sense on habit. Does anyone have any questions? Okay? And then anxiety much easier to understand. Anxiety is fear. So one of the main reasons we don't want to make changes outside of comfort, level and having to change is fear

570
01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.630
Lilliana Robinson: that can be

571
01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:36.870
Lilliana Robinson: mainly price. But I can think of a couple of others.

572
01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:46.849
Lilliana Robinson: Price is the biggest one that we see. So people have a problem. But the price barrier is enough to overcome even the pain of a push or the allure of a pull.

573
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:49.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How do I know if this will work

574
01:28:49.660 --> 01:29:15.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: right? I've been. I've been failed so many times. I've tried so many other solutions. Is this the one I I'm already. I'm already kind of like nervous about that. I'm unsure, so that that anxious energy that people carry that offers them a hesitation so like whenever a deal slows down. So some of you are doing B twob. Work right. And and you're trying to get a deal over the line. You've got an loi, you know you're talking terms, but you can't quite get the commitment.

575
01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:24.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There's likely going to be certain uncertainties or anxieties that the customer has on the other side that they're trying to navigate or deal with before they're ready to commit.

576
01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's so many different contexts where these forces come into play.

577
01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:35.859
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The push and the poor are much easier to discern and ascertain from the interview than the habits and anxieties. All are important.

578
01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they all feed in.

579
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:52.610
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, sorry, Neil. A great exercise is in my email to you guys, I asked you to review the mattress interview from Bob messed up. That is a key exercise to be able to understand this framework. So I don't know if we have time. Now, Neil, if you want to just

580
01:29:52.960 --> 01:30:06.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: go through the forces on that, or we can do it next time. But yeah, at the start of the next session we do cause. Then we'll give people time to think about it or revisit the interview if they didn't get a chance to re listen to it. But energy

581
01:30:06.810 --> 01:30:08.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at the end of the day is what we're looking for.

582
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:19.509
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Where there's high energy there is greater insight. So the last part of this equation and then we'll wrap up soon.

583
01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.400
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there's dimensions of understanding these forces.

584
01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They're social, functional, and emotional.

585
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:31.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So social is your interaction with others. And how they see you

586
01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:38.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: functional is, does it actually get the job done? Is it actually accomplishing what it sets out to? And emotional is how it makes you feel

587
01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:44.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so. Each of these layers to your energy

588
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:54.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: with respect to those forces are worth unpacking and understanding for each of your respective customers, because once you dial in what the implications are, different products

589
01:30:54.790 --> 01:31:02.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: have different levels of severity. For each of these dimensions some are pure function. some could be pure motion

590
01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:08.909
Neal Sáles-Griffin: most, if not all, have some variance of each of them. But keeping these

591
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:11.959
Neal Sáles-Griffin: dimensions of energy in mind

592
01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:23.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: as you do your interviews and understand your customers better, are going to allow you to have a level of creative, thoughtful nuance to your product, offering that most of your competitors do not have.

593
01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:40.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So whenever you realize that someone like some product that you buy something you paid money for. It's almost like they effortlessly understood what your needs were, and you were delighted at the experience because of how thoughtful and successful it was. It didn't even make you think, cause it was so easy.

594
01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:45.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like. Those are the kinds of experiences I like to sign up for.

595
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:50.749
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'm trying to think of a good example of a delightful customer experience, but

596
01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:55.070
and not to be too much of a fanboy. But if you ever walk into an apple store

597
01:31:55.380 --> 01:32:02.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: versus like a micro center or a circus city or a best buy. There's a difference in how it feels

598
01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:07.830
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and who greets you how you interact and and just how it feels to be in that room in that space

599
01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:17.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: makes you wanna buy on its own. So with that being said like, that's the level of understanding that you need to have about what those forces of progress are. Alright few final things.

600
01:32:17.970 --> 01:32:21.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: One demand side versus supply side.

601
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:28.039
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You're going to hear me say this a lot, because most of you will make this mistake at some point, as we talk and have our one on ones and conversations.

602
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:40.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The supply side thinking will be a total distraction to our early progress in this program. and what I mean by supply side. Thinking is, I'm not ragging on you, Matthew, but what Matthew said about we

603
01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:44.540
Neal Sáles-Griffin: need to do this or we become that, or what we will offer.

604
01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:47.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It ain't about you yet. so

605
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:55.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm going to remove solutions and supply side from our conversations early on, because until we understand who it is we're helping and what they need.

606
01:32:55.970 --> 01:33:01.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It makes no sense for us to talk about ourselves and what we offer. unless you already have customers.

607
01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:13.699
Neal Sáles-Griffin: If you have customers, then there's already a symbiotic relationship between demand and supply. And we're just looking to figure out how to enhance it further. So different situations. For you know, different companies.

608
01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:19.690
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but there's usually a bifurcation of these business units at companies

609
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:33.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at scale. You separate, you know, the the the customer support from the marketing and sales. So the best example and analogy I have of this is, if anyone has ever bought like a high end camera

610
01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:37.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: like if you've ever purchased like a canon or a nikon, or something like that?

611
01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:47.630
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Maybe some of the older folks in the room can relate more, but when you buy one of these products. There's a there's like usually a brochure, and there's branding and packaging to go with it that are

612
01:33:47.650 --> 01:33:58.840
Neal Sáles-Griffin: aesthetically beautiful. It's like really alluring. You're like so excited to have this new device. But what happens when you open the box? You get that manual. and it's

613
01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:00.360
Neal Sáles-Griffin: this thick.

614
01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:10.580
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And all of a sudden you have all of these little bitty, fine print and text to learn, and specs and instructions and tools, and all these things that become super overwhelming.

615
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:28.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's a case study in setting you up to buy, and then dropping you off the deep end afterwards. Once you're my customer, you've already made the purchase. You're not going to go back. You're not going to return it. I have you. Therefore I'll just. I'll just vomit instructions about how to handle this complicated product

616
01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:33.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: rather than continuing the thoughtfulness in that journey.

617
01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:41.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I think the best companies among us are the ones that keep the experience going. Even post purchase, where you're guiding the customer down.

618
01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:43.549
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Pathway to delight and success.

619
01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:45.670
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright

620
01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:58.179
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Speaking of business units and scaling those of you that want to still build those 1 billion dollar businesses, I hope, is everybody on this call. I hope you realize that everything we talked about with that timeline

621
01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:02.240
tracks to your companies at scale.

622
01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:05.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So when you have a hundred employees

623
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:10.519
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and you're managing, you know all of these different tools, and you're earning millions in revenue.

624
01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.380
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That customer journey is still true.

625
01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:22.309
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And the company systems that you have map to the timeline that we're trying to teach you at the basic level here

626
01:35:22.590 --> 01:35:27.870
Neal Sáles-Griffin: your marketing and sales systems and teams will be understanding

627
01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:32.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: both. The first thought, the passive and active looking phases of all the customers you're trying to appeal to.

628
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:38.180
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Who are those billboards in San Francisco speaking to as you drive around

629
01:35:39.190 --> 01:35:52.819
Neal Sáles-Griffin: when you think about the the large scale marketing and branding that happened, the ads, the commercials. The super bowl just passed, and those were a bunch of commercials. When you ask yourself, like, what are the teams of people doing the work to figure out what the message should say.

630
01:35:53.490 --> 01:35:59.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: how this should be rendered, how it should be visualized, how it should be offered, and then, last, but not least, customer success.

631
01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:05.710
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So just know that what we're teaching you might seem fairly accessible and even borderline rudimentary.

632
01:36:06.170 --> 01:36:10.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But at scale it becomes just as important and just as nuanced.

633
01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we're just trying to prime you all for that.

634
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:32.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I've alluded to having connections to the people who've taught us this framework and how we go about applying it. One really, really, special moment for me was when I had a chance to go to Harvard Business School to meet Clay Christensen himself along with Bob Mesta, who did the mattress interview. He and Clay

635
01:36:32.670 --> 01:36:44.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: together kind of co-created the jobs to be done. Framework in the 90 S. So I have one last story to share with you about the origin of that. But beforehand, clay, if you notice in the video is very tall.

636
01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:46.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think he's like 6 8.

637
01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:51.029
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He sadly, a few years ago passed away.

638
01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but he and I had a chance to meet before that. and he has this

639
01:36:56.430 --> 01:37:14.769
Neal Sáles-Griffin: humility exercise that he does with people sometimes when he takes photos where he gets down on one knee. And this is a mean play at Harvard. Spending that time together, having a conversation about how to apply jobs to be done in a political context which I'll share more about later in my story, when we're in Tahoe.

640
01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:19.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But this is the guy who's been doing the mattress interview for you. This is Bob messed up.

641
01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:21.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Bob is one of my best friends.

642
01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:24.140
I met Bob.

643
01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:31.629
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think, 11 years ago, at 37 signals, slash base camp in Chicago. At their office. He was teaching jobs to be done

644
01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.399
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to a group of people who had paid, I think, a thousand dollars to have a seat

645
01:37:36.490 --> 01:37:37.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to spend the day with him

646
01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:43.159
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there. People have to spend a lot more money now than they did back then to to meet with Bob.

647
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:55.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but I wanna tell you a quick story about him, and how he came to meet Clay, because Clay brings the academic side, and Bob brings the like the real practice. So. But before I do that I want you all to tell me

648
01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:57.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what these are.

649
01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:03.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: These are 2 candy bars. We know that. But what candy bars are they

650
01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.250
Felipe Acevedo - Goohaus: sneakers?

651
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:08.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Which one

652
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:23.219
Samarth Gupta: the bottom one? I think

653
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:32.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I don't. But I don't know. I've got an eye for such things, I guess. Alright cool, very nice. Okay? So here's the situation.

654
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:34.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Bob

655
01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:44.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is a very smart person. Okay. So he went to Michigan State. He went to Harvard. He's an engineer. He's from Detroit. So he does a lot of work with like

656
01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:48.479
Neal Sáles-Griffin: he's worked with over 3,000 products in his lifetime.

657
01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:56.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That being said early on, he was doing, I think both automobile industry and maybe some defense contracting work.

658
01:38:56.590 --> 01:38:58.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But a friend of his worked for Mars

659
01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:13.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Mars is the company that makes Milky Way and stickers, and they're based in New Jersey. So he flashed from Detroit to New Jersey. And his friend basically says, Hey, Bob, we need your help. We're trying to figure out, cause this is in the nineties. So you all might be surprised. But

660
01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Mars was struggling. and Snickers was on the chopping block

661
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:33.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because they were competing with Milky Way, and they were trying to make sense of these 2 products that they were offering and how they were sizing up with each other. So this is the state of the company. I

662
01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:43.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: hope that this works with the screen share, Liliana. If this doesn't, you let me know. Okay, I'm gonna try to play the state of the company with what they were where the business was at.

663
01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:45.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let's see if this works

664
01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.059
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is this working? No.

665
01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's just a frozen frame. Oh, man, alright! Let me see if I could fix this.

666
01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:59.480
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Let me see if I can fix this.

667
01:40:00.930 --> 01:40:02.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What about now. No.

668
01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:08.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, man, it's a commercial. So if you send me the link, I can pull it up.

669
01:40:08.210 --> 01:40:13.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, no, it's not. It's working now. It's working snickers. There you go.

670
01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:34.370
happy peanut! So over chocolate covered mountaintops, and water falls a caramel prancing Newgate in the meadow sings a song of satisfaction to

671
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:37.600
that's right.

672
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.780
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright.

673
01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:46.160
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So what what did we just see? Tell me what you all just saw like, who are we selling to? Who is this for? What's the message.

674
01:40:47.630 --> 01:40:52.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're on the advertising and marketing team. dropping millions of dollars on a commercial ad campaign

675
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:55.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: any thoughts.

676
01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:11.539
Malc - Xsauce: I mean, from quickly. First time seeing it. But obviously he's working in an office right? Looks like it's a pretty boring. He's the only one in there just looking at some of the context. So I feel like it's something about interrupting his day. The song, all that right. It's it's adding, injecting a bit of spontaneity, livelihood into that entire environment.

677
01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:22.430
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's a that's a impressive read. Yeah, III you're saying it better than I ever could. II don't know. Maybe. Yeah. Like, who who do you think the customer is like, what situation are they in?

678
01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:32.260
Malc - Xsauce: It's it's the mundane tedium of office work, right? So it could be anybody right? Make make things more interesting, right? Yeah, with the stickers.

679
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:34.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Samara, did you want to say something?

680
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:44.809
Samarth Gupta: No, just gonna say, it looks like he's, you know, in the middle of working might just want to snack like a quick, quick bite.

681
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:47.670
Matthieu Bonnard: maybe feels like an escape

682
01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:50.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: way to escape. All right. Alright.

683
01:41:50.690 --> 01:41:56.410
Art Fields - ClubReq: yeah. I was gonna say, the same thing, I mean in office setting, probably in a stressful environment. That's probably his way of like.

684
01:41:56.750 --> 01:42:01.059
Art Fields - ClubReq: you know, coping with that at the moment, like, I need to stress that. So

685
01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:03.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Kevin

686
01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:10.659
Kevin: Vickers gives you energy. You're in that office 2, 3 pm. In the afternoon. You get that afternoon lag

687
01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:14.900
Neal Sáles-Griffin: snickers and peanuts. It gives you the boost you got that from this ad.

688
01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:30.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I did actually cause he just it's an office setting. So it just looks boring. You take that that snickers bar, and it just kind of I mean, that's my interpretation. But I love this. No, I love this like cause, you know, it's funny because I

689
01:42:31.190 --> 01:42:35.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I have an inkling of what that might be informed by. But I'll get to that in a second, Christy.

690
01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:41.580
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: I don't know if I just imagine this, but II saw him

691
01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:44.910
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: experience joy once he kind of like

692
01:42:45.070 --> 01:43:07.830
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: when he heard you know the the guy singing, he appreciation for it. There was this join, you know, joyous moment again against the the boring, you know. Tedious day. And then he became kind of aspirational, like something I don't know he felt like he was. I saw him kind of dreaming of something, his current state.

693
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:12.579
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, so here's the funny thing. With this. This ad didn't work.

694
01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.679
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They experience no material change.

695
01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:20.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: no success, no real uptick. They continued to struggle.

696
01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:38.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and they were just kind of throwing things at the wall, trying to trying to do. I think what you all are trying to do. You're trying to make sense of what you saw, and you're kind of elaborating a little bit more. And I think some of that elaboration is informed, maybe from some other inputs and your familiarity with snickers. Now, that being said here Bob was with the puzzle

697
01:43:38.690 --> 01:43:44.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: still struggling. So he leaves New Jersey and goes back to Detroit, and he goes to the airport.

698
01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:52.659
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and he still got this puzzle on his mind like, Wait, Milky Way snickers bad ads, not growing sales. What do we do

699
01:43:54.610 --> 01:43:56.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: at the airport?

700
01:43:57.630 --> 01:44:00.759
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Past security? He sees a kiosk.

701
01:44:01.710 --> 01:44:08.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and lo and behold, he stands by the kiosk, and he observes a person buying the snickers.

702
01:44:09.690 --> 01:44:13.920
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Bob, as a kid, was given what's called the 3 Foot rule by his mom.

703
01:44:14.410 --> 01:44:17.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which means that if he's within 3 feet of someone he can talk to them.

704
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:27.259
Neal Sáles-Griffin: A strange rule, I know. But Bob proceeds to follow this snickers purchaser to their security gate

705
01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:32.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and sit near them. And first, he observes, and he watches this person

706
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:35.190
Neal Sáles-Griffin: open up their laptop. sit down.

707
01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:46.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: scarf down the snickers and start to work. He asks this person in language that they could understand. what job are you hiring the snickers to do?

708
01:44:47.730 --> 01:44:51.100
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The guy says, well. I've got this long flight.

709
01:44:51.370 --> 01:44:55.359
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I would love to get some shut-eye, so if I can get through my work right now

710
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:58.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and power through it. I think Kevin or someone said that

711
01:44:58.910 --> 01:45:04.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin:  then I'll be able to take a nap on the plane and I get my work done. Now.

712
01:45:05.370 --> 01:45:09.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: okay, that's cool. What do you think Bob did next?

713
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:16.140
Art Fields - ClubReq: Sorry to ask, what would you do or set of questions?

714
01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:19.350
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He went back to the kiosk

715
01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:24.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and he kept waiting. He started waiting. He was like, Okay, what do you think he's waiting for

716
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:28.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: somebody else to buy the snickers or a milky way?

717
01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:34.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Right? So he sits there and he waits. Someone else buys the snickers.

718
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:40.450
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and then he goes up to the guy working the kiosk. And he's like, Hey, like, do you sell these milky ways

719
01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:44.820
Neal Sáles-Griffin: much, and he's like, no, we sell way more snickers interesting.

720
01:45:45.490 --> 01:45:51.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So Bob's now trying to figure out where people are buying snickers versus where people are buying milky ways.

721
01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:56.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So he goes home. and the puzzle's still on his mind, cause he hasn't quite figured it out.

722
01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:59.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and he's talking to his wife.

723
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:07.650
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and he's like III got this puzzle, this New Jersey Mars Company like snickers, Milky Way thing, who the heck's buying milky ones.

724
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:13.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and his wife says. I have a milky way.

725
01:46:13.810 --> 01:46:24.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: She walks into the kitchen, grabs a stool, stands on it, reaches behind like a cabinet of the fridge, and pulls out a bowl where she pulls out her Milky Way.

726
01:46:26.370 --> 01:46:27.880
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Light bulb comes on.

727
01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:33.280
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Bob goes back to look at the data. It turns out

728
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:40.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that the hiring criteria for the Milky Way is dramatically different than the hiring criteria for the snickers.

729
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:50.610
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And when they actually did the market research after that light bulb they realize that the competitive set for the Milky Way was

730
01:46:51.190 --> 01:46:54.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: couldn't be more different than the people who were buying the snickers box.

731
01:46:54.850 --> 01:46:56.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The people buying the Milky Way

732
01:46:57.050 --> 01:47:06.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: consumed it from anywhere from 10 to 15 min. The consumption time for a snickers bar is 60 to 90 s.

733
01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:19.589
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so, to help you understand the contrast, Milky Way was more about a glass of red wine at the end of your day, or an evening run, or brownie, or ice cream, which is why they would put them in the freezer.

734
01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:31.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: whereas on the snicker side there was a functional piece of energy, a boost, red bull apples, coffee, fast food, functional needs

735
01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:34.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: was more about the hiring criteria for the snickers

736
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:51.299
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that came from that moment when he came home, and he saw his wife with that Milky way, and he decided to look at the data to realize that at least at the time, and this has clearly changed over time. But at the time far more women were purchasing Milky Way than men.

737
01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:55.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It was fascinating to look at the data and to see that.

738
01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:08.849
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so that, all being said, we don't give Bob all the credit. The company was smart and adept, and did a lot of cool things, but I'll show you where things landed which may come from a lot of the inferences you made from that first commercial.

739
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:11.710
What? Yeah.

740
01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:14.280
Applause.

741
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:29.380
What, Mike? What is your deal? Come on, man, you've been riding me all day you're playing like Betty White out there. That's not what your girlfriend says. Baby snickers

742
01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.010
better.

743
01:48:32.410 --> 01:48:33.840
I'm all

744
01:48:35.770 --> 01:48:40.550
that hurt. You're not you when you're hungry, snicker satisfies.

745
01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:43.980
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Hello! Do you all remember this?

746
01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:51.850
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So some of you do. So what ended up happening is this, you're not you and your hungry campaign emerge

747
01:48:52.090 --> 01:48:53.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: from these insights

748
01:48:53.850 --> 01:48:58.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and snickers went on to become the number one candy bar in the world.

749
01:48:59.770 --> 01:49:15.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So what ended up happening is is when you touch on the note of what the job is rather than just saying snicker satisfies, and I'm bored at work, and this is good. But instead, you put people in the actual situation where they would be struggling. And they can rel strikes a chord.

750
01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:25.439
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's the level of clarity that we're trying to get each of you all to during this program. With respect to who you're offering your product to, and how to present it to them.

751
01:49:26.010 --> 01:49:26.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

752
01:49:27.150 --> 01:49:42.320
Neal Sáles-Griffin: what does the candy bar have to do with your businesses. I know we're building tech startups. We're not building, you know, the candy bar business. There's a lot that comes with it, but very simply the language and processes and the domino effect that lead to the chain of events that undeniably cause the problem.

753
01:49:42.730 --> 01:49:51.750
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's what we're here to help you all figure out. So I share that snicker story and the Clay Mcdonald story because Snickers Mcdonald's jobs to be done.

754
01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:56.030
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Major corporations is where this framework came from.

755
01:49:56.650 --> 01:50:05.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The reason we extrapolated this framework. To apply to startups is because the goal for many of you is to get to the point where you are serving millions of customers all over the world.

756
01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.790
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and I want to give you all the context and the insights that exist at that level

757
01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: of prominence.

758
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:16.730
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and bring it to the earlier phase of how you build your companies.

759
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:17.860
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

760
01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:23.080
Neal Sáles-Griffin: few other tips, and I will wrap up with a few questions.

761
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:25.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: big hires and little hires.

762
01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:40.890
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Big hire language is when someone's committing or deciding to sign up for your product or service little higher, all the little things that they consume it. For along the way the best use case example I have for this is duct tape. You hire, duct, tape for one job. You need tape for a reason, and you use it.

763
01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:45.049
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You keep the duct, tape in your pantry, or in your closet, or somewhere in your house.

764
01:50:45.110 --> 01:50:48.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and whenever you need tape, you pull it out for another job. That's a little higher.

765
01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:59.879
Neal Sáles-Griffin: As far as my reasoning for using jobs to be done. It helps me distribute decision making better with my team. And because we're in alignment with the job. And we're always asking ourselves, are we in alignment with the job?

766
01:50:59.950 --> 01:51:04.300
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We optimize resources to focus on what matters most for the customer for success.

767
01:51:04.410 --> 01:51:16.640
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's inspiring to know that you're actually getting the right job done for your customers, and it allows you to more objectively track Kpis and know that you're assessing yourself over what you've determined to be most important to your customers.

768
01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:19.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So here's the process

769
01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:32.700
Neal Sáles-Griffin: frame the learning question. And when I say, frame the learning question, this is where everyone makes a mistake. They think I mean, what questions are you gonna ask in an interview. You shouldn't know what questions you're going to ask in an interview. There's no script.

770
01:51:32.770 --> 01:51:40.569
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll give you a few tips on ways to start the conversation. But there should be no script. The learning question is about what you want to learn from doing the interviews.

771
01:51:40.670 --> 01:51:42.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's the learning question.

772
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:48.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You screen recruits. That's your screening criteria exercise. You conduct your interviews, you do your debriefs where you track the forces and timeline.

773
01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:55.040
Neal Sáles-Griffin: then you do an analysis of pattern. This is where we come in to help.

774
01:51:55.230 --> 01:52:05.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: This is where most people struggle who study jobs to be done through Google, or, you know, by Youtube or through some online class or something. They don't do that part or do it well.

775
01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:17.119
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And we have done this for years. So we will help you analyze patterns from the insights you gained from your interviews to actually extract what you would need to know, to move forward for product development and for sales and marketing.

776
01:52:17.490 --> 01:52:31.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You detail the jobs to be done statements, and then you understand what to build and what to change about your business next. That's our process that we will guide you through in the coming weeks. The reason we do it now and not later. And the reason we don't make it optional

777
01:52:31.290 --> 01:52:38.310
Neal Sáles-Griffin: is because by the time you get to mentor madness we have very clearly learned that if you don't have this figured out.

778
01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:40.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: you are going to get eaten alive

779
01:52:41.090 --> 01:52:48.559
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because you're gonna waste so much time trying to explain to people what you think your business is about and who your customers are without actually understanding.

780
01:52:48.750 --> 01:52:56.210
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we're trying to set you up for success with investors we're going to introduce you to, and with lots of experts and people that you might even hire.

781
01:52:56.250 --> 01:53:00.620
Neal Sáles-Griffin: who are going to evaluate how well you actually know your business and what you're trying to get done with it.

782
01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:09.590
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Cool? I think that's a good time to end. I have more to cover. But I have more time, later case studies, examples, references, more to share about all that.

783
01:53:09.630 --> 01:53:12.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But, Liliana anything else before we conclude.

784
01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:34.859
Lilliana Robinson: Nope, just that this is going to be an immersive. So we have backed back, and we'll also jump into some more stuff for Jtb. Next week. So I know we threw a lot at you right now, but just know we're kind of going to be able to answer questions as we go, and you'll just get a lot more info each day. So just let it marinate tonight and review the mattress interview so we can go over that tomorrow.

785
01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:40.440
Neal Sáles-Griffin: and it's a lot of process to be clear, and it won't make sense until you apply it again yourself.

786
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:49.009
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's why we have multiple Revs on this. We had you do it during the application process. We're having you do it right now. And

787
01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:56.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: there are founders who are years out of my programs, who I still will do jobs to be done analysis with to this day.

788
01:53:57.300 --> 01:54:04.669
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I'll let you know that it never gets old, because, as you acquire more customers, you'll want to have a better understanding of who the new customers are.

789
01:54:08.370 --> 01:54:09.220
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Tune day.

790
01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:19.300
Tunde | Regfyl: It was just a quick question on the process. The first step is frame the learning questions. And I just asked, is there a reason why you didn't?

791
01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:24.739
Tunde | Regfyl: We're even as framed the learning outcomes, because that kind of seems what you explained it would be

792
01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:35.440
Tunde | Regfyl: is that a bit of a head fake to let people think about the questions, not from your perspective. Let you think about it from question as from not your perspective, but from perspective of the customer.

793
01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:47.069
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah. So there's a there's a I want to get the right quote. Maybe you can help me. Clay has a famous quote. Questions create spaces in the brain for answers to fall into.

794
01:54:47.730 --> 01:54:52.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It's all about questions first. So what questions are we trying to answer with this research that we're doing?

795
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:57.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's all. I think your framing of the outcome is equally valid.

796
01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:00.089
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I would say that they're 2 sides of the same coin.

797
01:55:01.810 --> 01:55:02.550
Tunde | Regfyl: Thank you.

798
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:08.319
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Any other questions or final comments.

799
01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.390
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, go, Tom.

800
01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:36.009
Dotan Shalev/Lexir: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Neil. Just a question about the scale of so, conducting the interviews, I became very aware of the fact that I was doing? 1, 2, 3, 4, but maybe if it at 1020, 30, 40, the answers and the path I've taken would have been different. So I'm wondering from your experience what sort of scale you think Le, in terms of sample will show to be effective.

801
01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:51.709
Neal Sáles-Griffin: 10. Yeah. If you do 10 with the right screening right here in the right context, you'll and you do them right in their quality interviews. 10 to 15 interviews is M. Pretty much I and I've been. I've been doing this for 10 years. Bob's been doing this for much longer than that.

802
01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.950
Neal Sáles-Griffin: You can get meaningful insights from

803
01:55:55.180 --> 01:56:00.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that number if you do it right? So that's also why I like it for a startup context.

804
01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:02.530
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because it's efficient.

805
01:56:03.090 --> 01:56:23.000
Neal Sáles-Griffin: We're not over researching the problem before we know what we need to know to run an experiment. We get insights, we make experiments and decisions, and we iterate from there. So I'll give you an example of a more prominent company, and I'll share more about them tomorrow when I do my next lecture on this but base camp. I did jobs to be done interviews with 37 singles and base camp.

806
01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:26.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: They were already serving millions of users and customers.

807
01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:37.130
Neal Sáles-Griffin: After 15 interviews the insights we got led to deep strategic decisions about the company and the product and the pricing

808
01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:39.970
Neal Sáles-Griffin: that had a fundamental impact on it going forward.

809
01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:45.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I've seen it happen at in the Big leagues and it works. So

810
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.739
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'll show you more cool. Thank you. Yeah.

811
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.070
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright. Let's get this once and for all. I wanna say your name properly. Merchia.

812
01:56:54.380 --> 01:57:12.100
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): Yeah, amazing. And I will not hold it against you if you do not. I don't expect this whole. This whole class is, gonna say your name properly by the end of the program, I promise you aware I'll make a T-shirt that, says H. Instead of E, or something.

813
01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:35.189
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): I have a very short question. We can answer it next time, if it's too long to answer. There is a difference between our current customers and who, we believe is our ideal customer in the future. Their ideal customer happens to be those performing musicians that are more successful than the ones that we work with right now, and they have a bit of a wall up because of their celebrity status. It's really difficult to interview. So I'm I'm

814
01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:44.009
Mircea Gogoncea (Cicada): worried about the discrepancy of interviewing the current customers to be done which are not maybe ideal, and I can't really reach the ideal ones at this stage in time.

815
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:58.270
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Alright I would love to help you with that. I don't have an answer right now on the cusp, but I love that. You spoke up about that because each of us have the ideal customer that we'd love to reach or talk to. That we can't quite get to yours is in a more extreme version of that

816
01:57:58.310 --> 01:58:00.520
Neal Sáles-Griffin: sounds like a worthy opponent. I'm down

817
01:58:00.530 --> 01:58:02.989
Neal Sáles-Griffin: so. I love ending on time.

818
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:13.810
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I will stick around happy to do it on core and answer more questions. But I wanna make sure that each of you all have meetings and things and priorities to attend to goal. Live your life.

819
01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:19.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: be well, be happy, live long and prosper. I'll see you tomorrow or Thursday or next week.

820
01:58:20.490 --> 01:58:21.909
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, see you tomorrow.
