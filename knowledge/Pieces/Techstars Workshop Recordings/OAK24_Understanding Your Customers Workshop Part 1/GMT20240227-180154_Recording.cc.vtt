WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Awesome. Alright, well. I think we have a quorum. We're at 42 and we are recording.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Okay.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, Lilianna, are there any logistics or important questions to address with the squad before we kick off our programming for today.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm not today. We got through pretty much all of the announcements yesterday, but as always, if there's anything, please reach out to our team.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Cool. Alright, great. So,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Okay.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is like, this is one of my favorite, times. During program where I get to lean in pretty hard and like kick things off with hopefully things that are helpful and given some of the comments that you all said yesterday about looking forward to jobs to be done.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here we are. It's game on. This is kind of my tried and true. Value add.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So with that, before I begin with like the goal of today is to essentially make sure that we're all in the same page with what it even is.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You all have already been through the paces of applying this framework actively on your companies. So I don't want to reinvent the wheel and I don't want to bore you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That being said, I think there's a few stories and perspectives about the origin of this framework and how it came to be that I'm connected to and familiar with that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
By and large, we found beneficial to share. So, there's a couple of things that we prepared.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
One we'll be sharing afterwards, which is a few testimonials from some of our alumni who've found a lot of success in applying the framework.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I think there's one video we might play for you all live. So you can kind of see and hear from at least one of them.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
One of the shorter ones, Leon, because a few I think were a little long and then, but before even that, I wanted to open up the floor, to see if, long.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And then, but before even that, I wanted to open up the floor, to see if anybody had.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Comments or questions. About jobs to be done. Anything that you wanted to clarify, anything that you want to know.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm pretty good at operating on the fly, meaning I have. Hundreds and hundreds of like anecdotes examples slides.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
References, links. So with all of those things, I can kind of customize what I share with you all today and over the next couple of days.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
To make sure it meets your needs for what exactly you all need support on with respect to demand side sales.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So given all of that, questions, comments about the framework, how it's worked for you so far, what you're looking forward to learning.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Vincent.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'd love to know about how this framework applies to what I've recently heard described as founder-led sales.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Yes, so when you say founder led sales, what's your understanding of what that term means?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Top salesperson. Yep.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So my understanding is pretty much what it sounds like. You basically, at you, when you reach Scale, you have a dedicated sales team, but before you have that, the best thing you can do is have your CEO step up and all into exactly talking direct.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
That's where it's understanding what their needs are. The YC, for my co-founder is build so many people want, but I don't know what the, is yet.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Yes. Well, so here's the thing build something people want, but how do you know what people want?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Yeah.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And I think when you said the YC way, which I have a lot of respect for, by the way, like we're actually supporters of YC in the sense that like spiritually like Let's go.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Yeah.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Let's all win. That's all make founder successful. The contrast that I provide from my perspective in program and I don't know if this is unique to tech stars or just me.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Is a lot of the times when you bring on very young, low cost individuals who are executing on a vision to build a startup.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They can afford to iterate and screw things up time and time and time again and there's no real downside.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:02.000
For those of you that are further along that have higher stakes, it may be more obligations, maybe there's a certain timetable that you need to make progress with your business and with the funds that you have.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It's really valuable. To do the work to get. Better shots on goal. So rather than kind of a scattered approach of let's iterate, let's build, let's iterate, let's build, let's see what works.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
There is actual work that you can do. To have a lot more certainty that the bet you make is more likely to actually tap into true demand.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I intuited this as a founder in my earlier years when I was young and I started a couple of tech companies when I was a teenager and in college.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
But then over time, I realized from a lot of really smart people who I'm gonna share some stories about today.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:55.000
That there are more, formulaic and framing oriented ways to go about understanding your customer and what they would be willing to pay you for.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Yeah, it's good.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Does that help Vincent? Okay, good. Brian.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Greetings everyone. I'm just curious. Especially in a Quote, like on context, like the framework, I'm a very big fan of the framework, but I'm also contextualizing it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:30.000
What happens it's in situations whereby the culture has a very big intention deduction cup you know so having a conversation with them in the interview and normally they're communicating their intentions but what they actually do is far removed from what they actually do.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
What they do as far move from what they do. Help me understand what you mean by that.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:42.000
You know, you know, I say we're going to the, so what they do is, state.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Ryan, I think you're sound cut out.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Yeah. You're mic cut.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
You have no idea what happened. But now we can hear you. Yeah.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But what they actually end up That's awesome. Oh, sorry. Oh, great.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Yeah, so it's basically saying what happens in communities where there's a high invention and actual gap, you know.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So basically when you have an interview with them, they're giving you their intentions. However, what they actually do is a little bit different.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Good question. That's a great question. I love that. That's an excellent question.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Thank you.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Alright, so I promise to address that and if I don't. You remind me at the end of this talk, but I will 100% address that question because that is Be secret.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:30.000
That is exactly what we're up to here. Which is like most people have customer interviews and I'll meet with founders right for deals and investments and whatever the 4 VCs I've worked at and so many of them go, well, we've done hundreds of customer interviews.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And I'm like, so what? What does that mean? What did we actually learn? What questions did you ask?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:47.000
What insights did you gain? So it's not about volume. First it's about quality reps and actually extracting the information insights you need and the short answer in spoiler alert, Brian is.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's not what they are saying. It is at first. You have to unpack the layers.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
That's what I've learned time and time again. So I'll get into the rest.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Ally, Ally? Is that how I say it? Oh, sorry, Lilian.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:13.000
That's really quick. That's huge. What Neil saying is huge because we have people that come in, not any of you, but we have people that come in, not any of you, but we have people for years that have people that come in, not any of you, but we have people for years that have applied to Techstars and told us when we give them the jobs to be done exercise that you all

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I already know. Yeah.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
did. They say, I don't need to do these 5 to 8 interviews. Yeah, here and they'll submit to us like here are 100 interviews I've done.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The quality is not there. So we still ask them to redo it and do it in this way because those 1012 interviews that you do in a jobs to be done session or round are worth so much more than any of those.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So it's kind of like a challenge to take away those preconceived notions that many of us have, especially if you're data driven.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And I'll get more into that in the lecture.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Yeah, and I guess so to reaffirm that point too. I love this conversation, by the way.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So thank you all for. Raising your hand, asking questions and getting things started. It makes it easier to get into the content side.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Once we get through this conversation. So, but the other thing that, you know, tends to come up a lot is, There's nothing special about this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Like we have packaging and labels for what we're teaching you, but this is accessible information, meaning a lot of people, you can read this online, you can find this stuff anywhere for the most part, but it's about applying it in a particular context and for your specific situation.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:21.000
That makes the value unique that we offer, to understanding this. Oh, Ally. Did I say that right?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Yeah, thank you. It goes along the same line. So my question was regarding, we are pre product so our product is not out there, is not accessible to, users.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And so doing the jobs to be done interviews, we had to focus on, you know, how people were using alternative products and sometimes alternative pros have absolutely nothing to do with us and maybe they are not even related to technology.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:09:01.000
So it was a little bit about like what's the best approach in those situations because you know, you're trying to go through the layers like you said and understand, you know, what draw they are decision and what they are really pursuing and then try to match that to our value prop.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But my question was, you know, in those situations where you cannot really ask them about how they've been using your products.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:26.000
They are in some cases they're telling you what they hypothesize is what they would do and that has you know just the limited value I guess so are there any other tools that we can use to complement jobs to be done or any specific approach that we need to take with the jobs to be done in interview in those cases.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Yeah, yeah, I would say there is a specific approach and we'll talk to you more about that one on one too as we do sessions with each company.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But the short answer is that when you're pre-product, One of the other techniques that you can utilize before you have customers actively using your platform to gain insights in the JTVD like fashion is by interviewing competing hires.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000
So whether that's a direct or indirect competitor, we can help you identify very thoughtful experiments to understand.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Someone hiring a different solution for the same job that you're trying to address. And then by going deeper to understand why they're spending money to make progress with those other tools or solutions.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:20.000
It will provide a lot of key insights about. What uniqueness you can bring to your product development process.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Thank you.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
To address that. We got you. All right, snow.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Alright. So I really enjoyed the jobs to be done interview, during the, the application process and It helped us a lot.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Surprisingly, after the after the accepted, we started charging our plug and we even have the plain customers but it was getting harder for me to hold the schedule so I mean I even reached out reached out to the the pain customers they don't yeah except the interview request.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
The answer to what would happen with the interview?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So I, it's, That's a they They didn't, didn't participate in an interview.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Oh. Yeah.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Understood.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Yeah.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
There's a few things there and there's a few layers of severity to address, right?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Even they are paying for our product, but it's getting harder for me to get the interview. So it's a little bit outside of the topic, but I wonder how I can get them better, interviewees and that's how I get often interview.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So on one hand, one way that I've always had success getting people to interview with me. Is by flattering.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You're saying, hey, thank you for being a user customer of our platform and product. And we want to find more people like you and to understand how to better serve you.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000
As a user and customer of our platform. So we want to have a conversation with you about what your needs are and how to find other great folks like yourself.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So there's a way to like frame that conversation, that invitation so that they're almost flatter to talk to you and they're willing to tell you more because they feel like they're making and they are a real difference on the direction of something that they've already signed up for.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So that's one. Another level of severity though is that you have a sensitive product, meaning like the context is more private.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
They may not want to talk to you for a variety of reasons. Could be healthcare related. It could be finance related.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So when you have situations like that. Or even tech related like with your business, run bear.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So when you have situations like that, it's helpful to provide some kind of incentive. So sometimes you can offer, you know, deeper utilization of the product in some way.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Or a longer term commitment or, you know, very frankly cash. You know, Amazon gift cards are the bees knees to a lot of interviewees with respect to jobs to be done.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:56.000
So there's a lot of ways to like ensure that you have people you can talk to. And then the last and final like crazy tier that I've helped more later stage founders with as of late is a turn.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Firing interviews. So the ones who leave, why do they leave? Do they want to talk to you?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000
How do you get them to talk to you? They're they're saying no to you. Do they need you anymore?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Do they even like you? Are they willing to have that conversation? So that's the ultimate tier of understanding like, all right, once they commit and they leave.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000
How do we actually get them to talk to us? So a lot of ways to go about all of that snow, but those are excellent questions and I love that you appreciated the framework.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Alright, Jeremy.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Thank you. Yeah.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Yeah, no, absolutely. I actually enjoyed how conducting the jobs to be done. Interviews allowed us to really ask those quick the 5 wise like really getting to the core of was driving this customer's decisions.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:41.000
We learned things that we didn't expect. A lot of our assumptions were, challenged.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Because we got insights into their lifestyles and into their true pains that they may have had and also, there was a time where we were able to steal down these, this research into these clear, distinct job statements.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
That really framed up who our customer was. And what they were trying to accomplish with various

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
There's much more than meets the eye, isn't there?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Absolutely.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah, love that. Antonio.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Alright, yeah, so like I said, we are pre product and We really enjoy like I said, that homework.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I think we learned a lot from those interviews I especially you know the journey and the diagram that to fill out it really forced us to understand the psychology.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
The customer in the Jordan they go through to to get to to the product. And I'm curious by the way to learn more about unpacking all these layers that you're talking about.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:49.000
One question I have is, And maybe we'll learn it throughout the program. If if there is a additional commitment that we can expect from the customers.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000
You know, before the final committee would be, would be You know, big, you know, give us their credit card to buy our products.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I wonder between the interview and, and get to that point if there is additional commitment that we can expect from the customer.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So from these test customers to to see their their willingness to to buy our product and get more certainty towards launch.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So I'm, I'm, I'm smirking because like one, it just feels good to be back in the field.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Like back doing the work and like working on jobs with a new class of companies and new problems. So just hear you ask that question just gets me excited to jam.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:40.000
My answer to you is A cautionary one. So here's a mistake that lots of founders make at the beginning of our tech search journey.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:51.000
They start doing these interviews and some of you have probably already done this over the application process. And they get excited about the people that they're talking to because they can tell.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
That there's room to either upsell. Or to convert into a customer if they aren't already.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I will caution you in that we do not want to. Disrupt the discovery work that we're doing on the demand side with the supply side thinking and desire for progress from a sales standpoint.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So it'll be a really sensitive like bifurcation of your energy to have these interviews and do these conversations in a way that doesn't get distracted by the progress you can make on your business and for the customer with what you have to offer.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:47.000
That comes later or at the end of the conversation. So, the answer. Though to your question is yes, of course there are ways to enhance the offer in the deal and the interaction you have with them, but my My, my ask of you is to wait either to the end or in a follow-up.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:58.000
After you have those conversations to make those additional. Offers to them. But yes, of course, it sweetens the deal because you understand them at a level that they never thought you could.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And once you get to that level of understanding and you know exactly what they need and you know that your product can actually deliver on that in a way that they had maybe either understood or you build a new feature to address the need that you discover in your conversation with them.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:24.000
It's such a delightful moment. It leads to so much customer loyalty and support and it essentially turns your early stage customers into your Salesforce because they start to promote you and they start to refer other people to you.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
So it's a really, really beautiful moment, but I would just caution you not to jump the gun on it.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Alright. Car squad. What's up?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Okay, so my question is, I wanna take a step back very quickly and rather than, entrusting the interview process itself.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Take a look at who you're entering in the first place. The thing for us is we've got 3 different types of users for a platform.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
With their own specific needs right and how do you pay prioritize who to interview would build for and your answer maybe okay we're just paying for the product but overstating the product might not have the most need out of front.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
So I want to figure out how to organize that. Okay.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Yep. Yeah, so it depends, right? So I would say whoever's paying for the product if our number one goal right now is to get our first customers because we have their revenue need, attraction need, a fundraising parameter.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
We have a deadline we need to make or whatever. That's not the case and if you have a little bit more time.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
My Alternative answer to what to prioritize as far as who to interview because there's different segments, you're right.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Is more about who can teach us the most about the problem we want to solve.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:50.000
So that is that is another way of framing. Like is it. User or customer of a competitive product.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
It may not be one of our new customers or our current customers because we're planning to change our strategic direction.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:05.000
We want to understand a new segment. Of demand. So there's all types of reasons for why you would interview certain subgroups of the people that you may want to serve as customers.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:19.000
So that is again a unique. Process where there's a lot of nuance and that nuance tends to get lost when people Kind of blanketly apply this framework in a way that is not as thoughtful as that.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So I love that you asked the question, your spot on. There's no clear objective right answer for who you should interview but the more specific you get with your screening criteria and your why the learning questions that you have of what you actually are doing the interviews for.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:39.000
In the first place, the learning questions that you have of what you actually are doing the interviews for in the first place, the more that will be informed properly.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
So I'll help you all with that.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Yeah, that's what we said. Take care.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Good. Christy.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:20:03.000
This is such a phenomenal work because, it kind of helps us like. Get deeper, empathize, with our customers and frankly, my co-founder Richelle, it's a much better person in doing this framework.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000
What I found just personally is it was a little bit embarrassing when they tell me what did they tell us.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:20.000
That they bought our product. Based on the strength of my relationship with them. It was a little bit personal.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:32.000
But over time, you know, we were able to kind of understand and get deeper to it. One thing that we would be helpful is do we have more examples or like in a B 2 B context?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Yeah

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Because I know that you, that would help us hone, our, you know, skill in doing this because it's such a phenomenal tool.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:47.000
I mean, it's I haven't seen anything like it and The way, we were able to unpack.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Why we're successful in developing this customer relationship. It's phenomenal. We wanna be able to do more of them.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Well, so you know, I will say one thing, Christy. You said you haven't seen anything like it and I'm we're flattered by that.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Hmm.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
That being said, I think all of you have seen something like this. Whenever in your life you've reached a point where You have a deeper understanding or clarity of why you purchased.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Something or why someone you care about purchase something? You realize that there was like a deeper wide than the one that was on the surface?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Whenever you got to that insight and you realized like there was more going on than what I initially understood. That's you knowing what this is about.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000
We're just adding language and like kind of parameters and like inputs to understanding how to go about that in a more systemic way.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000
But you all intuitively as human beings know how to understand the deeper underlying motivations and drivers for people's decisions.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
So, but to answer your other question with B 2 B, L, mentioned in the chat that we're putting together examples.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
That was one piece of feedback we got last time actually for a last program because we had a class of founders that were primarily B.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Yeah.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
So a lot of people initially think, oh, well. You know, and B 2 B, there's no individual. So you can't have interviews.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
I'm like, yeah, there's a decision maker. They're human beings who have needs.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
There's people who don't want to get fired, it's people who want to get promoted.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:26.000
There's people who want to look like they're the savior for their company. There's new executives that step in at the sea level that want to show that they're the hero of the new era for their business and they want to hire new cooled early stage tech companies with, you know, cheap enterprise contracts and deals that show that they're being innovative.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Yeah.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Right? So like there's all types of situations where there's human interests involved even in the B 2 B context that we can teach you all how to get closer to an unpack.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
So we'll give you all those examples and help you with that.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And. And just wanted to think, if there's any other coaching around. How we can do these interviews for our partners like our like our Almost like our sales channel partner.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Because maybe there's a little bit of nuance there too how we can make successful.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Okay. Sure, yeah, I love that. You're already thinking through how to help like your basically your partner succeed, the people who are leading to the progress for your customers.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
So I love that and happy to help. All right, Dan.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Yeah, hi. I have a questions about, a practical implementation of this framework in, in regards to the McKinsey customer journey model.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:34.000
So basically, what we did with this customer interview, we covered the, like part of the journey from like trigger to initial consideration set to, you know, active evaluation to the moment and purchase.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:56.000
But is there any way to implement this framework when you try to research on that. Post purchase and experience and loyalty loop you know so can we use this framework to go further than just moment of purchase.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Yes, you can. You can use this framework to go beyond the moment of purchase because the And I'll cover this the core part.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
That becomes important post purchase is customer success.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000
So are we actually doing the job that they hired us for? Are we getting it done? Are the new jobs they wanna hires for?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Are they gonna re hire us? So that I will if I don't address that Dan in what I'm going to share you let me know but that's something I plan to go much deeper on.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Thank you.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
It's a sniper question. David.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Yeah, I'd love to, I guess, learn a bit more about. How we identify what should be the core foundation of our value prop versus additional features.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
When it comes to talking to these people. And so we're pre product and still. Trying to hone in on what they were solving the right problem and as new problems come up.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
A lot of them are kind of clustered in different areas in different spaces. We really wanna make sure we're solving like.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
The core value prop, not necessarily building on additional features that may help a subset, but not necessarily everyone.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
So, hoping to learn more about that.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Well, yes, one quick comment on the last thing you said.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:21.000
We definitely don't want to help everyone right away. So you're still going to have to make trade-offs and focus on a subgroup to make disproportionately successful before you expand.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000
One of the trips that one of the things that trip up founders early on is like I know all you all want to serve millions of people.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I know you want to make millions of dollars. We all want that. But if we try to soon to spin a narrative that we have that figured out and we know who's gonna pay us all that money and who's gonna all those millions of people we're gonna come from, we're kind of fooling ourselves.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:52.000
So it was like a little bit of a trip question for me to ask each of you how you become a billion dollar company before I made the, you know, the final offer to have you all join because it's like the short answer is we don't know.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
You have a guess. You have a thought process for what you think will work and we'll help you with that.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
But yeah, David, I got you on that. That's not a problem. That's an excellent question.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Wow, that was awesome. We just took 20 min and burned through a dozen questions and I'm couldn't be more like happy about it.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:17.000
So, we have 2 quick founder stories that we want to share. We've never done this before.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000
So bear with us. Hopefully this is helpful for you all to hear from companies that literally just applied this framework and went through our program last.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000
And had real stories to share about what was beneficial and addressing skepticism going into it as well.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Is this a good use of my time? I'm here to fundraise. I just got into tech stars.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
How do I spend 120 K properly? I'm trying to sell. Why do you want me to slow down and like talk to people instead?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:44.000
So hopefully they address some of that. So Indy is the CEO of Perform View.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:27:03.000
They have been so steadfast at iterating on their progress throughout our program experience. However, Their business scares me.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Indies approach to providing art. To directly compete with Netflix as they tend to say in their tagline on the website.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Is still something that remains to be seen to me as like we can succeed with that branding and strategy.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000
However, The amount of traction interest and fundraising progress that's already been made since demo day for Indy has been impressive.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Now, G and I are actively advising in D on, you know, price round versus for, node and all these other cool details.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000
So that all being said, here is a perspective from Indy and then we'll follow up with another founder.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
And like, Ferno Sophie, and Nashi, can you put the performed view link in the chat.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And so people can see it. So we're giving a B to C example first and then we have a B 2 B.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:01.000
But they filmed a video just for you. So let's see. Could you hear that?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I think the sound may not be shared.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Okay, let's try it.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000
You're gonna play them like 1.2.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Hey guys, Independent is here, founder and CEO of Perform View. Form view was just in tech stars last Oakland cohort so was in there with the team having a lot of fun really excited for everything that's ahead of you here but the team asked me to do a little bit of a summary on the value I found from the jobs to be done process.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I think to be transparent when I first went into it, I, as many of you may be sitting there thinking, I've done a lot of customer interviews before.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Why do I need to do more? Now in this entirely new format. I feel like I've got a grip on everything and I'm just trying to build and grow.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.000
But I was encouraged to turn my focus into the process and it was ended up being such a valuable experience.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
So for us the main learning outcome or learning objective was why do people sign up to our platform? So, it's like Netflix for video art essentially.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:15.000
So why do people sign up? What are they doing about it and how can we use that insight, what are they doing about it and how can we use that insight, the learnings we got from that, the learnings we got from that, to then bring more people into the platform as customers.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:29.000
It was a pretty awesome experience, I think. We only got a handful of interviews with focused on interviewing our actual customers and learning about backstory towards how they found us, what made them make that purchase, what was the emotion behind their engagement with our product.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:56.000
And what we ended up finding is a lot more emotional reasons for the purchase itself. We had no idea towards it and we then took all of that insight and reflected on our landing page which is our main source of first or second step in the funnel alongside our social messaging, our social media strategy, and we completely redid it based on those insights based on the motive feedback we got from those customer interviews and as a result we actually after redesigning it

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:08.000
wasn't really a design change more so a messaging and language change. We saw our landing page to sign up page conversion rate go from 4% to 36% between November and December.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
So that's like a 32% jump up and it's been sustained at that point ever since.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And I'm a hundred percent certain it's because we have a better understanding of what that mode of trigger in our customers when they go to that sign up page, sorry, that landing page is going to be.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
So we're hitting it on the spot before they have to think for themselves and that's helping us make the sale.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:39.000
So I think I'd really encourage everyone to just go into the JTV process with an open mind, try and work out what that pinpoint is and just be critical on yourself around how much am I actually interpreting facts versus using using emotional insights.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Behind the purchase to make my decisions on how I bring people in or how I structure my sales cool. So I have to answer any questions directly if anyone wants to reach out to me.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000
The team can link you up. But if not, good luck to you.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Great. And then we'll follow up right now, with Nala. Imena does work on the BDB side to help larger organizations.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
I would like to think of as, work on the BDB side to help, larger organizations.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:15.000
I would like to think companies like tech stars get better insights about how to, retain their talent and support their employees.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
So let's get him in his

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Yeah, I think. Yeah, give me 1 s.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
This can.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
But we can also pop in these,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Email in the chat.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Yeah, I think I think I'm gonna need you to share it. I can't get out of

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Alright, I got you. I can get this done.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Here we go.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Please hold.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Chair.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Sure sound.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
And I was just putting out 1.2 5.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Alright, let me know if this works.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Yep.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:29.000
So hi everyone, this is Himena from Nala. I would say there are 3 things that like very specific that I got from doing jobs to be done.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:40.000
The first thing was we were able to really identify the true value our customers had with Nella. And because of that, we actually increased our prices by 25%.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000
And every single company that's part of our desired target, they not only said yes but they renew for the whole, 2,024.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000
So we would have never been able to do that if we hadn't had absolute certainty that they just loved our product.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:06.000
The second thing is that it helped us. Improve our marketing and sales effort. So as a startup, I'm the founder that's doing founder let's sell so anything from marketing like our website LinkedIn or the sales it's basically me.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:17.000
So really understanding what to say in any marketing initiative. Like focusing on what are the struggling moments, what are the benefits that Nala provides for companies that use us.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And then focusing on the sales process in explaining how NADA works. Really tackling those. Potential frictions or fears or things that we know we needed our clients to feel safe in order for them to make progress.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
And last but not least. I would say it also helped us to make decision in terms of a roadmap.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Because in our case we really discovered that what they truly truly value and what was unique about Nana was how we were getting actionable data in order for them to make decisions around talent management.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000
So it was not necessarily other things we thought they were looking that we needed to add in a roadmap because our competitors had.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
It was this very specific thing that we were doing very well. That was what called their attention in the first place.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:08.000
That's how they got the CFO to say yes to the budget that was required. And that was, and they were looking for that because that was going to help them with the pain they were going, like the struggling moment.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
And then finally, like whenever I'm selling right now, and again, I own B 2 B enterprise, so it's a little different for B to C.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Whenever I have like a first like a discovery call, thanks to jobs to be done, I have a completely clear understanding on where in the progress journey they're in.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000
So I know what it is that I need to give them in order to help them make progress in their own state instead of me treating every single lead.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000
At the same time at the same piece, giving them exactly the same process. So it sounds like more work, but it's not.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:50.000
It's made us more efficient and effective and provided a lot of clarity on different decisions we're making on a daily basis.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Alright, so you've heard from our founders. I'm ready to jam.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:04.000
I'm ready to get into my, talk. But I will preface it with one final thing, which is you can interrupt.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:13.000
You can drop questions if they're relevant to address in the moment I will otherwise. Do your best to drop them in so that we can go through and make sure we address them all.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:22.000
I might go I would love to cover more ground so that we have more time to do real practice in the next couple sessions we have after this.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
So if I can get through as much of this content as possible now, great, because then we can get real.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
And I can demonstrate examples, do live interviews with you. I'll show you what that looks like and maybe even use some of you all in the room as test subjects for the techniques.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:42.000
So that's always fun. Alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and jump in.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
And Lilian, I think you wanted to say something about our credentials and teaching this framework.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Oh, just that it's really, I find it really helpful to understand that this is something that we also teach kind of at the same time as teaching at Techstars to undergraduates and business students at Northwestern.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So we kind of changed the lecture a little bit to be more clickable to you guys who are actively working on businesses and have been for some time.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
But it's the same content. So if you can kind of put yourself in a student context for this, I think it makes it a lot easier to understand.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Almost like a class because Neil and I are you know, essentially teachers even though we work here at Text, and we're also investors.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
That's it.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Great. Let's see. Said by screen sharing was paused.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Let me do this.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
I'm gonna start that and then I'm going to

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Yeah, just very small.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Let me fix it.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
1 s.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
One more try. Sorry about that.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:04.000
When I do presentation, I needed to share the whole screen.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Is that working?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
It's still the same size, but everyone can go to view options and make it bigger if you'd like.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
In your own personal.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Weird. It says my screen sharing is pause and I'm not sure why.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
I'm sorry about that.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
It doesn't make a difference, does it? Hmm. Okay.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
We can go with this small. Everyone who wants it bigger can.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
I'll just do it like this. Can I do it like this? And is this okay? Okay, I'll I'll do it this way.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Yeah.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Alright, so go explain JTPD and dig deeper into why people buy. You get that.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Like I said, you can interrupt me. So I wanted to share a few quotes because you all are gonna go through inter Madness.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And as you know, with Minter Madness, you're gonna meet a lot of people who have a lot of perspectives on your business and a lot of founders tend to come out of that quite raw.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:15.000
So here are the most consistent. Statements that we get from every mentor madness roundup of feedback that we receive.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
You storytelling of current customers experiences to help sell the product. This is feedback to us about our founders.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Sorry, giving me stories about the customers. Don't chase your customers, understand your customers. Focus less on sales until you know your customers.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Stop building our technology, focus on the business. Something in the company is technology, start thinking about it as a problem you're solving to obsess with product.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Hit the brakes on tech dev. Sharpen the story. They screen jost to be done.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
So it got to the point where people realize like what we're teaching and where the founders are at and what they need to do.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
So, so you all know when I first started at Techstars. I wasn't teaching this framework as overtly as I am for you.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Right now, nor was I incorporating it into the application process. I was doing what I saw everyone else doing at tech stars and everywhere else.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:07.000
I was interviewing the founders asking them tough questions, deciding if I like their business and if I like them and then investing.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Instead, I realized that the people who I helped the most Are the people who resonate? With this framework as being a way to better understand the people that you want to help.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
If you think that you can build tech and just figure out who you're building it for. That can work.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
I'm just not good at teaching you how to do that. I'm good at this. So.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:36.000
There's a few examples of companies I like to highlight that have seen a disproportionate amount of success over the past 4 years.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And there's 2 kind of contrasting examples that I love sharing. One is real crafter. You may meet these cofounders at some point, but Sam and Sarah are co-founders of this company.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Sam was a composer himself for the video game nerds in the world. He was the composer for the original score of the game Mass Effect.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
So that is one of the most epic sci-fi video game franchises of all time.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
So I totally fanoid out as a gamer. But Sam's a really humble founder.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:08.000
He's the first one of the first companies I ever invested in. And he's thriving with this business in a way that's a little different than what you would expect.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:16.000
They came into my program at like, 4 K MRR. They have like a monthly product that, you know, a lot of musicians sign up to use.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:23.000
They've over the past 4 years stumbled into like, I think, 35 K almost 40 K.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
And we still are struggling to pinpoint how they've consistently grown their. Sales so slowly over time.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:44.000
There, you know, they've had contacts from Spotify and they work with the, you know, Berkeley School of Music and other university partnerships and, you know, music company, tech companies that are exploring working with them, but they haven't quite decided to turn on the venture spigot quite yet.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000
And raise capital. So there in one end of the spectrum for me as an outcome. The other end.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Nutrients. So they were also in the first class. So, Liliana, Sophie and others on the call know them well.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
They actually now come back and do workshops for us for our programs and help our founders so you'll meet the one or 2 of the co founders of this company at some point.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Let me tell you a little bit about them. So nutrients came into tech stars pretty much almost prerevenue.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Almost pre product and they provide continuous glucose monitors to help people better understand their blood glucose and health when it comes to all of their daily and bodily activities.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I think by the end of program. They reached like, 20 K MRR.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:44.000
And confidentially, I know this is being recorded, but please keep it in the family. I think they're their monthly recurring revenue right now is around, is it like 3 million?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
It's 4 million.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
It's 4. Yeah, 4. So they make like 4 million a month. Right now.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Yeah.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
And, they just raised their They raise their Series A and I think they'll be raising their series B. They're doing quite well.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:01.000
It's one of the shining examples I have of a company that I've seen final on a success.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
We didn't have as much to do it as you would think. When they were in program, they were so focused on sales.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
It was hard to get them to focus on a lot of the things that we're talking about here.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
But They ended up realizing the benefit of this jobs to be done framework post program. And ended up hiring.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Some of the experts I'm going to introduce you to like the gentleman who did the mattress interview, Bob Mesta.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000
To actually actively work on them, you know, on a consulting project for their company to help them figure out the demand side.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:40.000
When they plateaued. With their sales and hit ceilings and walls with respect to growth. But they kept going and now they come back and talk about both that and how they fundraise and how they do a bunch of other cool stuff.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:48.000
So all that being said, couple of great examples of founders that I've directly invested in who I know well and personally who we taught this framework to have found success.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:43:02.000
So, that's the why. And lastly here, don't fret if when I speed up right now with the story I will tell and the framework I introduce you all to again.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:11.000
We have this templated out very, very thoughtfully step by step. So you will be able to follow what we're gonna cover quickly here.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
It whatever pace you see fit. Once we we finished going through it. So we have all of those recipes and formulas built out for you.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:25.000
To know exactly what steps to take to do this properly. This list that you're looking at.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
I don't believe exists online. Like I don't think you can Google to find, you know, this like these steps in this way.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:38.000
So I'm glad it exists and I'm looking forward to one day maybe making something a little bit more publicly available.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000
I'm in talks with Bob Mester for example and writing a book about how to apply jobs to be done more directly to startups.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
So we'll see how that goes. Alright, now let's get to the fun part. Actually doing the work.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:59.000
So defining the problem, this is the question I get a lot as as an investor. And I interrupt people because they always try to tell me about their solution.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And I stop them and I say, hey, tell me a story that exemplifies the problem yourself because you're talking to me about what features your business has and that's irrelevant.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Before I actually know who were who were here to help. So whether you're seeking investors. New customers trying to figure out what to build.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:24.000
And your product next. Understanding the progress of your users and customers and what their desired outcomes are is the most important thing.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:34.000
So we could all nod our heads and all agree because this is all like easy things to say. But the more time has gone on, the more true these words have become for me.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000
And I hope that becomes the same for you. So the basic premise of jobs to be done, which you all know, is people don't buy products or services.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:53.000
They hire them to help them make progress in their life. So the age old analogy. The one that came from when this framework first came about in the early nineties.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Is that people don't want to buy a quarter and what do they want?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Feel free to unmute. Speak up.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
They want a whole

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Okay.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
I want the whole! Yeah, but now Jeremy, let's keep it going. Stay off mute.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
What did they want the whole for?

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Good question.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
They want to hang a photo.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Yeah, that's exactly right. So I wanted to hang a photo because I was a totally strange human being and decided to teach myself programming and software engineering and computer science.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:31.000
After graduating. And when I did that, I went mad and put like hundreds of posters all over my house.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:39.000
To motivate me to do the one of the hardest things. So I had these motivational posters on the wall with my drill in my hole.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:50.000
But why do you think I put those motivational posters up?

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Perhaps reminder to yourself, right? Or your commitment?

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Yeah, yeah, I was trying to be focused. I was trying to get Shit done. Now that being said, y'all.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:14.000
At some point you have to call it. Because if you ask why too many times. You get to an existential crisis and you start questioning the nature of the universe. Why am I here?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
What is the point of anything? Does anything matter? The sun is going to explode. I understand.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
So I say all that to say the quarter and drill to the quarter inch hole. The quarter intoll to hang a picture.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:34.000
The picture to be motivated to learn programming. The list goes on and on. But there are layers to understanding the depth of someone's underlying motivation.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:41.000
So with that being said, has anyone ever heard of the 5 why's this is like a standard like business?

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Kind of tool? 5 W. If you ask why once. You'll learn something, but you won't learn what's really going on.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:57.000
If you ask why 5 times, you'll get a lot closer to the truth. Why is actually a far less effective question in the context of jobs?

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Then when. And I'll tell you more about why later. But just keep that in mind. So progress is someone's trying to make.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:14.000
There's someone, they are in a place. There's this is one of your customers. Whether they're B to B or B to C, they're one of your customers.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:20.000
And they're trying to get somewhere that they're not. And that's why they would spend money to hire you to help them.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000
So how do we make sense of that? Well, struggling moment that they're facing and a desire to be somewhere that they're not.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:38.000
They're trying to figure out in that circumstance. What progress they need to make to do so. And we have to humble ourselves as founders that have products and solutions.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:47.000
And remind ourselves that we are very simply trying to help them get across as a bridge. So a job.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Is just understanding the why, the causality underneath that explains the choice as someone needs to make to make that progress.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:00.000
And you're gonna hear me say progress. Probably too much. Like you're gonna get tired of hearing Neil say progress.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.000
What progress are we trying to make when we start a meeting? What does progress look like here? What does success look like here?

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:15.000
You'll decide if, if you vibe with that language or not, but I just, I can't stop using those words because of the depth of their meaning for us.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:23.000
So that bridge, that capability, that's you. That's your entire business. So hopefully this is a very humbling moment for all of us.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
We aren't the greatest thing in the most important things in the world. We have to make sure our customers feel like.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.000
They have the most important thing in the world to us and how we are going to serve. So just remember that we are the bridge to the customers progress.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:48.000
And to the extent that we can embody that and how we operate. You will develop a lot of customer loyalty and better understanding of how to serve.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:56.000
So the circumstance language is deliberate as well. So. A job can only be defined and a new solution developer devised.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Relative to the specific context in which it arises. So this is a bunch of fancy way, like language around.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Saying that you start off building things for a very bespoke, unique group of people. And over time, you will iterate and learn what becomes.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Mass appealing. But in the beginning and the early stages for most, if not all of you. You're not at a stage now where you're trying to figure out mass appeal.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:31.000
So we shouldn't be spending our tech stars money on running ad campaigns until we have it dialed in and we actually know how to properly spend money.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:39.000
To acquire the customers that we truly want to search. Many of you are likely getting ahead of yourselves right now with how you're spending your dollars.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:47.000
To have other people sell on your behalf or other tools and systems selling your behalf without having a better grasp of who you should be selling to in the first place.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:57.000
So, symptoms, problems and causes. So a lot of folks tend to react. To the symptoms of a customer's problem.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Without understanding the underlying root causes and this framework is meant to help you understand that. So you all watch this video, correct?

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
The milkshake video with Clay? Yes, I'm seeing all the head nods.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Love that. One of the most fascinating things about that fast food chain he was talking about with the milkshakes.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Does anybody know? What franchise he was doing business with to help invent this framework in that story.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Anybody want to guess?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Was it Chick-fil-A?

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Yeah, we got it in the chat.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Sorry for Valeria, would you say?

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
I was gonna say, wasn't Chick-fil-A or McDonalds?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
There's McDonald's.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:41.000
It was McDonald's. Those McDonald's. So half of all milkshakes are being purchased before 8 o'clock in the morning.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:52.000
And they didn't know why. That blew my mind when I first saw this video. And the fact that And there it's 4 min long or 5 min long.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Be the nuance in how Professor Christensen talks about their approach is so dense. I'm telling you, if you go back and watch it.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:13.000
He'll say things like, in language that they could understand. We asked. Or we would go and confront these people and the drive through and talk to them.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:19.000
So he kind of casually tells a story about how he spoke to people about why they were buying milkshakes and figured it out.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:35.000
The level of. Of. Expertise required to be such an effective interviewer where you do a few dozen interviews at a McDonald's and you're able to unpack something that the company itself couldn't figure out what the data that they had access to.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:45.000
That was so impressive to me. And it was an early hint that I was. Onto something by wanting to learn more about how to go about understanding customers more effectively with this technique.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:52.000
So you all may know Clay. Not from jobs to be done. But from coining the term.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Disruptive. So whenever people talk about disrupt. And how it's like cliche or, you know, the Silicon Valley thing or we're disrupting this or you're being disruptive.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.000
He literally coined the term in the business context by writing this book called The Innovators to Lim.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
I believe it was in the eighties when you first started writing it and maybe it came out in the ninetys, eighties, something like that.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:20.000
But it's a classic business book. And I couldn't recommend it more for the true.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Deep old school business nerds in the room. So for any of you that really want to understand like the origins of like the emergence of technical innovation in America, especially in the eightys and ninetys.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:44.000
There are so many great case studies here where he talks about how competing startups would go head on with IBM and other, there's so many great case studies here where he talks about how competing startups would go head on with IBM and other, you know and the different forms of innovation that exist.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000
So when people say they're being innovative, I usually go, what do you mean? What does that actually mean?

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Because do you understand the concept of innovation and how it's applied and then what the contexts are because disruptive innovation is different than market-creating innovation, which is different than sustainable innovations.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.000
And there's different phases to understand that as you grow your business. I would encourage you all to learn more about.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:12.000
So the other book though that Lilyanna loves, I know because she was a student in my class and now she teaches it with me.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.000
But I don't have people read this book anymore because it's Usually 2 dents and there's there's too much to unpack for a lot of folks and there's a lot of academic rigor associated with it.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:30.000
But the books call competing against luck. It's named that for a very, very important and deliberate reason.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:38.000
But the notion here is that a lot of the times many of you all with your businesses so far likely shrugged your shoulders at 1 point and you didn't know why.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000
A customer behaved a certain way. Or you use your intuition to figure out what to build or who your customer was.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Or you made an inference from a conversation you had with the customer about what they meant.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.000
If you were right in making any of those assumptions, a lot of the times many of us would attribute that.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000
To this thing we call luck. So the labeling of this book is really about like No, there's a way to actually know.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
You don't just have to be lucky with your insights and with your realizations about how this works.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:20.000
We can teach you and go about a way. To literally create opportunities for those insights to happen. So, Lilian, if you want to say anything more about this book.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Yeah, it's true that we don't have the undergrads read it anymore, but there's one exception, which is our MBA students at Kellogg.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Oh yeah, Kellogg, yeah.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:35.000
So if you yourself feel that you are very much interested in case studies kind of a more traditional academic way of understanding jobs to be done.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:55.000
There are a lot of enterprise. Examples here, so a lot of people who are B to B really benefit, but even if you're not, if that's how your brain works and you would benefit from that, I highly, highly recommend purchasing it because it goes along with everything that we're talking about here.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000
But in a much broader, like scheme. The way that Neil and I teach it is very unique.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:11.000
In that we are applying it to startups. So a lot of people don't know this because it is widely applied to startups now, but it just started out as an enterprise.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Consultant solution. This is a very new. Maybe like one decade old venture into applying jobs to be done into startups and Neil has been at the head of that along with Bob Best of who he's going to talk about.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Who served your friend?

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000
And this is a great moment to check in really quickly and say something that. I think needs to be said.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:37.000
One of my colleagues, Matt Kosov, managing director in LA. He and I talk a lot.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
I look up to him. Managing director in LA. He and I talk a lot. I look up to him.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000
I've learned a lot from him as an MD. He starts off his program by telling his founders.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Techstars isn't school. We're here to do business and build businesses and get things done.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.000
I'm not here to lecture at you and have you do homework and things like that. And Tony, I've heard you refer to this work as homework.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:00.000
I know a lot of people refer to it as homework. I want you all to know. This if you see it as homework.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:10.000
All of, however, what you should see this as. As a better way to understand the people who are going to be funding your future progress as your customers.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.000
And if you don't see that value and this feels more like you're in school. I apologize for that.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Let me know ways that I can reframe it. But what we do in the university context is fundamentally different than what we're doing at Texas.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
I'm telling you. Like it's different to sit in a classroom, learn this stuff and think theoretically about how to apply it.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
It's a completely different piece to learn a literal framework, apply it and make more money because of it.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:42.000
And increase your prices and see that reflected your financial model and actually raise venture capital because of these new insights that you have.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:48.000
That's real. And that's what those are the results that we expect and can facilitate here.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:57.000
So I'll say that to say. I'm playing to my strengths and that I do know how to teach certain things in ways that allow founders to have new skills.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:06.000
I'm not only going to help you grow your business, but I'm also going to empower you all with very powerful tools and frameworks that will help you all scale your businesses over time.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:13.000
So that's my view on programming and content in a tech stars context. But I just thought you all should hear that from me.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Cool. Alright, so now we're getting to I think we're Dan was asking me about where what happens?

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:26.000
After the purchase. So you all earn this timeline, you all filled this out, but how well do we understand it?

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:37.000
So strangely enough, most of the time people are doing their customer interviews around this phase right here. The buying and the deciding.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:47.000
This is where most people when they do customer interviews are getting insights. We're here to tell you that there's so many other things that happen leading up to that moment.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:53.000
That you didn't initially imagine. And I know you all know this because you listen to the mattress interview at least once if not multiple times.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:12.000
So beyond the mattress interview, there's plenty of B 2 B examples as well of the same journey of those struggling moments where there's going to be a multitude of events that go from a first thought to active from passive to active looking and then fully making a decision and going back through this cycle over and over again.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:18.000
So we'll help each of you all model this out for your respective businesses. Also, the forces diagram.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:26.000
So between the timeline and this forces, these are your 2 main tools. If there's only 2 things that you all take away.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:33.000
From all this talking at you that I'm doing right now. It's these 2 slides. It's the timeline and the forces.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Everything stems from these 2 resources with respect to what we're trying to help you understand. So if we understand progress over time, when I'm doing a job to be done in interview.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:52.000
I have this timeline in front of me. I am talking to the people about their journey and I'm filling in the events as I go.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:02.000
My job as I do the interview is essentially a video game. Where I'm filling in the chain of events leading up to the moment of purchase and thereafter and how success is going.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:09.000
So each of you as you do your next round of jobs to be done interviews and you will. That's what I'll be expecting you to fill out.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:23.000
So before I move on to the forces. Are there any questions about this timeline?

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Or comments.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Nelson.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Yeah. Do does this require? Having a product for sale in order to be able to. Understand some of these early trans

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Great question, Nelson. And the answer is no. So if you don't have a product for sale.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Someone is probably trying to make progress outside of you, right? They're hiring something else. Go have that right.

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So what I would do if I were you, this is very simple. So you and I should talk more directly about what this looks like in a nuanced way.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I would go find people who've hired alternative solutions than what you plan to offer. And understand what they're hiring those solutions for.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And would led them down this journey. I love doing competitive product interviews. I love talking to people who choose something else.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So for example, one thing I'm doing right now is I'm actually interviewing founders.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Who get into Y Combinator and Tech Stars. And choose one or the other to understand why.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
That's how I'm applying the jobs to be done framework for my job. Because why would a founder choose?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Neil's Oakland or San Francisco program. Over Y Combinator, would they even?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And what would be the context and what value would I need to provide for that to be true. So that's an example for me of like a competing, you know, example.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Does that answer your question, Nelson? Okay, cool.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Hi, similar question, but slightly different. So we are working on sustainability and travel and obviously that's not really that doesn't fully exist and obviously there's a lot of travel and convents like Expedian booking where people can choose these alternatives.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:30.000
But I'm curious if it if there's it makes sense to interview a customer that might already be adopting sustainable practices in their everyday life like interviewing someone who owns a Tesla or shops that Whole Foods or uses Ridwell.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Or something like in the sustainability space in terms of their consumer purchasing behavior. But not necessarily in the same industry.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Just to understand their thought process on these changes or the forces of progress.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Interesting. So what you're saying is fascinating because I jumped back here. Because I'm trying to understand what the examples you just provided, what the struggling moment is.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Cause what you're describing sounds like people who have characteristics of Maybe what might be appropriate for who you think you want to serve.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Right.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
But who among them actually is experiencing a struggling moment that would lead them to want to make a purchase?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Right, so I guess like the most tangible example would be Redwell. So every every city has recycling services.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Yeah.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
But people that want to recycle. The things that just aren't recyclable that end up in the trash.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Anyways. End up paying a premium to use a service called Good Well to be able to recycle their batteries and clam shells and whatever it might be.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And so their struggling moment maybe. Like is a similar thought process like man, I really want to recycle.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I still want to do really good. But at the end of the day, there's not really good options out there.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And so then they that. And their struggling moment, they end up. Paying a monthly subscription for Ridwell.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:05.000
In the same way that like for people that are traveling. And want to travel more sustainably. Since it doesn't really exist yet.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Then finding that customer is somewhat difficult. I guess. So it's like pre product doesn't really exist.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So, okay. Alright.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Okay, okay.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Yeah, we can help you with this. Yeah, we can help you with this. Like it's a longer answer than probably what I should respond with right now, but like I have a lot of thoughts based on what you just said.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Okay. Alright.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
And the short answer is that we have to go way more narrow than how you're talking. Yeah, that's my instinct right now is like we gotta zoom in real deep.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Okay, cool.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Cause you start small and when you start small and narrow. It's way easier to abstract than the other way around.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Hmm.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.000
If you start abstract with these characteristics of Tesla or they shop or those kind of things. It's 2 amorphous for us to have.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Through insights about those early stage customers that you want to acquire.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Hmm, okay.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
But we'll get there. We'll get there. I will definitely work with you hands on on that.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Great. Thanks.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
So great question. Kevin.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yeah, so one of the things that, my co-founder Madison and I, we've been struggling with in the jobs to be done is How do we make the determination?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
On who to focus on. And I asked that because we're B to B to C. So who do we focus towards the business the restaurants or the consumers?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Yeah.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And so that's a very tricky thing that we've been struggling with. And if we should be applying it to both.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah, so, in the squad in the car asked about this, I think a little earlier, in a different way.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
But my question to you, Kevin, is, what are your needs? Like, are we, what are we trying to get done?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Are we trying to earn revenue are we trying to figure out like Like what don't we know that we're trying to know?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So it's sort of a 2 edge sword. So. We found that selling to the restaurants for us is pretty easy because our product kind of doesn't exist out there.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:06.000
So it's been. It's risky.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
It will, yeah.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
That's risky. Because if it's if you're saying it's easy now and the product doesn't exist as soon as you start to get bigger other people are gonna go oh we like that too we'll take it

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Right, exactly. So. So there's that portion of it. So right now at this moment in time, it's easy, but yes, it will, that will change.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I know, I know, trust me. You'll hear my story.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:35.000
But. The, the other part is that The consumers on that side. So getting to the restaurants what I was saying is that right now is easy to do, but then the sales actually getting the consumers to actually buy the product.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:43.000
We'll find that we could have, let's say, a hundred different restaurants, but then generating the actual consumer sales, that's a little more tricky.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And it's tricky because sometimes right now for what we have because it's very innovative, the mindset is not quite there yet.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
We're slowly getting that line set out to the consumer to sort of adapt this, but it's not there yet.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Yeah.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Huh.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So it may be. A thing where, you know, I might have answered my own question, even though with the restaurants it's easy to get it at this stage to them.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Try to get it to the consumers and get them to right.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
How do you keep him happy? Yeah. So, so, so a few things here. And I'll keep going, but you're asking, you all are asking, you all are asking fantastic questions.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:28.000
So keep them coming. This is the best use of our time in my opinion. Because everyone here can learn from each other and your respective situations.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Ryan Singer another friend of mine who I will introduce more about him later when we enter product development content work.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
He said this to me one day. He goes, who can teach us most about the problem?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Who can teach us the most about the problem? So the problem that we want to solve. And when I heard him say that, this is like over 10 years ago, I never forgot it because on one hand, my default answer to most people when it comes to who to choose between B 2 B+B to C or B to B to C.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Who's gonna pay me? Whoever's paying me. I'm trying to know them because that's where I got to start.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
If they're not willing to pay, I can't make progress in any other way. So that's a very simple rule of thumb that I still believe in.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.000
However, There is an alternative and that is If either the B or the C in your equation, Kevin.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Will mean more to you in the near term about what you end up building and how you execute your next phase.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:33.000
For example, if your goal is to raise venture capital and you have a certain set of institutional VCs that have a certain expectation for the strategic direction of your business based on the limited conversations you've had with them.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:50.000
And they set a Excalibur test for you like a goal. Like, okay, great. You guys in the tech stars if you hit these metrics or get this done or explore the space and can prove to us that there's a there, then we were interested in moving forward and investing.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Okay.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Will be your lead investor, write your 500 K check. That is a worthy cost to maybe divert from who pays me now to who will teach me the most about solving the bigger 1 billion dollar problem down the road.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Right? That's just one very simple example. There's a lot of more new wants strategic questions that you can ask.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I will spin up a job to be done interview for the smallest of things. Like if I want to test like certain a subset of a feature within a product or a new business concept.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I will do a whole job to be done process that takes one to 2 weeks to get done once you're good at it.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Just for that understanding in one domain without effect impacting the entire business. So that's where you can kinda pull in different.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Situations but the short answer of it, Kevin, is that it depends and I will work with you on a very direct custom answer, to your situation.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Snow.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Perfect.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I'm curious about, if it makes sense to conduct the interview with the people who is in the middle of the timeline.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So just who just decide to purchase the product?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Great question. What do you think? What do you think I'm gonna say?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:06.000
So I'd like to have the interview to understand that, but actually there are some that I cannot ask.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
So that's why I, so.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Huh. Alright, I'm gonna say something and you will have to forgive me. Please forgive my language.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
But it's something that someone taught to me. Bitchinate switching. So that's what I heard.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Bob taught me this. But basically what that means is is that when someone's struggling with the problem, but they haven't taken action to change.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:38.000
You're not going to learn nearly as much as the person who ends up switching. Right? So what you want to study is the actual purpose of someone saying yes or no to something.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Like a hard decision, like the switch moment is the key. That's where you're gonna find actually I'm gonna skip ahead of slide That's the energy.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:53.000
This is actually a part of my lecture right here. So the energy comes at the moment of the switch.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:00.000
People will complain all day long about what they don't like. But they still have to be the customer.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Sometimes that's good, sometimes it's bad. Right? It's bad in the context of Comcast?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Anybody a customer Comcast? That's bad. Cause I can't switch. I have to use Comcast and that sucks.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:24.000
But sometimes No one's ever gonna be happy with what comes out, but at the same time, it's getting the job done for you or others.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
So you're tolerating it even if you're going to kick and scream along the way. And maybe the kicking and screaming is more of the minority edge case, the super users.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And less about the masses who are very happy with the product as it is. So that's why Snow to answer your question.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Talking to people. Potential customers of yours but who have not made a decision to purchase. Will give you a false sense of confidence about what they would be willing to do.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So one example of this that happens in the real world is many of you have probably administered servants. You've probably run surveys to understand your audience and I'll have meetings with founders and they'll say, oh, I have a survey with a thousand results and that everyone says that they would be willing to pay.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
$50 for this or they'd be willing to do this or they'd be willing to sign up if it had this.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Those people are lying to you. You have no idea what they're actually willing to do yet. Until you ask them to literally pay.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Those are hollow words. So I'll tell you this is someone who learned the hard way. I started the first coding school.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I'll tell you that whole story later. But in doing so, I was learning this technique called the lean startup methodology.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:50.000
This is back in 2,009. So, you know, 15 years ago. And so in the lean start of methodology, talk about doing customer interviews.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And I did solution interviews and problem interviews. And when I did these interviews, I talked to people who I thought would be great customers for my coding school.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I met with 25 people. And the vast majority of them said they would be willing to pay. $6,000.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
To sign up for my coding program.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I launched my coding program.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:24.000
0 of those people signed up for that program or anything else. 0. Even though they all told me that they would.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:31.000
So I, but I ended up succeeding and there's a whole story there, but I just want you to understand like what people say they're willing to do and what they actually do are 2 different things.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000
So one thing that I always have people do when they claim that someone is willing to do something. It's a good lesson to do it.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
So you interview someone and they say, I'm willing to pay, I'd be willing to pay $30 for this.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Okay, it's ready actually. So here's it. You have your credit card ready. I'll take you $30 right now.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And then you'll find out the truth. So I love that you ask that snow is perfect. Okay, I'm gonna place through the rest.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:03.000
So. Forces. We talked about timeline, time, space and time, understanding, customers journey. What are the forces that are pushing them?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Through that timeline or slowing them down from making it through to the purchase moment. So space and time is what we're talking about.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
And right here, these forces are going to be the key to your understanding. Once you've conducted your interview.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:26.000
So we've kind of trained you all a little bit to do this already, but just so you know, what happens is when you're dealing with a push, this is the most common one.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Someone has a problem that they need to solve. The example and analogy I like to use is I have a flat tire.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
When you have a flat tire and you're trying to get somewhere, You need to fix the flat tire.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
That's a problem. That's a push. That's a necessity to make progress on.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Can anyone think of what a poll would be as opposed to a push? So if it pushes a flat tire What might a pool be with our car analogy?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Trying to get to your, daughter's,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Okay.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
That's a push too. You gotta be at the recital bro. I don't want you thinking about that being a good thing for you to do.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
That's a push.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Right.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So what would a pull be?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
You are okay with the price.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
What's that?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Maybe that the

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
You are okay with the IS for now and you don't change it now.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
You're okay with the tires, sure. So what else might be going on with the car?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
What kind of other pool might there exist with with a car?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Better performance.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Yeah.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
There we go. I like that better perform. What is better performance mean on a on roads with speed limits and and legality and restrictions.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
What kind of performance are we talking about part of?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:43.000
There could be safety measures. You know, on the riskier rows or depending on the sort of terrain that they're planning on traveling through.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Heck yeah, absolutely, 100%. So I'll give you an example. And this is it'll get dark for a second, but then it'll be okay.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Last year during one of my programs, right at the beginning, going into Minter Madness, I was in a really bad car accident.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I was in an Uber in the back seat. And I got t-bone and I was it was not good.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000
It was not pretty. I had to pick glass out of my head and bleed down to go to hospital back. Anyway, I'm okay. Made it through it.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Team supported me. We got it done. That being said, literally like a week or 2 later.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I made the mistake of taking another Uber. I think I was on a meeting with Liliana and another team member.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And I was in a Tesla. And the Uber driver almost crashed. Into another car a week after me getting a concussion and like I haven't go to hospital.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:39.000
But the technology auto-stopped the car. It like before he crashed the car like 4 stopped.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And I was like, I am taking Ubers and Teslas for ever now. I'm not riding in any other car.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Because I didn't trust the person driving. But the technology enabled more like safety and assurance for me.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
So I say all that to say, my pull example for y'all. I didn't even know I was gonna use that story, but here we are free styling.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:07.000
The pull is I don't need a new car. But that new Tesla, mmm, I'm trying to get that cyber truck. You know what I'm saying?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Like, so there's a pull, there's like a desire to have a better status or a better version of yourself or a better lifestyle that you want where you're not burdened by this struggling moment.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.000
But you are excited about that future you. Or a better way of living that can enhance things. Williana.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:36.000
No, yeah, so I heard a couple of you when you were guessing polls, you were saying things that maybe put you away from the solution so the direction of the arrows here is really important.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:46.000
So you can't see. I wish we had a whiteboard so you could see but basically the push is pushing you toward the new behavior and the pole is pushing you toward the new behavior.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000
It's just one is stronger than the other. The poll is much more about an attraction. Or an allure.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000
So like Neil was saying the enticing nature of the safety of the Tesla. I always use Tesla as an example for the social ramifications.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:07.000
So a lot of people at the beginning got Tesla not for any of its features but because it was seen as elite luxurious.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:15.000
You have made it if you can buy a Tesla in the tech world, things like that. You have no main issue with your current car.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Maybe nothing is even wrong with it. You just want the Tesla for a much higher reason, much more about attraction.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000
The push is there's an actual problem that is hurting. So I always associate push with pain.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:35.000
It says make it better. Something is truly hurting or inhibiting you. That's the difference, but they're both moving you toward the new solution.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And although on the regular pushes stronger than pull, sometimes pull can be extremely strong. A good example is a new iPhone.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:54.000
A lot of us get new iPhones without the old one being broken or made obsolete and it's a lot more about the poll than it is the push and I mean they've made a huge business on that.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So it's not always a push stronger. The main thing I want you to understand is that they're both moving you toward the new solution and the other 2 forces are moving you away from the new solution, sticking to status quo.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.000
That's very well said and it reminds me, Liliana, I would love for you to chime in more.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Just so you all know, the way Lilian and I have become very close as colleagues is. Through this through exactly what we're talking about right now this is the first time she and I met is when I gave a version of this talk.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And it was clear that it resonated with her and this was like 5 years ago and we've been applying this framework to help founder succeed ever since.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Brian.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Yeah, I like that.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Yes, that's a great way to say it. You're aspiring for a better self.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
So I'm just trying to make sure that I got what, both you and, Lilian are saying is that especially on the pool side is it safe to say that there are operational in nature.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I like that.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:19:00.000
So think about when you sign up for like a gym membership. Or. You know, I'm thinking about.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:09.000
You know, anything where there's like a dream of being enhanced or life being better and it's not necessarily coming from.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000
A major problem in your life, but just more of like a major upgrade that you're thinking of.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Those upgrades, that's the pull force. And there's usually a combination of them that are at play.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Tune day you had a question, but I don't know if you wanted to.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Yeah, I kinda changed my mind. The question. But I guess I can ask it and I've read a lot of books around like entrepreneurship and I'm trying to not to conflate a lot of the concepts and I'm trying not to conflate a lot of the concepts and so with this push and pull analogy what was coming to mind was when you speak about painkillers and

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Yeah, a morphine.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Yeah.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
A little. Yeah, yeah, you're good. This is good This is the deep work. This is the deep work.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
vitamins and I Okay, so yeah, I just wanted to know if it was kind of in the same in this we could use the same I guess thought process to try to understand push and pull and And that's what I, that's that's why I put my hand out because I thought I didn't want to I do wanna, yeah, yeah.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I like this. You're doing it. So to be clear, I will say that I will talk about.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Bye, vitamins, painkillers, and morphine, right, as levels of severity of the problem.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Yep.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Yep.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
It's tangentially related to what we're talking about, but not precisely. So a vitamin is a thing that you're taking proactively to be better.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:26.000
A painkiller is something because you're reacting to an immediate pain. I have back pain I need to go to CBS and get some you know aspirin or something.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Morphine is deep seated pain and need for relief. Each of you and your businesses today have respective pain levels of severity that you're addressing for your customer.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:54.000
The tried and true like kind of reference there for that analogy to day. Is by default. Ideally, you're trying to deal with the morphine level problem.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Because by solving a morphine level problem. People are willing to go to much greater lengths to make progress.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:07.000
That isn't always true or always the case, but in many cases, most cases I would say.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Trying to focus on the higher severity and the greater needs, even if it's a smaller subgroup of potential customers, is a great starting place for most founders.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:26.000
That isn't necessarily tracking directly to the push and pull analogy you're seeing here. The pull forces that we're talking about.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:37.000
To very well be at the vitamin or painkiller stage along with the pushes. So there's a slight nuance to those 2 concepts that I would kind of create a separation for.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Thanks.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I can think of an example, Neil. Like for, B 2 B, let's talk about a specific decision maker stakeholder, maybe a chief innovation officer for many of you.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Selling tech solutions. The push would be so that decision maker messed up and it like it's threatened that they may lose their jobs so they want your solution to make their job better and so they don't mess up again and keep their job.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
A poll that is equally as strong would be they want to move up maybe their VP of innovation right now they want to be Chief Innovation Officer.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:12.000
That poll can still be a painkiller or morphine depending on how deep the desire is.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:23.000
So their poll and allure to be better to achieve that promotion to be the champion of their team to bring in this new solution that streamlines their revenue and innovates the company.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
If they want that pull and the reason it's attractive is because they want to buy a new house for their family or something like that.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:40.000
There's still not a push there. But the poll I would say is at that painkiller or even morphine level, but it's still an allure or an attraction because they're not facing an immediate like pain in their job.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
I think that's a good way to think about it.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Yep. Now.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And this is great. I'm loving the back and forth. It's really good. I'm a I'm a qualitative researcher by trainings.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I'm love and breaking it down. My only question is, is there a need at this stage to quantify these trajectories, right?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Hmm

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Yep.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Is there need to have a sense of, yeah, that relationship? I know you're breaking it down, Just curious, we need to have numbers behind some of these, relative to that morphine scenario.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:14.000
What when you think of numbers, what are you thinking of? What numbers are you?

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Oh.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I'm more simply thinking even like a lighter scale, right? Like, are we, should be, should that be a part of the process of being able to help people understand the choices they have is right.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
There's plenty competitors, plenty of other options. I give a little bit of contact. We're in the fintech space.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:33.000
So our kind of pushing pull is probably always a saving versus investing kind of binary, right? And so for us, I'm just thinking, given other solutions, other investment options, how do we start to?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I'm gonna quantify some of that sensitivity.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That's a great question. We can help you with that once we get to the research insights.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Math gets involved. Math gets involved at the later stages of having these insights and how you process them and what the clusters look like.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:24:02.000
So for sure it does get quantitative. It starts off highly qualitative. Bob is still in the process of teaching me a lot of those quantitative techniques for how to actually like parse these insights further from a research standpoint, now.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.000
But yeah, for those of you that are trying to go full board with this, there will be room for more of that.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
For sure. So I love that you asked.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Awesome. Appreciate it.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Okay, would it be okay if I offer some of my insights? I'm doing my master's in market research, so it's all about call and quant and just like kind of breaking it down like When typically performing any kind of like consultative aid for a business, what you first do is the qualitative part because it helps you narrow down that scope of who and what to ask and the quantitative.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Because when you get all those like hard data numbers, you want them to be as focused as possible and qualitative is a great way of getting it there.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:49.000
So I almost feel as like a funnel where like I still do like Qual and Quant, but I always, not always, but typically do call first so then narrow it down to like what I want to ask about in Quant.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I love that.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Love it. Yeah, I'm, I'm on the same page with both of you. I will offer a caveat though.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
We cannot research our way to product market fit.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000
You still have to execute. You still have to screw up. It's messy. It's unproven.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
That's the very nature of startups. You all are here not because there's a formula that I can give you to be successful.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:18.000
You're here because there's a very painful chaotic road to realize what kind of business. You need to build in order to execute successfully.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So just know that we'll research our way through this and we'll have insights and hints.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:30.000
But at the end of the day, what to expect from this isn't an answer. It's a series of potential pathways to go down.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
To find the answer that you want. Matthew.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Yeah, my question was, can we try to be both push and poor? And, similar on the fintech space thinking, you know, the push could be saving money and the pool is making more money.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Can we try to be both or should we?

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I appreciate you asking and it's interesting. I'm going to offer up a reframe for you.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Because the context of this slide has nothing to do with us. And has everything to do with the person you're trying to help.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
So we're not even talking about we yet. We don't know what we want to be.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:17.000
We want to help them. So if we understand what's driving them to make progress and success, we can orient ourselves to address the forces that are motivating them to make progress.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Got it.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Has nothing to do with us yet. I hope I'm not being too forward by saying it that way, but that is the point.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Is that it ain't about us yet.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yeah.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000
It's really important. Yeah, it's not what we're offering. So like just changing that language to be.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I can.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Yep. Yeah. With so our assuming this is the person you want to help Matthew like once you tell me I know I want to help them Then we start with humility and we go, okay, what do we need to become to actually help them make their progress?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Not the other way around.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Got it.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Now if your question is like, can someone be hiring us for both push and pull? The answer is yes.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Yes.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.000
People will have a diversity of reasons that they come. To. Higher your product. I can do the last 2 now if you want.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Oh, this is good. Yeah, please do it. Yeah, let's go.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Gotcha.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Okay, so now let's change gears for the last 2 forces if you could go back Now let's change gears to what is keeping the customer at the current status quo.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:17.000
So business as usual on the left side. The last 2 are forces that are against progress against them making that switch.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
We'll do habit first. That's traditionally the hardest one to understand out of the 4.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
But just think of it as the actual title, a habit. It's keeping someone in their current status quo.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000
We are not creatures of change. Humans just like to stay with what they know. It's about comfort.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:39.000
It's about just accessibility. The greatest example that Neil and I always give is changing your operating system.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:49.000
So you're either usually a Windows person or a Mac person. Sometimes you change when you're like super young and in school, but you're pretty much set in your professional career.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And if you do change, one of the things that is keeping you from making that change is the habit.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:08.000
So Apple in order to convert Windows users have they have to overcome their habit force. People are very used to the certain shortcuts they have, the certain way that things show up in their operating system.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:16.000
And you now have to make enough of an allure or a push on the top to overcome that negative force in people.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Does that make sense on habit? Does anyone have any questions? Okay. And then anxiety.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Nailed it.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Much easier to understand. Anxiety is feared. So one of the main reasons we don't want to make changes outside of comfort level and having to change is fear.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:39.000
That can be mainly price. But I can think of a couple of others. Price is the biggest one that we see.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:48.000
So. People have a problem, but the price barrier is enough to overcome even the pain of a push or the allure of a poll.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
How do I know if this will work? Right? I've been I've been failed so many times.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I've tried so many other solutions. Is this the one? I'm already I'm already kind of like nervous about that.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I'm unsure. So that anxious energy that people carry that offers them a hesitation. So like whenever a deal slows down.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
So some of you are doing B to B work. Right? And you're trying to get a deal over the line.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:17.000
You've got an LOI, you know, you're talking terms, but you can't quite get the commitment.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:26.000
There's likely going to be certain uncertainties or anxieties that the customer has on the other side that they're trying to navigate or deal with before they're ready to commit.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:37.000
So there's so many different contexts where these forces come into play. The push in the poor are much easier to discern and ascertain from the interview than the habits and anxieties, all are important.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And they all feed into each other.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Okay. Yeah, so now a great exercise is in my email to you guys I asked you to review the mattress interview That is a key exercise to be able to understand this framework.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So I don't know if we have time now, now if you want to just Go through the forces on that or we can do it next time, but.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Definitely. Definitely review it if you have it.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Yeah, we will probably let's do that at the start of the next session we do because then we'll give people time to think about it or revisit the interview if they didn't get a chance to re listen to it.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:14.000
But energy. At the end of the day is what we're looking for. Where there's high energy there is greater insight.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:24.000
So the last part of this equation and then we'll wrap up soon. There's dimensions of understanding these forces.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:32.000
They're social, functional, and emotional. So social is your interaction with others and how they see you.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Functional is does it actually get the job done? Is it actually accomplishing what it sets out to? And emotional is how it makes you feel.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:51.000
So each of these layers. To your energy. With respect to those forces. Are worth unpacking and understanding for each of your respective customers.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Because once you dial in what the implications are, different products have different levels of severity for each of these dimensions.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Some are pure function. Some could be pure motion. Most, if not all, have some variance of each of them.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:25.000
But keeping these. Dimensions of energy in mind. As you do your interviews and understand your customers better are going to allow you to have a level of creative thoughtful nuance to your product offering that most of your competitors do not have.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:33.000
So whenever you realize that someone like some product that you paid, something you paid money for, it's almost like they effortlessly understood what your needs were and you were delighted at the experience because of how thoughtful and successful it was.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:46.000
It didn't even make you think because it was so easy. Like those are the kinds of experiences I like to sign up for.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:56.000
So, I'm trying to give a good example of a delightful customer experience, but not to be too much of a fanboy, but if you ever walk into an Apple store.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Versus like a micro center. Or circuit city or There's a difference in how it feels. And who greets you, how you interact.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.000
And just how it feels to be in that room in that space. Makes you want to buy on its own.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.000
So with that being said, like that's the level of understanding that you need to have about what those forces of progress on.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:29.000
All right, few final things. One. Demand side versus supply side. You're gonna hear me say this a lot because most of you will make this mistake at some point as we talk and have our one on ones and conversations.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:45.000
The supply side thinking will be a total distraction to our early progress in this program. And what I mean by supply side thinking is I'm not ragging on you, Matthew, but what Matthew said about we need to do this or we become that or what we will offer.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:56.000
It ain't about you yet. So I'm gonna remove solutions and supply side from our conversations early on because until we understand who it is we're helping and what they need.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:10.000
It makes no sense for us to talk about ourselves and what we offer. Unless you already have customers. If you have customers, then there's already a symbiotic relationship between demand and supply, and we're just looking to figure out how to enhance it.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:20.000
So different situations. You know, different companies. But there's usually a bifurcation of these business units at companies.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:34.000
At scale. You separate. You know the the customer support from the marketing and sales. So the best example and analogy I have of this is if anyone has ever bought like a high end camera.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Thank you, you ever purchased like a canon or a Nikon or something like that? Maybe some of the older folks in the room can relate more, but when you buy one of these products.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:50.000
There's a there's like usually a brochure and there's branding and packaging that go with it that are aesthetically beautiful.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:57.000
It's like really auring. You're like so excited to have this new device. But what happens when you open the box?

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:11.000
You get that manual and it's. This thick and all of a sudden you have all of these little bitty fine print and text to learn and specs and instructions and tools and all these things that become super overwhelming.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:19.000
It's a case study in. Setting you up to buy and then dropping you off the deep end afterwards once you're my customer.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
You've already made the purchase. You're not going to go back. You're not going to return it. I have you.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Therefore, I'll just. I'll just vomit instructions about how to handle this complicated product.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Rather than continuing the thoughtfulness. In that journey. So I think the best companies among us are the ones that keep the experience going, even post purchase.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:50.000
We're guiding the customer down a pathway to delight and success. Alright. Speaking of business units and scaling.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Those of you that wanna still build those 1 billion dollar businesses, I hope is everybody on this call. I hope you realize that everything we talked about with that timeline.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Tracks to your companies at scale. So when you have a hundred employees. And you're managing. You know, all of these different tools and you're earning millions in revenue.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
That customer journey is still true.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:23.000
And the company systems that you have. Map to the timeline that we're trying to teach you at the basic level here.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Your marketing and sales systems in Teams will be understanding. Both the first thought, the passive and active looking phases of all the customers you're trying to appeal to.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Who are those billboards in San Francisco speaking to as you drive around? When you think about the large scale marketing and branding that happened, the ads, the commercials, the Super Bowl just passed and those were a bunch of commercials.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:54.000
When you ask yourself, what are the teams of people doing the work to figure out what the message should say?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.000
How this should be rendered, how it should be visualized, how it should be offered. And then last but not least, customer success.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:07.000
So just know that what we're teaching you might seem fairly accessible and even borderline rudimentary.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
But at scale it becomes just as important and just as nuanced. So we're just trying to prime you all for that.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.000
So I've alluded to having connections to the people who've taught us this framework and how we go about applying it.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:31.000
One really, really special moment for me was when I had a chance to go to Harvard. Business School to meet, Clay Christianson himself along with Bob Messa who did the mattress interview.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000
He and Clay. Together kind of co-created the jobs to be done framework in the nineties.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:46.000
So I have one last story to share with you about the origin of that, but beforehand, Clay, if you notice in the video is very tall.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I think he's like 6 8. He sadly a few years ago passed away. But he and I had a chance to meet, before that.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And he has this. Humility exercise that he does with people. Sometimes when he takes photos where he gets down on one knee and this is a mean play at Harvard spending that time together having a conversation about how to apply jobs to be done in a political context.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I'll share more about later in my story. When we're in Tahoe. But this is the guy who's been doing the Manchester interview.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:30.000
For you. This is Bob Nesta. Bob is one of my best friends. I met Bob I think 11 years ago at 37 signals slash base camp in Chicago at their office.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:37.000
He was teaching jobs to be done. To a group of people who had paid I think a thousand dollars to have a seat.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.000
To spend the day with him. There people have to spend a lot more money now than they did back then to meet with Bob.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:52.000
But I want to tell you a quick story about him and how he came to meet Clay because Clay brings the academic side and Bob brings the like the real practice.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.000
So, but before I do that, I want you all to tell me

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:06.000
What these are. These are 2 candy bars. We know that. But what candy bars are they?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Sneakers.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Which one?

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.000
The bottom one, I think sneakers.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Top is Milky Way.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Yeah, some marn knows his skinny bar. Alright, what's the one on the top?

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Thanks.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
No.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I'm gonna say Milky Way.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Mars?

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Okay.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Yeah

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Oh, who said that? Was that Valeria? Malaria, you like Milky Way's?

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Yeah, and I think some other people too. I don't, but I don't know.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Yeah.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I've got an eye for such things, I guess.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Alright, cool. Very nice. Okay, so here's the situation. Bob is a very smart person.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Okay, so he went to Michigan State. He went to Harvard. He's an engineer. He's from Detroit.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.000
So he does a lot of work with like He's worked with over 3,000 products in his lifetime.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:57.000
That being said, early on. He was doing, I think, both automobile industry and maybe some defense contracting work.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:04.000
But a friend of his worked for Mars. Mars is the company that makes Milky Way and stickers and they're based in New Jersey.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000
So he flashed from Detroit to New Jersey and his friend basically says, hey Bob, we need your help.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:20.000
We're trying to figure out because this is in the ninetys, so you all might be surprised, but.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Hmm.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Mars was struggling. And Snickers was on the chopping block. Because they were competing with Milky Way and they were trying to make sense of these 2 products that they were offering and how they were sizing up with each other.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:36.000
So. This is the state of the company. I hope that this works with the screen share.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Lilian, if this doesn't, you let me know, okay? I'm gonna try to play the state of the company.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:50.000
With what they were where the business was at Let's see if this works.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
No, it's just a frozen frame.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Is this working? No? Oh man, alright, let me see if I can fix this.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Let me see if I can fix this.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
No.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000
What about now? No? Oh man, it's a commercial. So let me see.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000
If you send me the link, I can pull it up. Oh, it's working now. It's working.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I hope you enjoy that snickers.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
We can see it.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Okay.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Well, no, it's a it's actually Okay, there we go. There you go.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Happy peanuts all Over chocolate covered mountain tops and waterfalls of Branching new good in the meadow sings a song of satisfaction to the world

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
That's right.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Alright, so what did we just see? Tell me what you all just saw. Like who were we selling to?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Who is this for? What's the message?

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:55.000
We're on the advertising and marketing team. Dropping millions of dollars on a commercial ad campaign.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Any thoughts?

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I mean from quickly, it's first time seeing you. But obviously he's working in our office, right?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Yeah.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Looks like it's a pretty boring. He's the only one in there. Just looking at some of the contact.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
So I feel like it's something about. Interrupting his day, the song, all that, right?

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
It's adding injecting a bit of spontaneity, livelihood into that, environment.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000
That's a that's a impressive read. Yeah, I you're saying it better than I ever could.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. I like who do you think the customer is?

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I think he

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Like what situation are they in?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
It's the mundane TDM of office work, right? So it could be anybody, right?

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Okay. Got it. So just like make things more interesting, right? With the stickers.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Anybody working at 7? Yeah. Yeah.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
So Mark, did you want to say something?

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:42.000
No, just gonna say it looks like he's, you know, in the middle of working. I just wanna snack like a quick, bite.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Okay, a quick bite. Alright, yeah.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Yeah.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And escape. Alright, alright.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Maybe she feels like an escape. Which was

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing. I mean, you're in office setting, probably in the stressful environment, that's probably his way of like.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
You know, coping with that at the moment. Like I need to stress that. So.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Yeah. Kevin.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Gives you energy. You're in that office 2, 3 pm in the afternoon, you get that afternoon lag.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Snickers and peanuts it gives you the boost.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And you got that from this ad?

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Okay.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I did actually, cause he just, it's an office setting. So it just looks boring. Like and you take that that snickers bar and it just kind of That's my interpretation, but.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:31.000
I love this. No, I love this. Cause you know, it's funny because I I have an inkling.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Of what that might be informed by but I'll get to that in a second. Christy.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I don't know if I just imagine this, but I, saw him. Experience joy once he kind of like When you heard, you know, the, the guy singing, he kinda.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Yeah, he was like not his head and swimming around

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Huh.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Yeah.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Ging more appreciation for it. There was this join, you know, Joyce moment. Again, against the boring, you know, tedious day he was happening and then he became kind of aspirational like.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Huh.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Something I don't like it felt like I was I saw him kind of dreaming of something beyond his current state.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Well, so here's a funny thing with this. This ad didn't work.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:30.000
They experience no material change. No success, no real uptick. They continue to struggle. And they were just kind of throwing things at the wall trying trying to do, I think what you all are trying to do, trying to make sense of what you saw and you're kind of elaborating a little bit more.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And I think some of that elaboration is informed maybe from some other inputs and you're familiar with snickers now.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.000
That being said, here Bob was with the puzzle. Still struggling. So he leaves New Jersey and goes back.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.000
To Detroit and he goes to the airport. And he still got this puzzle on his mind.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Like, wait, at Milky Way Snickers. Bad ads, not growing sales. What do we do?

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:05.000
At the airport. Past security. He sees a keyiosk. And lo and behold, he stands by the kiosk.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And he observes a person buying a snickers. Bob as a kid was given what's called the 3 foot rule by his mom.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Which means that if he's within 3 feet of someone, he can talk to them. A strange rule I know, but Bob proceeds to follow this Snickers purchaser.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:34.000
To their security gate. And sit near them and first he observes. And he watches this person, open up their laptop.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Sit down. Scarf down the snickers and start to work. He asks this person.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:52.000
In language that they could understand. What job were you hiring the snickers to do? The guy says, well, I've got this long flight.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000
I would love to get some shut eye so if I can get through my work right now. Empowered through it.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I think Kevin or someone said that. Then I'll be able to take a nap on the plane and I get my work done now.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Okay, that's cool. What do you think Bob did next?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
What would you do?

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
One.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Sorry to ask you questions.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:25.000
He went back to the kiosk. And he kept waiting. He started waiting. He was like, okay, what do you think he's waiting for?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Somebody else to buy the snickers.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Or a Milky Way. Right? So he sits there and he waits. Someone else buys the snickers.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000
And then he goes up to the guy working the kiosk and he's like, hey, like You sell these Milky Way's?

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Much. And he's like, no, we sell way more sneakers. Interesting. So Bob is now trying to figure out where people are buying stickers versus where people are buying Milky Way's.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
So he goes home and the puzzle still on his mind because he hasn't quite figured it out.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And he's talking to his wife. And he's like, I got this puzzle. This New Jersey Mars company like snickers Milky Way thing.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Who's the hex by Milky Way? And his wife says, I have a Milky Way.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:23.000
She walks into the kitchen, grabs a stool, stands on it, reaches behind like a cabinet of the fridge and pulls out a bowl.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Or she pulls out her Milky Way.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Light bulb comes on. Bob goes back to look at the data. It turns out that the hiring criteria for the Milky Way is dramatically different than the hiring criteria for the Snickers.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:55.000
And when they actually did the market research after that. Lip. They realize that the competitive set for the Milky Way was couldn't be more different than the people who were buying the Snickers bars.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:08.000
The people buying the Milky Way? Consumed it from anywhere from 10 to 15 min. The consumption time for a snickers bar is 60 to 90 s.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:18.000
So to help you understand the contrast, Milky Way was more about A glass of red wine at the end of your day, or an evening run, or brownie, or ice cream.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Which is why they would put him in the freezer. Whereas on the snicker side, there was a functional piece of energy, a boost, Red Bull, apples, coffee, fast food.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Functional needs. Was more about the hiring criteria for the Snickers.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:44.000
That came from that moment when he came home and he saw his wife with that Milky Way and he decided to look at the data.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:54.000
To realise that at least at the time, and this is clearly changed over time, but at the time, far more women were purchasing Milky Way than men.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:01.000
It was fascinating to look at the data and to see that. So. That all being said, I don't, we don't give Bob all the credit.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:11.000
The company was smart and adept and did a lot of cool things. But I'll show you where things landed, which may come from a lot of the inferences you made from that first commercial.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000
What?

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Go! Oh, Mike, what's your deal, man? Come on, man. You've been riding me all day.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:31.000
You're playing like Betty White out there. Ask out what your girlfriend says. You snickers.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Better? Hi! That hurt. You're not you when you're hungry.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Snickers satisfies.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Hello. You all remember this? So some of you do. So what ended up happening.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Is this you're not you and your hungry campaign? Emerged. From these insights. And snickers went on to become the number one candy bar in the world.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:17.000
So what ended up happening is when you touch on the note of what the job is rather than just saying sneaker satisfies and I'm bored at work and this is good, but instead you put people in the actual situation where they would be struggling and they can relate to and it strikes a chord.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:26.000
That's the level of clarity that we're trying to get each of you all to during this program with respect to who you're offering your product to and how to present it to them.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000
So, what does a candy bar have to do with your businesses? I know we're building tech startups.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:40.000
We're not building, you know, a candy bar business. There's a lot that comes with it, but very simply the language and processes in the domino effect.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:45.000
That lead to the chain of events that undeniably caused the problem. That's what we're here to help you all figure out.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:53.000
So I share that snicker story and the Clay McDonald's story because Snickers, McDonald's, Jobs to be Done.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Major corporations is where this framework came from. The reason we extrapolated this framework to apply to startups.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Is because the goal for many of you is to get to the point where you are serving millions of customers all over the world.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:17.000
And I want to give you all the context and the insights that exist at that level. Prominence and bring it to the earlier phase of how you build your companies.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:26.000
So, few other tips and I will wrap up with a few questions. Big hires and little hires.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Big higher language is when someone's committing or deciding to sign up for your product or service, little higher all the little things that they consume before along the way.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000
The best use case example I have for this is duct tape. You hire duct tape for one job.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:46.000
You need tape for a reason and you use it You keep the duct tape in your pantry or in your closet or somewhere in your house.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And whenever you need take, you pull out for another job. That's a little higher. As far as my reasoning for using jobs to be done.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:00.000
It helps me distribute decision making better with my team. Because we're in alignment with the job and we're always asking ourselves, are we in alignment with the job?

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:09.000
We optimize resources to focus on what matters most for the customer for success. It's inspiring to know that you're actually getting the right job done for your customers.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:18.000
And it allows you to more objectively. Track APIs and know that you're assessing yourself over what you've determined to be most important to your customers.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000
So here's the process.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Frame the learning question and when I say frame the learning question, this is where everyone makes a mistake They think I mean what questions are you gonna ask in an interview?

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000
You shouldn't know what questions you're going to ask in the interview. There's no script.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I'll give you a few tips on ways to start the conversation, but there should be no script.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:43.000
The learning question is about what you want to learn from doing the interviews. That's the learning question.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:50.000
You screen recruits, that's your screening criteria exercise. You conduct your interviews, you do your debriefs where you track the forces and timeline.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Then you do an analysis of pattern. This is where. We come in to help. This is where most people struggle, who study jobs to be done through Google or, you know, by YouTube or through some online class or something, they don't do that part or do it well.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:15.000
And we have done this for years. So we will help you analyze patterns from the insights you gained from your interviews to actually extract what you would need to know.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:24.000
To move forward for product development and for sales and marketing. You detail the jobs to be done statements and then you understand what to build and what to change about your business next.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:32.000
That's our process that we will guide you through in the coming weeks. The reason we do it now and not later and the reason we don't make it optional.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Is because by the time you get to We have very clearly learned that if you don't have this figured out.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:49.000
You are going to get eaten alive. Because you're gonna waste so much time trying to explain to people what you think your business is about and who your customers are without actually understanding.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:55.000
So we're trying to set you up for success with investors. We're going to introduce you to and with lots of experts.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:02.000
And people that you might even hire. Who are gonna evaluate how well you actually know your business and what you're trying to get done with it.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Cool. I think that's a good time to end. I have more to cover, but I have more time later.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Case studies, examples, references, more to share about all that. But Lilyon, anything else before we, conclude?

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Nope, just that is gonna be an immersive. So we have back to back and we'll also jump into some more stuff.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
For DTPD next week. So I know we threw a lot at you right now, but just know we're kind of gonna be able to answer questions as we go.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:33.000
And you'll just get a lot more info each day. So just let it marinate tonight and review the mattress interviews.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
We can go over that tomorrow. I see a question.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000
And it's a lot to process to be clear and it won't make sense until you apply it again.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000
So that's why we have multiple revs on this. We had you do it during the application process.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:56.000
We're having you do it right now and There are founders who are years out of my programs who I still will do jobs to be done analysis with.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:09.000
To this day. So I'll let you know that it never gets old because as you acquire more customers, you'll want to have a better understanding of who the new customers are.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Tuesday.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
It was just a quick question on the process. The first step is, frame the learning questions.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:25.000
And I just asked, is there a reason why you didn't? Bring it as frame the learning outcomes because that kind of seems what you explained it would be.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Is that a bit of a head fake to let people think about the questions not from your perspective?

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Let you think about it from question as well, not your perspective but from perspective of the customer. Is that intentional yet?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Yeah, so there's there's a I wanna get the right quote so Lilian maybe you can help me Clay has a famous quote questions create spaces in the brain for answers to fall into It's all about questions first.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.000
So what questions are we trying to answer with this research that we're doing? That's all.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I think your framing of the outcome is equally valid. I would say that there are 2 sides of the same coin.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Thank you.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Any other questions or final comments? Yeah, no time.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Neil. Just, a question about the scale of, so conducting interviews, I became very aware of the fact that I was doing 1, 2, 3, 4, but maybe if it did 1020, 30, 40.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:35.000
The answer is in the path of taken would have been different. So I'm wondering from your experience what sort of scale you think in terms of sample will show to be effective.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
10?

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:45.000
10 interviews. 10. Yeah, if you do 10 with the right screen, you right here in the right context, you'll and you do them right in their quality interviews.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
10 to 15 interviews is Pretty much and I've been I've been doing this for 10 years.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Bob's been doing this for much longer than that. You can get meaningful insights from. That number if you do it right.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Awesome.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
So that's also why I like it for a startup context. Because it's efficient. We're not over researching the problem before we know what we need to know to run an experiment.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:18.000
We get insights, we make experiments and decisions and we iterate from there. So I'll give you an example of a more prominent company and I'll share more about them tomorrow when I do my next lecture on this.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:28.000
But base camp, I did jobs to be done. Interviews with 37 singles in base camp. They were already serving millions of users and customers.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:38.000
After 15 interviews. The insights we got led to deep strategic. Decisions about the company and the product and the pricing.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:47.000
That had a fundamental impact on it going full. So I've seen it happen. And in the big leaks and it works.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Cool, thank you.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So. I'll show you more. Yeah. Alright, let's get this once and for all.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000
I wanna say your name properly. Mercia.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Bam! Let's go.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Yeah, amazing. And I will not hold it against you if you do not. I don't expect anybody to know a Romanian.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
This whole class is going to say your name properly by the end of the program, I promise you.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Just imagine an age instead of the E. I'll wear I'll make a t-shirt that says H instead of E or something.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Meera. Yeah, I got you.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Anyway, I have a I have a very short question we can answer next time if it's too long to answer.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Yep.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:33.000
There is a difference between our current customers and who we believe is our ideal customer in the future and our deal customer happens to be those performing musicians that are more successful than the ones that we work with right now.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Yes.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000
And they have a bit of a wall up because of their celebrity status. It's really difficult to interview.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:44.000
So I'm worried about the discrepancy of interviewing the current customers to be done which are not maybe ideal and I can't really reach the ideal ones at this stage in time.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Alright, I would love to help you with that. I don't have an answer right now on the cusp, but I love that you spoke up about that because Each of us have the ideal customer that we'd love to reach or talk to that we can't quite get to.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Yours is a more extreme version of that. Sounds like a worthy opponent. I'm down.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Amazing.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:15.000
So I love ending on time. I will stick around, happy to do encore and answer more questions, but I want to make sure that each of you all have meetings and things and priorities to tend to go live your life.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Be well be happy live long and prosper. I'll see you tomorrow or Thursday or next week.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Bye
