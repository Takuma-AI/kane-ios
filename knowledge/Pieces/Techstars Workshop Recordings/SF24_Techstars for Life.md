### Frameworks & Methodologies

- George Haikal: People are going to be really interested in both getting to know you, tracking your progress, supporting you. But also like. We need people like yourselves to step up as leaders to foster that community. In addition to ourselves.

### Key Insights

> "George Haikal: So after this cohort in a few months, usually, like January ish. We're going to have an investor reveal that Sylvia will send some info out for right in our Hq. So our Hq. Will become the way that we talk to you guys as a cohort, as alumni. Very important, and we'll go through"

> "George Haikal: So it's only like, if you're very actively raising. If you come back to it in January, when you're ready. February, whenever you get to it."

> "George Haikal: in that, in that discord channel. And in that space. And whenever people are trying to get connected to a company, I tell them, like I could reach out to my fellow managing director and ask them to connect me to that founder, and then have that founder hopefully talk to you, or you could just reach out to the founder yourself"

> "George Haikal: Pretty open to a cold email from the textures universe? Or is it still better to get a warm. It's better to get a warm intro. Always always better to get a warm introduction like you can go cold if you literally have 0 leads. It's unlikely that you have 0. Because and by the way, you'll heard me say this, but I'll say it again. The best intros actually don't even come from"

> "George Haikal: Yeah. Also, everybody submitted that kind of fundraising intake form that I sent out earlier, and I'm tracking like actively tracking both your runway this that you know. And also when you said that you want to start fundraising, so I know there's some people who aren't going to fundraise, you know. Now they might fundraise next September, but, like I still have the form and still on it, and you can always ping me whenever after program, too. But just so, you know, like I'm still watching. So no messages like 2 weeks from left. But I'm prepared."
