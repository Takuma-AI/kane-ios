### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: So we'll start with tips for beforehand. First, you're going to do a lot of things beforehand to prep. That's why, we have this session to day. Wednesday. We used to have it on Friday, and it was way too close to starting on Monday. So I'm giving this to you guys today so that you guys can start doing all of this work. The first thing create a way to track mentor research and follow ups. I'm actually gonna defer this point to Ferona. Because this is so important that last program we actually had Ferona start"

> "Lilliana Robinson: You're also going to track, follow ups if you don't create a way to track, follow ups. And when I say, create a way most people use Google sheets. You could use Hubspot. You could do. However, you want to do it. You can even do it on notion or pen and paper follow ups are very important."

> "Lilliana Robinson: also beforehand. This is extremely important. We require you guys to send an email to each mentor. You're meeting with introducing yourself and your business at least 24Â h in advance. And honestly, this is standard practice, for every time you guys have a meeting. So mentor, madness is really almost like a home training for how to interact with people from here on out. So all of these standards that we're requiring, because that's part of what people expect from our cohort is"

> "Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: yeah, see multiple blocks like 4 blocks for the first and 4 blocks for the second week, so I will never meet the same same mentor. Correct it will every every time will be a different mentor for half an hour. Blocks. Correct. Yes, that's correct."

> "Lilliana Robinson: And a lot of that is like these are just great people. Some of them are super connectors or just experts. So like, you might see someone and be like, what does this have to do with my industry? It's not always industry based. Sometimes it's like, we know, you had a certain problem that this person has seen before. Sometimes it's like we think you would really get along with this mentor. Maybe they could be an advisor. So it's kind of nuanced. We I you're not going to be able to like initially. Just see why we put you but a lot of thought goes into it. Nikki?"
