1
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.800
David Ambler: How many of you guys have? Either ray other than the tech stars? You know, docs and money.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.359
David Ambler: How many you guys either started thinking about raising, or raised or gotten to the point of.

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.420
David Ambler: you know, deciding safe versus price round, etc.

4
00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:20.649
Alex Nativelle: No issue.

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.009
David Ambler: Yeah. Okay.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.791
David Ambler: Alright. Well, we have a short presentation, which I think is helpful to go through

7
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.660
David Ambler: and.

8
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.670
Chloe Lannert: And actually.

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.489
David Ambler: Cover this.

10
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.529
Chloe Lannert: Pick on people a little bit more, so can I ask each of you for, like, have you raised any money before techstars

11
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.469
Chloe Lannert: safe or priced round for your next round, and like the approximate timeline of when you're thinking about

12
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.210
Chloe Lannert: a raise, if at all.

13
00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:03.299
Alex Nativelle: I can go if you want so we have not raised any money. And we are thinking about it, for like maybe January 2026 or a bit later.

14
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.550
Alex Nativelle: So not in the near future.

15
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.109
Chloe Lannert: And you'll be on on safes right.

16
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.019
Alex Nativelle: That I don't know.

17
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.320
Chloe Lannert: Fun.

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.269
Alex Nativelle: I would say.

19
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.590
Chloe Lannert: Yeah.

20
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.890
Alex Nativelle: More price, right now.

21
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.120
David Ambler: We we can.

22
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.399
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, let's say we're gonna raise lots of money, and so not safe.

23
00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:26.048
Alex Nativelle: I don't know.

24
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.209
Chloe Lannert: Alright Andrew, can I pick on you next.

25
00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:38.860
Andrew Fernandes: We raise them taking some angel checks on saves we're gonna raise, probably in the next 3 months or so.

26
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.420
Andrew Fernandes: Cool.

27
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:51.950
Esmaeil Sadeghi: The same here as well like in next 3 months. So my name is Smail from Optifab. So this is the goal that we have.

28
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.850
Esmaeil Sadeghi: We already raised another 100 k. From a place I call forum ventures. I don't know if you know the place

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.750
Esmaeil Sadeghi: that's also supporting, like b 2 b Sas as well. So that's our experience with safe in the past.

30
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.070
Esmaeil Sadeghi: That's.

31
00:02:09.773 --> 00:02:13.699
Chloe Lannert: Chris! Viv, do you wanna jump in?

32
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.519
Chloe Lannert: I don't know if y'all are in a spot where you could talk.

33
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.589
Chris Wong: Yeah, sorry. I'm like getting a bite in between.

34
00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:33.860
Chris Wong: But yeah, planning to raise, probably in 3, 6 months. Is a plan? But yeah, familiar, familiar with safes.

35
00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.949
Chris Wong: and so forth. But yeah.

36
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.379
Chloe Lannert: And any previous checks. Chris.

37
00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:42.979
Chris Wong: No, not at the moment.

38
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.890
Chloe Lannert: Good alright.

39
00:02:49.030 --> 00:03:02.280
Chloe Lannert: and then looks like Viv. Probably can't talk right now. Extra note from Antoine for brio. They're incorporated in France. They have access to debt funding and government backed Bpi.

40
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.339
David Ambler: John, right? Okay.

41
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.200
Chloe Lannert: Rock and roll.

42
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:17.449
David Ambler: sounds good, Mike. Maybe I'll I'll skip kind of what does it say? For a second we come back to it. I just want to show a little bit about this sort of

43
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:29.630
David Ambler: say versus price round, maybe just to give people a little perspective. So I'm sure most of you have seen the card of data. This is sort of the most recent cut at it, which

44
00:03:30.336 --> 00:03:52.970
David Ambler: there's a lot going on in the slide. If you've not seen it before, but effectively. What this is saying is that if you're raising less than 2.5 million dollars, you probably have done a safe if you're using carta. And, as you know, obviously, many of you know, Card has gotten more and more market share over the years. So I think anecdotally. This is also our perspective. I mean, it used to be 5, 10 years ago. Even that

45
00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:02.750
David Ambler: we were. There was some battle between, you know. Should we do price round a convertible? No, to safe? There was other instruments. Kiss and others and safes have really taken over.

46
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:20.019
David Ambler: and the data shows you like, you know, basically, almost all companies have raised on a safe compared to other choices here. If they're raising less than 2 and a half, I think, as you, as you go above that number. And and really, even as you approach 2 to 2 and a half.

47
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:37.809
David Ambler: I mean one thing that's interesting for you all to do, and Carta has a tool for this. We can help you with this which we will do for free for techstars. Companies just kind of helping you model. What's more dilutive, the reality is the reason they're sort of around 2 to 2 and a half is as you start to scale and raise more on safes.

48
00:04:37.840 --> 00:05:03.551
David Ambler: they become much more dilutive. And the next slide goes into a little bit of the dilution, and sorry to hit you with data right off the bat that you haven't seen. But as you'll see, you know, under 250 K. The Median dilutions are percent and a half. It says under 5, next to the big blue box. But that's that's not usually the case, for under 2 52 50 to 500 is around 5% dilution.

49
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:28.169
David Ambler: And you can see it kind of scale up here as as we go up. Just, you know, as an example, you know. Obviously, seed rounds are larger and we'll get. We have data on that which we'll get to in a little bit. But you know, seed rounds are around 20% dilution. That's kind of been the market norm like since the beginning of time. I mean, you know the like. The investors that we work with, and I work with light speed and benchmark, and many others, and Mike's done

50
00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:36.459
David Ambler: hundreds and hundreds of deals himself as well over the years, but they usually don't do a check for under 20%. Obviously, that's assuming they take the whole round.

51
00:05:37.073 --> 00:06:00.379
David Ambler: So states are really meant for smaller rounds. Obviously it's less dilution. But if you're working with an instrument, possibly from an investor who's not institutional or or is giving you terms that are different to this on a as converted basis in terms of dilution. You probably know you're working outside of what market norm is. Obviously, every sector is a little bit different. Every company is a little bit different.

52
00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:18.589
David Ambler: But this gives you a good benchmark to kind of understand? Like, okay, fine. I'm gonna go raise like, how much should I raise if it is a safe? I know I want to be quick, easy, and fast. I don't want to pay my lawyers a bunch of money and then negotiate docs over 8 weeks. Obviously, safes are are much cheaper. But this gives you a decent perspective.

53
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.894
David Ambler: Mike, and maybe I'll flip back and then have you kind of start out just kind of quickly. Walk through kind of what safe are. And

54
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.589
David Ambler: yeah, how to think about it.

55
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:49.139
Mike Pestana: Yeah, for sure. And I'm I'm also like, I'm a pretty even though the the stats say otherwise. I'm a pretty big advocate of really simple price rounds in lieu of safes. So safes have their place, I think, in like early stage financings. But you know, you can raise a million bucks or 2 million bucks on a price round. If you just keep the docs really lean, and you know you might be looking at more like $1520,000 in legal fees, instead of like

56
00:06:49.150 --> 00:07:06.869
Mike Pestana: like a few $1,000 in legal fees. But safes can be a pain when they convert. You know you have to go out and get a bunch of people to sign up to the documents. People might be slow. Angel investors are sort of off the grid and that can hold up your your price round when you when you do have one. It also can

57
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:29.449
Mike Pestana: relieve the bigger concern which is like what we're we're gonna talk about here, which is like the uncertainty with, like, how much solution is being caused by the safes, something you'd have to model out ahead of time and something that's like a moving target. As you raise more safes. So the big takeaway from that is like, if you are interested in a really early price round for like a million bucks, or something that is doable with like reasonable legal fees. And there are benefits to that.

58
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.830
David Ambler: Yep.

59
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:53.099
Mike Pestana: yeah, in terms of like, what is a safe? And how does it work? So you're probably familiar with generally what it is. So a safe is specifically not a convertible note, but it acts in the same way. So, like a few decades ago, we only use convertible notes at the early stages, and that was like an actual loan to the company that would convert into equity on a price round

60
00:07:53.770 --> 00:08:05.780
Mike Pestana: Downside was that had an interest rate. And then there are certain like local requirements with respect to being like a lender that people mostly disregarded. But both those things cause kind of headaches for investors and the company.

61
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:19.979
Mike Pestana: The other part of it, too, is that notes were highly negotiated. There wasn't like a standardized version of the notes, so it took forever to do one. The safes, on the other hand, are extremely standardized auto. Just print them offline and sign them

62
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:40.869
Mike Pestana: They work about the same. But the key differences are one. It's not debt. It's actually a security unto itself that converts into a preferred stock of the company at your price round, and there's no interest, rate, or maturity date on it, so a safe can in theory stay outstanding forever if you never do a price round.

63
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.940
David Ambler: Yeah, Andrew, do you have a question? By the way.

64
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:55.109
Andrew Fernandes: Yeah, you said, I just wanna make sure I understand your previous point about saves kind of kicking the can down the road. If I am interpreting this right? It's gonna require more

65
00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.090
Andrew Fernandes: legwork, paperwork and some fees when they convert later. Is that right?

66
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:21.040
Mike Pestana: Yeah, that's right. So like in my experience, like a lot of people are raised like, let's say, 1020, safe or something. When you do your price round your series seed, you're gonna have to go get signatures from those safe holders. Now, technically, the safes automatically convert. So you can make the argument to your cash investors saying like, Well, they automatically convert, why do I have to worry about this?

67
00:09:21.569 --> 00:09:29.230
Mike Pestana: But the downside is, there's there's ambiguity, and whether they're actually bound by the financing documents and some of the particular provisions in there.

68
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:52.060
Mike Pestana: if they don't sign, even though they're obligated to sign. So the net net of that is that you end up having to go out and getting those 10 safe holder signatures when you close the price round and like inevitably one or 2 people are like in Africa, or like, you know, on a boat, and you can't reach them, and it becomes hard to track them down. So that's why I say, like it is, it can be more of an administrative hassle to have a bunch of safes outstanding.

69
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.370
Andrew Fernandes: And if you can't, you need physical signatures for these.

70
00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.829
Mike Pestana: No, you can do it by docusign.

71
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:06.409
Andrew Fernandes: And if let's say, like 4 out of your 5 stakeholders sign, and one doesn't, what happens.

72
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:29.730
Mike Pestana: So a lot of people just close over it. So your lead investor for your seed around may just say, Wow, it's maybe like a $1020,000 safe like, who cares? Let's just close, anyway. It's a small amount of risk. But there are some investors who will say, no, you have to go out and get that signature, and I've never seen a company not close because of a signature on a safe. But I've seen things get delayed, and a delay is is, you know.

73
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.720
Mike Pestana: also bad.

74
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:39.130
Andrew Fernandes: And what exactly is that risk? Is it a risk that, like your your stakeholders gonna come back and sue you, or something because they haven't signed on to the conversion.

75
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:57.920
Mike Pestana: Yeah. So like the the nitty gritty of it is like, a good example is like the what's called drag along provision, the voting agreement, so like when you sign up to a price round, you'll have this provision that says that a subset of the stockholders can drag the boat of the other subset of stockholders. In a single transaction. If you receive majority consent.

76
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:05.460
Mike Pestana: it's arguable that that safe holder is not actually bound by that drag along. If they don't sign what's called the voting agreement.

77
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:19.709
Mike Pestana: the additional background of that is inside the safe. They're obligated to actually sign the financing documents, so you can sort of take them to court and say, Hey, you have to sign this document, and then, once you sign it, the drag is enforceable. But, as you can imagine, that's a huge pain.

78
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:21.790
David Ambler: Exactly.

79
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.740
Andrew Fernandes: Got it? Thanks.

80
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:41.670
David Ambler: Maybe just to hit hit a couple of topics on this page. I mean, I think, for for those who are familiar this is probably one on one. But there's obviously a couple of ways these States convert. They don't convert at the price that the seed investors pay. They converted a discount to that price.

81
00:11:42.000 --> 00:12:04.679
David Ambler: I will say, even investors, that I work with a lot sometimes mistake kind of what the what the purpose is of a discount versus valuation cap. I always think of a percentage discount is really downside protection, and the valuation cap is really upside protection for the investor. So if you have, you know you were going to do a round at, you know, 10 million bucks. But, like man, you guys killed it. And now you're going to do a round

82
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:28.109
David Ambler: at 250, pre. Having to convert having the valuation cap, and there is really kind of protection from them from that runaway upside versus the percentage discount like. No matter what happens, they're always getting a discount. Let's just say it goes down from what their expectations are. They're still getting a discount relative to the seed investors, because they obviously took on more risk. So the valuation cap is sometimes, you'll see, saves that. Just say.

83
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:58.780
David Ambler: you know, it's just the valuation cap. Funny enough, like if you I've seen safe drafted where, let's say, the valuation cap you set in a safe at 10 million. The rounds are like 6 million. Well do they convert to 10? Sometimes the safes actually say that which is good for the company. Investors don't like that. Obviously it should say the lower of whatever the conversion price is pursuant to the cap and the round price. But I'd say it's less and less common to see both of these in here. You sometimes do see it. Valuation cap, at least. From my perspective, Mike, I see a lot more.

84
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:08.100
Mike Pestana: Oh, yeah, I think if you look at the stats valuation caps for like early investors are like, I mean, it's gotta be like 90% plus like, especially from like institutional investors. It's probably like a hundred percent.

85
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:34.280
Mike Pestana: Because, you know, if you were investor right, you want to know how much or what percentage you're going to get on conversion, which is which is good for the investor. And you know, maybe slightly worse, for the company. Sometimes percentage discounts actually work out to be better than valuation caps at the early stage. But I think we find that, like, you know, most valuation caps 5, 10 million dollars like it's pretty rare to raise a price around below these early stage valuation caps. So

86
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.489
Mike Pestana: usually the discount which only applies at the

87
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:44.669
Mike Pestana: the valuation of the price round is lower than the valuation cap. Usually those discounts just kind of get disregarded.

88
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.790
David Ambler: Yeah.

89
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:59.369
David Ambler: I'd say another way, as we go to just go back to this or go to the dilution data per second. I get we get asked a lot like Well, what should the valuation cap be right like somebody told me 10. Somebody told me 1215. Should I ask for 15,

90
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:21.350
David Ambler: like, I think I'm going to raise this, but if I get a worse, should I raise less? Right? There's there's that question that comes up all the time. I mean, the reality is, card has data on that, and we can send you as much data as you like. But I think you should ground yourself in dilution, right? Like, if somebody's just saying Well, we think it should be. Just look at the data and figure out what the dilution is going to be. And if the dilutions outside the scope of the median like.

91
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:38.500
David Ambler: you know, unless they're one standard deviation from the mean away, I think you've got legs to go argue for whatever you think is fair. I mean, sometimes you just feel like I don't care what the data says it should be X, and it rubs both ways. But you know, I'd say definitely, pay attention to what dilution is before you get too deep.

92
00:14:40.410 --> 00:15:02.079
Mike Pestana: I mean, that's the biggest that's by far. The biggest mistake that we see is that in these post money valuation caps, you know, you put like a 5 million dollar post money cap on it, and as you raise more money, your effective Pre money cap, meaning the the capital that actually converts that keeps going down. So if you have a post money valuation cap of 5 million. But you've raised a million dollars. But now your pre money cap

93
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:11.359
Mike Pestana: is 4 million, because on a post money basis, when it converts, it's going to be 5 million. Now, let's say you raise 2 million. Your company should be more valuable. That's not how the safe works, though

94
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:24.073
Mike Pestana: your pre money valuation in that case goes down to 3 million. So you see, as you raise more money, it's the opposite of what you would expect. You don't become more valuable, you become less, and that's why a lot of lawyers really hate saves.

95
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.990
David Ambler: Yeah.

96
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:48.350
David Ambler: and we can. I want to get to that, too. In a second. I mean, there's sort of like the pre money versus post money discussion like there's like some blog posts out there, people saying, Oh, it should go back to Pre. Money and post money is not fair, and you know, for those who don't know like Yc. Used to be pre money, I think the reality is like you can argue for whatever you're going to argue for the market is a move to post money saves, and there are arguments that go both ways.

97
00:15:48.440 --> 00:16:05.969
David Ambler: and we've modeled this before for companies in terms of like what's beneficial. The reality is like there's always going to be triggers that change the result that you don't know. Like, for instance, the post money safe, you know, if the round option pool size is 10% versus 15% has a massive change

98
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:19.339
David Ambler: on, you know, what's more beneficial relative to the pre money safe? So in any event, this is all comes down to modeling. I wouldn't read blog posts too closely. I'd follow the market. Look at solution. Come up with what's right for you. But just know that's out there.

99
00:16:19.828 --> 00:16:42.619
David Ambler: I'd say the other thing just hit this the last 2 things. Here, Mike, maybe you cover amendment thresholds, and I'll do Mfn, you sometimes will see Mfn in there and like. Sometimes this is sector specific. I see this come up constantly in Fintech and Web 3 with Mfns, just for whatever reason. Usually side letters get highly negotiated there, too. But for those who aren't familiar. Basically, this says that if you do another safe round

100
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.750
David Ambler: after the initial close, there's better terms, ie. Valuation cap.

101
00:16:46.980 --> 00:17:03.619
David Ambler: that they can also get the benefit of those terms. So just be wary of that, I'd say that's just less common for a company that's sort of like early doing well during their 1st raise. If somebody's asking for this like sure. Can you get it? Absolutely? I don't think it's certainly not automatic, and I'd be wary of it.

102
00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.059
David Ambler: Mike, do you want to hit the memo threshold just quick.

103
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:16.079
Mike Pestana: Yeah, I mean, usually, you try to get them together. So

104
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:29.349
Mike Pestana: you try to have a 50% amendment threshold of your entire group of safe holders. So sometimes safe holders will say, like, you can't amend my safe without my specific consent. That individual investor ideally. What you want to say is.

105
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:51.770
Mike Pestana: it's a majority of all investors based on the dollars they invested. So if you raise a million bucks and they have, you know, $500,001 invested, they have over 50% control. They control amendments for all of the safes. The reason you do that is it, mimics preferred stock in which usually a majority of the preferred stockholders vote together to make any changes to the preferred stock.

106
00:17:51.770 --> 00:18:04.650
Mike Pestana: So you'll see this change quite often with institutional investors. Honestly, you probably accept it. If it's a big sort of lead style investor. But for smaller guys you should push back and be like, no, I'm not going to give them an individual blocking right on amendments.

107
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:13.029
David Ambler: Yup, Mike, do you wanna hit save stacking where I can cover too. First.st

108
00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:40.439
Mike Pestana: I, yeah, I mean, so safe stacking is like, we have different valuation caps on on safes where you stack them together. So you start at 4 million, you go to 8 million, go to 10 million. You have these caps at, you know, different levels that can be beneficial. In the sense that you know later, cap safes they convert at a higher dollar value. So if you buy a safe at 8 million post money valuation, you're getting less for your dollar than if you bought it a 1 million post money valuation.

109
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.420
Mike Pestana: The tricky part with safe stacking is that

110
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.210
Mike Pestana: if you don't modify the safes

111
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:57.650
Mike Pestana: appropriately. All the safes that you stack together will be counted against all the valuation caps so like, for example, on like a 1 money valuation cap.

112
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:11.790
Mike Pestana: If you keep upping your valuation, you're like, oh, I'm raising 4 million now at 8 million post money valuation cap safe. And you had that initial 1 million cap. Well, now that initial 1 million cap safe is broken, and the reason it's broken is because

113
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:20.089
Mike Pestana: a 1 million post money valuation cap will deduct the entire amount that you raise under all safes, unless you modify the safe.

114
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:26.880
Mike Pestana: That means that the valuation cap and the price per share on conversion is below 0. It's negative. So it's just broken safe

115
00:19:27.285 --> 00:19:33.840
Mike Pestana: this happens all the time. So you can modify the safes to make this work. Basically, what you do is you say that

116
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:46.419
Mike Pestana: the safes as a group sort of the 1 million cap saves the 4 million caps attend. Only the dollars raised under those particular saves, as a group will get counted against the post money valuation cap of that group

117
00:19:47.360 --> 00:20:11.450
Mike Pestana: that works. But it's kind of complicated. And you have to actually have somebody draft that the better solution is just to be conscious of either. If you're gonna stack saves using a pre money valuation cap instead of a post is a lot better, because there's no deduction for the dollars. You raise it more, more or less mimics a preferred stock round or just don't stack because it can become messy. Basically.

118
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:36.260
David Ambler: Yeah. And even outside of kind of breaking the model. Even if the math works, I find that even really smart founders, when I get on the phone with them. And they're like, all right, I did one out of 15 now, I'm doing at 30, and then a 50, and they're like going up every time the reality is, it's really hard to model what the dilution actually is. And I've definitely seen founders give way more of their company away than they intended to, just because they haven't figured out exactly how to do the math. And they haven't modeled it correctly, like I've seen people

119
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:49.250
David Ambler: give away 40% of their company before the seed round. Just not thinking clearly about this. So I'd just be really careful as you stack safe, even though in your mind it's like, Oh, I just doubled the valuation. It's it can be. It can be painful.

120
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.750
Ankur Toshniwal: What is what is so complex about the map.

121
00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:58.630
Ankur Toshniwal: isn't it? Just like a percentage of the valuation cap at a Max? And then you just do it per

122
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.950
Ankur Toshniwal: like if you if you're if you if you're getting 50 K. At.

123
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:08.419
Ankur Toshniwal: you know, 5 million post money, and then you get 100 K at 10 million. Valuation right like

124
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.909
Ankur Toshniwal: these are. But they're both one like, you know.

125
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:21.160
Ankur Toshniwal: that that could just. Is there something like the math behind that? Is it like really complicated beyond that? Or is that is that's really it. Right?

126
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.290
Ankur Toshniwal: It's not the percentage.

127
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:43.409
David Ambler: Yeah, it's not that. It's that complicated. I just think it's hard to track it as you go along, right. And and to my point. If you haven't modified the safe to say that the valuation caps track to each other, and you have separate series of safes, converting with like series a dash, you know, a prime, a 2, a 3, a 4. If you raise on valuation caps it just it's something that gets overlooked. I'll put it that way.

128
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:49.599
Mike Pestana: Yeah, like, where people get tripped up is like, let's say, you raise on a 1 million cap, and then you raise like a 4 million cap like.

129
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.100
Mike Pestana: if you raised

130
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:56.870
Mike Pestana: 2 million bucks under that 4 million cap, you give away, you've given away 50% of the company.

131
00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.752
Ankur Toshniwal: Oh, yeah, what the who's doing that? Oh, my God! This is horror story!

132
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.339
Mike Pestana: Yeah. And then you'll.

133
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:02.660
Ankur Toshniwal: Oh, man!

134
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.329
Mike Pestana: Cap is potentially broken, too, in that scenario. So like.

135
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:14.920
Mike Pestana: even yeah. So even if you don't break them out, it's really so we'll sometimes we'll see like 50 saves like, and there'll be a different caps, and that's like

136
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:25.899
Mike Pestana: it's really almost impossible for a founder to know how much of the company they own both. So but that problem basically is like, you just gotta model it, you know, or have, like Paul Hastings, model it for you ideally.

137
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:26.710
David Ambler: Yeah.

138
00:22:28.753 --> 00:22:55.409
David Ambler: I'd say, the other thing that you know, you go to Yc's website, or you get the safe right? And you're like, all right. Well, here's the safe. Here's a side letter outside letter like that. Seems simple enough. The reality is. There's lots of side letters getting negotiated now in safe rounds. I've seen actually, like companies spend $20,000 negotiating side letters with investors like multiple rounds over multiple weeks, negotiating what the right should be to Mike's Point earlier on like, should you have just done a price round?

139
00:22:55.829 --> 00:23:02.540
David Ambler: You know, investors are looking for things you might otherwise see in the in the seed, financing documents, including information rights.

140
00:23:02.992 --> 00:23:08.550
David Ambler: Obviously board observer rights come up a lot pro router rights, which is already, you know, a standard for

141
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:29.710
David Ambler: for the Yc forms. But you know any dilution protection I've seen recently. You know certain covenants, things that you can. You can't do without their consent. Again, like these are things that would not have been in the safe, and was not originally intended to be in safe and as safe rounds have gotten larger. We have seen investors ask for things that would only usually be asked for in price rounds. So

142
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:45.489
David Ambler: I just be wary of that. It's another thing to kind of flush out with your investors in advance, and like, what are the expectations? If you heard the word standard side letter like that means nothing right. So I would just be wary of that, as you're comparing term sheets and talking to investors. And

143
00:23:45.838 --> 00:23:59.490
David Ambler: not that you want to make it about legal. But again, like, if you're expecting the safe round to get done in 2 weeks and cost you 5,000 bucks, and they have some crazy side letter. It might be 6 weeks, and it might be 25,000 bucks, which is just annoying, for

144
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:08.319
David Ambler: we're founders to have to deal with right, and I've seen it with sophisticated funds isn't just, you know, small investors who don't know what they're doing so. And in fact, it's quite the opposite.

145
00:24:08.973 --> 00:24:11.680
David Ambler: Mike, I don't know if you had anything else to add on this one.

146
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:24.249
Mike Pestana: Yeah, the standard side letter is always a fun one, like people would be like, Oh, we can close tomorrow is our standard side letter, and they'll have, like, you know, 4 pages of like standard side letter stuff. So like, yeah, just want to be careful, like, I actually think like smart if I represented.

147
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:48.999
Mike Pestana: which I sometimes do like seed investors, I actually do try to get them perpetual parador rights, and like, maybe for like a really good seed investor. That's okay. But there are things like that that you might want to modify or think about. There's also like ongoing reporting stuff. That sounds reasonable when you're small, but at scale is like insane things like, Oh, you know our Kpi reporting every month, or something on some sort of metrics. And you know, when you're a smaller company. It's not a big deal.

148
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.359
Mike Pestana: You have a hundred stockholders, and you're at scale.

149
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.230
Mike Pestana: It becomes kind of crazy. So there are just things to think about. Yeah, the early stages.

150
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.390
David Ambler: Down.

151
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.089
Chloe Lannert: Real quick, Antoine, do you want to jump in with your question?

152
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.623
antoinecarriere: Ha happy to, but but then I'll I'll start with another one. We are all

153
00:25:12.729 --> 00:25:38.530
antoinecarriere: we have that side later from textiles. Because we're all kind of textiles company at this at this point. And so should we just kind of use that as the template. Hey, we're already. This is the and extend the textiles rights, for example, the information rights to other investors coming in. Isn't that the simple and easy way to do it.

154
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:48.060
David Ambler: You, you would think so. Yeah, you usually it doesn't work. Usually everyone has their own form. I mean, you can try to, you know, like, here's what you think you. You can try to put people on a new form.

155
00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:56.349
David Ambler: If you're negotiating a new round. But the reality is, most folks are either gonna have their own or they're gonna certainly want to negotiate it.

156
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.870
antoinecarriere: Okay.

157
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.659
antoinecarriere: And so then, for my my question, my.

158
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:26.590
antoinecarriere: it's kind of the so the convertible note question. So right now same thing, we are all kind of takes us company of the of the of a batch where the investment was at a convertible note, and not the safe and and believe that everyone took the convertible notes in the in the batch. But maybe not.

159
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:42.790
antoinecarriere: Which means that kind of that hypothetical situation. Is not that hypothetical where you could, you could you could you could. You could be in a situation assuming you're barely profitable or profitable.

160
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:54.959
antoinecarriere: Where? And you're not raising right away, because that convertible note has a 2 year duration we could be like 2 years from now. In the middle of closing around

161
00:26:55.371 --> 00:27:14.350
antoinecarriere: and and had a valuation cap of 3 million. I believe. I I don't remember correctly, but let's call it the 3 million, and let's call it for the sake of the discussion, relatively low. Let's say that the the valuation that you're closing your ground at is more like 5 to 10 million. What do you? What do you do.

162
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.929
antoinecarriere: or what do you advise with the that- that company to.

163
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:31.061
Mike Pestana: So what I heard is like, the valuation is 3 million. It's relatively low, and you're going into a price round

164
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.020
antoinecarriere: At 5, let's say.

165
00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:38.879
Mike Pestana: At 5. Okay? And and then what? What's the objective with the with the convertible.

166
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.840
antoinecarriere: I mean the convertible. You could. You could convert it.

167
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.370
antoinecarriere: and then you will give equity at a 3 million cap

168
00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:51.819
antoinecarriere: or you could reimburse the convertible

169
00:27:52.330 --> 00:28:10.409
antoinecarriere: loan, wait for the wait for the for the expiration date, reimburse it, and have your price round. That was kind of let's say it was planned on March 30, th and you're going to have your price round happen on April 10.th

170
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.580
antoinecarriere: And now you've kind of you've avoided the the dilution.

171
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:33.990
antoinecarriere: and textile is happy because it's founder friendly and they already have, like a 6% with the the initial investment. But they're kind of they're a little bumped to some extent because they but they understand because they want what's best for the founders.

172
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:50.519
David Ambler: Yeah, I'd say what you're describing, just ignoring what the tech stars note says for a second, what you're describing would be very unusual. Most investors, if we're just sitting down today and writing a convertible note from scratch would never give the company the option to pay them back in cash like. That's a huge loss for them.

173
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:55.109
David Ambler: so most will say that they they have the choice, but you do not.

174
00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.659
David Ambler: and so they would have the option to convert into equity.

175
00:28:59.050 --> 00:28:59.590
David Ambler: But they.

176
00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.709
antoinecarriere: I have to continue.

177
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:15.930
antoinecarriere: but but the the convertible note from textiles I I kind of maybe I misread the the legalese that we signed, but I do believe that has an expiration date. That is 2 years, and so for the 2 years they have the option to convert.

178
00:29:16.775 --> 00:29:22.830
antoinecarriere: But after the 2 years you are, the company are obligated to reimburse.

179
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:24.849
antoinecarriere: And and you're not.

180
00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.560
antoinecarriere: Yeah. When yeah.

181
00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:36.799
David Ambler: Yeah. When when convertible notes mature, I mean, this happens. A lot seems to happen all the time, like people are like, Hey, it's expiring. What do we do? It's mature. Do we pay it back like, are we like? Are they gonna sue us?

182
00:29:36.800 --> 00:30:01.110
David Ambler: Can they take our assets like what happens most of the time. We just leave them out there like nothing happens. Right? The reality is, the investor is not going to sue you because it's mature, and you haven't paid them back or converted it, and you're not going to do anything. And so we just let them hang. Sometimes you'd go to the effort to extend the expiration date. And then companies that are growth stage companies. We would, in fact, use that as a little bit of a hammer to like, hey? We'll extend it by 6 months, but then we may try to extract some value. And

183
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:28.720
David Ambler: so it's a conversation. I mean, the safes don't have that same issue, which is another reason people like them. But the reality is like, it just depends on what the document says. It'd be pretty unusual to to do that. I mean, you could. We can talk separately about the tech stars. Now, I don't really want to debate that on this call. But I think the reality is, most of them. Don't say that, and the expectation would be that you would convert them or extend it if you felt the need to. Usually at the very early stage. You don't bother Mike. I don't know if you have other thoughts.

184
00:30:29.613 --> 00:30:32.649
Mike Pestana: Yeah. So I'd say a little more color on it.

185
00:30:32.730 --> 00:31:01.421
Mike Pestana: So I don't know. Yeah, I know I I haven't read the techstars note in detail, so I don't know I'm happy to look at it. But yeah, I mean a standard note that I would draft would would say that even if you hit the maturity date, repayment requires consent of the investor. For this exact reason. The other thing is like practically like again, not with respect to techstar specifically, or if we're talking about any investor like, it would pretty much blow that relationship. And, like most Vc investors at this stage, won't want to see that happen.

186
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:19.819
Mike Pestana: and maybe the 3rd thing is, I actually have. I have had a client get sued over a maturity date one time for $25,000, and an important thing to keep in mind is that usually the notes are amendable by a majority consent of all the note holders.

187
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:36.899
Mike Pestana: But if you go past the maturity date. California courts, at least in this case, held that it had to be amended by the individual note holder which is important for repayment. So again, that's why convertible notes are less optimal sometimes for investors and for founders depending on the circumstances.

188
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:58.829
antoinecarriere: That's that's helpful. I am just kind of the the reason why I'm asking about that is, I do believe this is the situation that pretty much. All dispatch and all the tech start companies to date are in. And I get your point around like the whole

189
00:31:59.462 --> 00:32:22.929
antoinecarriere: the the point is not too much is not so much to trick the system. It's just kind of to to. I do understand that pretty much companies that have hit that that expiration window are either dead or or or no. Nobody cares at this point in time, although there's legal is that says that you need to to pay back.

190
00:32:23.426 --> 00:32:26.159
antoinecarriere: I'm just kind of a I do.

191
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:27.930
antoinecarriere: I do want the

192
00:32:28.777 --> 00:32:38.439
antoinecarriere: given. The fact that a lot of the companies this time around are already revenue, generating at the time that they get the the text, our money.

193
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.850
antoinecarriere: if that might not be something that that might happen.

194
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.860
antoinecarriere: And I just I just don't.

195
00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.980
antoinecarriere: Yeah, I I won't. I won't bother you more on that. I'd love to

196
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.410
antoinecarriere: think about that more at some point.

197
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.020
David Ambler: Back to

198
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.996
David Ambler: go back to Safe or the Nvca. Financing docs. Anyone else have any questions on safe before we move on to

199
00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:06.630
David Ambler: Nvca.

200
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.020
Mike Pestana: I think that was it for the chat.

201
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:19.000
David Ambler: Cool, Mike, do you want to start out on this one.

202
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:20.230
Mike Pestana: Yeah, sure.

203
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.760
David Ambler: I'll flip the slide.

204
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:42.249
Mike Pestana: Yeah. So you can see valuation premium for AI. This is why a lot of times lawyers and investors will tell you like you should have an AI story, even if you're not like an AI company per se, and like, you can kind of spin your product a little. AI heavy because in the last couple of years, you know, there's been an AI premium. I actually think this is completely

205
00:33:42.410 --> 00:34:06.859
Mike Pestana: my own read and gut feeling. I think the AI premium is going to reverse soon enough, like maybe not immediately. But the oversaturation of AI companies in the market may actually work to the detriment of AI valuations, where kind of like we saw with like Web 3, and crypto, where we everyone wanted like a web. 3 story. It was like boosting valuations in like 20 and 21 the inverse happened to where? Then, if you mentioned Web 3 in like 2,023 people were like.

206
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:18.290
Mike Pestana: you know, we don't want to hear that, basically. So a little, this is like marketing over substance. But you know, there also are like very genuine AI companies that have a good AI story. So you know, it's food for thought mostly.

207
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.580
David Ambler: Yep.

208
00:34:20.568 --> 00:34:48.960
David Ambler: and I think the data speaks for itself. I mean, obviously, if you just slap AI on any company name, it doesn't work. But you know, for for those of you that are in tech source program, if you're claiming AI, it's usually application layer, usually not foundation layer at this point, and, you know, really tackling the issue. As compared to like, I'm doing some Ipos for companies who are like a cyber security company, for instance, and they're trying to tack on AI to the platform. But it's really not the core function. It's not AI native. So

209
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:55.690
David Ambler: it's certainly different versus AI, native cool.

210
00:34:55.699 --> 00:35:02.289
Ankur Toshniwal: Can I? Can? I ask something? Okay. So I hear the term a lot. And I don't really know what non

211
00:35:02.569 --> 00:35:07.699
Ankur Toshniwal: like non technical engineers, or like people think, what does AI native mean to you?

212
00:35:07.889 --> 00:35:11.549
Ankur Toshniwal: What do you? How do in your mind? How do you? What do you think the distinction is? Yeah.

213
00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:23.459
David Ambler: I would say, AI, native is like all. Let me let me answer in the negative first.st So like a company that was, let's say you're a staff security company and you secure you know. Office 3, 65.

214
00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:46.660
David Ambler: Your core function is to go in and set you know controls over how people access office 365 in an environment right? Your posture management. And you might have you know, let's just say you're 4 year, 4 years in you have no AI, and then now you have some AI function. The AI function might be a chat so like how you engage with posture management functions.

215
00:35:46.660 --> 00:36:00.919
David Ambler: It might be you know, helping you figure out what what alerts are, and you know, maybe reducing the amount of alerts or categorizing them. Better so. I wouldn't consider that to be an AI native company like that's really a co-pilot, if you will.

216
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:27.940
David Ambler: To me like AI. Native is your, you know, fine tuning llama with proprietary data or you know custom instructions, and, like your true function, is to, you know, use Gen. AI or something, some derivation thereof to go generate revenue. So there's there's no sort of like absent AI. Put it this way, absent AI like there is no company right versus. If I strip that from a cyber company, does that feel right?

217
00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.099
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, that's all right. Cool. Thank you. Appreciate it.

218
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:58.270
Mike Pestana: I also think it's a great question for anyone in any vertical to be like, ask like a non technical person, what they think, what you're saying means, because, like a lot of these, these will be like, they'll say they're technical, or they have like a mit degree from like 20 years ago, and like they haven't really used it. And like, it's important. What like the average person, the average like educated person thinks about your product and your slogan and what you're selling and stuff they can like reasonably understand it. I think that's like a good like benchmark, for like, are you marketing it correctly?

219
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:02.470
David Ambler: Cool.

220
00:37:02.802 --> 00:37:07.459
David Ambler: Mike, do you wanna take kind of quick overview? We don't have to cover every one of these rights, but.

221
00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:32.260
Mike Pestana: Yeah, I'd say, yeah, dividends. Most tech companies won't worry about those. So they're public. So okay, disregard basically, dividends will be issued. The board approves, and but they're equal among preferred stockholders and common stockholders. Occasionally you see something like an 8% dividend right for preferred stockholders. If you see that ask your lawyers to take it out. Liquidation preference. This is the one we probably all know about. So the investors get paid back the better of

222
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:39.810
Mike Pestana: usually one times their investment, so their original investment amount or and not, and but or

223
00:37:39.900 --> 00:38:06.820
Mike Pestana: they get to convert to common stock and participate with the founders in liquidity situation. So if you sell the company, let's say you invested a million bucks and you sold the company, and the resulting proceeds were $500,000. All those proceeds would go to pay back the investors or liquidation preference, which was a million dollars. On the other hand, if your proceeds were something like 5 million dollars in a liquidation. Preference was a million. Well, now they're better off. Had they converted a common stock? Probably

224
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:19.599
Mike Pestana: because the proceeds will probably be higher to the the preferred stockholders and their liquidation preference. So it's what's also referred to as their downside protection. If you don't beat their original valuation

225
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:39.090
Mike Pestana: anti dilution protections. If you do a down round, there's a kind of a complex formula to how the preferred stockholders end up with more shares of stock. In practice, it's actually not more shares per se. It's more shares on conversion. But that's a technical point. Basically, just think, anti dilution means that in a down round your investors get more ownership

226
00:38:40.110 --> 00:39:01.340
Mike Pestana: per rata rights means the right to buy stock in the future. Financing. Usually it's tied to their percentage ownership prior to that particular financing. So if they had 5% of the series seed going into the series, a, they have 5% per rata right? But then you fast forward to the series, either per router rights probably diluted down to something much lower. And it's that that diluted per router right into the series. Either they could take

227
00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:11.690
Mike Pestana: so it can change over time. Registration rights are the force registration of the stock on a public market don't really need to worry about that. The early stages, or somebody can talk to lawyers about

228
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:19.249
Mike Pestana: broadcast refusal and secondary transfers. This is important for founders in particular, because it relates to your stock, so

229
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:38.719
Mike Pestana: your common stock will have 2 right of 1st refusals on it. This is respect to selling it one. If you try to sell your stock to a 3rd party, the company will have the right to buy the stock ahead of that 3rd party at the same price per share and 2. If the company says no, the investors and usually just the major investors.

230
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:51.300
Mike Pestana: will have the right to buy that stock ahead. A 3rd party. There's a reflexive right known as the co-sale right. That is the right of an existing stockholder, like an investor to sell part of their shares in your transaction.

231
00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:57.339
Mike Pestana: Which means, if you sold a million shares and they own 5% of the company stock, they can sell

232
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:04.649
Mike Pestana: 50,000 shares in that transaction which would come off of your 1 million something like that. But

233
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:11.390
Mike Pestana: usually 90% plus in secondary transactions. The stockholders waive those rights

234
00:40:12.595 --> 00:40:41.020
Mike Pestana: reporting is like financial statements for the most part. Usually it's on a quarterly basis and one on the annual basis at our stage. It's going to be unaudited. As you scale the audited financial statements inspection rights are similar. This is it's sort of an add on it's a contractual. Add on to the Delaware default rights which gives every stockholder the right to review the company's books and records is what they call it the contractual right there removes the threshold. Question of whether they have a proper purpose to do the inspection, which is a Delaware

235
00:40:41.602 --> 00:40:48.530
Mike Pestana: kind of technical question. Most major investors get inspection rights, but smaller investors may not.

236
00:40:49.144 --> 00:41:04.240
Mike Pestana: The board. Just you know how many directors you have usually at this stage, you know, kind of the 1st price round we'd like to see 3 board members, one of which is the investor, 2 of which are the common stockholders and voting is usually just one to one

237
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:17.460
Mike Pestana: for preferred and common stock. But your preferred stockholders often have blocking rights like when you raise more money, you might have to get a majority of your investors to consent, or if you sell the company, there are a few other things that are common.

238
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:18.790
David Ambler: Yeah.

239
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:47.569
David Ambler: I'd say to just maybe a couple of high level points on the board, I mean, Mike mentioned one board seat for the investors, and 2 for common. If you find yourself in a situation where you're either losing outright control or investors are getting the same amount of votes on the board as a common. That's usually a big red flag for me like you should not be giving up control like affirmative control on the board in your 1st price round. That's something I sometimes hear like, Oh, there's a Co. Lead investor. We each want a board seat. There's 2 founders. Are you cool with

240
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:52.169
David Ambler: 2, 2, and one so like an independent director, I view that as giving up control.

241
00:41:52.597 --> 00:42:12.150
David Ambler: I would resist that if I were you guys, that's something to navigate a little bit as you start to get into conversations like well in advance, because you can kind of get pushed into that a little bit as you advance negotiations, especially if you're kind of advancing them independently. But that's definitely a big red flag. I'd say, too, on dual class versus single voting.

242
00:42:12.548 --> 00:42:28.700
David Ambler: We get asked a lot like we've done it enough. Mike and I just did a dual class financing. Obviously, that's case by case you all aware of generally what it is, is sort of super voting shares. We I, Mary, who couldn't join like we just did an AI financing with dual class

243
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:35.379
David Ambler: for serial founder. So it definitely is something that comes up. If anyone's interested in exploring that, happy to happy to discuss it.

244
00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:52.470
Mike Pestana: Yeah. The other one, I'm kind of unrelated dual class is like what we get questions about founders preferred stock and what that means. Basically like a tax benefit to you. Set up an initial formation of the company. It's kind of gone out of style a little bit, but we still see founders asking about it. So that's another one I probably throw on there.

245
00:42:53.720 --> 00:43:17.520
David Ambler: Yeah, although I tend to think that's a bit of a waste of time. I mean, we we there are some law firms are still kind of pushing it to have the founders preferred where your comment converts to preferred stock into financing, so that investors get a tax benefit or founders also get a tax benefit from that. The reality is, you don't really need to do it. It's sort of salesy at this point to push it. If you have it great if you, if you don't have it, I wouldn't let anybody tell you you have to do it. But yeah, agreed

246
00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:29.240
David Ambler: cool. Yeah, we? There's a lot we can cover. I don't know would be helpful for folks if this is like now getting boring, or if, like, folks have high level questions on like how to approach investors, or what we're seeing, but happy to cover docs, too, or

247
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.240
David Ambler: whatever you think would be helpful.

248
00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.100
Chloe Lannert: I mean, I'll I'll let the the founders

249
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:39.949
Chloe Lannert: drive from here. What what isn't making sense?

250
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:57.669
Chloe Lannert: What's hard? What's weird? I know we've had a few other people join since we 1st did the little intros. But if you want to drop in the chat, if you haven't already if you've raised any money prior to techstars the approximate timeline you're looking at raising.

251
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:05.360
Chloe Lannert: and then also feel free to unmute. If you have any any questions or sort of direction here.

252
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.929
Chloe Lannert: Harvest. I know you guys are. Yeah, Alex.

253
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:40.549
Alex Nativelle: Yeah, I think one of the things that I was looking for and you started touching upon in that. But like, what are the things that we shouldn't accept that are like non. You know what I think we should pay attention to. Of course there's a few things that we already know, like liquidation preference. If they're higher than 1, 1 is probably standard, if it's higher than one, then we should pay attention to it. Are there any things you talked about like the board seats. Are there any other things we we need to pay extra careful attention to.

254
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:47.889
David Ambler: I mean it could take us a lot of directions. I don't know, Mike, if anything pops out of you.

255
00:44:47.890 --> 00:45:03.030
Mike Pestana: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of stuff I see. So the board is a big one. The protective provisions oftentimes in the term sheet. They'll say something like standard Mvca protected provisions. Those are known as the blocking rights. So that's something that would require majority preferred stockholders to approve.

256
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:17.990
Mike Pestana: What I always say is in the term sheet. You really want to spell those out and know what they are, because they can throw in some obscure ones. Once you're drafting the docs so definitely want to get clarity in your protective revisions. Founder vesting is kind of a big one.

257
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:25.389
Mike Pestana: So oftentimes they'll be like, hey? I want you to reinvest your stock, and that should be negotiated the term sheet stage. It shouldn't be pop up later.

258
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:35.469
Mike Pestana: you know. There are maybe some other ones that are a little more bespoke to like different companies. I think. My well, there's 1, i would say that's

259
00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:50.410
Mike Pestana: personal to me. I I often try to negotiate around the blocking right on raising future cash. So this is non standard. But in the Mvc forms you have to get the consent of the majority of the preferred stockholders to approve future financing.

260
00:45:50.964 --> 00:46:17.480
Mike Pestana: I find that ethically dubious. I don't think that's right. I think the founders should be able to raise the money they want to raise. So we usually do when we have leverage is, we say, Well, if we do, an up round, and it's an institutional up round. Then we can raise without the consent of the majority of the preferred stockholders. That's a little more in the weeds, but it's something to think about. There's another one, founders asking about a lot which is like the sale of my business. What if I raise venture capital? Then I become sort of a

261
00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:23.729
Mike Pestana: like a normal business. It doesn't need more venture, and we're like 10 years down the line I want to sell. I don't want my venture back

262
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:31.400
Mike Pestana: people to block my sale of my company. You can draft around that. And I, if when you have leverage, we see that sometimes.

263
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:32.420
Mike Pestana: And

264
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:41.546
Mike Pestana: there's definitely a lot more things to get into in terms of like things you shouldn't accept. So the best rule is, hire a lawyer. I guess.

265
00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:56.530
David Ambler: I I'd say to just on like protect provisions where I we've seen it for years, but I see investors asking a lot for like hiring and firing executives, changing the business line like things that I consider to be operational. So any any sort of operational covenants where

266
00:46:56.988 --> 00:47:19.359
David Ambler: people are getting a block over something where I'd say like, Hey, listen! They're trying to grow the business and hire like, why do you have a block over sort of like day to day level activities. I get it if it's economic in nature related to their shares or selling the company, but that that's usually a no, no, for me, I'd say another one to be aware of, too, that doesn't often get addressed in term sheet. Sometimes it does just on your board seats like how you keep them, how you lose them. Right?

267
00:47:19.686 --> 00:47:42.290
David Ambler: So it comes up a lot. And this is not that interesting or not that different. But you know, do you have to be providing services like that? That definitely goes both ways like I, just for a company that's gonna do an Ipo next year had to like the board, pulled me in to remove a founder from the board, who was fighting with the other 2 founders, and we had to figure out like how to get the founder off the board, who was truly toxic.

268
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:55.129
David Ambler: very, very rare where this happens, especially for a company that was basically crushing it. But it does happen. And I and I know you all. I'm sure you know worried about horror stories of getting forced off the board. Very, very rare.

269
00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:16.219
David Ambler: but just in terms of how you keep your seat. Are you named? Is it services? If there's, you know, dual class stock. Is it a class BC class A/C again, if there's a 2 v 2 board and they're they're suggesting there's an independent. How does the independency get filled. Could it be the CEO that designates it? And then there's some other approval after that. So there's a lot of nuance around this. But.

270
00:48:16.676 --> 00:48:22.530
David Ambler: you know, I'd I'd say control at the early stage is super important because you're only gonna you're only gonna lose more as you do more rounds.

271
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:28.289
Mike Pestana: Yeah, I would double. I would double click on that. You're only gonna lose more. So get as much as you can. Early.

272
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.859
David Ambler: Anyone else have questions.

273
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:34.920
David Ambler: Antoine?

274
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:46.759
antoinecarriere: Yeah, yeah. So so the the points you were making, Mike, were all to to put in the rights of 1st refusal and Post Sale Agreement Category.

275
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.900
antoinecarriere: Okay?

276
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.760
Mike Pestana: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah. Ray, raising more money

277
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:56.480
Mike Pestana: and a sales company. Those are the 2 big ones.

278
00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:02.470
antoinecarriere: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so that's that's basically at your your point, just to make sure I got it right is

279
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:25.120
antoinecarriere: the. It's it's fair, I mean, it's kind of totally acceptable to attempt to negotiate an absence of right of 1st refusal when the the round is an up round and and on the the co-sell agreement. It's totally fair if you're in a position of strength to

280
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:35.540
antoinecarriere: not agree to a need for the the preferred stockholders to accept a sale of the company.

281
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:38.139
Mike Pestana: Yeah, I'd say

282
00:49:38.230 --> 00:50:03.790
Mike Pestana: it's definitely non market, and people will be surprised. They'll be like, kind of taken aback by it. So if you do want to be aggressive on those terms. I think it's important to like, be upfront and be like, Hey, we're gonna go unique on this. But yeah, I mean, basically, you're saying is, like, if I do enough round, you can't block me. And if I sell the company, usually, if we say something like if we sell the company, and we at least return your capital, or we 2 exit, or

283
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:15.610
Mike Pestana: like a multiple often, then you can't block us. Now in practice, like I've never even used that provision. It's just there is a backup but I think gives, you know, peace of mind.

284
00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.650
antoinecarriere: Yeah, okay, thank thank you. And and we're talking about kind of

285
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:40.010
antoinecarriere: hypotheticals. And I think if you're if I understand the point you were making earlier is at the end of the day. You're kind of with these investors for the long run, and so you'd better choose your investors carefully and make sure that you get along with them, and that your interests are somewhat aligned, because

286
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:49.890
antoinecarriere: kind of. There are situations in which the interests are just, not aligned contractually. And and what do you do in these cases? You'd better have kind of

287
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:57.830
antoinecarriere: a good, a good set of investors, so it's not about kind of playing them, playing you you against them with the. It's just kind of

288
00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:09.040
antoinecarriere: to your point, understanding what is the standard language to use and what is standard to do in order to understand. Go, go with their eyes wide open.

289
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:22.319
Mike Pestana: Exactly. And what I say, too, is like with institutional investors. People change. It's like the person you're working with there could leave the fund, and then you get somebody else you don't know. So that's like another reason to invest, to negotiate aggressively.

290
00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.450
David Ambler: Yeah.

291
00:51:24.397 --> 00:51:25.379
Ankur Toshniwal: I oh, sorry!

292
00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.019
David Ambler: Ahead. Anchor.

293
00:51:26.779 --> 00:51:38.650
Ankur Toshniwal: I had a quick question. About anti dilution protective rights. So when it comes to kind of either bringing on new like, potentially like

294
00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:57.379
Ankur Toshniwal: founder level equity even later in the company, or just like large sums of money that we like, we think is important to bring on the right people. When does anti dilution kind of like rights? Protective rights come in? The reason I ask is, we're not sure yet, but you know it's possible that we're

295
00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:20.159
Ankur Toshniwal: we might be looking for like a 3, rd like co-founder who's might be in the larger side of equity. And that, you know, is something that we're considering. So I want to know, like, Hey, as are we gonna get blocked from doing that because it would you know it might not be a part of the option pool then? Right and which is why I was wondering if it's outside of the option pool. Where do we? Where do we get blocked?

296
00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:37.259
David Ambler: Yeah, it's usually carved out for any dilution. So I wouldn't worry about that. Service providers. You know, usually raising debt. And you issue warrants to the, you know, debt holder, and things like that. So you usually what the preferred is worried about are non service providers, non commercial transactions.

297
00:52:37.935 --> 00:52:43.100
David Ambler: So ie. Raising money through obviously another investment. Oh.

298
00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.750
Ankur Toshniwal: I see. I see. I mean, okay. Thank you.

299
00:52:45.750 --> 00:53:02.799
David Ambler: To your point, though, to take that a step further, though, like where it could come up is, if the investor disagrees with how many shares you want to give like they could just say, Well, there's not a common authorized in the charter. I'm going to block that, and I have a right to block common increases in the charter. So there's a bunch of ways to get at that right where they.

300
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.500
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, so.

301
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.620
David Ambler: Section, so yeah.

302
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.170
Ankur Toshniwal: So, yeah, is that like a a real concern is that they.

303
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:08.010
David Ambler: Yes, it is.

304
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:11.219
Ankur Toshniwal: Of all right. So when it comes.

305
00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:11.730
David Ambler: Great.

306
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:16.030
Ankur Toshniwal: If they, you're right, if they disagree. And so when it comes to

307
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:26.830
Ankur Toshniwal: thinking about I guess like protection around that. Obviously, okay, is it something that you know you'd we'd want to even consider thinking about? Or it's like, Hey, we just need to talk to our investors and

308
00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:31.634
Ankur Toshniwal: get them in alignment and prove to them that this is the right decision. I just, you know,

309
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:44.695
Ankur Toshniwal: hypotheticals, I guess, but I don't know how often it app happens. But I would assume that you know, companies do do make changes early in in the in the game, especially with when it comes to founders and bringing the right people on is important. So

310
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:59.330
David Ambler: It's it's not like a growing company that has, like a technical Co founder founder, let's call it, and they don't want to be the CEO like just everything's amicable, and they have to hire a new CEO right professional, CEO, like how much do you give them? And then, who has control over what the vote is to.

311
00:53:59.330 --> 00:53:59.840
Ankur Toshniwal: Yeah, exactly.

312
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:00.190
David Ambler: Right?

313
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.989
David Ambler: Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

314
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:13.279
David Ambler: it's not unlike that. And like, I think at the end of the day it'd be pretty rare for you guys not to be on the same page. If you're not on the same page, something's broken that said, you want to be in a position of having flexibility to apply a little pressure. Right?

315
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:13.650
David Ambler: That's always

316
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:41.469
David Ambler: helpful if they just have a flat block over doing something that puts you in a bad spot. Maybe versus like, if you knew this, I mean, we should. If there's specifics here we should talk offline. But if you knew this was going to happen like, maybe we have a big buffer of common in the charter, so at least they don't have a block over that, and then it's just going to a board, though, which you control like. That's a much better position to be in. I mean, there are still things to consider fiduciary duty issues, and whatever. But I think just setting yourself up to have flexibility is definitely important.

317
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.029
Ankur Toshniwal: Cool, alright. Thank you.

318
00:54:48.103 --> 00:54:51.839
David Ambler: Anyone else have questions happy to cover more here. But.

319
00:54:54.574 --> 00:55:07.990
Chloe Lannert: Founders feel free to just like thumbs down, or whatever if this isn't relevant. But, David, you mentioned sort of changes to founder, vesting. What does that look like? This is me being unfamiliar.

320
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:09.780
David Ambler: Mike, do you want to take that one.

321
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.200
Mike Pestana: Like, what? What would revesting look like?

322
00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:34.759
Mike Pestana: Yeah. Yeah. So so usually, when you said a company, either you have no vesting, or if you do investing. It's like 4 years, one year cliff like pretty common. So like, let's say you've been at it for like a year. You probably be like. Oh, I don't want to revest again like a 4 year. One year cliff setup so oftentimes like in that scenario. Let's say you've been at it for a year. You the series C term sheet.

323
00:55:35.120 --> 00:56:00.310
Mike Pestana: I'd say there's like 2 routes, one you don't revest at all. You just keep going 2. If you do revest. You get rid of the cliff and you say, Okay, I'll revest. But I'm investing monthly over a 4 year period, starting as a closing. There's another prong where I'd say you go more bespoke, and you say something like, well, I should. I should invest a certain percentage like, let's say, 6 months worth of shares like 12.5, but the rest will be monthly.

324
00:56:00.583 --> 00:56:17.270
Mike Pestana: Once you get into that last prong of like bespoke, I'd say it's pretty unique per founder, and like per situation. Like most of the time, your argument is like, I want credit for time. I've spent working on the company and the investors. Argument is like, we want to make sure you stick with the company, you know, until liquidity.

325
00:56:17.596 --> 00:56:21.709
Mike Pestana: Which would be, you know, far beyond 4 years for for most companies.

326
00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:29.014
Mike Pestana: So I'd say, usually founders I work with, except revesting at the series. Seed stage

327
00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:35.020
Mike Pestana: if we have leverage, maybe it's like 3 years. If we don't have leverage, it's like 4 years.

328
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:57.430
David Ambler: Yeah. And I would say, I just got down with any like A AI company financing where the vesting wasn't a problem like they. They didn't think the founders were too vested. They didn't like the terms of the vesting, I will say, like we've seen more and more companies try to get cute with like what acceleration looks like. And what if I'm forced out? And it was within 6 months versus 12 months, and

329
00:56:57.430 --> 00:57:12.539
David Ambler: investors are very focused on that. So certainly, if you've gone into the to the building, the company, with no vesting like, you know, you're going to get hit with Re with a revesting like I would say, it's not impossible. But like it's, you know, it's automatic. You're going to get in a conversation about it.

330
00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:23.290
David Ambler: and if you try to mess with acceleration, either single or double. You know investors care a lot about that because their lawyers care about that and and raise all the potential red flags.

331
00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.787
antoinecarriere: And so so what is typical in terms of

332
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:45.970
antoinecarriere: for founders. So again, the hypothetical scenario is, the founders have common stock. They only have like one investor, that is an accelerator. They are raising their 1st round of

333
00:57:46.837 --> 00:57:58.800
antoinecarriere: their 1st price round. Is it going to be like 50% of their shares are going to be revested, or is what? What's what's typical here at this point.

334
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:10.890
Mike Pestana: I think it varies a lot like I think what I what I feel I see probably most commonly is revesting monthly over 4 years. If we're talking about like

335
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:14.786
Mike Pestana: of a company that's been around for like a year or something.

336
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:26.049
Mike Pestana: if you've been around for more than a year, yeah, sometimes you see something like that where you you say, well, 50% of the shares are vested as of the closing, and the remaining 50% are over 4 years. Something like that.

337
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:41.229
Mike Pestana: But yeah, once you get into like the customized vesting schedules. It's pretty unique, like per company, because everyone has, like a different story about why they should or should not be revested over a certain period, but it usually comes down to like how long you've been working on the company.

338
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:49.600
antoinecarriere: Okay? And so so if the company is really young, like, it's been incorporated 2 months ago.

339
00:58:50.158 --> 00:58:59.110
antoinecarriere: And the the founders haven't worked on that. What you're saying is, in the case of a price. Round 100% of the shares are listed over 4 years.

340
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:03.309
antoinecarriere: would you? Would you? Would? You would not be surprised by that.

341
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:05.230
Mike Pestana: Yeah, that sounds right. It's only 2.

342
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:30.730
David Ambler: I mean, you can obviously ask for more. Right? Like you could start out with the presumption that 3 months are vested, or even 6 months are vested because you started thinking about this even before formation. Right? I sometimes will see investors even before they've looked at vesting. No more than 25% is vested in the term sheet. One of the Vcs I represent has that in the term sheet it's no more than 25% will be vested. We will control the preferred stock. They'll have a bunch of assumptions.

343
00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:46.599
David Ambler: But I just, I think, be reasonable, because the second we start negotiating with Vcs about your what your investing is like. If you try to be too aggressive at the outset, at least in my experience, you almost end up always end up worse off than if you just try to choose something reasonable.

344
00:59:47.430 --> 01:00:05.390
antoinecarriere: And and just for my for my knowledge. This seems to me like something that has been in the past 10 years invest kind of. I wasn't familiar with that with that kind of automatic revesting

345
01:00:05.972 --> 01:00:20.499
antoinecarriere: of. And so so how is how did we get there? Because I totally see the logic. I think it makes a ton of sense, but it feels very, very aggressive, because initially kind of the it basically says

346
01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:29.570
antoinecarriere: you are, we are re deciding the the shareholding structure at the time of the 1st price round.

347
01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:35.759
David Ambler: Yeah, I I mean, it's I think it's been going on longer than that. I I'd say I mean, at least from from my purview. But

348
01:00:36.177 --> 01:01:00.670
David Ambler: but listen, I think all they're all they care about is that you're incentivized to stay, and for the period of time they think it takes to build the company. That's all they care about right? And so if you're 40% vested, you can make every excuse in the book we've been working on this 2 years. I didn't get paid. Whatever it is they're gonna go. We we respect all that. That's why we're investing in you. But respectfully, we have to have reasonable vesting like that's always going to be the answer.

349
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:02.700
antoinecarriere: Okay. Okay. Okay. Thanks.

350
01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:29.410
Mike Pestana: And if if you're interested in the history of it, too, like there's a book called Vc. In American history that goes into like how Vc. Terms have changed over time, and they they used to be crazy onerous like Vc. Terms. Back in the day when, like Ben Rock was, Rockefeller was like starting to do this stuff like in the eighties, and even like the seventies and sixties, were insane, and the valuations were rock bottom. So if you want to feel better about how things are today, it's a really, it's a really good book.

351
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:31.050
Mike Pestana: I recommend it.

352
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.970
antoinecarriere: Thank you.

353
01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.510
David Ambler: Yeah.

354
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:47.350
David Ambler: I say, just 1 1 like boring point on this page. Information rights? One thing I've seen investors, I mean, investors have had this for a long time, but rights over approving your budget, even if you don't have audited financials.

355
01:01:47.768 --> 01:01:52.860
David Ambler: can seem fairly customary, and I don't think this is something you should die on the hill over. But

356
01:01:52.960 --> 01:02:05.910
David Ambler: if you give the investors the right to block your budget that includes things to the question before over hiring a new founder like they could theoretically block the budget because they don't agree to pay somebody what you're paying them right?

357
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:30.079
David Ambler: They can block it for any reason. And that's a stockholder. Right? That's not a board right? As stockholders. They have no fiduciary duty to do that for a good justification. So usually the budget approvals are at the stockholder level. So again, like this is not something the Vcs monkey around with very much. But, like we have. I've seen that used on the stockholder side to apply pressure in situations where you wouldn't think you would need to be applied. So

358
01:02:30.463 --> 01:02:37.389
David Ambler: you know. I I see that get negotiated every once in a while, mostly because I look for it, and I've I've seen it used as a hammer. So just beware.

359
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:55.259
Mike Pestana: Well, also, if if you guys have any other questions on this call to feel free to reach out to us separately, too, especially if it's, you know, something that's more confidential. We're happy to do. One offs.

360
01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.460
David Ambler: Yeah.

361
01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:17.520
David Ambler: I'd say to just running through this, maybe the last substance slide. I want to hit just silo terms. I won't cover all these because people's brains will go down. But I'd say, for a typical Vc, like some of these are just kind of out there, or it's for strategic, for a typical Vc, I'd say, like major investor status gets asked for enough.

362
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:39.190
David Ambler: which is the right usually to participate pro rata and a financing or get information rights. I care less so about the information rights and more so about preemptive rights, especially if it says something like, even if the other investors, and we all agree. It's a majority of the preferred stock who gets to decide whether we're going to waive the pro rata right on behalf of all other investors.

363
01:03:39.190 --> 01:04:05.509
David Ambler: Even if the documents say that my side letter says if you waive it, and then let other major investors participate, you have to let me participate. So there's there's things like that that pop up in these docs again under the purview of this is a standard side letter. Some of some of these I care more about than others like. That's 1 where you know. You should talk about. Obviously, super Parada, let's say less common, or what you might. But that's those are 2 that would jump out at me.

364
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.639
David Ambler: That's at least being something we should discuss.

365
01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:24.810
Mike Pestana: MF. Ends oddly can come up in in, on in strange ways. So most of your nation's clause means you have to give the same terms to the current investor that you give to a future investor. If they're better. So sometimes you'll have a situation where, like you have an advisor or something, or someone who gets like

366
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:41.169
Mike Pestana: like preferential terms, basically to their investment. For like strategic commercial reasons, Mfns can be a block or and can hamper that because you'd have to go back and give those same pre preferential terms to your prior investors. So that's the other way. I would.

367
01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:43.440
Mike Pestana: It's kind of a sleeper, but it comes up.

368
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:59.909
David Ambler: Happy to chat about anything else, to have folks still have questions about financings or otherwise.

369
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:01.430
David Ambler: or what can go wrong.

370
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:18.359
Chris Wong: I have a completely separate question. It's around funding and and that kind of vehicle. I was curious. If you guys have any recommendations or thoughts around. Like I heard there are 3rd party providers that could help you facilitate those.

371
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:18.770
Mike Pestana: Oh!

372
01:05:19.018 --> 01:05:36.659
Chris Wong: And like you can wrap them in into kind of like vehicles, and then they like the crowdfunders, all vote along kind of like the lines, as like, you know, or they differ, or they proxy. They give the the CEO the proxy, to vote on behalf of them. Or, Yeah, I'm not sure if you have any like color on, you know crowdfunding, and how common that is, too, and

373
01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:42.159
Chris Wong: if it's recommended at this very early stage, or if if we want to do something like that, yeah.

374
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:45.570
David Ambler: I might have my own thoughts unless you feel, yeah.

375
01:05:45.897 --> 01:06:04.910
Mike Pestana: I mean, just straight up. Crowdfunding is really looked down upon by venture capital like it's really not like a good look for most companies there are like some examples of like really successful, like tech, or mostly consumer brands that have done crowdfunding successfully and become like giant companies. But those are like really rare examples.

376
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:18.529
Mike Pestana: Yeah, I mean, there's there's like, I think that's like micro ventures. Maybe it's called. There's, I think, out of Texas. There's a couple of these places that will help you facilitate crowdfunding. I've actually done one back in the day when they 1st approved it, and it was a total mass.

377
01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:19.460
Mike Pestana: It's

378
01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:26.741
Mike Pestana: yeah, I mean, it's hard. And you have a ton of stakeholders. And even if you're a proxy, you can get involved with like,

379
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:30.050
Mike Pestana: having a ton of stockholders in the cap table.

380
01:06:30.727 --> 01:06:39.340
Mike Pestana: But like bottom line advice is that if you're looking to invest, looking to receive like Vc. Style investment. I think crowdfunding is a huge negative on the cap table.

381
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.890
David Ambler: Yeah, agreed.

382
01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:44.760
Mike Pestana: Got it.

383
01:06:45.520 --> 01:07:05.459
Mike Pestana: There is like product crowdfunding, which I've seen. Be successful for consumer products where you're just like you're not selling equity. But you're selling like the product, you know, before you actually launch it, that, I think, is in a different category that I'm like, if you sell, you know, you're selling a consumer product, and people prepay you for it, and you get revenue from that. That's like another. But that's different than like equity crowdfunding, which is probably what you meant.

384
01:07:06.215 --> 01:07:06.760
Chris Wong: Yep.

385
01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.650
Chris Wong: Got it.

386
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.110
Chris Wong: Thanks.

387
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:13.363
Chloe Lannert: Yeah. Antoine.

388
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.719
antoinecarriere: Is it? Is it?

389
01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:35.210
antoinecarriere: Should we be thinking about Spvs for safe investment, or is it delete? I think an Spv costs like 6 to $8,000. If you use canopy or some some sort of a

390
01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.190
antoinecarriere: system like that.

391
01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:47.089
antoinecarriere: just to kind of to- to go around the problems you were mentioning earlier on, you're safe is going to have like a bunch of people in it. And

392
01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:53.569
antoinecarriere: so is is that kind of the the smart thing to do, although it's a little bit more expensive or.

393
01:07:54.330 --> 01:08:06.409
Mike Pestana: So, yeah, I mean, it's interesting. So people definitely do that like, I've I've invested in a lot of companies through Angellist Spv, and it's like when you're putting in small amounts. It's kind of like expected. Like, you're not going to be individual stockholder.

394
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:32.529
Mike Pestana: for most companies are probably raising between 10 and 20 saves. So it's like not worth the hassle. If you're talking about like 50 saves, maybe it starts becoming worth it, especially if it's like 8,000 or $10,000 or something. You do want to make sure everyone's an accredited investor and bunch of other things, too, and end of the day. Somebody has to manage it. To like somebody has to be in charge of the Spv. But, like Angel List, is a pretty good function for setting that up. If you want to do that.

395
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:46.770
Chloe Lannert: You have any thoughts on those crowdfunding sites that do not require you to be an accredited investor. I've heard some weird, weird stuff recently.

396
01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:48.880
Mike Pestana: That that is interesting.

397
01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.960
Chloe Lannert: An Spv that doesn't check.

398
01:08:52.500 --> 01:09:09.180
Mike Pestana: It doesn't check. Well, I mean, look okay. If you're the stockholder, it doesn't really matter to you, because if you're if you're not accredited investor, and you get money into a private company. You don't have another securities. Law, exemption. You, by the by, you probably do have another securities, law, exemption you could fall under. But like, let's say you just don't.

399
01:09:09.692 --> 01:09:14.487
Mike Pestana: You have recourse against the company to basically get your money back one day.

400
01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:30.339
Mike Pestana: you have like the right to say, like I wasn't accredited. I didn't get the information I needed to make this investment and whatever. And then, technically, the Sec. Could bring something, but they probably won't, for like a $10,000 investment. So the risk is really like on the company, not on the investor.

401
01:09:30.729 --> 01:09:33.779
Mike Pestana: Sounds sketchy, though I don't think I'd want that was

402
01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:50.689
Mike Pestana: you have to explain to a Vc. One day, if you want to be a billion dollar company you have to raise a ton of Vc capital usually, unless you're very, very smart and very crafty so all this kind of stuff you have to explain to them. And like, if you're like, I use this sketchy, crowdfunding site, they're gonna be like, alright, that's hard for us to accept.

403
01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:55.800
Chloe Lannert: Yeah, periodically, you have an alum resurface with some really odd plans.

404
01:09:55.980 --> 01:10:10.980
Mike Pestana: Yeah. And then you get to like, I mean, this is not what's gonna happen, but like there are like sanctions and what's called Cfius for Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. If you're taking money from like countries that are like pseudo friends of the United States, or even enemies like, you know, mainland China, or parts of Russia, I mean.

405
01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:29.860
Mike Pestana: you know, it can get it. You can have a $10,000 investment from somebody in Russia, and then the Vc. Gets spooked or something, and you have to explain. It takes like 2 weeks to get them on board with it. And there's all kinds of wacky stuff like that. Which is unfortunate for Russian citizens. By the way, I think they get a raw deal, but that's just the reality of it.

406
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:31.180
David Ambler: Hmm! That's

407
01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:48.629
David Ambler: I'd say, too, just on foreign investors generally, if you're going to have a foreign investor, even like a strategic like sap right sapphire like there's investors out there who you might not think have foreign investor issues like Cfius. You definitely need to get in front of that. And usually they know it, but it can be a long pull.

408
01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:50.599
Chloe Lannert: And or a block.

409
01:10:51.340 --> 01:11:00.649
Chloe Lannert: Everyone check your week, one or pre-programm to do list. There are a bunch of Cfius docs prepped by techstars that you've all looked at.

410
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:02.320
Chloe Lannert: So, Antoine?

411
01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:04.560
Chloe Lannert: The answer is, there in the decks.

412
01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.340
David Ambler: Yeah.

413
01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:10.229
antoinecarriere: I mean, we're good friends, is a friend.

414
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:12.410
Mike Pestana: Exactly. It's true.

415
01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:15.689
Mike Pestana: France is easier from a Cfius perspective.

416
01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:16.560
David Ambler: Yeah.

417
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.690
Chloe Lannert: Hmm.

418
01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:23.830
antoinecarriere: Yeah, tax tax evasions is not a good idea.

419
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.500
Mike Pestana: Very difficult, I'm sure.

420
01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.900
Chloe Lannert: Anything else.

421
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:43.179
Mike Pestana: Cool. Well, we're, you know, thanks for having us. And like, yeah, like, I said, like, if you have a confidential thing you want to talk about, happy to, you know. Do do one off conversations.

422
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:52.989
Chloe Lannert: This is killer. We've had so many of these like small questions popping up over the course of the last few weeks, so really really grateful for you guys for taking the time to dig through.

423
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:53.850
Mike Pestana: Yeah.

424
01:11:54.103 --> 01:12:10.079
David Ambler: Just one plug, too. I'd say it's our techstars materials, but we obviously have in there. We do fix these for safe. I mean, sometimes it's free. If it's just like, send us form and update the valuation cap. But we do fix fees for those and same thing on on venture financing. So if you guys, no matter who your council is.

425
01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:31.510
David Ambler: I would I would recommend you, ask for that like fees have gotten wild and like even for Mike, and I like. It's painful on our side, too. It's just the way of the world. So you have power to negotiate. If whoever your counsel is, you should be negotiating that, not asking for estimates, because those estimates were very sneaky about saying, Well, it's 2 times the amount because of the following 20 reasons.

426
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:35.679
David Ambler: and you find yourself in kind of an odd spot. So just put that out there.

427
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:47.129
Mike Pestana: Yeah, if you have other friends who work with other lawyers like this is like a classic story of being like, oh, it's gonna cost like $5,000, and it's like 15,000 like poly. Since we don't do that, we just tell you what the cap is on the deal.

428
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:57.909
Chloe Lannert: And verify that the last class has had that experience. Where it's like this is, this is what I need. This is how much it'll cost receives the document 2 days later, and that's actually what it cost.

429
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.980
Chloe Lannert: I've heard only nominal things from everyone who's worked with y'all.

430
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.880
David Ambler: Appreciate it.

431
01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.600
Mike Pestana: It's great!

432
01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:07.470
Chloe Lannert: Alright!

433
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.869
David Ambler: Everyone. Thank you.

434
01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:14.840
Chloe Lannert: Last few for the founders. Bye, Mike, bye, David, thank you.

435
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:26.850
Chloe Lannert: Please do revamp your pitches like drop your pitch script in basecamp. I have a little

436
01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:33.220
Chloe Lannert: update on the let me just pull it up real quick

437
01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.780
Chloe Lannert: on the demo day invites.

438
01:13:42.550 --> 01:14:08.580
Chloe Lannert: I'm just gonna show you real quick, but just like a written recap of what we need here. Here's a spreadsheet like we need a spreadsheet of the people you want to invite to Demo day. This is like we need some help crafting the audience to make sure it's the people you actually want to speak to the people who are the highest value. I've made a template. So it's super easy for you guys to just get all the information you need. You can look for these people anywhere

439
01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:29.287
Chloe Lannert: but the Texters universe entrepreneur and investor directories will have a little bit higher of a conversion rate, and I'll be able to pull contact details on the back end. If it's someone who's not in those databases, you can use Hunter I/O, or like Apollo, or whatever to scrape emails. But this can literally be any anyone.

440
01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:52.229
Chloe Lannert: these are for people you're not already close enough with to directly invite them yourself. So if there's anyone you're directly inviting yourself one absolutely do that to make sure I know about it, like the format isn't super important with this, but make sure I just receive a ping with like a name like so and so. Yes, Demo Day, that's all I need to make sure they get approved on the Luma once they've registered.

441
01:14:52.740 --> 01:15:00.979
Chloe Lannert: and they're not like hanging, and you're not texting me the day before, after all, the badges are printed and Google's mad at me trying to get them in. Just let me know.

442
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:09.070
Chloe Lannert: yeah, friends and family also. Please invite them at this stage. If you want to bring your people, if they're local.

443
01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:25.140
Chloe Lannert: All of the founders are already on the list and do not need to register. We are assuming that all of the people who, like filled out the class roster form your co-founders. Whatever are there? If you have other employees or team members that you want at Demo Day that I haven't met.

444
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:27.939
Chloe Lannert: tell me, and we'll make sure that they

445
01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:30.509
Chloe Lannert: their information gets where it needs to go.

446
01:15:31.118 --> 01:15:54.219
Chloe Lannert: We'd love to have this list by end of day Monday. Just so. People have enough time to plan. The note that people will receive who you're not like already familiar with is just like a hey? We'd love to have you join us a demo day, we think you should take a look at this company. They seem pretty cool, and seem pretty aligned to what you're doing. It's like from us from the techstars team telling them to take a look at you.

447
01:15:54.410 --> 01:16:04.380
Chloe Lannert: and then you can, of course, reach out again closer to Demo day do your own outreach outside of that. But it's just like we're trying to give you the little social proof of being like, Hey, this is techstars. Look at our company.

448
01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:09.540
Chloe Lannert: Any questions, comments, concerns.

449
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:15.944
Anthony De Silva: Like is this like people without refined in techstars, universe or

450
01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:19.820
Chloe Lannert: Yes, so you can find these people

451
01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:43.329
Chloe Lannert: investor, entrepreneur, directories and universe, but also like random people on Linkedin, who you think are cool. The one caveat is, try to keep it Bay Area based, unless you know or like West Coast, unless you know that they travel frequently. Since these are cold people like our established mentors, and like Investor List, there are people who will fly on that list

452
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:53.970
Chloe Lannert: like I've invited people who have, like bought plane tickets to come to this. If it's someone who hasn't heard from me before. Odds that they're gonna fly out are very low. So just be conscious of that.

453
01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.609
Anthony De Silva: So like, look for a mut- mutual connection, or in the list, or.

454
01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:00.400
Chloe Lannert: This doesn't need to be a mutual connection.

455
01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.000
Anthony De Silva: Okay.

456
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:13.909
Chloe Lannert: Conversion will be higher if it's a mutual connection. But basically, I'm gonna cold email people on your behalf as tech stars being like, hey? You seem like a cool tech person. We have some cool tech companies. You should look at them.

457
01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.010
Anthony De Silva: Okay.

458
01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:19.909
Chloe Lannert: The email comes from me. It's like, Hi, I'm Chloe with techstars. You should come to our demo day and look at this company.

459
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.639
Anthony De Silva: Got it cool. Thanks.

460
01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:25.020
Chloe Lannert: Clear

461
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:31.329
Chloe Lannert: good questions, comments, concerns, list by Monday. So you can talk to the people you want to talk to in the audience.

462
01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:34.610
Chloe Lannert: Killer

463
01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:38.490
Chloe Lannert: alright.

464
01:17:38.974 --> 01:17:42.854
antoinecarriere: Chloe, just quick question for the for the

465
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:48.710
antoinecarriere: So our pitch is not finished. But you do want a draft, because

466
01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:55.479
antoinecarriere: look looking at Base camp, it said, like the final pitch, to submit the final pitch, so

467
01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.039
antoinecarriere: not the fact.

468
01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:56.910
antoinecarriere: The beach.

469
01:17:56.910 --> 01:18:00.250
Chloe Lannert: This is a separate folder. This is the pitch practice folder.

470
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:02.639

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:54.869
Chloe Lannert: And the like iteration loop there is take, take on the notes that you have from the previous 2 days, and drop your script. And then Neil and I and all of you guys should be sharing feedback over the course of the next day or so. So you have more time to make final touches. For the demo day practices with Neil on Monday, where you'll each have a 1 on one slot with Neil to sit down and work through your entire set.

480
01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:59.940
