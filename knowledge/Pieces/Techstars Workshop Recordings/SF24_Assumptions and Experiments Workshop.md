### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Lilliana Robinson: He also is one of the best examples of early scientific method. And that's what we're going to talk about today, the scientific method. That's why we're talking about hypotheses and experimentation. All of that. It's kind of odd because we're in startups business entrepreneurship. But the scientific method transfers greatly over to building a startup. So Darwin made an observation in the Galapagos Islands. He saw these birds on the different islands with different kinds
- Lilliana Robinson: and kind of like survival of the fittest, that whole concept. So the point here is not the evolution piece. It's that he used the scientific method. He observed this about the birds.
- Lilliana Robinson: A lot of people who don't understand the scientific method, think that he observed that about the birds, and therefore concluded evolution. But that's not how it works, and that's not how it works in the startup, either. You're observing a lot of things. You're gonna observe your customers behavior. You're going to observe trends in the market, and you cannot just skip to drawing conclusions. You have to make an

### Key Insights

> "Lilliana Robinson: So the Texters team who put this deck together, they call the assumptions hypotheses. It's the same thing. Neil and I always call them assumptions, because we really like the riskiest assumption test which I put in your Pre work packet. If you didn't click on that article. I highly recommend going after this workshop and reading it. It's like a 5 min read but riskiest assumptions are the same as"

> "Lilliana Robinson: So like, probably because you guys were giving me some of your riskiest ones, I want it to be clear that it's also extremely important to validate the smaller assumptions that you're making the assumptions where you're betting your time, your resources, your your team's efforts, all of that I want to make sure that every single thing that you're doing is not based on an unproven assumption. So something as small as trying to acquire people via Facebook, because you think 45 to 60 year olds are going to be on there."

> "Dominique (CEO) & William Stone (COO)_Agent Lunar: It's like resonating anyone. Please talk. There's a few marketeers in the class, but especially before paid. I'm offering it up now. Please talk to me, because it's so sad to see ultimately these channels. I always say the businesses they want you to spend more. So"

> "Lilliana Robinson: It happens. And and we'll always still help you guys, we actually like to try and like repurpose our founders. If you shut down to like other portfolio companies and stuff. So text search for life. It's it's totally fine."

> "Lilliana Robinson: we have our hypotheses, which are the assumptions we're making. So it's important that when you're thinking about your assumptions like, what are the observations that you made that make made you think that assumption so like for Dave, you obviously have a reason that you are making the assumption that people are going to change from tabletop to computer games when you make their game online."
