1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.019
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, guys, we're recording that way. You guys don't have to scribble down notes. You can just listen to Troy, and you can.

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And this is this is the 1 min pitch right.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.600
Lilliana Robinson: Yep. Just 1 min.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Format is, you're each going to go 1 min pitch. I'm going to give you feedback on it. We're going to get through this in an hour right.

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.650
Lilliana Robinson: Yep. Well, I told them, we'll see how many we can do so why don't you guys throw your names in the chat? I'll just do. First come first serve, and we'll see how many we can get through

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:43.620
Lilliana Robinson: Troy. We have last Friday we worked on QA. With them, and then last Tuesday we worked on video storyboards. So I think everyone should start by saying, 10. Second, what is your company? Actually, you're going to say it in the pitch. Don't say that. Start by saying the objective of your pitch and video, which one is first and just give context because Troy hasn't seen either one.

7
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yep.

8
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.509
Lilliana Robinson: Why don't you throw your names in the chat?

9
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.030
Lilliana Robinson: For who wants to go first that way? I can keep a log. Okay, Mirchin, we'll just start with you. Tell.

10
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.530
Mircea Gogoncea: If it's okay to have to also do it, even though I got some feedback last time.

11
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.960
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, no, everyone should go. If we have time. Tell, try, like, what order you're doing. Pitch video. And what are your objectives for each of the 3. So yes, context.

12
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:28.769
Mircea Gogoncea: Yes. So I'm doing pitch first, video, second, QA. Last. And the objective of the pitch is to give a bit of context about what we do and who we are. So the 3 points are what we generally do team and a little bit about traction. And then the product video will show how the product works a little bit without giving away too much information. Hopefully. Should I go?

13
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.520
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah.

14
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.209
Lilliana Robinson: Time you whenever you're ready.

15
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:39.340
Mircea Gogoncea: Okay, 3, 2, one. The average Us. Musician makes $20,000 per year in total income. And yet Taylor Swift

16
00:01:39.470 --> 00:02:07.810
Mircea Gogoncea: earned over 1 billion dollars on her latest store. Why is there such a big discrepancy? We're gonna help solve that. Musicians are musicians, not because they are good business people. They're musicians because they love to make music. That's why they hire managers. The problem is, their managers don't always know what to do. Let me introduce you to cicada cicada partners with managers to help them do their job better and make more money for musicians. We do this by focusing on the actual concert experience. That's by far the most profitable part of the live music business. And yet

17
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:36.800
Mircea Gogoncea: musicians are still leaving money on the table there cicada combines monetization with audience. Engagement and data give gathering tools to create new revenue streams at every gig. It's already being used by musicians in 12 countries, which makes perfect sense, because my co-founder and I build that for ourselves. We are both professional musicians and technical people. Mark is a full stack engineer and a professional jazz basis that I'm the world's most highly awarded classical guitarist. I've performed over 450 concerts on 5 continents. I use cicada at every gig I play, and let's not take a look at how it works.

18
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:54.950
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that was 103 before Troy jumps in. Just really quick, Mitchell, you and I. We have the same problem. We speak way too quickly. We're gonna need to cut some so that you can slow down because it was very comprehensive because of how much you were rushing through the team part I love that you wanna mention Mark, the team part should wait till QA.

19
00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:11.689
Lilliana Robinson: So basically, you say this great business. And you're like, also my team is awesome. Here's like Mark is somewhere in the crowd. He's great. He's a musician to just save that there are a couple of more things we could save to QA. I'll wait for Troy to say but we just want to cut a lot, probably like 10 or 15 s, so that we can slow down a lot.

20
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So my one comment, slowdown. But not only slow down. This is really important for everybody.

21
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Don't just slow down.

22
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Use your voice to punctuate what's important. And there are other times where you can talk really fast on stuff that isn't as important.

23
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:35.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? And so what makes for an interesting pitch is when your voice changes both in its pacing.

24
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.960
Jennifer Loh: Do.

25
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.583
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And in its volume, right? And it just makes it way more interesting. The example I give people is

26
00:03:44.260 --> 00:04:00.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: okay. You needed. You muted her. The example, Jayla, we were getting your your humming in the background. We muted you but the example I give people is, you know all caps in an email is really great if you want to emphasize a word. But if you send the whole email and all caps, it's annoying.

27
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:14.154
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Your pitch was in all caps. The whole thing was just all caps right. So think about using that variation. The other thing that struck me so obviously, we worked on this before. I'm biased because I like the opening.

28
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't feel like you gave me enough

29
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: of the how

30
00:04:21.047 --> 00:04:24.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and maybe you're going to see that in the

31
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: video. So maybe the goal of the video is the how. But I feel like, you're like, yeah, and we're gonna make them more money in concerts. And we're gonna give them audience interaction. And we're gonna do.

32
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But I didn't understand the how.

33
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And maybe it's it's good, because maybe you, you can tease that.

34
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then when you talk about the video. So now you can say, and I think you did say something like, now let's see how it works.

35
00:04:46.632 --> 00:04:50.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But I thought that was generally pretty good. You've got to cut out some.

36
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and here's how you think about that.

37
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: If your house is on fire.

38
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:09.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and you have time to run in and grab some stuff. You probably know what you're going to grab the things that are not replaceable the paper photographs of your grandmother. You know the whatever the things that ha! That are not replaceable.

39
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Guess what

40
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:21.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: what dude your pitch is on fire. You only get to grab 60 s worth of stuff, and you have about 120 s worth of stuff in there, because you talk so fast.

41
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:35.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what are you gonna grab? What are you gonna keep so think about it like my pitch is on fire. I can't grab everything. What's most important. I think that's a good a good framework to use for this. So but I think you're off to a great start.

42
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.689
Mircea Gogoncea: Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

43
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Awesome.

44
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.149
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, it was really strong nature. We just need to cut some, move it to a different spot. Kelvin is next.

45
00:05:46.330 --> 00:06:09.790
Kelvin Alaneme: Yeah, good day, everyone. So, I'm going. We're going to do the pitch first, followed by the demo video. And the pitch is essentially to outline the problem statement. And then, what we do in a nutshell. The demo video is going to capture how we do what we do, and the traction, or rather potential other aspects of the business.

46
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.529
Kelvin Alaneme: and more guided in the Q. And a.

47
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.759
Kelvin Alaneme: So I'm starting now.

48
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:25.770
Kelvin Alaneme: So in I grew up in Nigeria, where 94% of the population pay out of pocket for healthcare. So in 2,019, when I was asked the focus

49
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:50.619
Kelvin Alaneme: of my master's research. My answer was simple. How to make healthcare more affordable? This single question has echoed in my mind throughout the 13 years of medical practice, and got louder in the past 4 years. As I treated mentally ill in the Uk's Nhs, there is an acute shortage of therapists compared to the overwhelming demand. And this problem is 20 times worse. In the United States, one in 5 adults in the Us. Suffer from mental health issues.

50
00:06:50.730 --> 00:07:02.419
Kelvin Alaneme: and majority of these cannot afford therapy. I'm Kelvin Allen, Co. Founder and CEO of mind. Help a company that improves access to mental health care by providing online group therapy

51
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:23.449
Kelvin Alaneme: as a service. True mind helper is single license therapist working 30 h in a week can see 300 patients instead of just 30. The group model has shown to be very effective, as we see with alcoholic anonymous. And our mission is to take it online where most people are these days and make it affordable, so that those suffering can get the help they desperately need.

52
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.469
Kelvin Alaneme: We're going to show you how it works.

53
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.390
Kelvin Alaneme: How are we? And.

54
00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:30.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: lilliana.

55
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.470
Lilliana Robinson: That was 108.

56
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So again.

57
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it felt

58
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: long. And what does what does the peanut gallery have to say?

59
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.770
Kelvin Alaneme: What does the.

60
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.190
Lilliana Robinson: That is.

61
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Everybody else. I wanna hear your peers. Yeah.

62
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.550
Lilliana Robinson: Way too fast.

63
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.720
valeria brenner: Gonna say.

64
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.629
Art- ClubReq: I feel like there.

65
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.250
valeria brenner: Oh!

66
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Go ahead, Valeria!

67
00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:15.789
valeria brenner: Oh, yeah, I was. Gonna say, I feel like there wasn't many like intonation changes in your voice like everything went at like a very. I like the same pace and at the same like intonation. I think it'd be useful to put breaks in there to inflect your voice when something's more important than the other. Like. Treat it more like a conversation rather than a pitch like if you're explaining it to a friend rather than just like

68
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.640
valeria brenner: I don't know reading about.

69
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 100%. Valeria. Yup.

70
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it! It felt like you were in a race, Kelvin.

71
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.582
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You were like racing to get this thing done and

72
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then the other thing is that you are at a slight disadvantage. I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but you do have an accent.

73
00:08:34.224 --> 00:08:38.009
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Accents are hard for people who aren't familiar with your accent.

74
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:48.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so I found I was working really hard to try to process each word, and when those words were coming fast that inhibited my ability to kind of step back and just absorb it.

75
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so, even more so is it important if you have an accent

76
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to enunciate

77
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.958
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to speak clearly and slowly. lilliana, do you remember the did you watch the

78
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: pitch from Pictorin with his French accent.

79
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.560
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, a long time ago. Yeah, I remember that.

80
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:23.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, I'm gonna pit. I'm gonna put in the chat. It's gonna take me 1 s to get there. I'm gonna put a link to a Demo day pitch. This is not your format. This is an 8 min pitch. But it was this guy from France who had this really thick French accent. We worked hard with him on doing a couple of things. There were some

81
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: English letter combinations that were difficult to pronounce, and so we found synonyms for him.

82
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:35.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then we played up the accent in certain places. I thought it was hysterical. I love it.

83
00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:45.792
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It, anyway, it's worth watching. If you have any interest, or if you're thinking about, how can I do a great pitch when I have such a thick accent? And

84
00:09:47.018 --> 00:09:50.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: give me 1 s, and I will put it up there.

85
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:57.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Here it is copy dropbox, link, boom! And it's in the chat

86
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:03.009
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: now. And by the way they built a great business, and they're doing amazing. Alright.

87
00:10:03.752 --> 00:10:05.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: yeah. So, Kelvin, I

88
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:19.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know you hit the right things. You're gonna have to again. Your pitch is on fire. You're gonna have to take 25 of the stuff out to have enough room to have cadence and pacing and do it. Well, I think now it's about the delivery. But

89
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: yeah, I think it's now about the delivery and getting confidence around that.

90
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.656
Kelvin Alaneme: Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you. Everyone.

91
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:51.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: By the way, those 2, if you guys are all this good, that's amazing. Cause this is like way better than, for instance, the last cohort when I did this with them where we were like, oh, my God! That makes no sense. We have to totally rewrite. You need a big opening you need a. So I feel like you've put in some more work. So that's awesome. Who's next? Philippe?

92
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.970
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah, Hi, everyone. Hi, Troy.

93
00:10:56.598 --> 00:11:06.760
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah. My objective is like having this big opening more emotional. I want to capture more investors and people like.

94
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.875
Felipe - Gohaus: So

95
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.800
Felipe - Gohaus: And I'm gonna go first with the pitch and then with the demo.

96
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.060
Felipe - Gohaus: So.

97
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And what's the goal of the demo.

98
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.979
Felipe - Gohaus: To show what we have today and where we are going.

99
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, and the goal of the

100
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: pitch is to get their emotions.

101
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.785
Felipe - Gohaus: Get the motion first.

102
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:35.709
Felipe - Gohaus: then, to say what we did with Walmart? That is kind of a large brand, large client.

103
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:44.579
Felipe - Gohaus: and then invite them for the demo, a for the demo, to show them where we are and where we are going.

104
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

105
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:57.240
Felipe - Gohaus: Right. So our homes are the spaces where we share moments with family friends, children. They are full of memories

106
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:03.560
Felipe - Gohaus: or spaces. Evolve over time when you get married with the arrival of a new child.

107
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.049
Felipe - Gohaus: or when your son goes to college.

108
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.919
Felipe - Gohaus: we all seek a feeling of belonging with our spaces. We all want to feel at home.

109
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:17.770
Felipe - Gohaus: and in the world of design and beauty we all aspire to live in a beautifully designed places.

110
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:23.139
Felipe - Gohaus: yet true design is neither affordable nor accessible for everyone.

111
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:44.709
Felipe - Gohaus: After p. 14 or a startup year ago, Connie, my co-founder, and I knew we could enhance people's life by improving their living spaces. So we created a Saas platform that is, delivering AI to transfer interior design, providing consumers and business with tools for personalized decoration and efficient portion. See directly from retailers.

112
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:53.099
Felipe - Gohaus: With Walmart we capture over 12,000 users in just 4 months, and we are continually learning from their experience to enhance our platform.

113
00:12:53.120 --> 00:13:08.860
Felipe - Gohaus: We are also deepening or understanding of the multi-family real estate business. Specifically, in decorating apartments for rent, where we are actively streaming the process, and Felipe CEO of go, host, let me show you what we are doing, and where are we headed.

114
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:18.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, so I don't have the benefit of having worked with you. But what who is your customer? Is it the retailer or the consumer?

115
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:25.669
Felipe - Gohaus: Today the retailer. They pay us the fee for commission. We integrate the platform in their commerce.

116
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

117
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:37.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I feel like there might be a different way to pitch this. Let me try this on for size.

118
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:46.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: what do you call consumer products that are for the home interior design? What's the category called.

119
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.460
Felipe - Gohaus: Co. Furnishings.

120
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Home furnishings.

121
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright.

122
00:13:51.850 --> 00:14:06.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What I'm gonna try this on for size. Home furnishings is an incredibly competitive market with margins being driven down down down and those margins being sucked up by advertising. We've all seen the wayfair ads. We've all seen the Xyz ads.

123
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:17.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We are a platform that allows consumers to interact with the retailers and design custom spaces for them

124
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:23.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: frictionlessly, flawlessly fast whatever blah blah blah and

125
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is a new way for those retailers to reach their consumers.

126
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:38.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Our Sas product is sold to the large retailers embedded on their site, allowing their consumers to buy their products and design their spaces and make it just the way they want.

127
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:48.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We already have Walmart as a customer, and they've already gotten 12,000 consumers to use our platform and by products from Walmart.

128
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We are. Go, house. I am, Felipe. We are changing the way

129
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: consumers by

130
00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: home furnishings.

131
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.829
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know. It was a little rough, but what do you think.

132
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.100
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah. No. Yeah. For sure.

133
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You say, for sure, but it was very different from what you pitched.

134
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.370
Felipe - Gohaus: Very different. Yeah.

135
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:18.370
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And I. And the reason I did that is, I believe that your customer is the retailer, the one who's going to pay you.

136
00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:28.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then you just have to make that bridge, and you could probably make the bridge better than I did, for why the consumer is gonna come to that site because of your software. But

137
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: when, when.

138
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: when you did your pitch, it was totally unclear to me who your customer was.

139
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.090
Felipe - Gohaus: Okay.

140
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.030
Lilliana Robinson: Right, yeah.

141
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:43.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Saying, You're selling to retailers! And then in the next breath saying, Oh! And we already have Walmart like holy shit.

142
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:45.525
Felipe - Gohaus: Alright!

143
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:56.390
Lilliana Robinson: Question, though, like, isn't some of the storytelling part important for investors, even if, like, it depends on fully based goal. Right? Like, if he's trying to be to be customers, and this makes sense, but

144
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.950
Lilliana Robinson: more enticing to have, like investor conversations. The story was not helpful.

145
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:21.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, so what you might do then is so you might tweak what the objective of the video is. So imagine you do that. And then, when you introduce the video, you say, and the best part is, consumers love our product and making spaces their own, let me show you why.

146
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:28.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then the objective of the video is to show how much the consumers like it and how much it changed their lives.

147
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It changed their space.

148
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and you can maybe wrap some of that storytelling into the video.

149
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So it's up to you. You could do it. However, you want.

150
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.140
Felipe - Gohaus: But.

151
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:56.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: As an investor I would be more intrigued by the business model of you're helping retailers who are already spending a bazillion dollars trying to get to those consumers. You're giving them another channel and a way to do it more efficiently, and you already have Walmart as a customer.

152
00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:12.249
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Holy shit! Show it to me. And then if in the video you have cust consumers building stuff and you show, have them saying, this changed my life. This made my apartment. Better this whatever. That's where you convinced the story is that where you were getting at lilliana.

153
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.314
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, I think that accessibility piece is huge, like, I don't wanna lose that.

154
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, and that this is accessible to anyone.

155
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:26.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And the fact that you're on walmart.com kind of makes it accessible to anyone right like

156
00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: by definition. That's sort of the.

157
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.513
Felipe - Gohaus: Alright, perfect.

158
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:32.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Try it.

159
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.430
Felipe - Gohaus: And different ways.

160
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What you should do. Bullet, point it out, try it on for size. See how it feels.

161
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You might like it better. You might like your story better.

162
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.860
Felipe - Gohaus: Perfect right. Thank you for that.

163
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:47.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right.

164
00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.300
Lilliana Robinson: Thin.

165
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.620
Dan Ponomarenko: Hey? Can you hear me?

166
00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.490
Dan Ponomarenko: Yep.

167
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:23.050
Dan Ponomarenko: alright. Yeah. So my, the beach goes first. After that video with explaining what's product is so my main goal for this demo day is to get connection. And you know, get investors on board and we're gonna race in September.

168
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:30.969
Dan Ponomarenko: But overall, I just wanted to make connection with potential investors and get them interested in our product.

169
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:39.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I understand that as a high level. But what is the narrow, more narrow objective of the pitch? The pitch is successful, if

170
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is it

171
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so? Do you have a particular point? You're trying to get across.

172
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.560
Dan Ponomarenko: Yes. So I wanna highlight the problem and solution.

173
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.159
Dan Ponomarenko: Right? So the problem is miscommunication.

174
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You'll tell me in the pitch. Yeah, yeah.

175
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.065
Dan Ponomarenko: Okay.

176
00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Come into it. It it raw, just like the audience will.

177
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, let's see it.

178
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:22.039
Dan Ponomarenko: That sounds good. Alright pressure over 3 million web developers and digital managers work under the pressure of missed deadlines while working on website projects. Most of delays are caused by miscommunication and fragmented feedback through the multiple channels like email screenshots and chats.

179
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:36.009
Dan Ponomarenko: Digital specialist and web developers spent up to 40% of their time on back and forth communication while working on that project. It cost industry 64 billion dollars a year.

180
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:46.579
Dan Ponomarenko: But visual streamlined the development process by allowing users to collaborate on live website and pages communicate directly on web elements and digital assets.

181
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.159
Dan Ponomarenko: track progress in real time and share visual feedback in the matter of seconds.

182
00:19:51.220 --> 00:20:00.930
Dan Ponomarenko: It gives everybody who is involved in development process, clarity on, on what has to be done, and gets all team on the same page.

183
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.340
Dan Ponomarenko: literally on the same page.

184
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.420
Dan Ponomarenko: I'm then CEO at the visa, and I will show you how it works.

185
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:10.729
Lilliana Robinson: 58 s.

186
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Awesome.

187
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And and I think last time we talked I said, Oh, is this like canva for web development? Right.

188
00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:31.099
Dan Ponomarenko: Well, it's a yeah. It's a live website copy that you can comment assign task on particular on web elements. So everybody see what you mean by this red button.

189
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:46.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yep. And so then the question is, I'm just trying to hit the but I'm talk thinking out loud. So you hit the size of the market and the size of the problem. You talked about whatever 67 billion dollars. I think it will be obvious when people see the demo

190
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I would just have a transitionary stage that says something about

191
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know. Now let's see how

192
00:20:54.370 --> 00:21:00.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it'd be nice if you had a claim. So let's say, your claim is, we take 50 of the communication time.

193
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 50% of the time out of communication.

194
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:13.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm making that up. But imagine, then, in your transition, saying, Now, let's see how we're we take 50 of the time out of communication for web developers.

195
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then you transition to the video that's going to show the how

196
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right. But you were very clear about the problem, and you were pretty clear about the solution.

197
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:36.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and or the other, the other thing that you could do in that would be to talk about size of market. And so you could say something like, you know, let's see how we're gonna change.

198
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:48.059
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You know the the 10, how we're going to change the workflow for the 10 million web developers in the Us. Or whatever I made that up. But you know, I want you to have something like impactful on your transition.

199
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Either the amount of time, the amount of dollars.

200
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:55.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or the number of developers. You think the the total market sizes

201
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that would be great.

202
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.410
Dan Ponomarenko: Okay? Bye.

203
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's thoughtful. It's good. You guys, you guys are doing well.

204
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.260
Dan Ponomarenko: Thank you.

205
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Who's next?

206
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:13.775
Snow Lee / Runbear: Hi!

207
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.419
Snow Lee / Runbear: Can you hear me?

208
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.260
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yep.

209
00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:17.510
Snow Lee / Runbear: great.

210
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:37.720
Snow Lee / Runbear: yeah. Last time you, you told me about that. We sound too much like consultant, and we should publish it for the customers to understand that easier. So our pitch goal is attracting investors, and I'd like to have kick, start meetings with them.

211
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.091
Snow Lee / Runbear: and that we're so that's

212
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:57.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I'm gonna I wanna put a pause for a second. Every one of you that's raising money wants to meet investors and kick start meetings with them. So let's be more specific about what are you gonna do in the pitch? That's gonna get you to get investors, interests and kick start meetings. So what's the specific goal of the pitch itself?

213
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.870
Snow Lee / Runbear: I see, I see.

214
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Like I'm peeling back the onion. Another level.

215
00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:06.840
Snow Lee / Runbear: Got it. Got it. I'd like to deliver the concept, and then I'd like to

216
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:14.279
Snow Lee / Runbear: posts. I'd like to share our traction progress so that make them feel excited?

217
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.780
Snow Lee / Runbear: Does it make so.

218
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:22.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, so I'll start with them. So I'd like to get investors excited about our traction and progress.

219
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:24.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, okay.

220
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:33.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that's that is a more appropriate objective. Right? I'm trying to get them excited about our traction and progress. I can right.

221
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.640
Snow Lee / Runbear: Alright!

222
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let's go. Let's hear it.

223
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:37.920
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yeah.

224
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:49.080
Snow Lee / Runbear: So run, bear is the word most straightforward way to utilize custom Gpts on communication platforms like slack Microsoft teams or hubspot

225
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:58.679
Snow Lee / Runbear: for companies that want to improve their work. Using AI ROM bear is no code solution that integrates custom GPS into their work tools

226
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:10.810
Snow Lee / Runbear: in less than 10 min instead of weeks or month, you can create a policy assistant compliance assistant, or whatever you want without coding or engineering support.

227
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.860
Snow Lee / Runbear: 5 months after launch we attracted 50 paying customers, including Bcg.

228
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:23.459
Snow Lee / Runbear: They save tons of resources by supporting 600 clients using Rumba on their select channel.

229
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.890
Snow Lee / Runbear: Let's see how you can benefit from Rumbaire.

230
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.900
Lilliana Robinson: 45 s.

231
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.337
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, you had a little more time.

232
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:40.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't feel like you set up the problem well enough. You made it feel

233
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like a vitamin.

234
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Everybody wants to have chat gpt in their

235
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: slack channel.

236
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The

237
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it would be great if you could make this feel like a pain killer.

238
00:24:53.478 --> 00:24:55.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And I'm trying to think about how to do that.

239
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

240
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:06.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: what if we started? I'm making stuff up. This could be totally wrong. Snow. I want to be clear. I'm just making this up on the fly.

241
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What if you started by saying we all know how fast the world is adapting generative AI.

242
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:21.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Any company that does not have it deeply integrated into its business processes is falling behind today.

243
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yet that process is very difficult.

244
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Until now

245
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:35.169
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Runbare is the tool that makes it the easiest to integrate generative AI into things like

246
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:42.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: group chat, chat, slack, blah, blah blah! In order to make your employees more efficient at creating.

247
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:49.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: searching. It's a I don't know quite exactly how, but you know, creating efficient. Make them more efficient and keep up.

248
00:25:49.510 --> 00:26:01.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know. So companies that don't have run bear either don't have the benefit of generative AI in their in their work processes, or are spending months and months and months trying to get there.

249
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:07.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We already have 50 paying customers, including Bcg, we've saved the 600

250
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Bcg partner companies millions of dollars

251
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:17.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in time and expertise. Blah, blah! Blah! We are run by. Let's take a look at how it works.

252
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:20.496
Snow Lee / Runbear: That's perfect.

253
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:26.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright, it's not perfect. It needs a lot of refinement, but I like the idea

254
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: of trying to make it be

255
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: a pain killer if you don't have this, you're gonna die

256
00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:39.149
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like the world is changing rapidly, and you gotta keep up. And we just made it really easy for you to keep up.

257
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.280
Snow Lee / Runbear: That's exactly what our client says. So, yeah, that's that's really nice. Thank you.

258
00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay. Great.

259
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:50.810
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. Art.

260
00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.140
Lilliana Robinson: where are you on the screen.

261
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:54.650
Art- ClubReq: Here.

262
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.940
Art- ClubReq: okay, let me tell you a story. I was leading the recruiting team.

263
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Holland. Hold on!

264
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.350
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, wait! What is your objective.

265
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:08.970
Art- ClubReq: Oh, oh, alright, my bad, I'm sorry. So yeah. So the 60 s pitch will be more of a storytelling of the problem.

266
00:27:09.471 --> 00:27:15.110
Art- ClubReq: Of a real problem. And then a demo video will be the benefits with a client testimonial

267
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.990
Art- ClubReq: looks at. But.

268
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:21.280
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What's the objective? So your storytelling for some objective? What's the response you want.

269
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:35.639
Art- ClubReq: Storytelling is well, the response on one is like to gain the interest of like this is, we're trying to showcase a real problem, like like the storytelling, is like sharing a real problem, and how the our, our.

270
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.530
Art- ClubReq: our product is the solution.

271
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:43.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, so the objective here is to get investors interest.

272
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that this is a problem solution worth worth pursuing.

273
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.540
Art- ClubReq: Correct.

274
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Awesome. Got it? Alright. Go ahead.

275
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:56.940
Art- ClubReq: And then the Demo videos showcase the product and the benefits in the client testimonial

276
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.139
Art- ClubReq: of utilizing employment.

277
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:06.870
Art- ClubReq: The Eir QA. Would be to share share data to back the problem solution in the market that we can serve.

278
00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:07.940
Art- ClubReq: Kai.

279
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Go for it.

280
00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Paulina's on the timer.

281
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:33.460
Art- ClubReq: Sorry. Alright so let me tell you a story. I was leading a recruiting team of a prominent tech company, and I had 2 customer service recruiters that were weren't hitting their hiring goals. Why? Because they had an influx of applicants. Recruiters are juggling multiple roles, and they lack time of resources. Hail! We were pulling supervisors off the floor to help with pre screens, so I partnered with the outside agency to use that screeners

282
00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:43.730
Art- ClubReq: and my recruiters, review resumes and put them in a queue for the agency to screen. This enabled us to hire faster, and the supervisors to be able to focus back on the operations.

283
00:28:43.920 --> 00:29:00.305
Art- ClubReq: I'm art, and that strategy is what created club wreck. We use AI to review resumes and produce a job matching score. High scoring applicants are instantly invited to screen with an industry expert interviewer. This enables companies to screen faster and higher quality candidates.

284
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.920
Art- ClubReq: Also, we also bring a provide, a better candidate experience for job applicants.

285
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.770
Art- ClubReq: Let me show you how the benefits will

286
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:14.539
Art- ClubReq: let me show you how. Let me show you the benefits and how a client is using us today.

287
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.550
Lilliana Robinson: That was 59 s.

288
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.128
Art- ClubReq: Dammit, I was stumbling my bad.

289
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: No, no, that's good on time. So

290
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:34.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: let me try something, cause it's interesting. We just had in my Kellogg last week. Mike Evans, the founder of Grub Hub, come in and talk about recruiting, because he hired like 5 literally 5,000 people

291
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: when he was running grub. Hub

292
00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:42.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And he talks about casting a really wide net

293
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:47.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then having a series of things in an automated fashion that will. People will filter out of.

294
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.505
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And

295
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.788
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: all right. What if we talked about?

296
00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:59.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: alright recruiting and finding new employees is incredibly expensive.

297
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's expensive to do, and it's expensive when you fail.

298
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's not hard to get applicants. Our average job

299
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:14.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: gets over 500 applicants. The expensive part is figuring out which ones you should actually interview

300
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:23.979
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in the past. We did that with humans who are imperfect at screening resumes and looking at matches to skills, etc, and filtering it down.

301
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.509
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let me introduce you to club wreck.

302
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:32.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: club wreck is an AI Poweredange agent that not only knows how to match

303
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:42.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: resumes with skills for and filter out, but candidates for potential positions. But it gets better with each one because it gets feedback

304
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:47.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: getting feedback from its from the process and improving along the way

305
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: we're club wreck. We're gonna help people match. We're gonna have.

306
00:30:53.300 --> 00:31:05.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't have the closing here. We're club wreck. We're going to help. We're going to help companies filter out the wheat from the chaff, getting the best people in the best positions at the least cost. Let me show you how it works.

307
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:16.390
Lilliana Robinson: Try that was really good. The thing I feel like is missing there, that I had art, which I think could have been stronger in the way art did it is that the interviewees also have a better experience. So it's like.

308
00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Totally it.

309
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:33.129
Lilliana Robinson: I think that's important. I think the way you say it. Art was like kind of it was May, you just said like also. They like it, too, you should say, like, and interviewees love it like something like that, like, not only does it help the company, it helps them have a better experience, so that even more people want to apply to your company.

310
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:43.609
Art- ClubReq: Right. Yeah. My closing was, I was supposed to say, and I thought I was like it provides a better candidate experience providing applicants with instant gratification, so like something of that nature.

311
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:49.189
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think that's I think that's a very important point that I missed. So sorry about that. But I like

312
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:59.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I would set it up as a problem like that. That. So am I correct that most of the app look, most of the jobs that are open for you get literally hundreds of applications.

313
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:00.830
Art- ClubReq: Yes, that's correct.

314
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:08.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And that probably is because that all of these job sites now have a one button like apply. Now apply. Now apply. Now apply. Now.

315
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.600
Art- ClubReq: It's called a quick reply, a quick reply. Right? And so, yeah.

316
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.650
Art- ClubReq: candidates, and then you get you have to weed out the trash candidates.

317
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:36.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. And so you could set that up if you needed to at the beginning for those you haven't done it for those you haven't applied to a job. Recently, the world has changed with dozens of of job listing sites and the quick apply button. The average application. The average job today gets over 500 applications. The problem isn't getting candidates. The problem is filtering them.

318
00:32:37.546 --> 00:32:40.993
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We used to filter with humans. Blah, blah, blah blah blah, our AI engine.

319
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.650
Art- ClubReq: So. So you think, are you suggesting, like, maybe like, omit the story telling

320
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.940
Art- ClubReq: and go into exactly the the problem.

321
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, so when you say the storytelling.

322
00:32:54.330 --> 00:33:01.328
Art- ClubReq: Right? Because, like, you know, I know that we mentioned something about like stories are really good. Right? We want to utilize stories stories.

323
00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So. So give what was your opening line again?

324
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.709
Art- ClubReq: My story was about when I was leading the recruiting team for a tech, a prominent tech company

325
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.839
Art- ClubReq: like telling a real story about.

326
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:16.520
Art- ClubReq: I was leading the recruiting team of a prominent tech company where I had 2 customer service.

327
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, then you had to pull people off the line.

328
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: so

329
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for me. So I do agree. Stories are great

330
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for me

331
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:33.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in this particular case. I think the logic of why or there's so many job applicants

332
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:39.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is actually more important than an anecdotal story of you had so many job applicants.

333
00:33:40.488 --> 00:33:42.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You can go either way.

334
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't think there's a right or wrong here, but I would.

335
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:59.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I tend to be very logical. I'm an engineer. I tend to think that way. So I want to ask the why. So I want to give them. I want to start with why there's such a problem.

336
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know.

337
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:17.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and there's a pro. And most people will be surprised that there are that the app maybe you open up with the average job application today has over 500 applications. And I made that number up. You've got to get a real number, but it will be shocking to most people.

338
00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:27.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because, you know, people who are out recruiting 20 years ago, which is who, where your investors are. We're like, Oh, we put up an ad in the newspaper, and we get 4 applications

339
00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:31.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? The world has changed very dramatically

340
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because of job sites and because of quick applies and

341
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:45.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know. And I think my perception is that 90% of those are garbage. They're just people who hit apply, apply, apply, apply. Don't even match qualifications.

342
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:54.170
Art- ClubReq: That is a close percentage. You're right. It's around like 91%, 91 92% of a job. Applicants are not a right fit for the role.

343
00:34:54.170 --> 00:35:02.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right. So if you can get if you can get data. So you know you'd say, and from. And you got a quote, whatever the, you know.

344
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Sherm or society of human resource management whatever. I'm sure 91 of those applicants aren't even qualified.

345
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.829
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But we use Steph

346
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to go through all of them. Anyway, it was like digging for diamonds.

347
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Now

348
00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:19.139
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: we clear the Mud

349
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: club rack. Takes care of matching blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

350
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:24.340
Art- ClubReq: Gotcha

351
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.360
Art- ClubReq: like

352
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.189
Art- ClubReq: nothing, I'll say.

353
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.127
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I wanna I wanna keep rolling

354
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:43.629
Lilliana Robinson: Or just look in the chat. I was saying that that story. If you nix it, it can go in the QA. Where you say, like, why are you guys the right people? Well, I had first hand experience. Also. Blah, blah blah like, talk about your co-founders. It would know as well.

355
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.680
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. Okay. Jaylen.

356
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.700
Lilliana Robinson: also.

357
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.030
Jennifer Loh: So.

358
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:53.420
Lilliana Robinson: It's wild how you can think of the stats and be like one off.

359
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.740
Lilliana Robinson: This is the following list.

360
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I was like.

361
00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:13.039
Jennifer Loh: I don't know. You got my last stats pretty pretty close in our last pitch. We've redone our pitch we're gonna be focusing more on our customers and our goal is actually to get more customers and traction investors will be secondary for us.

362
00:36:13.396 --> 00:36:25.340
Jennifer Loh: So the pitch will be, it'll be pitch video. And then QA. Our pitch will be setting up the problem and really honing in on our Jtbd insights. And our customer experience as well as our solution.

363
00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:45.765
Jennifer Loh: And then the video will showcase our product and really make them feel the difference. And then in the QA. We want to use that time to really well, first, we'll have like a slide with our QA. Or QR code to our website. But that'll be where we really talk about the market sizing and our team. Why, they're we are the right team to to solve this problem.

364
00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:51.540
Jennifer Loh: and that way. If there are investors that are interested, that'll be kind of the time to to dig in a little more.

365
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:52.560
Jennifer Loh: Okay.

366
00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:54.210
Jennifer Loh: okay, cool.

367
00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.820
Jennifer Loh: So.

368
00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.720
Jennifer Loh: lilliana, do. I just tell you I'm gonna start, and then you time me.

369
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.159
Lilliana Robinson: Yep, I got you.

370
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.389
Jennifer Loh: Okay, cool.

371
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.429
Jennifer Loh: I don't want to be that American tourist.

372
00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.329
Jennifer Loh: This was one of the most common phrases spoken in our customer interviews.

373
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:18.349
Jennifer Loh: People are tired of the way we travel, and there is a growing consumer awareness on the impact of how we travel on the destinations we visit.

374
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:26.430
Jennifer Loh: I've been working in travel for the last 15 years, and I've personally seen the direct impacts of travel on overloved destinations like Hawaii.

375
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:34.210
Jennifer Loh: In fact, 90% of travelers surveyed in 2023 that they want to travel more sustainably, but they don't know how

376
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:41.460
Jennifer Loh: through to our techstars. Insights. We found that people care most about finding these hidden gems that they couldn't otherwise find on their own.

377
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:48.720
Jennifer Loh: Even further, they're sick of Tripadvisor Top 10 lists and don't trust big brands like expedia and booking.

378
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.000
Jennifer Loh: What they really want is to be in control.

379
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:57.680
Jennifer Loh: have access to culturally immersive experiences, and make the most of their limited time off

380
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.780
Jennifer Loh: all the while protecting the environment and supporting the local community.

381
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:14.039
Jennifer Loh: My name is Jennifer Lowe, CEO, and co-founder of Tuvars, and we are leading the regenerative travel movement for off the beaten path. Travelers to access unique, immersive experiences that are good for people and planet

382
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.020
Jennifer Loh: want to travel. Better to join the movement.

383
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.160
Jennifer Loh: and then it'll go into our

384
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.310
Jennifer Loh: video.

385
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:21.889
Lilliana Robinson: That was 1 12.

386
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.110
Lilliana Robinson: Okay.

387
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. So I'm gonna ask you a question that's gonna piss you off.

388
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: are you?

389
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Are you about unique.

390
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:36.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: immersive experiences, or about? Are you about saving the globe.

391
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.869
Jennifer Loh: We're about saving the planet.

392
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.799
Jennifer Loh: But it's secondary to the unique, immersive experiences

393
00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.800
Jennifer Loh: like our high selling point is the unique, immersive experiences.

394
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, because I think I think you have to lead with one or the other.

395
00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and in a 1 min pitch. I don't think you have time

396
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:04.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and to do 2, because it immediately, I'm like, Well, wait a minute. We're traveling. We're going to

397
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:13.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Bora Bora, but I'm taking a jet airplane to get there. I'm hurting the planet. I'm Bora! Bora! I'm hurting that like. How do you like

398
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for me?

399
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.900
Jennifer Loh: How do you reconcile that.

400
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah in 1 min, and it's just too hard to reconcile in 1 min.

401
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so and if you're trying to get the tourists.

402
00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think.

403
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: having

404
00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:31.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the appeal of the unit

405
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: unique. One-off tour

406
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:43.589
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is, gonna get you a bunch of people who are really interested. And you can actually facilitate the lower impact just by the types of tours you offer. And so you could attract

407
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: both someone who wants a unique experience and doesn't care about the world.

408
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.519
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and someone who really does.

409
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.580
Jennifer Loh: I'm here.

410
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:57.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So my gut says I would go with the uniqueness first, and so I would be

411
00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, so I just saw

412
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:10.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: don't remember where it was. I just thought, oh, I know where it was. I just saw a pitch where, you know. If if you even the difference between signed in a a generic.

413
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:14.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: go to booking.com, and search for whatever hotels in Oakland.

414
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or sign in, and have been someone who's

415
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:23.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: been to Oakland 20 times, and booked rooms and bookingcom. You will get the same list of hotels

416
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:30.800
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because booking.com is just putting it in order in a particular order that has nothing to do with you individually.

417
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.490
Jennifer Loh: Hmm.

418
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:36.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right planning a trip on booking.com means that you get the same

419
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:41.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: attractions, hotels, and opportunities that the other.

420
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:47.070
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then you gotta have a number 500 million people who went to Bookingcom this year saw.

421
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:53.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: If you want something unique, if you want something off the beaten trail, where are you going to go to find it?

422
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.759
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Tripadvisor doesn't have it. Expedia doesn't have it either.

423
00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's why you have to come to, you know. Come, see us.

424
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:07.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What we do differently is boom! Boom, boom, boom, boom! And then there's a way to make it.

425
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:14.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, feel exclusive and feel. And then, if at the end, you say, you know, not only are we

426
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:20.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: giving you the most, you know, culturally immersive, unique experience.

427
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We do it in a sustainable way.

428
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.970
Jennifer Loh: Marine.

429
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:44.450
Lilliana Robinson: I think whenever you talk about the sustainability piece, Jayla, you are not educating the audience enough. You need some sort of palpable story like. I've I think I said this in the other session with the video, like a really good story, is like they are going to have to close the ruins in South America in the next decade, because people keep taking rocks.

430
00:41:44.460 --> 00:42:09.649
Lilliana Robinson: there's not going to be something left. If, like every person that goes millions of people. They all take rock, and there's no, there's no stone left. Something like that like that's what I always think of when you say regenerative travel, cause. I heard of that story in high school, but like something like that, because, like Troy said, it sounds like you're talking about like the earth and the climate and like carbon and the plane. But that's not what you're talking about. You're talking about the communities that they go to, and they leave an impact on the place they're going.

431
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:14.799
Lilliana Robinson: It's less about like the air travel and other stuff like that. So like, you need.

432
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.440
Jennifer Loh: Yeah.

433
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:23.269
Lilliana Robinson: Clear cause. I see choice point that people could not understand. The minute that you start talking like ecological. What do you mean?

434
00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:29.309
Jennifer Loh: Yeah. So Lisa and I actually went on, one of the conservation experiences this weekend. And

435
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.489
Jennifer Loh: I think, like what we're realizing is, it's

436
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.979
Jennifer Loh: it has to be both.

437
00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:39.189
Jennifer Loh: It can't just be one or the other, because we're sending people to these unique, exclusive.

438
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.200
Jennifer Loh: sacred sites.

439
00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.809
Jennifer Loh: Right? We're not like just sending them to Mulacane to have another snorkel tour

440
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.170
Jennifer Loh: they're getting to like, go into like

441
00:42:48.460 --> 00:43:03.900
Jennifer Loh: protected watersheds to like actually go and like replant trees, and like do things that most people wouldn't want to do, and if they don't have that inclination of wanting to protect the planet, then they don't belong there.

442
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.409
Jennifer Loh: Yeah, right? Like we talk.

443
00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:09.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, okay, I got it. I got it. So

444
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: let me try one more time. Then

445
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:17.089
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: booking.com 500 million people. Blah blah blah! You all get the same thing, and

446
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:22.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you're destroying, you know, and that level of travel is destroying a lot of the most beautiful places in the world.

447
00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:34.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We offer a series of of excursion, a series of trips that are not only exclusive off the beating trail and deeply immersive.

448
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:40.579
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but they, while you're there, you actually make the place. Better let me give you an example.

449
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:50.209
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Costa Rica trip with the howler monkeys and the blah blah blah where you're planting trees to replenish after there was this a wildfire.

450
00:43:50.370 --> 00:44:00.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: a trip to blah blah blah where you're, you know, and give give, make it concrete where it's like, Oh, God, I would love so for those people who want to see the unique and give back

451
00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or the best possible solution.

452
00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let me show you some examples.

453
00:44:05.187 --> 00:44:09.359
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Then it's I, I understand. So until lilliana said that

454
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I thought this was like low carbon.

455
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:28.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I didn't understand that it was about planting trees and about, I mean, I think, about the people like I have a couple of friends who've taken their kids to do habitat for humanity kind of projects. You know, you spend a week building houses and helping and and like those are

456
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: transformational for the kids to think. Oh, I help like, look at what we built. Look at what we created.

457
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:37.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I feel like it's sort of now I understand.

458
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:38.260
Jennifer Loh: Yeah.

459
00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:39.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So.

460
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:39.800
Jennifer Loh: Yep.

461
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Whatever it was you said in your 1 min and 12 Si didn't get it.

462
00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:45.290
Jennifer Loh: Okay.

463
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:50.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And I and I had a even had a little bit of a predisposition of what you were doing right? So

464
00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I wonder if there's a story

465
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.499
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: about the most meaningful vacation

466
00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or the most meaningful travel experience

467
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:06.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: where you could talk about you know, a most meaningful travel experience I had

468
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: was the time that I went.

469
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:11.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, hiked into the back woods.

470
00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:16.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: planted these trees, did this thing, knowing that not only did I experience something unique.

471
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:20.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but I made it better, and those trees are going to be there for a hundred years.

472
00:45:23.103 --> 00:45:25.860
Jennifer Loh: alright, yeah. We'll give us a think.

473
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Give it a thing.

474
00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.109
Jennifer Loh: Back in. Thank you.

475
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:37.329
Lilliana Robinson: And you can include the quote like, I didn't want to be that tourist who goes to the place only to take like I felt so good that I was giving back something like that.

476
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.809
Lilliana Robinson: But this was great food for thought. Let's go on to some mark.

477
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:47.650
Samarth Gupta: Hey, hey? Good afternoon, Troy.

478
00:45:48.196 --> 00:46:00.989
Samarth Gupta: So the the goal of our pitch is just to highlight the problem statement, and the high level solution. And then the product video will go into the demo and the key benefits of of our product.

479
00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:02.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

480
00:46:03.805 --> 00:46:07.930
Samarth Gupta: And then just fair warning. This is really rough. We're still working on it.

481
00:46:08.544 --> 00:46:10.360
Samarth Gupta: But here it goes.

482
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I've seen the sausage be made a few times. Don't worry.

483
00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:39.612
Samarth Gupta: Okay? So the legal industry has largely remained unchanged over the past 3 decades. Today, lawyers still manually draft and review every contract, a process that consumes ours and often becomes a bottleneck for businesses eager to close deals. This is precisely why we see a significant opportunity for disruption in the legal industry, especially in the realm of agreements and contracts.

484
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:53.219
Samarth Gupta: My name is Samarth Gupta, and I am the CEO of Lex IQ. At Lex IQ. We're harnessing the power of generative AI to modernize contract drafting and analysis to bring lawyers into the 20 first century.

485
00:46:53.280 --> 00:47:10.820
Samarth Gupta: Gartner predicts that the legal tech market will be valued at over 50 billion dollars globally by 2027, due to Jenny I. We, Alex. IQ. Are poised to be pioneers, leading the charge in capturing this emerging market join us on our journey to transform legal tech and empower lawyers.

486
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:12.919
Lilliana Robinson: 55 s.

487
00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:18.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think it's pretty good and clear. I have a suggestion for the opening, though, that

488
00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: maybe the only the older lawyers would get.

489
00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:29.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But instead of saying it just saying it hasn't changed in 30 years, I would say the the legal and the productivity and legal industry hasn't changed

490
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:36.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in 30 years since since lawyers discovered copy and paste in wordperfect

491
00:47:36.628 --> 00:47:42.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and like poking a joke about like how today, what we're really doing is copying and pasting

492
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:49.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and throwing the word perfect thing in there, because lawyers used wordperfect for like decades beyond, when anybody else.

493
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:54.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like everybody else, was on Microsoft word and Google Docs, and they still loved wordperfect. For some reason.

494
00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:55.700
Samarth Gupta: Right and.

495
00:47:55.700 --> 00:48:05.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So it would be a little bit of an inside joke that anybody who is around back in the day would would get right. But I think that idea it also. It paints a vivid picture, right? You know.

496
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the the biggest productivity boost.

497
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:17.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You could even say it a little differently. The biggest productivity boost that lawyers have had in the last 40 years is when they discovered copy and paste, and we're perfect.

498
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It hasn't changed since.

499
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let me tell you how we're gonna you know.

500
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:23.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think that I,

501
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:35.589
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: at least for me, that would resonate you'd get a chuckle out of me. And and it then is very visual that what they're doing today is copying and pasting. And what you want to do is actually generate custom stuff.

502
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.220
Samarth Gupta: Right? No, that makes perfect sense.

503
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think it's good.

504
00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.970
Samarth Gupta: Then okay.

505
00:48:41.737 --> 00:48:45.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Now, I do have a question about your fundamental. So as a

506
00:48:45.760 --> 00:49:05.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: as someone who deals with a lot of contracts primarily around investing. One of the things that's great is that there are all these standard forms right? There's the Yc safe. And there's the C series seed Docs and Nbca docs. And so I don't have to spend a lot on legal anymore, because every contract is basically the same template with just a few things tweaked.

507
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm nervous that if you had AI generate

508
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:10.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: a safe.

509
00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:17.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that it's going to be different. And now I'm gonna now on the other end. I'm gonna have to have lawyers reviewing it, seeing how it's different. Do I care like

510
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:30.819
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: there is some benefit to the fact that things have been standardized and copied and pasted. So just give that some thought, because that might be an objection that you're going to get. And if you think you've heard that. Then maybe you address that in the QA.

511
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:42.880
Samarth Gupta: Got it? Got it? Yeah, yeah. The idea is that we actually ingest a lot of those templates, playbooks, etc, to inform the drafting review and analysis that are AI kind of out.

512
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:51.899
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But if you, my point is that if you do that, let's say you're on that side of the deal, and you then send over a custom. J. AI. Drafted contract.

513
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:53.649
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And now I gotta look at it.

514
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.179
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's not the same like when I look

515
00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:01.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: go to Yc. Safe. All I have to do is do see that there's only 3 things that have changed

516
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:07.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? The the amount, the cap and the discount like. That's it. Nothing else changes.

517
00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:13.009
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so it's really easy. I don't even need a lawyer for that. But if you send me a custom version

518
00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:19.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that's different from the standard template, I'm gonna at the reviewing side. I'm gonna have to have a lawyer look at it.

519
00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:20.770
Samarth Gupta: Right?

520
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:22.450
Samarth Gupta: Okay, that's good. Yup.

521
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:23.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Just something to think about.

522
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, who's next?

523
00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.710
Lilliana Robinson: Okay. Next person is Antonio.

524
00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:32.820
Lilliana Robinson: Get you?

525
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:44.239
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Okay? So the goal of my pitch is to have the audience con commit audience, commit to $50 to get into the Vip Presale campaign

526
00:50:44.667 --> 00:50:52.749
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: the pitch is gonna be telling a story of a challenge that I overcame, and it's gonna be more of emotional story

527
00:50:53.285 --> 00:50:58.469
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: then followed by the video. So the the pitch is to tell why we are doing this.

528
00:50:59.021 --> 00:51:03.639
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: By the way, we are building the ordering of mental wellbeing. That's what I wear is about.

529
00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:06.840
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: So the pitch will tell the Y.

530
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:11.189
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: The demo video will tell the how, how does the product works?

531
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:21.509
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And then the QA. Will tell the more details about the the psychology, the neuroscience behind these products and the go to market strategy.

532
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:22.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

533
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.790
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Alright.

534
00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.810
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Are you happy?

535
00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:29.500
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Please. Yeah, raise your hand.

536
00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.550
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: How do you know?

537
00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:39.960
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Years back I wasn't happy, and I didn't know it. I was at high stake jobs. I was irritable, anxious, and overweight.

538
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:45.250
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I knew something was off, but I couldn't tell what that was, and didn't act on it

539
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:49.080
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: until I got sick and tired of being sick and tired.

540
00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.690
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: so I decided to do something with it.

541
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:57.829
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I lost 40 pounds in 12 months by tracking exercise and calories with my apple watch.

542
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:04.279
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yet it took me 8 years of experimentation with mindfulness to get to a better state of mind.

543
00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.929
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Tracking my emotion was the key.

544
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:08.840
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Name it to tame it.

545
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.669
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I'm Antonio Ferenza. CEO, of a ware

546
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: aware, is a wearable, that continuously monitors our emotions and gives us insight to accelerate our journey, to become a better version of ourselves.

547
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:26.590
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: a better partners, a better employer, a better leader.

548
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:33.260
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: aware, empowers you to take control of your mental wellbeing, and build your happiness every day.

549
00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:37.779
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, that was 104.

550
00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.090
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Okay.

551
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:42.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. And you didn't really have a transition to the to the demo.

552
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:53.250
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think you do need to have a transition about what you want them to look at, you know. See how it works, or whatever. I don't love the opening asking people a question

553
00:52:53.626 --> 00:53:05.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it's awkward if I'm in the audience. You don't know how long to wait. If I'm in the audience, I'm like, well, do I? Am I happy? I think I'm happy? I don't know. Do! What's everybody else doing? It's you don't want to make people feel uncomfortable

554
00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in your first 3 s on stage.

555
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:12.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I would. Probably I'm gonna make up numbers again. I have no idea

556
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: what the real numbers are.

557
00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:17.530
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But you know, if you said something like.

558
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:23.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, research research shows that 78 of people are not as happy as they could be.

559
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:28.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: More importantly, of those people, 95% don't even realize it.

560
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:30.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You could be one of them

561
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:37.639
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I was blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, right? So like use data

562
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to make a statement that is surprising.

563
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:50.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I especially like the you know. And again, I totally made it up. You know, 78 of them aren't even aware of it. You could be one of them.

564
00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:54.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or 78% of them think they're happy. But aren't

565
00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that could be you?

566
00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I know, because it was me.

567
00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:03.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I had a great job. I did a thing, but you know. Blah blah blah

568
00:54:04.112 --> 00:54:06.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think that would make it more fun.

569
00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:08.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It was.

570
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:14.239
Lilliana Robinson: You need more emotion when you're telling that personal story like, even when Troy just did, it sounded different than when you set it in.

571
00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:21.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, you tended to be very so. There's an interesting thing here. You tended to be very monotone

572
00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:27.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and very deliberate and pacing, and blah blah blah! And you're talking about a business

573
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:35.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: where you know we're talking about caring and people and well, being and happy and

574
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:37.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the

575
00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:39.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you're delivering

576
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.360
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: free and the actual product seem way out of sync.

577
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:44.370
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah.

578
00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Just saying.

579
00:54:46.370 --> 00:55:00.696
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: No, you're right. And it that's because I was reading so I'm hopeful that it will be more like that's that's the thing that I'm struggling a little bit with like memorization versus, just just let it go. Be natural. And

580
00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:07.109
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: yeah, I like, be off script. Basically, I mean here, I I I see your point. Yeah.

581
00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:13.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. And one thing, and I am gonna have to go in a in 2 min. One thing that's really important

582
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:16.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is practice. How you want to play.

583
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:35.770
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I was an athlete in high school, and I didn't understand this. The coaches had us do all these drills, and I would just kind of do it half ass, cause I didn't. And what happened was when I got in the real match I would execute the way I had practiced half ass and kinda cause that was what my muscle memory was.

584
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:38.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: When you are practicing your pitch.

585
00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:44.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you want to be building the muscle memory for how you're going to deliver it.

586
00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:59.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so it's not sufficient to just be reading it in a monotone and be getting through the words, because that's because when you get nervous and you're on stage, you're gonna default to what's most comfortable and what's most comfortable is that thing that you've done the most often.

587
00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:05.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so when you're reading it literally, even if you're reading it off a paper.

588
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:07.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: give it some personality.

589
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and the thing you have to realize is

590
00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:16.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I'll I'll make this 1 point, and then I'll be done. If you've ever gone to the opera.

591
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:36.350
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The characters look like they have faces, whatever all this stuff, but if you ever see them upfront and up close they look like cartoon characters. They have, like red circles painted on their cheeks, and ridiculous amounts of lipstick and ridiculous amounts of eyeliner. And that's because when you're standing in the audience.

592
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:38.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, a hundred yards back.

593
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:44.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you need that kind of of intensity on the face for any of it to get through.

594
00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:47.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And the same thing is true of your speaking.

595
00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:58.910
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The stage will add a lot of distance, as lilliana said, and so you have to be overly expressive, and it would feel unnatural in a one-on-one situation.

596
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But in a big crowd it feels great.

597
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:03.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I mean. Think about what? Like some

598
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:13.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: your favorite musician who is at the Super Bowl doing in the halftime show like, think about how crazy over the top expressive that would have been if if you were in the same room with them 10 feet away.

599
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:18.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But when you're on TV, or you're, you know a hundred rows back.

600
00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.809
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It looks great.

601
00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:23.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and you all are gonna have to do that. You're gonna be overly expressive.

602
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and it's going to come off great.

603
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:27.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright.

604
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:29.349
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I do need to roll.

605
00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:31.300
Lilliana Robinson: All good, Troy. Thank you. Guys.

606
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:31.990
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Good to see you all.

607
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.610
Jennifer Loh: Thank you so much.

608
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:35.252
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright, take care!

609
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.300
Lilliana Robinson: And else.

610
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:36.689
valeria brenner: Thank you.

611
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:39.130
Lilliana Robinson: Anyone else can pitch to Troy next week when he comes back.

612
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:40.980
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, bye, everybody.

613
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:45.650
Lilliana Robinson: And Dotan, you can share a recording with us.

614
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:56.769
Lilliana Robinson: Troy isn't gonna be able to review it, Async, but your eir that you have right now, and us we can do it. I gotta jump to another call. But great job, everybody. Thanks for your help here. Bye.
