## Core Concepts

Based on the workshop content, founders will learn:


### Frameworks & Methodologies

- George Reed - Noetic: you, and how you approach problems, and how you present yourself, and
- Lilliana Robinson: We want to change. We keep logs of these things, and then we review them as a team in a postmortem, and then we implement them. So we have an iteration process that we do every time we kind of treat this program like our own startup, as you guys know. So these are really important to us.

### Key Insights

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: She's like big big dog, like the exact like she was in charge of all of accelerators. She's the coo like she's as the right hand at David Cohen. Like she's very important."

> "Lilliana Robinson: Right hand, and she's never visited one of our programs before one of Neil and my programs. She's virtually come to stuff. She's she's been in screening committee every single time. So you guys have actually already met her in screening committee. But she's never come in person, and she's offering this session, and then Rachel, who's the best boss ever. She's right above me and Neil. She's our general manager, so she's kind of in between Shirley and Neil. She's also going to come and spend the week with us."

> "Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we've never done this before. This is a 1st time workshop."

> "Lilliana Robinson: how do I become like an operator like you, Neil? And so he just worked with George to put together all these tips and tricks like we said. The most important thing is that you're here at 10 am sharp for techstars for life. This is such an important session. This is like the most important session other than Demo Day for this whole week."

> "Lilliana Robinson: So this is one that we've done for years, and it covers everything. And then we're also gonna cover a few like off boarding logistics as well. So that's really really important that you're present for so that you can ask any questions that you have from 10 to 12. This one"
