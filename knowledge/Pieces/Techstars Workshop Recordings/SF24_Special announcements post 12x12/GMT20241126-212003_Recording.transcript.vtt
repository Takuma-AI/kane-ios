1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.470
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think we should record this part.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:13.160
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, we're gonna start with the CEO roundtable. We're gonna have some special guests there. So you're gonna want to make sure you're on time for this. It's gonna be in person somewhere in galvanize, probably on like the 4th or 5th floor.

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:34.610
Lilliana Robinson: Then we're gonna have Kp, Kpi meeting with the Eirs. Some of the Eirs will be in person for that. Some of them will be virtual, so we'll do like a hybrid thing like we did in the 1st week. That's your last Kpi meeting. Those are with your eirs that are your rotation. 3, not your demo to Eir. So right now you should be working with 2 eirs. It may just happen to be the same one, but for most of you it's not.

4
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:50.819
Lilliana Robinson: You have one that's working with you on your business progress, who? We're still paying to have weekly meetings with you. So you should have a week, 12 meeting and a week 13 meeting with the person helping you with your business. But then you get 2 practice sessions with the Eir who's interviewing you on stage. So just make sure you're

5
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.509
Lilliana Robinson: actually utilizing that because they're being paid to do those things. So it's on you guys to schedule. We're not like monitoring it.

6
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:21.930
Lilliana Robinson: Then we're going to do a special ama with techstars leadership. 2 people are flying in, and you'll talk more about this. But this is going to be a really fun session. They're willing to answer anything, anything that you guys want to know about the market, the future of techstars, things that are going to be available to you like innovations that we're doing to make your lives better. And this is a kind of a flux time at techstars. There are a lot of new things coming out so

7
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.740
Lilliana Robinson: they'll share as much as they're allowed to share. And you guys should just come with questions because it's really rare that our founders get to

8
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:33.629
Lilliana Robinson: meet. Oh, sorry I didn't say, but Shirley is the coo of techstars, and this is the.

9
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.760
Neal Sáles-Griffin: She's like big big dog, like the exact like she was in charge of all of accelerators. She's the coo like she's as the right hand at David Cohen. Like she's very important.

10
00:01:42.760 --> 00:02:07.469
Lilliana Robinson: Right hand, and she's never visited one of our programs before one of Neil and my programs. She's virtually come to stuff. She's she's been in screening committee every single time. So you guys have actually already met her in screening committee. But she's never come in person, and she's offering this session, and then Rachel, who's the best boss ever. She's right above me and Neil. She's our general manager, so she's kind of in between Shirley and Neil. She's also going to come and spend the week with us.

11
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:27.869
Lilliana Robinson: And she's awesome. So you guys, you guys should prepare some questions for them because they're just willing to open themselves up to answer anything which is awesome. No one's ever had this opportunity in our program. Then Neil's best friend, Mert, who a lot of you have heard a lot about because he's worked with some of you. He's currently building his own venture. So he didn't come into program that much this

12
00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:33.030
Lilliana Robinson: this time around. But the data room curriculum I've been doing with you guys. I built that with Mert.

13
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:53.949
Lilliana Robinson: He's awesome. He's gonna give his founder story. This is my favorite founder story that we have, and I wanted to make sure you guys heard it, even though he hasn't been super involved with program, because it's gonna make you like, want to run through a wall like, yes, I can do anything. And it's perfect for demo day week. So make sure that you guys are able to come to that. It'll be in person not recorded. Make sure you're there.

14
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.140
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Flying in to spend the week with us.

15
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.010
Lilliana Robinson: For the whole week. That's great, so he'll be.

16
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.600
Neal Sáles-Griffin: He's saying through Demo day.

17
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.840
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, so you guys will get to talk to more afterwards.

18
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.199
Lilliana Robinson: Awesome. So he'll like to galvanize on Tuesday and Wednesday. Oh.

19
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.080
Lilliana Robinson: guys, that's a huge opportunity like definitely try and like Grab some time with Mert. Don't overwhelm him, but

20
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.249
Lilliana Robinson: I think you're going to want to talk to him.

21
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.240
Lilliana Robinson: Neil has added this special session for you. I'm gonna let him talk about it Tuesday morning.

22
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.930
Neal Sáles-Griffin: George.

23
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.609
Lilliana Robinson: George! Come on, George!

24
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.990
George Reed - Noetic: You want me to talk about it?

25
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.729
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I can't.

26
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, right?

27
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.300
Lilliana Robinson: George is doing his 1st workshop with Neil.

28
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.710
George Reed - Noetic: Exciting stuff. Yeah, I mean, Neil will have a more concise summary of it. But basically, we wanted to leave you all with

29
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.819
George Reed - Noetic: tools that you can use just to better yourselves as people, and that will in turn

30
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.119
George Reed - Noetic: help your business. But it's really about building the foundation of

31
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.480
George Reed - Noetic: you, and how you approach problems, and how you present yourself, and

32
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.080
George Reed - Noetic: how to show up in the best way possible.

33
00:04:01.514 --> 00:04:07.820
George Reed - Noetic: We're breaking that down into like actionable things you can do every day. So basically, how to bring the best part of yourself.

34
00:04:08.343 --> 00:04:09.860
George Reed - Noetic: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

35
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.919
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That was great that was really succinct.

36
00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:16.200
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we've never done this before. This is a 1st time workshop.

37
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.609
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So this came up as something we like thought of and imagined as the program was going on.

38
00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:32.389
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So I don't know what's gonna happen exactly. But we have some slides, and we have some ideas, and we hope it's a good use of time. But I put the flag on it as optional

39
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:41.460
Neal Sáles-Griffin: cause. I don't want to pressure you all because you got a lot going on. You got a lot to do. And we we want you to be around for tech starts for life at 10 Am. That same morning. So whoever's like

40
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.770
Neal Sáles-Griffin: the true, the true warriors, you're welcome to show up, otherwise we'll record it for everybody else.

41
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So.

42
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.399
Lilliana Robinson: And it's based on some questions you've gotten right like, people are like, How

43
00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:11.689
Lilliana Robinson: how do I become like an operator like you, Neil? And so he just worked with George to put together all these tips and tricks like we said. The most important thing is that you're here at 10 am sharp for techstars for life. This is such an important session. This is like the most important session other than Demo Day for this whole week.

44
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.170
Lilliana Robinson: because this is, you're talking about your post-program life.

45
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:32.479
Lilliana Robinson: So this is everything you need to know about post program, how to be involved. What is required of you guys like legally, because of the terms you've signed, but also what's available to you as resources, how to connect with us, how to report things to us all of the things you need to know as a business exiting techstars and entering the alumni life.

46
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:46.849
Lilliana Robinson: So this is one that we've done for years, and it covers everything. And then we're also gonna cover a few like off boarding logistics as well. So that's really really important that you're present for so that you can ask any questions that you have from 10 to 12. This one

47
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.700
Lilliana Robinson: is optional, but I highly but.

48
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.990
Neal Sáles-Griffin: And Tesla for life, like, I think timing wise. Correct me if I'm wrong, liana, but it usually ends early.

49
00:05:55.903 --> 00:06:05.209
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It usually ends early. Yeah, yeah. So it shouldn't. Shouldn't take the full 2 h, so it won't be too overwhelming. But only if you want to hang around and really get into stuff.

50
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.489
Lilliana Robinson: Okay? And then, Annie, I'm gonna call on you, cause this is your session.

51
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:37.169
Annie Brown: Oh, yeah. Well, this is obviously optional. I have talked to quite a few of the folks in the group about wanting to do. Basically a circle discussion about historically underrepresented founders or being one. The definition of that is in basecamp in the description. We want it to be as inclusive as possible, but also make it a safe space to be like, really honest about

52
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:55.870
Annie Brown: challenges issues. We've had and yeah, and we also want to invite the the techstars team to join as well anyone who fits the that definition. And yeah. So so yeah, join, join if you can. And I'm gonna order pizza for us.

53
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:03.530
Annie Brown: So and I'll kind of be facilitating. But really, it's just like, kind of a casual lunch chat.

54
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.870
Annie Brown: Yeah.

55
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.049
Annie Brown: And anyone who has questions about it feel free to ping me on on basecamp or Whatsapp.

56
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:27.419
Lilliana Robinson: Any. This is so great. Unfortunately, we're going to be at lunch with Shirley at this exact time to join us, but if you host, one in the future I absolutely will come.

57
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:35.440
Annie Brown: Well, I will be here, so I would love. I would love to do once in the in the future, and and just help with that, or whatever I can do. So that's great.

58
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:45.830
Lilliana Robinson: Okay? And then we're gonna do off boarding meetings. This is something Neil and I implemented many programs ago, probably 4 or 5 ago, because we realized we want to.

59
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.389
Lilliana Robinson: We are what we consider like

60
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:54.939
Lilliana Robinson: a white glove service. So we want to hear from you what can be better? Give us all of your feedback.

61
00:07:54.950 --> 00:08:08.539
Lilliana Robinson: We want to change. We keep logs of these things, and then we review them as a team in a postmortem, and then we implement them. So we have an iteration process that we do every time we kind of treat this program like our own startup, as you guys know. So these are really important to us.

62
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:25.529
Lilliana Robinson: But it's also important to you guys. It's kind of like a nice closure. On the end of your program experience. You'll always be part of our program. But you're not going to be in program. So these are our off boarding meetings. You'll have 15 min, and we'll just go through, and we'll have a few questions for you. But we'll also just leave it open, ended to hear about your experiences.

63
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.399
Lilliana Robinson: And then this aw.

64
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:37.010
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Well, sorry. One more thing on that, Liliana. I just realized I I noticed, that some founders don't recall our open door policy to return to program.

65
00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:42.839
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Some of you have heard about it. Some of you have reminded you about it, but just as once and for all reminder.

66
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:49.020
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I just have this like very informal loose commitment to all of my founders that they can come back

67
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.429
Neal Sáles-Griffin: to any one of my programs if they'd like to participate again.

68
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.060
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So there's a little bit of nuance to what that means and like

69
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:04.370
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which activities you actually do participate in versus which ones you don't. But for the most part you're welcome to 80% or more of what the program experience will continue to be.

70
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:19.409
Lilliana Robinson: Perfect. So for this aws investor event, we're gonna just hold off because we're still confirming some details here. So I'll follow up with a message about that. Once we talk to our aws. Rep.

71
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:35.480
Lilliana Robinson: This one is really great. And Wednesday morning I didn't make this optional because I used to make it optional. And then I realized, everyone needs to be there. Chloe does a great job giving you guys some public speaking tips. We always do it like with a day or 2 before Demo Day, because this is kind of like the cream on top

72
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:58.459
Lilliana Robinson: of your Sunday, which is your demo day set. So you all have your demo day set, but this is like the polishing things you can do to just make it great. And Chloe is coming off of a lot of experience with public speaking, and she'll talk about her experience. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's really fun, and this is a very fun and engaging session that she's put together. It's it's great and it's good to hear from Chloe. I think this is her

73
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.999
Lilliana Robinson: only session during program. That's just done by her. And it's really great.

74
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:24.570
Lilliana Robinson: Then we're going to do our final 12 by 12. This one's usually quite emotional. It's not like right now, where we're just going through our week. It's a reflection on the whole program. And this is our last official programming of the whole program. It always is. So once we're done with this, the program will have concluded, and it'll be really nice to reflect on everything. This is probably my favorite session during this final week.

75
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:33.680
Lilliana Robinson: And then, lastly, we do this really fun. Pitch practice is completely optional. So if you want to leave after the 12 by 12. Go, practice your pitch, do whatever you need to do rest.

76
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:58.120
Lilliana Robinson: But we're going to have this really fun. Final cohort pitch practice where we practice distraction techniques this roots from all the way back when Troy was managing director, and then Brad took over. And now Chloe and I run this and we're gonna distract you. So we'll play music. We'll try and talk to you. We'll throw crumpled up paper toward you, and you're going to have to keep giving your pitch, and everyone will get to go multiple times. And the whole point is that

77
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:14.739
Lilliana Robinson: in the actual room it's not gonna be dead silent, like where you practice right now where we are on pitch practice. And we say, Okay, go ahead, and we're all on mute, and you get the floor. Anything could happen like the lights could flicker, people could cough like someone's phone might ring, and you still need to give your pitch without.

78
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.409
Neal Sáles-Griffin: The mic has stopped working.

79
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.569
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, that has happened.

80
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:40.300
Lilliana Robinson: Or and you just need to switch it out. So we're gonna practice with distraction techniques. So this is going to be a really really helpful session. But if you feel like you have other things that are need to be prioritized. That's why it's optional. Ours like to join, too, because they like to be part of the fun. So we'll have a lot of fun with it. I really like the session and that people have found it helpful. But it's up to you guys. Thursday.

81
00:11:40.530 --> 00:12:03.310
Lilliana Robinson: as you all know, Demo Day was originally on Thursday. So now you have this extra practice day our team will be having some meetings in the in galvanize. So if you want to snag us or try and have some final pitch practice with us. That's totally cool. We can let you know. Sometimes we're available, and then we can go in a conference room and and hear you pitch. Otherwise you don't have to come into the office this day if you want to, just

82
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:14.369
Lilliana Robinson: like get in the Zone at home and do your pregame ritual, whatever you need. That's fine, too. This is a really rare opportunity that we have a day to just like mentally prepare for Demo Day. So that's pretty cool.

83
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.829
Lilliana Robinson: And then demo Day, we have a full run of show that we're going to post. But, like I said, in the weekly overview for this week.

84
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:25.499
Lilliana Robinson: Ceos especially, but mostly everybody needs to be there by 9 sharp.

85
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:36.049
Lilliana Robinson: We're gonna take attendance. We're gonna make sure everyone's there. I think they're gonna give you guys like a little coffee bar, and then we're gonna get started with our rehearsal for about 3 h. Then they're providing lunch

86
00:12:36.732 --> 00:12:50.020
Lilliana Robinson: which is so nice of them. And Chloe and I are gonna implement a rule from 1230 to 2 30. That's where you guys have downtime. You need to be or sorry till 3. You need to be back at Google by 3

87
00:12:50.290 --> 00:13:05.340
Lilliana Robinson: because of the extensive security. It's not going to be like, you can just come and go. So at 1230 the Googlers are going to take a batch of people who would like to leave. So if you need to go go home, have meetings. Usually a lot of the founders might want to go get.

88
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:32.174
Lilliana Robinson: They're like, change into their actual Demo day outfit or finish getting ready at home. If you don't come fully ready at 9 Am. You can also bring in and get ready at Google. But it's gonna be like you either stay or go. You're not gonna come and go through those like 2 and a half hours. So at 1230, we're gonna take a group down. We'll be ready to bring you guys back up at 3. But if you stay, you're gonna stay. And you're not really gonna be able to leave. So we're gonna provide you food. You can have downtime, but it's not like

89
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:41.559
Lilliana Robinson: People shuffling in and out because we just don't have the Googlers to key card you up and down the whole secure building. Does that make sense? Does anyone have questions about that?

90
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:59.430
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I would. I will say everything that you could possibly need will be at Google. So it's a good place to stay like you'll have places where you can work on your laptop, and you can eat and you can get ready. They have really large restrooms. We can get ready there. It's not going to be a problem.

91
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:09.050
Lilliana Robinson: The one thing Chloe already told you about Kpis yesterday is to not have calls scheduled because they're not providing a Co. Working space for us.

92
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:19.830
Lilliana Robinson: so I'm assuming we'll have Wi-fi. I don't know how reliable the Wi-fi will be for everyone to be working, because it's like a guest wi-fi and you certainly will not have like a private space to take calls.

93
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.349
Lilliana Robinson: They're doing us so many favors. So we're gonna be good guests.

94
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:31.480
Lilliana Robinson: I don't want us to ask them to make exceptions to find phone booths for us, or anything like that. If you have calls during the downtime of 1230 to 3

95
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:40.330
Lilliana Robinson: one, we told you to block the whole day. But I understand things come up. You probably need to leave and walk over to galvanize, and you can use galvanize as a space for that time.

96
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.189
Lilliana Robinson: Dave, do you have a question about them?

97
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.679
Dave Scott: Not about that. But any. What's the parking strategy?

98
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.890
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: Parking info will be dropped with the daily, with the run of show. On Monday.

99
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.089
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, they sent us it.

100
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.210
Dave Scott: Sorry, what! What will be.

101
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:04.970
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: The parking info will will come on Monday. But Google doesn't have dedicated parking plan on street parking parking at galvanize or ride sharing.

102
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.779
Lilliana Robinson: They had some recommendations in their in their document, but just like most places in San Francisco.

103
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:17.219
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, there's a there's a parking lot next to galvanize. That's like 25 bucks for the day. If you show up early.

104
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.490
Neal Sáles-Griffin: which is pretty good.

105
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:26.899
Lilliana Robinson: Good deal, and then you can just walk over. We walked to Google from galvanize quite a bit during Sf, tech week. I think it's like a

106
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.390
Lilliana Robinson: like a 1015 min walk. Not bad cool, so we're not.

107
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:42.150
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Sorry to interrupt you, and I know Annie had her hand raised. I just wanted to also clarify. For the off boarding meetings. I have to apologize in advance. I will be taking those remotely

108
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:50.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: because I will be prepping dinner for the team that I'm hosting at my house that night.

109
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.799
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So that's the only reason there. But I will be present. And and in those conversations still.

110
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.829
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think we're gonna have Chloe in there, too, to help take notes.

111
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:19.910
Annie Brown: Yeah, I just had a quick question about the setup of the stage. For the for the slide that's behind us. Will our chairs be like basically covering the bottom half of the slide like, how should we format our slide if we want to show text.

112
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.460
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, close.

113
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.999
Neal Sáles-Griffin: What a pro move question! That's such a good question, Annie. Well done.

114
00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:28.679
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: Good question. The screens will be above your head.

115
00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:29.630
Annie Brown: Okay.

116
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:49.899
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: So no small text at the very bottom, but like it should be, everything should be more or less visible. I'll see if I can pull a picture of like what the stage sort of looks like. It's not a huge elevated stage. It's a really really cool space. I don't know if you all know this. But this is Google's product launch space. It's where they announce

117
00:16:50.550 --> 00:17:02.930
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: new stuff coming out of Google. So we'll have sort of directors chairs for the er conversation, and it'll be really really clean and cool. So I'll pull some pictures for you guys.

118
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.887
Annie Brown: And if I'm bringing like

119
00:17:05.952 --> 00:17:11.928
Annie Brown: the the posters for the reception and stuff I just bring that in the morning, and I'll.

120
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:26.459
Lilliana Robinson: Green room. There's going to be a little green room where our founders that where the Ceos will go and come out of for the actual event. I think the co-founders will be in the crowd to cheer on everybody, and you can put in there. Everyone's bags will be in there.

121
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.599
Annie Brown: Well.

122
00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:28.199
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: Also.

123
00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.799
Lilliana Robinson: Needs to bring stuff for the reception you can put in the green room.

124
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:44.830
Chloe Lannert | Techstars: Yeah, we'll also help you figure out where things need to go. And it's looking like that CEO Green Room will be able to live, stream the pitches from the other room, so you'll still get to see everything in in real time, which will be sweet.

125
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:45.550
Florence Ettlin: Check.

126
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.890
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, they're doing a lot to accommodate you guys which is so sweet. Go ahead, flow.

127
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:54.750
Florence Ettlin: Yeah. So does that mean we can be together right before we go on.

128
00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.809
Lilliana Robinson: You're gonna be separated. Traditionally, the Ceos are separated. We have them like off stage.

129
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:01.830
Florence Ettlin: Okay.

130
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.409
Lilliana Robinson: Like basically queued up to go just like.

131
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.560
Neal Sáles-Griffin: It sounds like it's that's gonna be a problem for them.

132
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.889
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I'm here.

133
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.749
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, my God! No!

134
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.170
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's how we. That's not how we do things here. Collab is collaborative.

135
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.299
Annie Brown: I could put on like a black curly wig, and just like

136
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.469
Annie Brown: need to like hold my hand.

137
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.749
Florence Ettlin: That's me that's good.

138
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.959
Lilliana Robinson: There you go. You can give Annie a hug before it'll be good.

139
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.970
Lilliana Robinson: You're out volunteering any.

140
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.780
Annie Brown: Anytime anytime. It's an honor.

141
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:44.139
Lilliana Robinson: I love that. That's not gonna work for us. No, but you need flow in the audience so that you can see her when you're pitching versus like hidden in another room, we always have the co-founders in the 1st or second row, to be those familiar faces along with our program team

142
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:54.409
Lilliana Robinson: cool. Okay, so you guys will be back at 3. Pm, if you choose not to stay, we'll bring you guys up the doors open at 3 30 for our guests.

143
00:18:54.490 --> 00:19:14.949
Lilliana Robinson: So it's 3 Pm. Sharp that you need to be back. We'll take attendance again to make sure everyone's there, and then we'll tidy up the space. Make sure everything's where it needs to be, and we'll open the doors to our guests. And you guys will be hosts. You'll welcome people. You'll get to mingle a bit for about 30 min. We'll have some light snacks and refreshments, and then we'll start, and then we'll have heavier food and drink during the reception.

144
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.619
Lilliana Robinson: Neil, do you want to talk about the committing to the after party.

145
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:30.449
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Oh, yeah, yeah. So I mean, it's karaoke. Right? Agadina, we got this alright. So we're doing karaoke on Friday night again. Part 2.

146
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.910
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But this is gonna be, you know.

147
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.419
Neal Sáles-Griffin: we're we're gonna be more. We're gonna be a little more organized this time, as far as I'm concerned. So it'll be good, thanks to Monica.

148
00:19:40.795 --> 00:19:42.120
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So

149
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:48.260
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I just need to know who's actually coming, because we're trying to decide whether we want to get one giant room or 2 smaller rooms.

150
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.619
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So we'll we'll send something out to get your commitments. But I'm hoping that everyone's in.

151
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.489
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Yeah, maybe you can. Just

152
00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:05.960
Neal Sáles-Griffin: it's okay if you just like fall asleep in the room, you know, like we'll just like make fun of you and draw like circles on your, you know, eyes or something. We'll do something funny.

153
00:20:06.328 --> 00:20:14.529
Neal Sáles-Griffin: but you know I know everyone will be gassed, and some of you have probably have other commitments, but if you're willing to come hang afterwards. I think it'll be very cathartic.

154
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.649
akadinayadegar: I'll send out a survey like right after this call.

155
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.050
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Checked.

156
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:20.980
akadinayadegar: And let us know.

157
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.979
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Laser tag, no.

158
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.190
Lilliana Robinson: Honestly, I haven't to go to Laser Tag, but

159
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.960
Lilliana Robinson: I think the team has voted on Karaoke.

160
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.800
Neal Sáles-Griffin: There we go, cool.

161
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.510
Neal Sáles-Griffin: alright, and then I think we have one last thing right, Liliana. I should tell them a little bit more.

162
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.370
Lilliana Robinson: Back by our special guests.

163
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.969
Neal Sáles-Griffin: So let me stop recording.

164
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.279
Neal Sáles-Griffin: But whoever is watching this and not in this call right now

165
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.789
Neal Sáles-Griffin: make sure that you hear what we're gonna say, that isn't recorded.

166
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.740
Neal Sáles-Griffin: How do I stop it?
