00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Don't have to worry about writing stuff down.

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.350
Lilliana Robinson: Yep, okay. So why don't we start with volunteers?

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:14.389
Lilliana Robinson: Let's see Mircha volunteer to go first, then, Valeria. Anyone else who wants to volunteer or get in the queue. Jump in the chat.

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.349
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, Marsha, you can go first.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:35.949
Mircea Gogoncea: So much for accommodating, I will record. I will watch the recording for valuable suggestions from others after okay, so I do pitch. Video. QA. I'm trying to kick off meetings with potential investors. And that's it. Do you need more information at this stage?

6
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:57.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, so typically, your pitch has a objective that is more specific than I'm trying to get investment. Everybody wants investment. But you gotta be more specific. How you know I'm trying to intrigue them with the size of the market. I'm trying to show them that we have unique traction. I'm trying. I don't know what it is for you. But what is it for you? What is your objective.

7
00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:11.099
Mircea Gogoncea: I'm trying to intrigue them with the sector that they've probably never thought about music managers and live music. I doubt everybody's ever thought about this, and we show them that it's actually quite possible to make a good profit in there.

8
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

9
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright!

10
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.960
Mircea Gogoncea: Okay.

11
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:32.760
Mircea Gogoncea: alright. The average Us. Musician earns only $20,000 a year. So how did Taylor Swift earn a billion dollars on her latest tour. Well, most musicians are not great business people. That's why they hire managers and cicada partners with managers to make more money for artists.

12
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:56.899
Mircea Gogoncea: We do this by focusing on the live concert experience, which is already the most profitable part of the industry. Before Cicada concert revenue could only come from tickets, and the old school. Merch, booth, and Merch is a logistical nightmare. Cicada unlocks 6 new revenue streams at every gig. These include paid dedications, custom merch on demand for every fan and synchronized calls to action activated by the music itself.

13
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:14.900
Mircea Gogoncea: Since January, Cicada has been used by over 40 acts in 12 countries, which makes perfect sense because we built it for ourselves. We, the founders, are professional musicians and highly technical people, and we believe that the next Taylor Swift will use Cicada to earn her first 1 billion dollars.

14
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:20.430
Mircea Gogoncea: In fact, some of you are using cicada right now if you scan the QR code behind me, here's how it works.

15
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, how are we on time?

16
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.930
Lilliana Robinson: 103.

17
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:40.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay. So we're pretty close. You were talking really fast. You're gonna have to figure out how to how to. Maybe not necessarily talk quite so fast. So a subtle little little thing. At 1 point you said so. How does it work? You? Said Cicada partners.

18
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And you started going, and I thought that cicada partners was your name.

19
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You know how many things are like math, venture partners, or whatever. And so it took me a while

20
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.119
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to pick up on that. Oh, cicada

21
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: partners with.

22
00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so I got like all flustered. So I don't know if other people, if that would happen. But be careful when you do that stuff. So you could say we partner with.

23
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or our our business partners with. It's just a subtle thing, but it really makes a difference in how I perceive it.

24
00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:12.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. So I think I get it.

25
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.899
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think that

26
00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:22.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: do you have any data? So you said you've gone. So with ported 40 bands in 12 countries.

27
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Do you have any data on how many?

28
00:03:27.653 --> 00:03:31.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: How many audience members? How many consumers have actually engaged with you.

29
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:50.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: how much money has been made, how much like. So the the thing that was impressive about music, audience exchange was that when they would do their texting thing at at a concert. They'd get like 75 80% of the people to give the sponsoring brand the right to text them.

30
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: which was amazing.

31
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Do you have any data like that?

32
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:21.793
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah, we have some. It's not super impressive yet, though. So we have probably around 1,100 unique visitors, total of, for on the audience side. People who have scanned the QR codes. But we don't know what percentage that is of the audience, because we don't have exact audience numbers on all of them, but that is, you know, in the thousands. The total Gmv is also not huge. It's about 3.6,000 dollars since we started.

33
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:49.369
Mircea Gogoncea: and was the profit. The what we've calculated so far, based on our estimate and the total number of of listeners at these concerts is about $3.8 in extra direct extra revenue per fan. And I am actually the most successful user of cicada. Because I've actually increased my personal live music revenue by something like 23%.

34
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right. So why don't you say that?

35
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:59.520
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Why don't you say? And as one of the first users as a data, I've increased my revenue by 2030, by over.

36
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: by almost 25%.

37
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:23.849
Mircea Gogoncea: So we were just thinking about this yesterday, Mark and I, my co-founder, who's also in this call, and we were wondering whether we should do it. The the reason why I didn't do it in this pitch, but I'm happy to put it back in is that I feel like it might be limiting like, yes, I've achieved this, but you know, we actually think that it's possible to maybe 2 x 3 x 5 x revenue for.

38
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:40.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So maybe you do that in the QA. Then so maybe in the QA. Someone says, Well, how much can we actually make. And you say, Oh, well, you know, I'm one of the first users I've I've increased my revenue per show by 25. But that's just the beginning. We're just getting started. We think it's going to be 2 x 3 x 5 x that much.

39
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.960
Mircea Gogoncea: We do have that in the QA. Actually. So you think.

40
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

41
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.660
Mircea Gogoncea: To put it in the pitch. Then.

42
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.335
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, no, you could, one or the other.

43
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.689
Mircea Gogoncea: Right alright to put the increase that I've experienced in the pitch. That that's what I meant. Sorry that wasn't clear.

44
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, it's up to you.

45
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.247
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but you can.

46
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.269
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I was so I was impressed. So this is the first time I've heard you clearly articulate.

47
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:11.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and maybe I missed it before, but clearly articulate this piece about having having 6 new revenue streams.

48
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.116
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? And

49
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.480
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so you know, what are the 6? By the way.

50
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:42.537
Mircea Gogoncea: Yeah. So it's paid. Thank you. Notes, basically a way for the listeners to support the musician. And send them a message. It's I should probably have them memorize better. It's a paid dedications and paid song requests custom, infinite merch on demand for every fan without having to bring it to the store.

51
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:56.090
Mircea Gogoncea: Other concert related services like Perks, and vip access. So basically, we allow musicians to sell those things at concerts. Using our product.

52
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.933
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, I think it.

53
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:07.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think it was pretty good. Again there was a little wording change. I I don't know that I would change a lot at this point. And, by the way, I'm not, gonna

54
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:22.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: my feeling is that if your pitch is pretty good you should work on delivery and timing and refining at this point. I don't want to mess people up by having them like Redo their entire pitch 3 days before the pitch like you'll get. You're better off delivering a great pitch.

55
00:07:23.473 --> 00:07:27.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Having a great delivery because people are. Gonna think about

56
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:38.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: your presence and how you speak and how like that's going to come through really clearly as much as what your actual words are. I mean, your words have to make sense. You're telling a story, but.

57
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:43.729
Mircea Gogoncea: Is there anything I could do at this point to make it from pretty good to very good, or to exceptional.

58
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We have time. Say it one more time.

59
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:58.009
Mircea Gogoncea: Okay, alright. The average Us. Musician only earns $20,000 a year. So how did Taylor Swift earn a billion dollars on her latest store.

60
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:17.290
Mircea Gogoncea: Well, most musicians who are not Taylor Swift are not great business people. That's why they hire managers. We help managers make more money for their artists, and we do this by focusing on the live concert experience, which is already the most profitable part of the industry. Before cicada concert revenue could only come from tickets and merch

61
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:31.890
Mircea Gogoncea: and old school. Merch is a logistical nightmare. Cicada unlocks 6 new revenue streams at every gig. These include things like paid dedications, custom merge on demand for every fan and synchronize calls to action activated by the music itself.

62
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:49.350
Mircea Gogoncea: Since January, cicada has been used by over 40 acts in 12 countries, which makes sense because we built it for ourselves. The founders are professional musicians and highly technical people. In fact, I am an early customer as well, and I've increased my revenue by 23% by using cicada. Here's how it works.

63
00:08:53.370 --> 00:09:05.319
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think it's pretty good. I really do. I don't know that I would. There's nothing that's hitting me that like. Oh, my God! He didn't say that, or, Oh, my God, I mean, other people may have some input, but I think you're on a good path. I am totally comfortable with that

64
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.439
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think you should roll with it. Make it better.

65
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.329
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright! Who's next.

66
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.996
valeria brenner: I am.

67
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Valerie, let's go.

68
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:13.730
valeria brenner: Us, so.

69
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I would rea.

70
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.389
valeria brenner: Malaria. I think.

71
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.220
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Malaria.

72
00:09:17.531 --> 00:09:22.199
valeria brenner: And then it sticks. Think the disease but with a V, and then it sticks

73
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.199
valeria brenner: malaria, malaria.

74
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, got it.

75
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That sounds like an episode of Seinfeld to me.

76
00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:59.660
valeria brenner: Okay. But I'm doing the video first. And the objective of the video is to show the opportunity, the problem, the solution and then start teasing at traction, then, the pitch which my objectives are to show the market size, the value, proposition, or traction, and like what our next steps are, and then I'm doing QA. So just to get right into it. There are over 200 million small businesses, artists, makers, and thrift shops selling on Instagram.

77
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:12.240
valeria brenner: Many of these are run by a single person as a passion project or a side hustle, and as they grow, shipping becomes this miserable chore, taking more and more time away from the fun parts of their business

78
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:27.370
valeria brenner: ship is here to change that. We've reduced the average shipping time for Instagram sellers by up to 75% a value. Add that's already attracted over 1,800 users and helped to sell nearly $300,000 in shipping labels last year.

79
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:38.090
valeria brenner: moving forward. We want to keep automating and simplifying the process. That's why we're launching thrift ship 2.0 next week with the goal of making shipping as easy and error free as possible.

80
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.350
valeria brenner: with the roadmap full of new features. We're set to help our users grow even more.

81
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:50.930
valeria brenner: Our vision is to support businesses across all social media platforms and help them spend more time on the fun parts of their business and less on shipping.

82
00:10:53.190 --> 00:11:02.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Here's the so I think it's pretty good. And we you and I've talked about this a little bit. But here's the gap that I have this like selling on social media

83
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:13.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and like, how is that different than anybody else like? Why aren't you doing shipping for shopify sites? And why aren't you doing shipping for like? What makes this social media part different.

84
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:33.059
valeria brenner: I kinda go into it in the video cause I used to sell on social media. And so I talk about how all customer transactions are done through dms. So customers are just texting you their address. And so it becomes a very manual process for these small businesses, where they're copying over each address, which is incredibly time consuming and error prone.

85
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, so your real value prop

86
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:46.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is, let me guess is that your software can either screen, scrape or whatever it's going to pull in the DM information and automatically populate stuff to automate shipping.

87
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.620
valeria brenner: Yeah, it's a shipping form that they send to customers, actually, or they put it in their bio.

88
00:11:51.360 --> 00:12:00.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then customers fill out the shipping form, and that's valuable for social media because you don't have a Crm. You don't have an order. You don't have a database behind it.

89
00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.370
valeria brenner: Hmm.

90
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what if you explain that

91
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:11.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you were? And you don't necessarily, when you say a shipping form, it sounds simple. What if you were to say something like.

92
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: we take the unstructured process

93
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: of people dming back and forth with addresses and zip codes and typos

94
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:29.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and turning it, putting a database behind, because you have a database in your in your system and putting a database behind those social media accounts so they can actually capture the data

95
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:36.539
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: properly store it and have a have a proper Crm, you know, and do say something about a Crm or a database like.

96
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:45.050
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: maybe you've already seen shown that in the video, and it's fine, and you don't need it in your pitch. But for me, not having seen the video first.

97
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:56.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I was sort of like, why is this valuable here, and not valuable everywhere? And why are the tools that shopify uses not doing this? And now, once you explained it, it's clear. But

98
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:07.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I feel like your real value. Prop is you take this unstructured random texting data and replace it with a Crm that can be linked to directly in social media.

99
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.890
valeria brenner: Yeah.

100
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:22.639
valeria brenner: okay, I get that and then, actually, interestingly enough, like, I talk about shopify in my QA. Because that's like a common question is like, Well, why isn't shopify doing this? Why is an Instagram after it? And so I'll tackle that as well.

101
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Kay

102
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: great.

103
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.270
valeria brenner: Awesome. Thank you.

104
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.749
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You guys are coming along. There is no question about it coming along.

105
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:37.669
Lilliana Robinson: That's awesome. I'm glad to hear that. Sorry I didn't time you to Blair yet. But we can do it after if you want run bears, snow. You're next.

106
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.630
Snow Lee / Runbear: Alright. Thank you.

107
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:45.849
Snow Lee / Runbear: So we're going to do the 1 min pitch first and the 1 min video for sharing the

108
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:57.870
Snow Lee / Runbear: use cases and the benefit, and 4 min Kenny for addressing the concerns and the addressing some of the market size. And our goal is making investors

109
00:13:58.498 --> 00:14:03.810
Snow Lee / Runbear: excited about our progress and attraction, and then starting the conversation with them.

110
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:04.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

111
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.900
Snow Lee / Runbear: So

112
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.300
Snow Lee / Runbear: look, AI Fomo is real

113
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:15.389
Snow Lee / Runbear: company. Leaders are afraid of falling behind in the generative AI scene.

114
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:32.189
Snow Lee / Runbear: They are desperate to stay competitive by utilizing Gen. AI in their workflows. But it's challenging, especially when they lack engineering resources. So they hire an AI engineers and AI consultants and spend weeks and months implementing and operating the integrations

115
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:46.569
Snow Lee / Runbear: for those industry leaders run bear is a software solution that enables them to integrate their custom. Gen. AI built on open AI or Anthropy into their daily work. Tools like slack Microsoft teams, Zendesk, and More.

116
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:54.440
Snow Lee / Runbear: In less than 10 min instead of weeks they can improve their work using Gen. AI without coding or engineering support.

117
00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:05.199
Snow Lee / Runbear: Thanks to techstars, our customer base has increased from 15 to 60, including big names like Bcg, it's fourfold in less than 3 months

118
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:12.250
Snow Lee / Runbear: one customer testified that his team has been able to handle 2.5 times more tasks than before.

119
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.539
Snow Lee / Runbear: Let's see how Rumbert makes this possible.

120
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.270
Lilliana Robinson: That was 107.

121
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:31.139
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, I think it's getting better every time. I remember being very confused. Now, maybe part of this is because I understand what you're doing better. I'm trying to think of how we get.

122
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What's your opening line?

123
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.480
Snow Lee / Runbear: It was AI, for moon is real.

124
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, okay. So you told me something. I know, what's your next line.

125
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.370
Snow Lee / Runbear: Company leaders are afraid of falling behind in the generative way I seen.

126
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, what if we change that

127
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to something like.

128
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know. I'm trying making this up on the fly.

129
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.939
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We all know that generate. AI is changing the way the world works.

130
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What are you doing in your company

131
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to make sure you don't fall behind.

132
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:20.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or I want bigger than fall behind. What are you doing in your company to make sure you don't get lost

133
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in the in the gold rush

134
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.459
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like I'm I'm looking for something that's like, Oh, shit! I better pay attention

135
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:34.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like your your Fomo is real is sort of nice. And bo, but I want like Punchy right.

136
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.270
Snow Lee / Runbear: Hmm.

137
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:40.170
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And and I don't think my first line is punchy enough. Jennifer is change like like

138
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:50.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: a you know, generative AI is the biggest computing revolution

139
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: ever.

140
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What are you doing like? I'm like accusatory. Literally. I would be pointing, what are you doing

141
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to make sure your company doesn't get trampled in the gold rush.

142
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, let me tell you about Runbear.

143
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We are the blah blah blah blah like I want. I want you to get attention and excitement

144
00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in there up front.

145
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and

146
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and then

147
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.859
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and maybe do a little bit of a clearer job explaining

148
00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:23.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that

149
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you are. So I picture you being

150
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:32.870
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the kind of integration Api layer that makes it really easy

151
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.999
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for you to take the existing tools that you have

152
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.393
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and apply AI copilots. AI

153
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:50.219
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know what the other words I'd use are. But I'm trying to think of like, what are 3 words AI co-pilots, AI writers and AI analysts

154
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: into your existing tools and workflow to make your business more productive.

155
00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I feel like that would be clearer explanation.

156
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:06.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and people would be, oh, holy shit, how do I do that. I want to do that like. Yes, yes, yes.

157
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right.

158
00:18:08.445 --> 00:18:08.820
Snow Lee / Runbear: Like.

159
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.500
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Literally think, here's your entire pitch. Imagine if I got it up there, I said, my entire pitch was

160
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: generative. AI is the largest computing revolution in the history of the world.

161
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:25.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What are you doing to make sure that your company doesn't get lost in this gold rush and trampled

162
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: runbare is a simple

163
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: integration platform that allows you to take your existing tools and processes

164
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and integrate AI, whether it's

165
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:42.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: AI co-pilots AI writers, AI analysts

166
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.659
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and bring your company

167
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: into the next generation

168
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like

169
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I feel like that

170
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.330
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that nailed it.

171
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.740
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Now. You may want to put a little bit more into it, but that was like probably 30 s.

172
00:18:58.453 --> 00:19:06.959
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: By the way, you don't have to do 60 s. If you have a teaser that is more impactful at 30 s or 40 s, do it? You could

173
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.880
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: probably beg to Liliana and use the extra time in your video or in your QA. But

174
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:18.369
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but you don't feel like it's. This is not a book report where you have to use all 60 s.

175
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:21.640
Snow Lee / Runbear: So be.

176
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:29.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Take from that what you like, and you don't like. I would like to see it be more punchy, more impactful. And you're having a stronger point of view.

177
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You're too nice.

178
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.460
Snow Lee / Runbear: I feel that I I I can feel your energy. And I I I need to learn how to do that. Yeah.

179
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.600
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay.

180
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.389
Snow Lee / Runbear: So take that.

181
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.679
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. This is recorded. Just play it on. Repeat a few times.

182
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: definitely.

183
00:19:48.592 --> 00:19:51.568
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: By the way, one of the other things.

184
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.289
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you're sitting down right now, aren't you.

185
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.610
Snow Lee / Runbear: Yes, I'm sitting down.

186
00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.259
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's easier to have energy when you're standing up. I'm standing up right now.

187
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:07.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: when you're delivering your pitch, you're gonna deliver it on a stage standing up. You should practice standing up.

188
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:16.969
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I said. This last time I will save him. Neil is like turning on his video and and thumbs up in this. I said this before, and I'll say it again. You

189
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.640
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: will

190
00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:38.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: perform like you practice. So if you practice reading it quietly while you're sitting down and blah blah blah! Your default, when you go get nervous on stage, will be to do it just the way you're comfortable reading it quietly before right. But if you practice standing up and delivering and pointing, what are you doing about your company?

191
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:46.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Boom! Boom! Boom! Then, when you get nervous, you're gonna default to doing it the way you've done it every time you're building muscle memory, Neil.

192
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.779
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I just have a few quick questions for the group.

193
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.109
Neal Sáles-Griffin: does anyone here have their question bank now?

194
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.719
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Not just of your QA questions, but a question bank from the questions you've been asked. Does that exist?

195
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.370
valeria brenner: Started, started, adding them, it's so native in America.

196
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.753
Lilliana Robinson: And for this week. So.

197
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:15.329
Neal Sáles-Griffin: That's good. That's a day room assignment, so they have to have it. Alright. My next question is, do you have a list of all of your recordings of your pitch somewhere in a drive or somewhere. Right? You haven't all the iterations you made of your pitch.

198
00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.420
valeria brenner: Yes.

199
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.660
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Good. Okay, very good. And then I think

200
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:33.290
Neal Sáles-Griffin: I think that might be it. But I just wanted to say that there's there's a bunch of stuff that we've suggested so far that I hope that you all are taking seriously, because, like Troy just said, you're at the phase now, where you should be practicing your pitch

201
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.940
Neal Sáles-Griffin: every single day, multiple times a day.

202
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:54.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: As you want to deliver it. It's not good. Some people would walk around be like, and if you go to the thing, and they're like trying to memorize it as they walk like. That's no good, I mean, I guess it's better than nothing a little bit. But what you need to do is stand in front of your phone. That's recording you

203
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.540
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and pitch to your phone

204
00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:10.889
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: with with energy and passion and emotion, and then watch it be like, Oh, God, I suck! You're gonna be your own worst critic, and then do it again better, and then watch it and then do it again. Better. That's how you get great at this.

205
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.090
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. And it is standing up. I'm standing up right now like that makes a difference.

206
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It really does.

207
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. I wanna make sure we get to people. So let's keep rolling.

208
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.730
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I love that. I woke up, Neil. See? Now I put him to sleep.

209
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.194
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah. Only for the really pivotal moments.

210
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:34.369
Neal Sáles-Griffin: Go, but I just wanted to check in and make sure y'all were good. But thank you for everything. Yeah.

211
00:22:34.654 --> 00:22:35.790
Lilliana Robinson: Daniel, I've got it.

212
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.783
Lilliana Robinson: Antonio is next. He stood up. When you talk.

213
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.440
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Up, yes.

214
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.540
Lilliana Robinson: Annie! Good.

215
00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: See, he's coachable.

216
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:44.200
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah.

217
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:45.830
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: awesome.

218
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:57.760
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Okay? So this pitch is, I'm gonna start with the pitch, and then the video, and then the QA. And the goal of this pitch is to deliver an emotional story of a challenge that overcame

219
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:07.640
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and our goal is to have people in the audience sign up to our Presale crowdfunding Company

220
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.259
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: man. Alright.

221
00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm ready.

222
00:23:11.185 --> 00:23:11.639
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Right?

223
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.890
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: One out of 3 people in this room is completely overwhelmed by stress.

224
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.219
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and I know that really well, because I'm one of them right now.

225
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:28.929
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Years back, I was stressed at high stake jobs. I was irritable, anxious, and overweight.

226
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.960
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and I wasn't even aware of it.

227
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:38.889
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Eventually I got myself an apple watch to track my exercise and calorie burn, and I lost 40 pounds in 12 months.

228
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:46.540
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yet it took me 8 years of experimenting different mindfulness techniques to get to a better state of mind.

229
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.250
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: That's a big gap.

230
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.989
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: and the key to the journey was to label my emotions, name it to tame it.

231
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.539
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: I'm Antonio forensic. CEO, of aware

232
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:08.690
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: aware, is a wearable that continuously tracks your emotions and provides you with actionable insights to accelerate your journey, to become a better version of yourself.

233
00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:13.220
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: a better parent, a better employer, a better leader.

234
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.370
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Here's how it works.

235
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.729
Lilliana Robinson: 102.

236
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:35.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, I think it's pretty good. And I think that your opening is great, especially the double Andre, about your being someone who, you know, I know, because I experience it myself. I'm you know, like you're up there. You're nervous. You have anxiety that that was great. I think there is one piece that you could do that would help connect the dots

237
00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: when you talk about the apple watch

238
00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:48.380
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: for me. So I use. You know I do count my calories on a food counter, and I have what, like all the quantified self stuff.

239
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the reason that it works for me is I get immediate feedback.

240
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:59.410
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right? So normally you eat, you eat and you eat. And a week later you're like, Oh, I gained 2 pounds

241
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:05.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: me, I can tell you how many calories I've consumed today, and how many I have left, and I have that immediate feedback, and that will

242
00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:09.799
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: cause me to alter my behavior based on the immediate feedback.

243
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.150
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so.

244
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.789
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: if you have some way of communicating that quickly.

245
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that I used an apple watch

246
00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:23.879
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to get immediate feedback on my caloric intake and my energy, which helped me lose 40 pounds over the first 12 months.

247
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.599
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But it took me 8 years

248
00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to get to the point of mental wellness.

249
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And that's because I didn't have immediate feedback.

250
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.379
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what did I do? I built a where?

251
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.729
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Where is the tool that gives you immediate feedback

252
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.589
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: on your mental state of mind allows you to change your behavior just like the apple watch.

253
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.060
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But this time it's for your mental state.

254
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.009
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Does that make sense.

255
00:25:51.470 --> 00:26:11.910
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Absolutely. Yeah, thanks. Thank you, Troy. This is absolutely makes sense. So I can repeat 3 times immediately, because that's the key is like I can say, the apple watch gave me media feedback. What I was missing in that journey was the media feedback, and I to try all these different meditation. Psychotherapy had even have immediate feedback.

256
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:18.169
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: And now we're building that device that gives you immediate feedback. Can I repeat it 3 times like, is that okay?

257
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.570
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Totally okay, cause that I think that's your value. Prop.

258
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.550
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Yeah.

259
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:27.020
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Right and then, and it makes sense. And so you know, and then, if you're.

260
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:42.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, depending on how you do it, maybe you do it in the QA. But it would be cool to tie back to that at some point and say, You know what we're on a journey to create mental wellness, so that instead of 8 months, 8 years, you can do it in 12 months, like I did with my apple watch.

261
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:54.610
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like, even though one was in the QA. And one was in the pitch. But they're all kind of part of the same presentation, and people remember that story when you say that it'll be really cool if you can tie back to that

262
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.199
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in your Q. And a.

263
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:05.370
Lilliana Robinson: Dan is doing something like that, so like talk to him if you want like. He had a joke in the pitch, and then his last thing in the QA. Calls back to that.

264
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.630
Lilliana Robinson: I don't know.

265
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, that's.

266
00:27:07.639 --> 00:27:08.089
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Juliana.

267
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.839
Lilliana Robinson: Dan from Web Video, who's on the call right now?

268
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.490
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Oh, Dan, okay.

269
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.429
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Hi, Dan, thanks. I'll I'll talk to you.

270
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.010
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah.

271
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.670
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right.

272
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:30.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think that'll be good. I think I think you were in the right direction. But I think if you can make that parallel between why the Apple watch was so successful and just call it immediate feedback. People will understand and then tie it to. That's what we're doing differently.

273
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.010
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Bingo! You got it.

274
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.964
Antonio Forenza - AWEAR, Med: Beautiful. Thank you so much, Troy. Appreciate. It is awesome.

275
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:41.209
Lilliana Robinson: Thanks. Aware. Okay. W. Next is art. It looks like he's also standing up and ready.

276
00:27:42.245 --> 00:27:42.489
Lilliana Robinson: Brad.

277
00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:46.000
Arthur Fields: I am. I am just trying not to be too loud. So the.

278
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.135
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: No, you gotta be loud, dude. This is about being loud.

279
00:27:49.420 --> 00:28:06.179
Arthur Fields: Import. I'm talking about an import here over. So like all the conference rooms, have been booked. Alright. So the purpose is to get investor interest. So I'm gonna start with our verbal pitch to showcase the data, the back the problem in this with the story as well.

280
00:28:06.654 --> 00:28:19.750
Arthur Fields: And then move over to the benefits by well showcasing the benefits through our demo video. And then QA. Will showcase the marketing, the market size and the cost analysis. As well.

281
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.770
Arthur Fields: Okay.

282
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.870
Arthur Fields: Iraq.

283
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.740
Arthur Fields: So finding a job or hiring the right person is challenging job posts like

284
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:43.559
Arthur Fields: job post sites, such as indeed, and Linkedin average about 250 applicants, but only 25% are qualified, and 75% applicants never hear back from employers. Companies take close to 2 months to hire doing any fashion process. I'm our field founder, CEO of Club Rec.

285
00:28:43.600 --> 00:29:03.230
Arthur Fields: When I was leading recruiting at Doordash, our recruiting team struggled to meet hiring goals because we were overwhelmed with too many unqualified applicants, lack resources for timely interviews. Hell! We were pulling supervisors off the floor to help with free screens this lengthy time to hire frustrated candidates. It burnt out my recruiters, and of course we had angry, hiring managers.

286
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:07.330
Arthur Fields: Inspired by this experience. Club wreck was created.

287
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:23.049
Arthur Fields: We use AI to instantly score applicants for job matches and real industry experts to interview your top candidates. This mix of AI and human intelligence speeds up the process, reduces time from application to interview, and ensures only the best candidates are moving forward.

288
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:29.159
Arthur Fields: Now, I'd like to show you the demo that highlights our our platform's benefits and features and testimonial from our customer.

289
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.479
Lilliana Robinson: 103.

290
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:42.560
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. So, couple of things. One is we can cut out some time because you don't need to say features of testimonial from our customer, because they're going to see the testimonial from the customer. Right? So we can cut that out.

291
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.720
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Give, read your opening line.

292
00:29:46.955 --> 00:29:48.530
Arthur Fields: Finding a job

293
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.380
Arthur Fields: or hiring the right person is challenging.

294
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:56.980
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright. Why? So yeah, I get that like, how's that? Gonna get my attention? What's your next line?

295
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:08.160
Arthur Fields: Job post sites, such as indeed and Linkedin averages 250 applicants, but only 25% are qualified, and 75% applicants are ghosted by companies.

296
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.470
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, you're kind of boring. You're you're boring me. You're boring.

297
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.390
Arthur Fields: Right? Okay. Alright. So my.

298
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.409
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Point here is, I want you to have a catchy opening.

299
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:23.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So what about something like this? I don't know what the right words are. But the gist of it is this, what if you said something about

300
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and I'm I'm trying to think. Give me 1 s.

301
00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:31.440
Arthur Fields: You got it

302
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.260
Arthur Fields: with.

303
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:39.919
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Unemployment rates at historical lows. Companies are having trouble fulfilling open positions.

304
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:48.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And it's not because of a lack of occup. It's not because of a lack of applicants. They actually have far too many.

305
00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:55.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What the hell! They can't fire people because they got too many applicants. I'm confused. I better pay attention.

306
00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.569
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You see, 75% of those are unqualified. They're horrible.

307
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Well, and then you go into your whole thing like I Wanna, I don't know that that was quite the right.

308
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:11.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the quite the right mix. But what I want to do is give them something that they think doesn't make sense.

309
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The reason it's so hard. The reason we can't fill these positions

310
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: isn't because we have a lack of occupants. It's because we have too many applicants.

311
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.270
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Huh?

312
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I got to pay attention.

313
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:31.449
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then you go into how your tool solves the problem of too many applicants, because that's really what your tool solves right?

314
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:32.290
Arthur Fields: Right?

315
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.030
Arthur Fields: That's correct.

316
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And and

317
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, I mean, we've we've heard about

318
00:31:38.131 --> 00:31:42.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know how hard it is to fill job posts, and we've heard about unemployment being

319
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:48.309
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: rates are historical lows. But like so all these data points that don't like make sense.

320
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:54.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And then you get 45 s to explain how your tool makes sense out of all of this, and makes it better.

321
00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.889
Arthur Fields: Like that.

322
00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:03.079
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Saying, hiring is hard like you just bored me. I know hiring is hard.

323
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:04.000
Arthur Fields: Hi.

324
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:13.429
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Tell me something I don't know is my point. That's why I like opening up with something that's surprising. A big number a you know something that will

325
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:18.240
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: keep people so that they'll cause if you say 15 s of boring stuff, I'm on my phone.

326
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.699
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm like, Yeah, whatever he's saying, I gotta check these. My phone was buzzing a minute ago. Right? That's what's gonna happen.

327
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.139
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so get have something catchy and surprising.

328
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.150
Arthur Fields: Okay. Okay.

329
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.250
Arthur Fields: Gotcha.

330
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:32.700
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Friday night.

331
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.320
Arthur Fields: Thanks, Troy. Anything else.

332
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.419
Arthur Fields: What about what do you think about the combo of the story?

333
00:32:39.941 --> 00:32:46.929
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I love that you were the hiring manager I love that you did, hiring. I love that you were. You know you dropped in

334
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:56.629
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: last time you had a little more detail about pulling, hiring, pulling managers off of the line, and you know, taking them away from their jobs. And it felt like too much, and this time it felt right.

335
00:32:56.967 --> 00:33:09.030
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think the rest of it felt pretty good. I would work on if you get a bigger opening, and you cut out the piece about about listen to our testimonials because it's going to be obvious. Their testimonials. I think you're going to get. I think you're going to be there.

336
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:10.030
Arthur Fields: Okay.

337
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Awesome.

338
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.909
Arthur Fields: Appreciate it. Thanks, joy.

339
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:13.970
Lilliana Robinson: Rate.

340
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:20.769
Lilliana Robinson: Thanks. Art. So, Christy, you're next. Are you able to stand up and like tilt your screen back? We're practicing standing.

341
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.739
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Okay, so I am standing, although I am.

342
00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.240
Lilliana Robinson: And that's.

343
00:33:24.685 --> 00:33:25.130
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Lynch.

344
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.519
Lilliana Robinson: You're right, Jessica.

345
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:26.950
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Andy.

346
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.220
Lilliana Robinson: There you go. Well, the background's blurred so I couldn't tell if you're sitting or not.

347
00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.329
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Yeah. Like.

348
00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.912
Lilliana Robinson: Whenever you're ready.

349
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.240
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Hospital. It was.

350
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:41.650
Lilliana Robinson: You join late. So let me tell you. Just tell Troy your objective for each of the 3 parts, and then your overall goal for Demo Day.

351
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.550
Lilliana Robinson: Right.

352
00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:57.827
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Yeah. So Troy. Our objective is really, to get connections to to the wineries and the retailers where they're at to land our next pilot, and we wanna be able to iterate that in the pitch in the video and also in the QA. The order will be

353
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.740
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: me, pitching first, and then our video

354
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:18.790
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: and the will share the problem with a small wineries. Introduce how parenting makes wine shopping better for both the wineries and the shoppers, and then the video will highlight the shopper experience in the store and explain in more details the benefits for both the Wineries and the retailers.

355
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Kay.

356
00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:21.379
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Colonel.

357
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:30.469
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Parenting Thing provides a wine pairing software on a subscription model to help wineries sell their wines at retail stores.

358
00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:38.729
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Did you know small independent wineries, spent over $2,000 a month per retail account to maintain their store aisle presence.

359
00:34:38.809 --> 00:34:42.859
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: often working in the dark without clear insights, to whom they are selling.

360
00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:57.979
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: That's where parenting comes to the rescue next time you are grocery shopping you can now scan a QR code on a shelf talker or use the kiosk and know what wanting to buy for what you're having for dinner, and you may discover a wine that's new and interesting

361
00:34:58.009 --> 00:35:12.569
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: in our recent pilot. We helped the founder of a startup wine business just breaking into their first retail store to attract shoppers like you and me. That would be drawn to their story and their wines, and we were able to increase sales by 20%

362
00:35:12.809 --> 00:35:26.019
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: after pivoting from large enterprises like target. We're now signing a new customer in 3 weeks. Let's take a look how we're making wine, shopping, easy, helping, independent wineries and their retail partners serve you better.

363
00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.700
Lilliana Robinson: One on one.

364
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:28.639
Lilliana Robinson: Oh, hmm!

365
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.340
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Better.

366
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.820
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

367
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:37.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think I understand it, and I know we've talked before. So I I get it.

368
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:45.109
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't feel like it was like, Oh, my God! I'm on the edge of my seat. I want to see this video. I want to see this demo. So

369
00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.029
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know one of the other ways you can get people's attention is by making

370
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.709
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: get building anticipation.

371
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.960
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, I really wanna see like, like. So for instance, with a where I'm like

372
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:10.680
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you get instant feedback on your mood like, how the hell is that going to work? I want to see that like I don't even have a mental model of what that looks like, or seems like, right? So that'll be really cool.

373
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But

374
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:18.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: this one was like, yeah. So it's a Saas program. It's marketing for wines. It's like.

375
00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:29.949
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I feel like I I want to see a stronger opening. I don't wanna so you opened with the name of your company pair. Anything is a Saas product that helps of like.

376
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:32.190
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know, Christy. It's kind of boring

377
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:33.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right?

378
00:36:34.462 --> 00:36:37.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I thought that last time we did something

379
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:49.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like saying, I thought we were talking about how small wine retailers have trouble competing against the big guys because they don't have the resources. And that pair. Anything is the tool

380
00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that they use. So if I remember correctly.

381
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:57.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and maybe you don't like that approach. That's fine. By the way.

382
00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.630
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: yeah.

383
00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:08.469
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: We did like it. We're just kind of balancing also feedback from our eir. So we'll we'll we'll regroup as a team and and figure out what would make it stronger as an opening.

384
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. Who's your eir for the oak? Who's doing this?

385
00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:12.940
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Max.

386
00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.504
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay. And he's

387
00:37:16.229 --> 00:37:21.079
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Stating our one liner in the beginning, just to give people a primer of what we do.

388
00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:26.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. So I will be clear. There are lots of approaches to this, and I don't

389
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: think that mine is necessarily any better.

390
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I like to

391
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.510
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: create interest in the problem

392
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.739
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: before I talk about the solution.

393
00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:42.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Because if I don't understand, why do I want to hear about a solution that I don't even know what the problem is.

394
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:51.040
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I my approach. And, by the way, for everybody, use whatever approach works for you, whatever feels right, it's most important that it's authentic to you.

395
00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But

396
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I like to have a problem, a hard, hitting problem

397
00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that people can relate to and are like, Damn, what's the solution. Oh, you got a solution to that.

398
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's great.

399
00:38:05.003 --> 00:38:14.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And so, you know, that's just my style. So I would probably open with either the consumer problem or the winery problem.

400
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.210
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know, or both

401
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:23.580
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: consumers are confused about what wine goes with, what product. We've all been there.

402
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:31.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and the boutique wineries. They don't have the marketing budget to get in front of you, and just for you to even know they exist.

403
00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.180
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's hard to be in the wine business.

404
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We at pair anything make it a lot easier.

405
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Let me tell you how we work.

406
00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:46.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! That would be my style again. Max has a different style than I do.

407
00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.840
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: totally cool. You have to find what's authentic to you.

408
00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Kay.

409
00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.471
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Thank you so much, Troy.

410
00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:00.600
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: I really like the way you frame that, so we'll we'll we'll balance it, and we'll get the.

411
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:14.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, yeah, and I will not be insulted. By the way, nobody should feel like, Oh, Troy's going to be insulted if I don't take his advice. I know that if you talk to 10 people about your pitch you're going to get 20 different suggestions, and you have to pick the one that's right for you. So.

412
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:37.159
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: I do just wanna share one thing. I I did post a a short video because you know, we're piloting it right now that video the imagery in that vision video is essentially the most catching. I I'm almost tempted to just use real life footage because we got like inquiries from like 10 wineries already, just from watching us a short video on Linkedin.

413
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:52.989
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: So I would. I want to be able to kind of incorporate that kind of connection where they could see exactly what's happening in store and be able to pull in. You know, someone who's grocery shopping, but also have empathy with a small winery start struggling in the grocery aisle.

414
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:54.850
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: Okay.

415
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.800
Christy Serrato | PairAnything: thank you so much, Troy. You're good.

416
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.250
Lilliana Robinson: Jayla, are you ready.

417
00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.320
Jennifer Loh: Hello!

418
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.220
Lilliana Robinson: Embarrassed.

419
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We don't see you.

420
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.640
Jennifer Loh: Oh, my God! I look like shit because I just.

421
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.909
Lilliana Robinson: She has Covid.

422
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.329
Jennifer Loh: I'll stand up. Hold on! Let me find.

423
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:12.940
Lilliana Robinson: Just stand. But it's okay if you don't want to be on camera.

424
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:18.500
Lilliana Robinson: Taylor's been out all week with Covid, but I appreciate that you still been coming to stuff, cause it's go 10.

425
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.259
Jennifer Loh: I know it's go time. Here, let's see if we can do this.

426
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.290
Jennifer Loh: Hold on.

427
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:23.440
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Oh, we can do this.

428
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.109
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, we'll trust that you're standing whenever you're ready at.

429
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:26.980
Jennifer Loh: You see me.

430
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.509
Lilliana Robinson: Not bad. You're fine.

431
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:30.750
Jennifer Loh: Okay.

432
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.409
Jennifer Loh: I don't want to be that American tourist.

433
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:44.809
Jennifer Loh: That is the most common phrase spoken in our customer interviews, and I get it. Nobody wants to stand in lines to do the same. 3 or 4 things that everyone else is doing.

434
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:59.579
Jennifer Loh: and what they care most about is finding the hidden gems and off the beaten path travel. But there's also growing realization that tourism, the tourism industry, destroys the environment and local culture, and nobody thinks it can go on like this.

435
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.519
Jennifer Loh: We initially thought that these were 2 distinctly different problems to solve.

436
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:14.880
Jennifer Loh: finding hidden gems or traveling more sustainably. But as it turns out, they're actually the same problem. And the answer is a new kind of experience called regenerative travel.

437
00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:23.709
Jennifer Loh: regenerative travels all about finding unique authentic experiences, the kind of perspective, altering travel that life is all about.

438
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.070
Jennifer Loh: and that leaves a place better than you found it.

439
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:39.949
Jennifer Loh: My name is Jennifer Lowe, CEO, and co-founder of traverse. And we are building a platform for regenerative travel. So that also bean path travelers can access unique, culturally immersive experiences that are good for people and planet.

440
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:45.009
Jennifer Loh: We actually just got back from Hawaii, where we experienced the Travirus experience ourselves, check it out.

441
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.870
Lilliana Robinson: 1 10.

442
00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.110
Lilliana Robinson: I don't like that, you said Experience twice in the last.

443
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:54.590
Jennifer Loh: I know we're like trying to figure out how to like, weave that in because we go

444
00:41:55.190 --> 00:42:13.400
Jennifer Loh: pitch video. QA. And like Max was like you should have like a like a real that opens up the video because it's too good, like Lisa and her husband. They're like cinematographers. So like, it's an actual, real video, even though it was like hell of scrappy. And we just like, basically

445
00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:18.962
Jennifer Loh: did it ourselves, like we woke up at one in the morning and went out and did the experiences ourselves.

446
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:31.249
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So let me ask a question, and I've kind of we've talked about this, but is what may my impression now? Not before. Is that what makes these experience so meaningful

447
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:41.689
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: is they are not experiences where you're sitting in a boat and looking at things, or where you're they're experiences where you're actually doing and interacting and potentially helping.

448
00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:42.470
Jennifer Loh: Yeah.

449
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:43.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Am I correct?

450
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:51.019
Jennifer Loh: Yeah, it's like, culturally or culturally immersive. So you're they're a lot more like intimate experiences.

451
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Give me an example of one of your best experiences. That you put on.

452
00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:24.820
Jennifer Loh: We have a canopy Zipline and conservation experience where basically you go ziplining with a conservationist. And like as you're zip lining over native forests. Then you're like learning about this place, learning about the native plants, the culture of the place. And then when you finish the Zipline tour, you go off the beaten path. And like, actually go and like replant native trees. And you learn about the ecosystem. But it's actually really cool. Because

453
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:38.009
Jennifer Loh: basically, this, like 300 acre native forest wouldn't exist without tourism. So like the owner of this company, basically, yeah, they built it, built the first, and then that pays for the conservation work.

454
00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:50.039
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Okay, so that's what was missing to me from your pitch. So when you said we had these 2 things, we could we, you know the 2 different things and off the beaten path and regenerative. And we realized they were the same problem.

455
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.830
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: You didn't finish the thought for me.

456
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.810
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So imagine if you could say off the beaten path

457
00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:00.265
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: impact, you know,

458
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.650
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: small footprint, or however you describe it, you know, boom and say, for example.

459
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.849
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: in Costa Rica

460
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:22.159
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: we have a tree top zip line program, you know. Zip line should where? Yes, you zip line across. And yes, you hear about all the native species, and then you get the opportunity to go and plant native trees

461
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:28.290
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and regenerate the forest. Literally, your tourism is making the planet. Better

462
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.970
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: like that. To me

463
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:34.869
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it's is way more impactful than all the other words you said.

464
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:35.660
Jennifer Loh: Hmm,

465
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:52.609
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Because I got the gist of what it is now, when you said your first, whatever minutes, 7, or whatever you said, I still didn't have a mental image. But now I've got this mental image of like, Oh, cool! I'm going to learn about this forest, and then I get to make the forest bigger by planting trees.

466
00:44:53.830 --> 00:45:10.717
Jennifer Loh: right? Yeah, I think, like, because there is a lot of question around like what is what is regenerative travel. And so we tried to define that. And so I think, like being even more clear and concrete like this is exactly what you're doing. That makes the planet better, I think. But add.

467
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:17.129
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Because I could. I couldn't for the longest time I couldn't get my head around. How is my traveling to a place going to make it better.

468
00:45:17.528 --> 00:45:19.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know. But then, you know

469
00:45:20.339 --> 00:45:35.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: it's almost like a modern day version of some of the piece Corey kind of stuff. I mean, you're probably not digging latrines and doing that kind of stuff. And but it's that sort of thing. You're going to an unusual pace. You're learning about the culture, and you're helping them make their place better.

470
00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.090
Jennifer Loh: Right.

471
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.320
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And that's a meaningful emotional experience.

472
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.150
Jennifer Loh: Ripe.

473
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:46.460
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So I'd love to see you. It's sort of like we talk about show. Don't tell

474
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.179
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and pitches. It's of course you don't have video to.

475
00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:50.670
Jennifer Loh: Physical.

476
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:57.049
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Show, but you can have them paint a mental model. You can show them with your, you know, with your story.

477
00:45:57.859 --> 00:46:01.985
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and maybe the Zip lining is a great example. Maybe you have another example.

478
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:14.710
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you know. Maybe you could rifle off a couple Zip lining through a native forest, and Costa Rica, and then planting the very trees that are native that that make it bigger. That's a be, you know

479
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:26.620
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the snorkeling in the in the Caribbean Sea, and then helping regenerate the coral that is necessary to replace all the bleach coral. We help have a positive impact on everywhere we go.

480
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.150
Jennifer Loh: Like.

481
00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:33.229
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Then you don't have to explain, Jennifer. Regenerative travel. You've described it. You've you've shown it.

482
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:39.920
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think that's more powerful than the words you use to try to describe it in your in your 1 min pitch.

483
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.099
Jennifer Loh: Okay, I'm gonna rework this. Thank you.

484
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:44.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: All right.

485
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:54.500
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, I think we can power through the last 2. Dan, are you standing up, Dan, from web web visio? And then, Pardo, you'll be last.

486
00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:59.430
Lilliana Robinson: and then, Felipe, you just see your name in the chat, but if we have time for you, we'll try to get to you, too.

487
00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.659
Lilliana Robinson: So 3 more, 4 min each. I'll time it.

488
00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.350
Lilliana Robinson: Go ahead, Dan.

489
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:10.089
Dan Ponomarenko: Right so the the beach, first, video, second, and QA.

490
00:47:11.116 --> 00:47:11.693
Dan Ponomarenko: So.

491
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.860
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The objective of the pitch.

492
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:22.899
Dan Ponomarenko: So objective of the pitch to show versus the market. There is a gap in communication between

493
00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.050
Dan Ponomarenko: project stakeholders and web developers.

494
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:40.419
Dan Ponomarenko: And this problem is cost like 40 64 billion dollars, just because they spend up 50% of the time on back and forth collaboration.

495
00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.440
Dan Ponomarenko: Alright

496
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:53.560
Dan Ponomarenko: pressure over 3 million web developers and digital managers work under the pressure of missed deadlines while working on web design projects.

497
00:47:53.850 --> 00:48:03.439
Dan Ponomarenko: Most of the delays are caused by miscommunication and fragmented feedback through the multiple channels like emails, screenshots, chats.

498
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:18.580
Dan Ponomarenko: digital specialist and web developers spend up to 50% of their time on back and forth communication while working on my project. It cost industry 64 billion dollars a year worldwide

499
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:33.559
Dan Ponomarenko: with visuals streamline the development process by allow users to collaborate on live website and pages communicate directly on pages and digital assets, track progress and share visual feedback in a matter of seconds.

500
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:41.519
Dan Ponomarenko: It gives everyone clarity of what has to be done, and gets all team members on the same page.

501
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:43.949
Dan Ponomarenko: literally on the same page.

502
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:55.379
Dan Ponomarenko: I'm then CEO, of a visual, and I will show you how to. We have already helped over 1,000 companies. Take the time back and make their life better.

503
00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:58.450
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Kay

504
00:48:58.580 --> 00:48:59.420
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that was.

505
00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.642
Lilliana Robinson: 1 min, exactly.

506
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:07.769
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm trying to think of an opening, and I know how I would do it if you had slides. But I'm trying to think of an opening where it's like

507
00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:11.390
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: anxiety.

508
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:28.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's nerve wracking to be up here speaking to all of you. But you know, what's more, nerve wracking when I was a web developer, and I had requests coming in. They were coming in on slack and on, on email and on text and on. I I was just dodging them. It was crazy

509
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that pressure drove me nuts.

510
00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Turns out I wasn't alone.

511
00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:42.310
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Web developers spend over 50% of their time dealing with this asynchronous messaging that's coming from all directions.

512
00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But at web visio we're going to solve all that.

513
00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:51.529
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We put the communication in the web page where the problem is

514
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:53.490
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

515
00:49:53.730 --> 00:50:07.740
Lilliana Robinson: What Troy just said was a lot clearer, I think, Dan, for that value. Prop. You know we were talking yesterday how it got muddled in your pitch, and you can still your pressure. He wants to use the song like under pressure, so you can still do exactly what Troy just said, and just swap the word anxiety for pressure.

516
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:15.559
Dan Ponomarenko: Okay, yeah. And it's also like my QA. Ends with the with the no pressure.

517
00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:16.800
Dan Ponomarenko: You know.

518
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.120
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah.

519
00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:17.760
Dan Ponomarenko: Yeah, so, yeah.

520
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:45.279
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, yeah. So so press, I didn't realize you were doing under pressure. But that's fine. So pressure. So you could do the same thing with pressure, you know, under pressure. Yeah, I feel like I'm under a lot of pressure being up here in front of all of you. But it's nothing compared to what it was like when I was a web developer I had to dodge. I had like boom, boom! And I literally am picturing you like doing the superhero thing, and like dodging the various, you know as they as you say them. You know, email slack text messages, you know. You know, whatever Jira.

521
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.250
Dan Ponomarenko: Yeah, and and.

522
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:52.339
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Have like a list of 7 or 8 that you can just rifle off. Really fast. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! It's crazy

523
00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:57.200
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and like, get emotional about it. You're kind of monotone when you talk.

524
00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:03.417
Dan Ponomarenko: I'm I'm very calm. I'm not like, I don't have any artistics, you know. Skills.

525
00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:11.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I'm an engineer. I'm very calm. I'm very, very even keeled, but I can deliver it a little bit when I need to.

526
00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:14.000
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: It's not hard, you'll deliver it.

527
00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:16.260
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Alright! Thanks, Super, Harold.

528
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:16.870
Jennifer Loh: Energy.

529
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:19.970
Jennifer Loh: We have had a birthday.

530
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:27.082
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I have energy. I definitely have energy, but I am. I am not artistic. I have no acting skills.

531
00:51:27.702 --> 00:51:31.379
Lilliana Robinson: When I hear you do these, I'm like Troy is built for this stage.

532
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.319
Lilliana Robinson: You missed your calling.

533
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.719
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: No, I yeah.

534
00:51:36.196 --> 00:51:39.899
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I can only do what's authentic, what I believe, what I hear like I couldn't.

535
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:40.440
Lilliana Robinson: Nice like.

536
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.829
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Couldn't play another character, I would be horrible with that.

537
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:48.909
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And that, by the way, is why I keep saying to you guys, what's important is you do what's authentic to you.

538
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:58.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because it will come off as so much more sincere. And if your style is calm and cool, you're gonna have to play up to that style

539
00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:05.160
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: right? If your style is rah, ra, go get them! Play up to that style. Don't try to be something you're not.

540
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:12.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But you do have to have some energy and deliver like it's going to be hard to stand out if you're just totally monotone.

541
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.370
Lilliana Robinson: A lot of you haven't been to work on that.

542
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:18.939
Lilliana Robinson: So, Pardo, are you able to stand? Are you standing right now?

543
00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:23.429
Lilliana Robinson: You've got that tech setup. So we can't tell. Okay, cool whenever you're ready.

544
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:30.533
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Okay, awesome. And I did go over this with Troy earlier this morning. But I just wanna burn it into my brain at this point. So

545
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Another pass.

546
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.448
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

547
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:35.280
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Alright.

548
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:38.749
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: One trillion dollars a day.

549
00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.609
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: That's the total dollar value of securities traded

550
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:43.710
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: daily

551
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.760
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: one trillion dollars a day.

552
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:53.550
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: This creates billions of data points, or even the smartest traders don't know what to do with all that data

553
00:52:53.710 --> 00:53:01.489
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: at Trinium labs. We've developed tranium AI, where we take those billions of data points and help you make sense of it.

554
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:13.450
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Our AI trained to perform the work of over a hundred technical indicators, the same algorithms used by the world's top hedge funds in high frequency trading made effortless for you.

555
00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:21.159
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: And if you have a question, just ask our AI, and it'll distill out to you whether a genuine investment opportunities presenting itself.

556
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.250
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: or even coach you on your execution.

557
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:29.909
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: We piece together the most disparate pieces of information. Others don't even know to look for

558
00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:36.759
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: taking the complexity out of trading and investing, to help you season opportunities effortlessly.

559
00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:39.969
Lilliana Robinson: Was 1 min flat.

560
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:50.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, I mean, I we talked about this earlier, Pardo. I think it's good, but I want to say something for everybody else. His presentation was not super hero dodging, jump up and down.

561
00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:56.139
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but part of that is because his value prop is, we take all of this chaos

562
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:58.559
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and turn it into useful information.

563
00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We're calm. We're

564
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:17.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: where we have the knowledge. We have the like, the the that's part of the brand to me. That's part of the brand. That's confidence. That's so I think I think it's I think it's great, and I like your pace slow delivery. You're pausing at important points.

565
00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I think it's great.

566
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:20.559
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Thank you. I really appreciate it.

567
00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.229
Pardo Walter | Trinium Labs: Yeah, thank.

568
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:31.930
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: And they should all be different. I mean, if they all were super hero style, it would be really boring to watch 24 of those. The fact that they're each going to be different is really good for you.

569
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.249
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: because you will stand out by being different.

570
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:41.429
Lilliana Robinson: Yeah, and we'll try to make the order so that it's very dynamic. And that is not just a bunch of the same like same kinds of pitches back to back.

571
00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.600
Lilliana Robinson: So, Felipe, we have time.

572
00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.300
Felipe - Gohaus: But right.

573
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:44.870
Lilliana Robinson: Pardon.

574
00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:55.670
Felipe - Gohaus: Few minutes, pitch, video, Demo and Q&A, and looking for starting conversation with the angel investors. People related to.

575
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:58.690
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: But what's the objective of the pitch? The pitch is 6.

576
00:54:59.081 --> 00:55:06.510
Felipe - Gohaus: The beach idea is where we were and where we are going, like what we have been doing, and.

577
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:07.340
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So

578
00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:11.230
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: alright, I'll ask you yet. So the pitch is successful. If

579
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:13.110
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: fill in the blank.

580
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:18.890
Felipe - Gohaus: Alright. So the beach is successful if I can find investors for

581
00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.400
Felipe - Gohaus: for, like India investor, to start conversation with them.

582
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:29.069
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah. But so Liliana may have to help me here. So overall, I know that's what you're trying to accomplish.

583
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.449
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah, like, the pitch.

584
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:32.299
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Itself has some objective in.

585
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:32.640
Felipe - Gohaus: Yes.

586
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.419
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Series of 3 things. The pitch is successful. If.

587
00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:37.775
Lilliana Robinson: Like, is it making people understand your problem.

588
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:38.470
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah.

589
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:39.060
Lilliana Robinson: So the new.

590
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:46.949
Felipe - Gohaus: Yeah. First problem, then, how we address that problem, what we are doing with that problem.

591
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:52.479
Felipe - Gohaus: a bit of traction of what we're doing in in where we are heading on that.

592
00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:59.110
Lilliana Robinson: So you want people to understand what you're doing, what the problem is, what your traction is and where you're headed all from. Just the 1 min pitch.

593
00:55:59.837 --> 00:56:00.999
Felipe - Gohaus: Kind of yeah.

594
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.309
Lilliana Robinson: Okay, let's hear it.

595
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:24.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: That's hard. So feedback for everybody, it's much simpler if you have a single objective which each each one of the stages, the last one with QA. You can do more because you have more time. But typically it's like, I wanna peak their interest. I wanna define why this is such an important problem. I wanna like there's typically a single thing for each one. But let's we're running out of time. So let's go. Let's roll.

596
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:34.619
Felipe - Gohaus: Okay? So during my 18 years in real estate, I saw how Telco, consuming an expensive space decoration process can be for customers and companies

597
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:42.979
Felipe - Gohaus: to streamline is to streamline this process. Last year we started by seeking partnership with retailers to connect with the real-time inventories.

598
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:55.099
Felipe - Gohaus: Using AI, we automatically categorize their products into a styles, and with this we create personalized product recommendation for customers and companies. Now, spaces can be furnished. Within a week

599
00:56:55.330 --> 00:57:02.539
Felipe - Gohaus: we pilot our platform with warmer chile, where over 3,000 customers so personalized product recommendation in just a few months

600
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:05.820
Felipe - Gohaus: we keep understanding from them to accelerate sales.

601
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:22.759
Felipe - Gohaus: Now, through text starts, we are demonstrating the value of our platform for the largest asset class in the world. Multifamily, companies with over 50 million short term rental units globally properties must be furnished quickly with the style, and within budget to accelerate renters and increase cash flows.

602
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:30.179
Felipe - Gohaus: I am Felipe Co. Founder and CEO of go-host. We are making decoration process simple and cheaper for people and companies. Let me show you how.

603
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:43.473
Lilliana Robinson: So that was 103. When you say Walmart, Chile, it's getting lost in your accent, Felipe. So I want you to like really practice, and unseating those 2 words, because it'll be easy for people to not hear what you're saying for that part.

604
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:46.130
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Did not hear. Walmart, yeah.

605
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:51.410
Lilliana Robinson: You kinda just like slurred through it. Make sure you're really enunciating those words.

606
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:52.179
Felipe - Gohaus: Or for.

607
00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:59.760
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: What's your first opening state sentence?

608
00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:10.639
Felipe - Gohaus: So it's during my 18 years in real estate I saw how tight consuming and expensive space decoration process can be for customers and companies.

609
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:14.950
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Yeah, what's next?

610
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:18.450
Felipe - Gohaus: So

611
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:26.579
Felipe - Gohaus: to streamline that process. Last year we started by seeking partnership with retailers to connect with the real-time inventories.

612
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:34.710
Felipe - Gohaus: Using AI, we automatically categorize their products into styles. And with this we create personalized product recommendation for customers

613
00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:38.759
Felipe - Gohaus: and cost and companies. Now, spaces can be furnished within a week.

614
00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:46.890
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: So is your cut. Who pays you? Does the retailer pay you, or does the cut consumer pay you.

615
00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:49.219
Felipe - Gohaus: The retailer pays us today.

616
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:51.200
Felipe - Gohaus: hey?

617
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:56.550
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: How big is home furnishings is a worldwide market.

620
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:01.430
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and

621
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.300
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: and how many

622
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.080
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 100 billion Us. Dollars? Alright.

623
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:20.399
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I want. I I want, I'm trying to come up with a more exciting opening. I don't have it yet, but let me give you my thought process.

624
00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:25.590
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Imagine if you said 500 billion dollars.

625
00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:31.850
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: that's how much is spent on home furnishing each year. Yeah, people find it difficult

626
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:51.469
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: to just make those decisions. And and this and and to furnish their homes. Worse is people who have is companies that have multi family residential units, where they have to furnish the homes in order to make them appealing and rent them. People of Airbnb's, and have to furnish them, make them appealing to rent them.

627
00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:58.619
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We make the process easy

628
00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:04.660
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: by partnering with retailers who share their inventory with us.

629
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:16.179
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: Our AI engine figures out what's in stock? What? Appealed, what you know, what goes with, what the matching, however, use those words and makes the process of furnishing these

630
01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:22.400
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: these homes at scale as simple as clicking a button and accepting a delivery.

631
01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:28.780
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: you can literally furnish an entire apartment building of 300 units in just a week.

632
01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.779
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: The best part is that the retailer pays for it.

633
01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:46.099
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: but the Re, the retailer pays for it because they want to make sure that their products are being represented. We have partnerships with Walmart based in Chile

634
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:52.019
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: 3,000 apartments. I don't know whatever you said. Boom! Boom! Boom! We're changing the way

635
01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.790
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: the vast majority

636
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.100
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: or the majority of multifamily tenants are gonna get

637
01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.479
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: multi family apartments are, gonna get

638
01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:00.940
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: get furnished.

639
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.140
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: We're making it that simple.

640
01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.341
Troy Henikoff (he/him) | MATH Venture Partners: I don't know. It's just an attempt.

641
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:10.770
Lilliana Robinson: I'm sure you have to hop. Try. I know we're 2 min over.
