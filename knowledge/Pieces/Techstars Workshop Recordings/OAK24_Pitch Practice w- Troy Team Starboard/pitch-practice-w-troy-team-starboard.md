### Frameworks & Methodologies

- valeria brenner: Okay. But I'm doing the video first. And the objective of the video is to show the opportunity, the problem, the solution and then start teasing at traction, then, the pitch which my objectives are to show the market size, the value, proposition, or traction, and like what our next steps are, and then I'm doing QA. So just to get right into it. There are over 200 million small businesses, artists, makers, and thrift shops selling on Instagram.
- valeria brenner: moving forward. We want to keep automating and simplifying the process. That's why we're launching thrift ship 2.0 next week with the goal of making shipping as easy and error free as possible.
- valeria brenner: I kinda go into it in the video cause I used to sell on social media. And so I talk about how all customer transactions are done through dms. So customers are just texting you their address. And so it becomes a very manual process for these small businesses, where they're copying over each address, which is incredibly time consuming and error prone.

### Key Insights

> "Mircea Gogoncea: I'm trying to intrigue them with the sector that they've probably never thought about music managers and live music. I doubt everybody's ever thought about this, and we show them that it's actually quite possible to make a good profit in there."
