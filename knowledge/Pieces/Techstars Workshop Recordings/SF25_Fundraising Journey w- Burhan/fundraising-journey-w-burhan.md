### Frameworks & Methodologies

- Chloe Lannert: My approach changed so dramatically from his 1st attempt, raising directly after Demo Day to when he finally closed, and he says he's got some some good stuff to share. So I've got my list of questions and my little overview. But, Burhan, I'm gonna let you take it. And then, founders, this is also your time, same as Danny. I want you to lead the questions. Lead the conversation where you want it to go.
- Burhan Syed: because, as we started to do more customary reviews within like nightclubs. The more we realized that no one actually gave me a shit about product or wanted to buy it. And I mean, we we knew that going in prior to getting into techstars. I had done a road trip across the United States and Canada, trying to sell to every single nightclub that I could possibly approach, and every single one, I think I met with over 200 said no to us. So
- Burhan Syed: ultimately, just, it's a Testament, I guess the jobs to be done process and and talking to your customers and understanding the space. And I think also a big part of it is, you know,

### Key Insights

> "Chloe Lannert: They they always ask, do we make companies pivot or like, what's the what's the ethos around pivoting? And I always tell your story like without fail. You're actually in my in my little techstars, overview deck that I share."

> "Burhan Syed: The guys who are building Arini are like Harvard Cs majors that never worked in the dental space, and they ended up building or they ended up being like founding engineers. It's more than AI startup."

> "Burhan Syed: and so ultimately we just came to the conclusion that we just understand the space better than them. And what they had overlooked was that private equity was taking over the space. Now they've realized that a little later down the line. But we knew that going in because Alan's parents were always junko on the fact that they were going to sell their practices private equity firms, and so very quickly we understood that the niche we wanted to target was the PE space. So, given those 2, I guess considerations, it made a lot of sense to tackle as well."

> "Alex Nativelle: But that was important for you. Not only that you cared about the problem, or you thought it was an important problem, but also you could do better than the Yc. Company"

> "Burhan Syed: It was important for us to have the right positioning. And we thought we were positioned better. And it's also important for anyone to build a startup in a space that they have a unique insight on. And we knew our unique insight was that private equity was taking over, and nobody else really saw it"
