WEBVTT

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And whoever was described the 1st time will now share their W. 3, and the other partner will write down and not talk. The other partner will write down what they're hearing and what questions they have, and then we'll switch one more time. So there are 4 segments.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
We're the person that just wrote down all their notes will repeat back what they heard, and any questions.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And if there's extra time you can begin to answer the questions to your partner. But the whole point is really to just get those questions shared not for you to answer them.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Does anyone have any questions before I put you guys into breakout rooms.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I'll send you cues in the chat for your timing.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Okay.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Let's put you guys in.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
I'm gonna do it by founder, so the whole teams will not be together. We're gonna have.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Completely separate people.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
In each breakout room.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And it's gonna be pretty random.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Kevin from my team. I'm gonna put you in a room as well to.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Even out the odd number.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Alright! We'll see you guys in a second.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Makes me sad.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Alright, we're gonna.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I took all the founders there.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
We'll find one.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Okay, so what happened? How did that feel? I wanna hear from at least 2 of you.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
By. By the way, there are 2 really cool tiki bars in San Francisco.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Yeah. Good. The recordings. Now, the recording. Sorry I can shut up.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Happy to take you guys.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I'll just mention I really enjoyed talking with William and Dominique, because

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:53.000
They have a beachhead market, and we have a beachhead market that's like very niche. So it was cool. Hearing that from another founder.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Yeah, you guys have similar experiences with your businesses. I caught that.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
We also like me and Nick.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
We're pretty compatible, I guess, in Matching, because.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:16.000
We are analyzing people who play games, and he happens to be a gamer, and he happens to be a gamer. He happens to be a person who's playing a game that I am very intimate with.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
So you know, I was able to, you know. Pick out well, if you're doing that and doing that, you fall into this category in our game.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.000
And then my both of my parents are teachers, and my entire family is comprised of teachers, both in the father side and the mother side.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
So, and he's doing a student preparation.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Tech for the Iv students. So I guess that was pretty cool.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
I'm so glad you guys enjoyed it.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
What's the game?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
It sounds like somebody of you.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Yeah. Apparently he was playing legal.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Oh!

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And I gave the example out of legal. So you know.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
There you go!

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
I was like.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Oh, you guys, are, you guys are on a different level? Alright.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
You guys have so many similarities between all of you amongst the class. It's awesome.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
So I'm wondering. Did anybody like try to explain their W. 3? And then what they heard back was like totally not what they thought.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
They had said.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Did anybody have trouble getting their listener to like, really understand exactly what it was? Or were you surprised with what they heard.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
I think oh.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Circle.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Well, I have. I have a little. I'm sorry. Go on.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
For us. Do you think.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Okay, I have a little personal note I'm not the one usually.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Nonetheless.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000
I'm not the one the talkative one in my team so usually, or talks so it was kind of a different.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Experience for me to express.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
All of these things that I have in mind about our company. So.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I'm trying to get better. And this was really fun for me and educated for me personally. So I just want to add that.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:17.000
I'm so glad you added that brush. I literally have a slide for that. Everyone on your team needs to understand and believe your W. 3. You need to be able to articulate it. I I'm so happy to hear you say that it was a good experience for you, because not just the CEO, every single team member in the room today and not in the room today. So those of you who have part time participants who are part of your company, but they're not in tech stars.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Every single person needs to be able to understand and believe in your company's. W. 3.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:32.000
The reason for this not only is for company in your joint goals and initiatives, but also because you never know what the opportunities.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
What opportunities might come for every single employee that you have.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Someone might be in an elevator with a key investor or stakeholder or customer that.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:25:06.000
If they were able to pitch your W. 3 s. And explain your business could unlock huge opportunities for your business. The the CEO is not the only one who exists in the world who represents the company, so I can't tell you how many co-founders, employees, not even co-founders, just team members in general have been able to unlock opportunities because they went through techstars or their team did, and they were able to articulate their W. 3.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
These opportunities come.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000
All times, and you have to be ready for them so definitely, making sure that your team is aligned on this and that everyone can do it so, Brush! I loved that

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Liliana, how do you feel about.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
The need to customize the W. 3 to your audience. So.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
One customer might resonate with one aspect of your story versus an investor. You might think of it.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Differently, so on and so forth.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I would definitely say, just in general, the the way you would talk about your business to an investor versus a customer is different.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000
But to an investor understanding your customer deeply is extremely attractive to them. So it's it's not as different as you might think.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000
I I saw Neil nodding his head. Did you want to add to that.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Yeah.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Good question.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I had a kind of a question to build on that I was gonna wait, but.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:11.000
One thing I've struggled with is talking about the beach head with investors, cause it kind of distracts from like the bigger picture, and they get like hyper focused on that one niche that we're working on. And so.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Maybe not to answer now, but just kind of putting it out. There. That that's something that's like one of the goals I put on my sheet was to really like, think about like.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.000
How we communicate. Why, we're approaching the market like we're approaching it.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I I would start with the the grand vision, and then work your way backward to say, Here's our wedge to get there.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Okay.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
So if you lead in with how you're like what you're doing now, people will get distracted.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Especially on the investor side. But if you start with the big outcome and desired, like, you know, vision for your what you're gonna do you say? And here's how I'm gonna make it.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
I'm starting here, small but.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And then.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
You elaborate.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Could could the grand vision be too big? Can the vag be too big for cause? I've shared Vag and.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
You can sound naive.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
It scared a lot of investors home.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Yeah, okay.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Sorry I am.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Yeah, yeah, there's a sweet spot. You gotta hit the sweet spot. We'll help you with that. But, like the notion is that you have to signal a big enough vision where it can get even bigger with their input.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Meaning like you'll sell them on the.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:25.000
What you you're claiming the big vision is. And they're gonna add, oh, but you could also expand verticals. And like, you know, they're gonna get excited. Think they're like, have more ownership in it, whatever. But you already thought of it. They're just, you know, just making them feel.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Good.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Absolutely.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:38.000
So we're gonna do a ton of exercises like what you just did in the breakout room, practicing being able to articulate your business in a short amount of time. So.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
You had in total 3 min, basically 90 seconds back and forth.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:53.000
How? Basically, if that didn't work and you need more time. And you're not sure exactly how to explain it. How can you grab someone's attention and much less time. So what I mean to say here is.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:18.000
We talk about elevator pitches, 60 second pitches. You really only have 5 to 10 seconds to answer somebody. At all of the events, we're gonna put you guys in front of. So you meet a mentor at our event next week. They ask you what you're working on. You have probably about 10 seconds, Max, to get their attention. And that's what I want you guys to be able to do. I want in the that very short amount of time those few seconds for them to be able to probably feel.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
How well you know your business, and for them to understand what your business is and does, and who they serve.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
So that's our goal.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Also everything that you just explained was speculation. Like I said, you guys just wrote those down on a paper and then gave it. So we're gonna get into now.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
The actual nitty gritty of your W. 3.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:53.000
One more caveat is that until you have data, you shouldn't go too far in any one direction. So a lot of you are probably like steadfast and ready like. This is my who this is who I'm serving, and I'm sure.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:03.000
What I say in the book is being lost in the middle of nowhere, like if you were just dropped in the desert, and there are not very many landmarks, or anything to be able to know where you are.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
You wouldn't just pick a random direction and walk in that direction, and hope you'll find water or a city.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
You would start looking for landmarks, for small signs, for any sort of data. You can tell.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:39.000
That you're going in the right direction, and it's the same for your business. So make sure that you are wary of that. If any of you are going off of a lot of assumptions which we'll talk more about tomorrow. Don't just go off of a bunch of assumptions and speculation of what you feel is correct and go too far in that direction. We wanna be extremely conservative and hinge it all on validation and data.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Soresh got this point for us. We're already ready, so let's jump into w. 1.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
So w. 1 is the.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Who do, I believe, is my customer.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
So I'm gonna teach you guys about this. And then we're gonna go back through and try and rewrite what what you have.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
So who do, I believe is my customer.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
This should be at full scale. Your total addressable market.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Just like Annie was asking, but for now.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Start, narrow.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:22.000
It should be extremely uncomfortable. I know a lot of you want to talk in great detail about how big your business is going to be, and all of that. But right now your w. 1 should be a tight control group, very much like we were talking about with screening.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Even if your w. 1 segment is point 0 0 1 of the entire market that you'll eventually get to capture.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.000
At least you'll have absolute confidence that you can make a sale to every single one of those members in your Icp.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
That's how narrow it should be. Neil hinted at this in his job to be done lecture. Then I would get into this.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
This week, and that's exactly what I'm saying now.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Every single person in your w. 1 should result in a sale because of how narrow and niche it is, and how well you know their segment.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
This is not where you're ending.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:07.000
It's where you're starting, so that you can get a very deep understanding of all of the attributes and struggles that exist in that small segment.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.000
There's no such thing as too narrow. So if you feel like you are, you're probably in the right direction, and if you're just.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Putting something on the paper, like all of you did, I would say. You probably need a half, or even quarter the amount of people that are in that segment that you talked about.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
If I can just add one thing here, Liliana.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
To say it in a different way to reinforce what she just said.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
We really mean it like.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
There's there's someone probably.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Who you are getting closer to understanding, based on your jobs to be done in your analysis.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Where, if you got a chance to get in front of them with what you are building, or what you have.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
They would.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Just.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Be so ready to say yes on the spot.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Whoever that perfect customer is is what we're looking for. A descriptive.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Nothing more.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
And I find founders.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Unfortunately, because I think this whole venture market conditions you all.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
More broadly. So you need to serve a large group.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000
I'm I'm giving you permission to forget about scale and massiveness and size and all that stuff.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
I just want you to get one.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Perfect customer.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
So think about who that person is, and we'll go from there.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
That's perfect.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
So this next slide is something I love to talk about. It is the diffusion of innovation.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Or the innovators curve.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Many of you might have seen this before. Some of you haven't. A lot of the founders coming into techstars have not seen this, which is why I started teaching it in this workshop.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
So basically, what you're looking at here is.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
The adoption curve for any new technology.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And for the entire public.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:33:01.000
So it starts off with innovators who are okay with risk. And then we go into early adopters also, okay, with risk and getting in there early before they hear about it from everyone. Then there's this chasm, and there's a very famous book about crossing the chasm. That's what it's called I highly recommend. It's about sales.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
And then you get into early majority and like majority, this is when most of.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:16.000
The people out in the public are talking about it. You see it on social media. It's it's a well known household name. And then at the end we get to laggards and laggards. I always explain as.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:30.000
People who are in the nursing home learning Google for the 1st time, like, those are the kinds of people that are laggards. You guys should basically not even consider the laggards and considered like that, you will never reach them, because that's.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:38.000
What monoliths are after. At this point only big companies like Apple Google are worried about the laggards because they've already captured all the way through the late majority.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
So for you guys, I used to like, ask the question, where do you guys think that you are? A lot of people? Say, early majority.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Which makes sense. You think you're early, maybe even early adopters.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
We are.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
In the innovator section.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Every single one of you.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
And we're not even in the innovator section. I like to say we're on the line.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Of the block that starts the innovator section like exactly where that arrow points that little black line. That's us. We're at the point 0 0 1.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Of the entire Tam.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:21.000
So this is just to put into perspective. That's correct. That's what we want. We want to be so narrow and so targeted and have such a strong and deep understanding of that, and then we expand outward.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
So does anyone have questions on this diffusion of innovation.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Curve. This is very important that you understand.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
First, st mark.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Fabio! Go ahead!

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Yeah. And I just think it's very smart.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I again just picture many people we talked to.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Maybe in the late majority, or even in a laggers. And I'm just realizing now that.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
I didn't use this as a criteria when I was.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Kind of like sizing them up, or just figuring out what kind of customer they could be. But I should have this.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Yeah, yeah. I'm just like wasting your time where you.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Talk to innovators.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Exactly. It is a waste of time. You will get there.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Starting a a company as a 6 to 8 year journey. I promise you'll get to late majority cause we want all of you to be extremely successful and reach your full scale.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
But for now we're in the innovators.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Annie, did you have a question? Someone else unmuted.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Oh, I was just I I was just gonna say I I'm wondering and you might cover this later. But if there's a.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
A chasm between.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
The innovators, and early adopters, too.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:45.000
That's a good question. I think I think there's a small chasm between every section, because you are making a leap to a new segment, and it has, like different criteria. But it's just not the biggest leap.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Okay.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
The reason there's a chasm there is because it like that's where most businesses hit their pitfalls.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Like they get all the early adapters you hear about them. I'm sure you guys can think of a lot of ones that maybe you saw on Kickstarter you heard a lot about, but.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:06.000
They don't make it to early majority. They don't make it to the point that your friends know about it. Your parents know about it. They just can't cross that chasm.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Beyond the series, a Annie. So like, if you think about it, there's companies that end up doing quite well, like a lot of mine. I have a lot of companies that are now moving into the early Adopter phase over the past 5 years.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Where they're making millions of dollars. They're serving thousands and tens of thousands of customers. But now they're at that weird spot. Are we gonna make it? Are we gonna blow through? Are we gonna flatten out or stagnate.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
So it's a really sensitive spot right there, but if you get over it, then you win.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Cool.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Okay, are we good to move on from.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Diffusion of innovation. Any other questions.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Okay, this is crucial. And I will refer back to this the whole program, because this is a huge.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Part of understanding markets. And what you guys are going to go after now versus in the future.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Once you know your who intimately.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
That very narrow segment you can identify every attribute of what makes that? Who a perfect customer.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:19.000
And then, once you've validated your theory of this narrow group, you can make a list of all of the attributes and situations and struggles and circumstances that they're under of this narrow segment, and then you test each 1 1 by one, to expand your base outward at a high success rate.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:29.000
So that's kind of the secret. So you have this narrow segment that you're hitting 100 of the time. And you know this list of things about them. So maybe it's like, if we go to the Snickers example, maybe it's.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Not just people who are in a rush of the airport. Maybe people will want a snickers as well. So if we, you know.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Change our marketing toward that. Does that expand our base things like that? So you test every single attribute. And it's a much more systematic approach to expanding your market than just these random throwing darts against the wall that most people do. So. That's why I love this. It's anyone who likes data or a very systems oriented approach. This is.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Absolutely, that.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
So a lot of people ask me around this point of the workshop. What's the difference between this and Jt.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:12.000
And a long time ago I used to teach W. 3 on its own, as completely separate. And then I realized these things go together so.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:24.000
While they're both related to starting with a narrow group of customers, one is for interviewing, the other is for sales. W. 3 is a theory about your business. So the whole point of W. 3 is.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Knowing your business, and you're making this theory in jobs to be done. We don't make a theory. There's no hypothesis. You're setting out to learn something, and you don't make a guess. You just go and talk to those people for W. 3. We're trying to make a theory, and we're trying to test it, to know if it's correct.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
So.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
The Jtbd. The answer to this question is.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:52.000
The interviews and the customer discovery insights you're gonna get from doing. That is the tool to verifying whether or not your W. 3 is correct.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
So that's how we're gonna use the 2 hand in hand. It's kinda like a superpower.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
And if done well, something magical happens.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Amos calls it magical, I would just call it.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Success in this process. It will directly inform your product roadmap and your financial model in a very predictable way.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000
So without understanding this. W. 3, you're kind of making a product, roadmap and financial model in the dark.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Troy talks about it like driving with your eyes shut like you're you're not really using a map.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:33.000
This is your map. That's why I've renamed this to business. Blueprint. This is your blueprint. This is your roadmap, and it will directly inform your product and your finances in a predictable manner, so you'll be able to make those bets.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Correctly. You can invest the 10 K in making this product because you know exactly what to build.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
One more caveat is for 2 marketplaces. You will have 2. You have 2 W ones.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Focus on the one that gives you money.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
But then you should go back later and do the other half.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Just like in Java.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
So I want you guys to take. I'm gonna give you.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
90 seconds.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
To write down your who.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Based on everything that we just talked about.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Trying to make it as narrow as possible.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Can I ask a question.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Absolutely.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
I have a who in mind but.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Essentially.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
I have a who in mind which I think is really ideal.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
But that's.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
More difficult to reach than.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Other. Who's that I can think of.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Who would?

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Be more.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
It would be easier to reach, to reach out to, but.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Might not necessarily be.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
As interested in the pro, in my product.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Shall I still stay focused on whom I think is ideal, and ignore.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
The challenges of reaching to that customer.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Yeah, that's a really good question. So like, how much does accessibility play a role in this? I would say, if you're going after people who are more accessible like you can reach them more easily. But they're not as ideal.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
They're also not accessible.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
They're not going to be.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Able to be sold to a hundred percent of the time. So how hard to reach is this ideal customer.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Is it just a challenge of time? Cause? That's okay. A lot of b 2 b companies are.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Essentially, since we're a b 2 b company, the higher you go up in the organization, the more likely it is that they'll find a tool useful.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
But if I go lower in the organization.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
A manager is more likely to respond to me than the CTO.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
I see.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
But a CTO is going to find my tool more useful.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:32.000
I think we want to go with who is ideal, because even if they're easier to reach out to if they're gonna say, no, there's no point. Your efforts would have been better spent on trying to reach the harder to reach one who is more ideal.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:40.000
If you know that that's a better person to sell to, and I have an example of selling to the higher ups in a second.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:53.000
But I love that question. I I think we should try and change our mindsets where, yeah, some people might be a low hanging fruit. If they're not ideal, you're just gonna get a know every single time. And that's a waste of your time for outreach.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:05.000
I want you guys to be using your time for 100 hit rates. You're you're getting the sale every single time, or else it's a waste of your time, and the whole reason we are the whole ability to do that is based on knowing a very narrow w 1.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:16.000
So does anybody want to share what they wrote down for their very narrow w. 1 before we move on.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Yeah.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Sorry. I actually had a quick question before share is, is that is that okay?

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
So me and.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Nick, we have a a mentee, and he is. He absolutely loves our product. He reached out to us first, st saying, Hey, love, you guys are doing. I have so many ideas. I wanna help out. How can I do this?

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
But I think my question here is, do we just.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Backwards engineer almost, and just describe this exact person who was making all this effort to.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Contact us reach out to us. And you know, it's really like early curve like is that.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:54.000
To. I know we wanna get narrow. How narrow are we going there? Is that? Do we put too much faith on? Just we use our number one or.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Okay.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Probably one that you want more of that's believable. Right? So the what you're describing sounds meaning like this is someone who literally hunted you down and like.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Right.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Like they they they.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Yeah.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Th this is.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
I think it's more of the.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:19.000
You're you're right to ask this question because you do want to take it one step easier you like. I'm not saying I want all my customers to sell themselves on me, and then present themselves to me.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
And I won't have to do anything like, so that does sound like a reach.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
To me.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
I think rep.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
B- being replicable. It's very important.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
So that's why, like Neil's calling this person an exception, because you're not going to be able to replicate that.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Reaching out to people. And I'm saying, Yes, that is replicable.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
So that's really that's important. Here.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Got it. Okay.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
That was a great question.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Let's take one example of someone's who.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Yeah. George.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Cool. Thanks. Yeah. Happy to. So

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
I said.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
I'm looking for the CEO of.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Boutique Qualitative Market Research Company with over a million dollars annual revenue.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Who struggles to hire enough staff and has a backed up sales, pipeline.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
That's.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Because I've met a few of those, and I think they.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.000
I love how narrow that is! I would make the last.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Hmm.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Statement a little bit more of like what we were saying. Boolean, like it's a true or false like what defines a backed up.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Sales cycle or hard to hire people like. Did they lose a couple of recruits.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Okay.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Hmm.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Like they've lost 2 more recruits in the past year something like that where it's like someone can read that and say, that's me.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Okay, awesome. Yeah, do that.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
But that was really good. That was a really good example. Do you guys see how narrow that was?

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Not only the type of company who at the company you qualified the company. That's something that usually people don't do. I was grateful to hear you say that. So you can say like companies 50 to 100 employees, you said, with over a million in revenue. That's a great qualifier, all that was great.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Cool. Let's move to W. 2.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Yeah. Kevin.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
No, all good. I want to take your question.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Sorry I was. I thought, we're all just sharing I was. Gonna I was gonna share mine as well. We can.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Okay, you can share your W, you can share the next one.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Thank you.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Let's move on to W. 2. I'm wary of the time. So let's just keep moving forward, and I'll stay on and evaluate people's after you still want to present.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
So W. 2 is the what.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
This is, what do I believe my customer is buying from me.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
This one has a huge distinction. So like someone asked when we were doing the.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Very 1st exercise.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Do we mean W.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:48.000
What they think we're buying or what I'm selling. That's exactly what we have here. So what they're buying is different than what you are selling. Most people coming into techstars. Tell me what they're selling.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
All of you know exactly what you're selling, you know. Why you're selling it.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
But do you know what the customers are buying from you?

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
It's very similar to jobs to be done.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
So there's a distinction here.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Customers don't care what you do. They don't care that you have this.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Platform with all these bells and whistles, and this is what you do, what you provide. They care what you do for them. So there's this concept of the selfish buyer, which is every single buyer, and that's completely fine, and it's up to us to accept that about them. They only care what you can do for them.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
So what's the difference between what you do and what you can do for them?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
The difference is the job just like jobs to be done.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
So you want to lead with how the product is going to impact their lives.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.000
I'll recall to Neil's example quarter inch drill versus. If you remember the example.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
A hole in the wall.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:50.000
When someone is at home. Depot buying this quarter and drill home depot is so excited they sell all the different drills with all the different bits, every single model that they could.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Ever fathom. The person going in just wants a hole in their wall.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
They're not buying the drill from them. They don't care about what the what different drills they're selling. They want the best item.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
To get the thing that they want to accomplish, which is a hole on the wall.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
So whichever one is going to be the best for the situation that they're in, that's what they're interested in.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
So W. 2 is not always.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Concrete.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
And sometimes it's more than one thing.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Sometimes it's a little bit more abstract.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Also the W. 2 can help inform your w. 1.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
So if you're who is correct.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
You'll have data that shows your who cares about your what.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:38.000
If you're facing problems trying to validate your what, you should probably go back to your w. 1, because that means you're who isn't correct, so they directly feed into one another.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
So.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
When I say it's not always concrete.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Another example I always like to give is haircuts.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
So when I'm going to get a haircut.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000
All of the salons are selling all these different cuts, and all of these different services.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
But what am I buying? Well, actually, what are each of you buying.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
When you go.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:06.000
To buy a haircut. What are you buying? What matters to you?

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Yeah, it's like.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
To look it up.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Hit! Say it again.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Yeah, that they know.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Kevin.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
No, I just said to look good afterwards. That's what I'm buying.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
To look. Good. Okay. Flow.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
That my hair is healthy, and that I don't have split ends.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
To health. You want your hair to be healthy. Okay, Fabia.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.000
That. They know what they're doing, so I know I'm in good hands.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Saying it, say it louder.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
That they know what they're doing. So they're professionals.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000
You're buying their yeah, their professionalism and their expertise.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
George.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
I was gonna say, peace of mind not having to worry about.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
The inconvenience.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Of a.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Of doing it yourself.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Having this annoying long hair.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Yeah.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Oh, no! Just like.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Or oh, long hair.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Okay.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Yeah, like, right now, I need a haircut right now. It's annoying me.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
So it's top of mind.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Yeah.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000
So you want. You want your hair out of your face. You're buying peace of mind. More hours at work because you were annoyed with the the hair like we could take it a step further. All of these different things.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Oh, yeah.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
What's windy, or anything.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Or what about you?

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Well, it might be a local thing, but here the barbers and their clients usually get very intimate, and you know.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
They share a lot of stories. They share a lot of.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
You know.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Chit chat that's supposed to be relieving, and some of them do really extensive head massages, so those could be both as well. I am buying them.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
That is so cool.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Maybe others too.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:44.000
That's definitely cultural, like my husband is very close with his Barbara, and when he goes it's definitely for the haircut. I completely agree with that. And then it sounds like you're also buying stress relief from the massage.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Yeah, yeah, like, like, literally, my barbar knows more about my business that my parents combined.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
That's awesome.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:08.000
I haven't heard that one before, but I completely agree. So exactly. These are the. This is our what this is, what we mean by what. So I want to challenge you guys, shift your mind from what you're selling to what your customers buying. So take a look at the w. 1 that you wrote down.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:15.000
And write down A. W. 2. For what? That segment, that specific segment you wrote down? What are they buying from you?

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Don't get into why they care.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
We'll get into that. Just the what.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Take.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:52.000
90 seconds.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Okay.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Features. So if you wrote anything down about your features, you probably want to rethink it.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Only about the impact. Let's do, Dave and Talitha. And then, Kevin, I told you you could also present.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Go ahead! Dave!

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:21.000
I'm curious if I got this right. But, my customers are buying into a gaming system that they believe will fulfill their storytelling needs.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
And provide enjoyment to their players.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Yeah, I would even argue they're not. They're not buying.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
The gaming system. It's more the things that you said after that.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
I think the the gaming system might be more of what you're selling.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000
The the things that come to fruition because of them buying it.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Got it. And then also, they're buying into a community and a subculture to some degree.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Yeah, I love that. So they're buying community. They're buying. Yeah, they're buying friends.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
It makes them happy. What was the second thing you said.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Subculture they're buying into a subculture.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Yeah.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Those things. So it's it's a lot less about the product itself.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
It's about the things they're getting from it.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
That's perfect, Telitha.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:15.000
I know I didn't write like a sentence, but I just listed a couple of things. So number one is peace of mind, so that they don't have to deal with any of the nuisances that come with dealing with guests or their issues.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Secondly, is time back in their day, and the freedom to use it in the way that they would wish, whether that is, with their personal life, but also with their own business.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
And the 3rd one is the ability to be able to actually grow their business more.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Yeah.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:54.000
That's great. I think every single one of you can probably write peace of mind on yours. So I like to caution that cause. That's like a pretty general one. What? What is it? Exactly. That's specific to your customer, that one's. It's very easy to write that, because if you're making a solution to a problem that inherently gives peace of mind. Right? That's what's problem solving is. So most of you probably did write that it's not wrong. It's just too vague to try and like.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Make it a little bit more specific to your business, but the other 2 I completely agree.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
So.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Kevin, did you want to go.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Yeah. Sure.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.000
They're buying efficient way to study, either due to convenience or necessity.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.000
They want something that can help them out 24 HA day that they.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Where they themselves don't have to know what they don't know. They wanna feel confident that they know the information leading up to exams, and they wanna be comfortable in their own space.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Right.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Okay, I think we kind of got into it more. With the last 2. They're buying confidence and comfort. The 1st couple I heard a couple of like features like 24 7 access things like that, I would say, if they're buying a a study help whatever the 1st one was where you said. They're buying help with study. That that's a little bit more about what you're offering are what are they buying? Are they buying the good grade like. Is that why they need to study help? I would argue, yes, that's probably more.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000
What they're buying from that like. What is the consequence of it?

00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:00.000
The good grade. They're buying success in their class for those 1st few, but the second 2 were very good.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Yeah. Fabio.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:16.000
I just had a quick question about this cause I I saw a lot of people like bringing up matters of like like psychology, or like emotions, and like the buying process, which I think is a part of the job to be done

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Yeah, you guys like had us do for the application.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
I was wondering, like, how important it is to include it in, like the what they're buying, because.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
You know they're buying, for example, with us was like.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:38.000
The possibility to eliminate or reduce the complexity of setting up a computer. But I was wondering if I should include the like, the emotion, or like I don't know the.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
More like personal effectiveness.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Creates in the, in the buyer, like peace of mind, or all these other aspects.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000
That's a good question. I think. Not. Every single business, the what is emotional so.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:05.000
It doesn't have to be like for the barber example. Some of us are buying confidence. Other people are just buying, or like George, it's much more utilitarian. He just wants to be less annoyed with the long hair, so.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:14.000
I think what you said like. It's not a very emotional buy, but I will say most of you for the why the W. 3 we're about to do will be pretty emotional.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000
So some of you, the what and the why will be emotional.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000
For a lot of the b 2 b. The what probably isn't.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Or it's a smaller one.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000
And the main, what is much more.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Practical kind of like what you just said, Fabio.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000
That's a good question.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:37.000
So let's go into W. 3. This is my favorite one, because this is kind of where it all clicks.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000
So this is the why does my customer buy from me? So we know what they're buying.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:55.000
And every single one that we just heard of those examples we could say, Okay, well, why do they want that? And that's key. Because, knowing what isn't going to sell it, knowing why they want it is what's key to getting these people to say? Yes.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
So the Y is the value your customers get from what they're buying.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000
So the outcome.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
There's what they're buying which give.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Gives them a certain part of value.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
That we need to.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Extract and dissect and understand. And that's this. Why? So it's the outcome.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Let's go back to the haircut example.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:20.000
For me and a couple others who said, When I'm buying a haircut, I'm buying confidence from the.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Salon.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Whether it's because I want.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Their expertise, or I feel better when I get a haircut, whatever it is.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
I want to buy confidence.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Why?

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Well.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
For me. One reason why I might get a haircut is because I have a big work event.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
So I want to get that promotion. You can ask why? Again.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Maybe I want to get the promotion because I want to buy a house because I want to impress my family because I want to. You can ask why? 1,000 times kinda like Neil said, in jobs to be done. You kind of want to stop at a certain point because it'll get existential.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:13.000
What's another example? For the haircut? So if they're buying it for confidence, why, I can think of a couple of others. What could be a why, for that.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Be like.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Looking good for your job.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Looking nice for a date kind of thing. I like.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
There we go. Interesting. Yeah.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
I completely agree.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:46.000
You're buying confidence. Why? Because you have a date. And why do you want to look good for the date? Because you want a second date, or because you want this person to think highly of you because you have an interview, and you want to get that job because you want this new life change. You want to move whatever it is. There are so many reasons, and you could extract all of those just from this person buying a haircut.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:52.000
And you see it right. You see it in haircuts like there are reasons that people buy haircuts and they market it to us. For those reasons.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
So that's the why.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Now.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Equally as important is, how does my customer that y. So there's understanding there? Why.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But if you can't explain to them that.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Or show them that you are helping them achieve that. Why, in the way that they measure it, it means nothing.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
So.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I want you to differentiate how your customer measures and how you measure value. So a lot of you might think that you're bringing value to your customer because of Xyz. But if the way they measure value is complete.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Completely different, then that means nothing to them.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Real life example. Amos talks about his time at businesscom.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Businesscom is selling insights into customer competitors, products.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
So, however, businesscom measures that.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It doesn't matter.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:53.000
What their customers measure that? Why it, as what they found by interviewing them, is additional revenue brought in by those leads, when they convert to sales.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:06.000
So businesscom was previously measuring how successful they were providing value to their comp customers, as how many insights or how many leads they gave into their customers products.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:14.000
They would be completely off base, because their customers they realize only care about the additional revenue that's brought in. When those leads convert to sales.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Being lead. Gen. And giving them a bunch of leads actually means nothing to them if they don't convert. So they had to change their strategy in order to provide that value to customers. And they realize that's actually why they were losing customers.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Does that make sense.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Cool.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So moving forward. Another caveat is that b 2 b has 2 y's, this has been a big like slide. I was waiting for for you guys because a lot of you asked this during the understanding your customers last week.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
B. 2 B. Has 2 wise. There's the business as a whole.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And there's the decision maker as a person.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
The second one is very important at the start.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.000
If you can figure out how the decision maker as an actual person who has human emotions and wants.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
How that decision maker as a person measures the value you're bringing them.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
You can figure out their motivation, and why they're buying your product or service, and therefore you can get them to say Yes.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
An example.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
The company measures value from your like a company.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Measures their value that you're giving them from your lead Gen. Software as business com by the extra revenue it brings in. Like, I just said.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But if your individual decision Maker.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Is the chief revenue officer.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
And the companies that you're targeting.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Have a chief revenue officer who has no personal to surpass the revenue goals that they already meet without your product.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Then you're going to be hitting a wall. You're going to know that you can help these businesses. But the decision maker keeps saying, No.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
That's because there's no motivation. There.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
So.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
This is a real life example, but business com had to adjust their w. 1.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:02.000
To specifically companies with chief revenue officers who are financially incentivized to surpass revenue goals.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Once they started.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Targeting businesses that had that exact w. 1 with the decision maker having that incentive because they would get in with the chief revenue officer, he would say, yes, and then the business as a whole, they already know that they can provide value there. So, figuring out how the decision maker measures. Value is very important as well. You need to treat them as a person, and then there's the business as a whole that you also need to serve.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Does anyone have questions here? Because this is a really important point.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Okay.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So feel free to adjust your w. 1 and W. 2, as you think about your W. 3.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Remember that all of these are theories at the end of this workshop. In about 15 min you will have a set of W. 3 s. But you will need to go out and test them, using jobs to be done.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:08.000
So one more note. One more story I have for B. Twob. That I alluded to last week is Bloomfield. So you'll meet the CEO of Bloomfield during.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Program. This was a 22 company we had in our summer cohort in Texas.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
They came in and they were targeting.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Businesses

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Technology businesses who had between 50 and 100 employees.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000
They were targeting CTO at those businesses, and they were targeting people who had.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Had 2 to 3.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Developmental errors that caused significant backup in in revenue throughout the year.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Because they were kind of a jira. So they were helping developers figure out their problems and their bottlenecks in their development to streamline, their software processes and rollouts.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:54.000
What they realized was that their w. 1 was all wrong. They were selling to CTO as much about these.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Backups in the processes of flowing out product.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
The CTO's at these companies were much more worried about other things. It was the chief innovation officers.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Who ended up caring about this streamlined process about stopping these bottlenecks that we're inhibiting progress. So when they change the decision maker to being the chief.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Innovation officer. I think they realized that the chief innovation officer is the one who's.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Job was on the line by not.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Having their.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Processes streamlined. And having all these backups, they realize that chief innovation officer, the one that would get promoted if they brought in this like product if they championed bloom filter. So they started targeting chief innovation officers as their businesses champion.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And he would bring in. He or she would bring in their product and champion. It.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Like no other.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:51.000
These deals started going through very quickly, and they've grown exponentially. They are doing extremely well. I don't know if Neil, you want to talk about.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Where they're at currently. But you'll get to meet their CEO. So that's 1 of my favorite examples of real life. Tech stars. W. 3, helping.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Scale of business.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Okay.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
So let's take 90 seconds.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
To do your why?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Write down your theory on the why question how you believe your customers will measure them, and then how you can ensure you have the right tools to measure it in the way that they do, so that you can prove that you're providing the value to them.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Take 90 seconds.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Alright! That's our time.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
So.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Do a couple of people want to share their why.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Yeah, sure.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Okay, this was a bit harder, actually.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
But yeah.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I said, to develop a game that will be played on a large scale for decade. For a decade.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
With understanding every player deeply in real time, at 1 3rd of a cost than usual.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I think that's definitely the why for the business.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
What about for the person who's gonna say S to you? Why are they specifically incentivized to.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
To do this.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Is it like that promoted within the company? If they can bring these insights or.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
What do you think?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And they they.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
The decision maker will have less on.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
What people are saying so because he can understand in real time.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
And business as a whole.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Can a profit.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I loved by May, developing a game that is played over a decade.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Yeah, I like that kind of like legacy thinking, because I also think that that's attractive for the decision maker. A lot of decision makers in

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Like b 2 b.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Will like being the champion of something that brings a lot of glory to the company. Right? Like everyone wants to be that champion for the company. So if they're the one that brings something in that makes this game a hit for 10 years, that's a huge incentive.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Yeah.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And that's something you can use and play to when you sell to them.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Like paint that.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And the measurements tools for this Y is the live player, count.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And money per.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Like feed.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Money spent per feedback, analyzed.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Okay, that's how they care about it. So if you can get that down, they would be happy.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Okay, I like that. I think that's a great example.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
What about Agent Leonard.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So we're still discussing this. It's not quite there yet, but I think, for the business as a whole. We said that they really want to be.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:18.000
The best, the best in the business, the best in the industry, and the top expert in their area. So just to clarify, we're talking about residential real estate sales agents, and then, in terms of.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000
The decision maker. It's essentially so. They can close more sales and make more money.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And how they will measure it is through the number of listens and number of sales.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
How they compare, and, like comparison, lead tables.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And then how do we make sure they've got the right tools.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000
We can tie back their activity to that exact social post which will do through the dashboard. So where.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Where they are now, versus where they started, and what's.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Was towards that.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000
So kind of showing the Delta you think will prove to them that you're providing that value cause you're gonna track. The thing that they care about? Is that what you're saying.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
That's great!

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I think that's awesome.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Thanks.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
We can take.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000
One more.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Yeah, flow.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Okay, I'll give it a go. So one of the wise is because they want to scale their portfolios without the need to hire more guest relation that directly impact the bottom line.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And when you speak from the person itself, because they don't want to jeopardize the quality of the service that they provide.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
At their business.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Which would negatively affect their position as an operations director.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Yeah. So not having to hire more people. But the revenue still going up basically is that or the amount of custom.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
The service quality, not going down as a result of increasing the portfolio size.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Yeah.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And how do they measure service quality.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Do they get like a star rating.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Reviews.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Okay.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Yeah.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
There we go!

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Bad reviews.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
That's perfect.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So you can. Basically, you see how just like Agent Lunar was saying, like, you might eaten the product, want to develop something that shows them that they're like service quality is staying up.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Because of your product, so that that can consistently reinforce how much value you're bringing.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Yeah, that's exactly it.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So let's just wrap here. Now, you have your theory of your W. 3, each of you.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000
It's a theory, it's not validated. It's just an assumption. How do we go test it?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
The answer is jobs to be done. So, as you guys are doing, your customer discovery.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
You're going to be able to validate every single part of your W. 3.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:43.000
So this is not part of the book, but what I've seen is that it maps perfectly onto your job statement. So remember that when I I want to, so that I.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000
This is the same, the when I, the who, the situation, the attributes that the person is under.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I want to. What are they buying or hiring? What is their desire? And then why, what is their outcome or value, so that I.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
So.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:07.000
You guys doing your jobs to be done will help validate this W. 3 blueprint that you guys have created today. And you might need to readjust it as you gain more insights, and you start talking to these people.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
But I think these 2 go.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:18.000
