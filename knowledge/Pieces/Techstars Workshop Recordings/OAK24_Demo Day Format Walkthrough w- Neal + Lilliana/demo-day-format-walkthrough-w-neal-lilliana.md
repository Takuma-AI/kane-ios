## Overview

This comprehensive workshop introduces the evolved Techstars Demo Day format, explaining how it has transformed from traditional 10-minute pitches to an engaging 6-minute format designed to maximize follow-up meetings and meaningful connections. The session covers expectations, format details, preparation timeline, and includes detailed analysis of successful Demo Day performances from previous cohorts.

## Key Themes

1. **Demo Day as Springboard, Not Fundraising Event**: Modern Demo Day serves as the first meeting with investors, not a direct fundraising pitch
2. **Quality Follow-ups Over Direct Investment**: Success measured by meaningful follow-up meetings that advance company goals
3. **Engagement Over Endurance**: Short, engaging format keeps audience attention throughout all presentations
4. **Preparation Excellence**: Rigorous approval process ensures professional, polished performances
5. **Individual Goals Drive Strategy**: Each company crafts their approach based on specific objectives

## The Evolution of Demo Day

### Historical Context

Lilliana explains the transformation from the original Techstars model:

> "Demo Day used to be this giant giant giant event. Because think back to the start of techstars. We were one of the only accelerator programs in the whole nation... just 10 companies, 10 companies once a year in Boulder. This is the giant event. Everybody would fly from the country to go there Glitz and Glam bell of the ball style."

### Modern Reality (2024)

> "Demo Day evolved into rather than just being this like one time, giant event, you have to be there into rather a springboard, or like I think of it as like a catillion. We're presenting you into society... these are the startups that have techstars like best blessing, and go meet them, go, meet them, help them, achieve their goals."

**Current landscape challenges**:
- Demo days happen monthly across all accelerators
- People don't fly across country for demo days anymore
- Audience attention spans have decreased
- Market saturation requires different approach

## The "Secret Sauce" Format Innovation

### Development Story

Born from COVID necessity, the format was developed when virtual demo days revealed attention problems:

> "We noticed that, like people would listen to 2 or 3 min of the pitch, and then just start skipping through, which was not great, because our founders took a long time to craft those, and there was a lot of really good information."

### Format Components (6 minutes total)

1. **1-minute product video** (enhances understanding)
2. **1-minute elevator pitch** (no slides, just founder on stage)
3. **4-minute Q&A with EIR** (fireside chat style)
4. **One enhancement slide** (displayed during Q&A)

**Flexible ordering**: Most choose pitch first, but some benefit from product video first (example: hardware companies like Halon Technologies making drone batteries).

### The Q&A Innovation

**EIR Selection Process**:
> "The eirs hand pick you guys kickball style during the last month. So once they've met with each of you. Once you do your final rotation... the Eirs pick you, and then you'll have about 2 or 3 weeks to work with them and craft your QA."

**Emotional Investment Factor**:
> "The purpose of that is that each er is extremely invested emotionally in your company, because they chose to be representing you on stage."

**Preparation vs Performance**:
> "People do not know that it's pre prepared. If the Eirs do a good job which these Eirs do an amazing job on stage... you're playing off of each other. You're riffing. It seems like you're having a conversation."

## Success Metrics: Redefining "Winning"

### The Traditional Misconception

Lilliana corrects a common misunderstanding:

> "A couple of programs ago we're talking about. Oh, I'm gonna Win Demo Day, which I'd never heard people say before. And I corrected them, and I was like winning. Demo Day is is not a competition between each of you like. There's not a winner of Demo Day."

### Real Success Definition

> "The people who win Demo Day are the people to gain an adequate amount of follow up meetings that help them work toward their goal... Who is getting these people to scan their calendar link and sign up for these follow ups. And who who's follow ups from that, are helping them achieve their goal."

**Follow-up Focus Areas**:
- Investor meetings
- Customer acquisition  
- Partnership discussions
- Strategic advisor recruitment
- Consumer app downloads

## The Two Key Artifacts

### 1. Professional Video Artifact

> "It's not streamed, it's recorded. And it's professionally recorded. So we get a really high end videographer. They make these artifacts, which is a 6 min video for just your company with intro music and your logo and everything, and you get that as a moment in time that you can then use."

**Uses for the artifact**:
- Send to investors
- Share with potential customers
- Post on LinkedIn for hype
- Use in ongoing sales/marketing efforts

### 2. Strategic Invitations

**Techstars Network**: Hundreds of community members, partners, investors, mentors
**Company-Specific Invites**: Tailored to individual goals

**Strategic invite examples**:
- B2B customers who might sign
- Investors for warm conversations
- High-profile advisors/mentors
- B2C audience for app downloads
- Partnership opportunities

## Format Benefits: Why It Works

### Audience Engagement

> "All of the people that come. We have very few trickle out in the middle of the event which used to be a major problem for techstars demo days, and we have people extremely engaged throughout each pitch like I watch them and I see them. Everyone's listening to all of it."

### First Meeting Efficiency

> "Our demo day allows you like, I say here, to have confidence, clarity, and real skills by articulating your business by answering questions on stage, so it will serve as the first meeting to get through any sort of hesitations for why people would not want to meet with you."

### Pre-emptive Q&A Strategy

> "We have you answer the hard questions. And after people see that they want to have these meetings with you, and it's on an expedited track, because they already have heard all of this stuff they've heard about your your traction."

## Preparation Timeline and Process

### Extensive Practice Schedule

**Key Sessions Include**:
- **Intro to Demo Day Prep** (with Troy and Lilliana)
- **Pitch Practice** (with Troy, 2 weeks later)
- **Product Demo Walkthrough** (storyboard feedback)
- **Alumni Pitch Practice** (pitch coach from Chicago)
- **Pitch Tips and Tricks** (always helpful session)
- **Mentor Pitch Practice**
- **EIR Q&A Practice Sessions**
- **Individual 30-min Practice Sessions** (final week, with Neal and Lilliana)

### Approval Process

**Monday Before Demo Day** = **Hard Deadline**

> "Monday of Demo Day is when you get approved. So we'll have approval. Sessions where you come up, and you give your whole demo day. Set all 3 parts, and most people get approved."

**Approval Requirements**:
- Complete 3-part performance ready
- Pitch organized and on time
- Video dialed in
- Synchronized with EIR on Q&A

**Consequences of Non-Approval**:
> "It's not a guarantee that you get to present a demo day. You have to do your part to show up. Be prepared and have your act together... We won't approve it... we're dead serious."

**Professional Standards Rationale**:
> "If one of you guys seems extremely unprepared, it's gonna reflect poorly on the rest of you. We want this to be an extremely professional event, with extremely interesting and high performing companies."

## Venue and Event Details

### Block 15 Oakland

**Venue Description**: Art gallery where "all of the cool events in Oakland happen"
**Capacity**: 300-350 people (larger than Chicago's 200-250)
**Format**: 3-hour event + 1-hour cocktail networking
**Atmosphere**: Food, drinks, professional but engaging

### Event Flow Success

From the previous mega demo day:
> "The actual event ended at like 8:30, and then we had an hour and a half or so of networking, and once we cleaned up by 10 we had to start kicking people out. But amazing conversations were happening like for a lot of the founders. We couldn't even get the people to like stop talking to them."

## Product Video Guidelines

### Philosophy: Scrappier is Better

> "We prescribe this crappier the better, like not dumping a bunch of money into these. I've had people like literally use $0. They had, like their wife, record it, and as like the narrator and they made it on canva."

**Budget Recommendations**:
- **$0 option**: DIY with family/friends
- **$250-500 range**: Most common, buy specific assets needed
- **$1,000-2,000**: Only for video-heavy businesses (not recommended)

### Content Strategy Options

**Option 1: Product Focus**
- Brief product overview
- How it works demonstration
- Technical capabilities

**Option 2: Customer Success Focus** (Lilliana's preference)
> "A lot of people do not show their product in the product, Demo. Rather, they briefly overview the product, and spend the majority of the minute with a customer testimonial that is extremely helpful."

**The customer testimonial approach**:
> "There's one thing to show like, this is our product. You click here. This is how it works. And there's another to show the outcome think jobs to be done? And W. 3. What is the outcome? What is the success we're getting for our customer through this product? So showing that means 10 times more."

### Technical Considerations

**Live Demo Risks**:
Neal's advice: "It's usually a bad idea, because things can go wrong."

**Recommended approach**:
> "I would recommend you have the hardware on you, and you can like show it. But you should kinda almost like fake a live demo in that. You're demonstrating what it would do conceptually by mapping it to whatever you would show on the screen or the video."

## Demo Day vs Fundraising Reality

### Setting Proper Expectations

Neal's clear messaging:
> "There's a misconception both joining text ours and demo day itself that that just translates to dollars. Raise your commitments... that is not something you should expect. But it's not something you should plan for, and it's not something that we think is is is a product or expected outcome of Demo Day."

### What Actually Happens

**Rare but Possible**: Direct investment offers
**More Common**: Expedited investor conversations
**The Real Value**: Strategic relationship building

**Neal's Nuanced Explanation**:
> "You could facilitate great opportunities to have expedited conversations with investors because you make them aware of what you're doing. You've been updating them through techstars through your journey. They show up to Demo Day or you share the Demo Day video with them afterwards, and it leads you down the path of due diligence that leads you to a commitment."

### Post-Demo Day Strategy

**Mert's Approach** (Former EIR Strategy):
> "He would kind of stack a bunch of investor conversations and meetings post Demo day. So he had all his founders when he was in Eir schedule their meetings, one to 2 weeks after Demo Day."

**Strategic Benefits**:
- Finish Techstars progress first
- Use Demo Day as conversation starter
- Create reason to contact previously unresponsive investors
- "Hey, that's okay. Let me just meet with you, anyway, and tell you what's going on"

## Case Study Analysis: Successful Demo Day Performances

### Jake from Zest (B2C Cooking App)

**Context**: Achieved dramatic improvements during Techstars
- 5x monthly recurring revenue to $3,500/month
- Fixed major leaky bucket conversion problem through JTBD research
- 20x conversion rate improvement

**Pitch Strengths**:
- Clear problem articulation ("every year millions of twentysomethings graduate into the real world")
- Competitive positioning ("We're like culinary school. If culinary school is cheap, hilarious, and you can do it from your couch")
- Traction evidence (16% week-over-week growth rate)

**Q&A Excellence**:
The Q&A demonstrated why this format works. Eric Severing (EIR) asked tough questions that viewers initially thought were harsh:

**Key Q&A Exchange** - Virality Concerns:
> **Eric**: "Virality can be notoriously fickle. Algorithms change previously. Available methods get arbitraged away... Can you help me understand why we can trust the the customer acquisition as you think about virality?"

> **Jake**: "Yeah. So virality is not our strategy... We now know that 20 posts a week across platforms with a proprietary blend of trending and unique content, will yield 1,200 organic downloads. Now there is viral upside there. We do outperform that, but it's certainly not what we've modeled our business around."

**Impact**: Investors who might have dismissed a "viral cooking app" became interested due to the thoughtful responses.

**Results**: Jake raised funding both in Chicago and West Coast, with references from Jason Calcanis and Sequoia.

### Bloom Filter (B2B Software Analytics)

**Context**: Andrew Wolf, 17-year software engineering background
- Addresses the problem that 68-78% of software projects are late, over budget, or don't ship
- Analytics and AI for executives to identify and solve development issues

**Video Weakness**: 
> "Andrew's video was weak. So he spent $0 on his video. There's a way to spend $0 on your video and still have a good video. His video, like it was kind of last minute... it was just barely good enough."

**Performance Issues**:
- Nervous energy initially
- Pacing around stage instead of standing still
- Sound quality problems in video

**Pitch Strengths**:
- Strong personal credibility from experience
- Clear problem statement with credible statistics
- Concrete customer examples

**Q&A Slide Excellence**:
> "That was a really good example of a QA. Slide behind. It's really important for your QA. Slide... it enhances the QA. And does not distract from the QA."

**Slide Elements**:
- Bloom Filter logo
- Customer logos (visual credibility)
- Clean, uncluttered design

**Results**: Despite video weakness, raised $7 million and company performing well.

### Activated Scale (B2B Sales Marketplace)

**Context**: Pratik Mahath, 20 years sales experience
- Marketplace connecting startups with fractional sales talent
- Strong traction: customers won $800K+ in net new revenue

**Performance Excellence**:
> "He brought a stage presence, so he ha has a very successful business... he has really good numbers. He came with the energy. And he's really strong."

**Video Strategy**: Customer testimonial focus
- Featured actual customer (Rene from Windsor)
- Showed complete customer journey from problem to solution
- Included authentic customer testimonial video

**Pitch Energy**: 
> "What's up, everybody? Good evening. Welcome to the show!"

**Minor Critique**:
> "The one thing that could have been improved is, if, at the end of the phrases. Your intonation always goes down in the same way. Then it's clear that you've memorized it. He needs a little bit more variety for it to sound a little more spontaneous."

### Bake It Box (B2C Cultural Baking Kits)

**Context**: Shelley, creating culturally diverse baking experiences
- $40,000 in sales to date
- "Hello Fresh but for baking"

**Video Strategy**: Emotional customer journey
> "Her QA. Slide was just to elicit the certain mood or feeling that she wanted her customers to feel so. She's like bringing you on that customer journey."

**Pitch Opening**:
> "I want to take you back to when you were a kid. Remember what it felt like to spend time with your grandma in the kitchen. cracking eggs into a bowl of flour and sugar."

**Results**: Recently raised $1-2 million, performing well.

## Strategic Guidance for Different Company Types

- Market opportunity size
- Viral/organic growth mechanisms

### Pre-Product Companies

**Special Considerations**:
- Focus on team credibility and vision
- Market research and validation
- Clear development roadmap
- Strategic partnerships or pilot commitments

## Advanced Preparation Strategies

### Q&A Slide Design Principles

**Enhance, Don't Distract**:
> "You don't want them to be reading that instead of like watching your carefully crafted QA. Kind of happen before their eyes instead, it's enhancing."

**Effective Elements**:
- Company logo
- Customer logos
- Key traction metrics
- QR codes for action items
- Customer testimonial quotes
- Stock imagery for mood/industry context

**What to Avoid**:
- Too much data/text
- Distracting animations
- Information that requires reading time

### Feedback and Iteration Process

**Continuous Feedback Loop**:
> "Think of it as like an open feedback loop, iterative. Constantly, asynchronously via base camp. You can also send videos or boxes of your pitch as you iterate that in between sessions."

**Multiple Touchpoints**:
- Product demo walkthrough sessions
- Practice sessions with Troy and alumni
- Base camp asynchronous feedback
- Individual practice sessions before approval

### Goal Setting and Invite Strategy

**Define Success First**:
> "Think about what your goal is. Talk to your team. If you have a team decide what it is for you to win Demo Day? Is it to get X number of like consumer customers? Is it to get one big like B, 2 B customer, get that one partnership to that big brand, or is it to get like 10? Follow up meetings with investors."

**Work Backwards from Goals**:
> "Think about that first, and then craft your pipeline backwards. When I say pipeline, I just mean invite list."

## Friends and Family Integration

**Unlimited Personal Invitations**:
> "You guys will be responsible for friends and family invites. It's unlimited. A lot of people find it very helpful to have their family and friends come and support them pretty much. Every founder has at least one loved one. Come and support them."

**Save the Date Information**: May 30th, 5-9 PM, Block 15 Oakland

## The Meta-Lesson: Demo Day as First Meeting

Neal's strategic insight about investor relationship building:

> "The whole notion here is that if they see your demo day that that first conversation is already done, and you didn't even meet with them yet."

This reframes Demo Day from "make or break" fundraising event to strategic relationship building tool that:
- Eliminates need for initial pitch meetings
- Demonstrates preparation and professionalism  
- Creates natural reason for follow-up conversations
- Shows company in best possible light with months of preparation
- Provides lasting artifact for ongoing use

**The Ultimate Goal**: Transform Demo Day from performance event into business development tool that accelerates meaningful relationships and advances each company's specific objectives.

## Key Takeaways for Implementation

1. **Reframe expectations**: Demo Day is a springboard, not a direct funding event
2. **Focus on follow-ups**: Success measured by quality meetings, not stage performance
3. **Prepare extensively**: Use all practice sessions and feedback opportunities
4. **Keep video scrappy but effective**: Customer testimonials often outperform product demos
5. **Design for your specific goals**: B2B customer acquisition vs investor meetings require different approaches
6. **Craft strategic invite lists**: Work backwards from desired outcomes
7. **Use the artifact**: Professional video becomes ongoing business development tool
8. **Answer the hard questions**: Pre-prepared Q&A addresses investor concerns proactively

The evolved Techstars format recognizes that modern investors and customers need different engagement strategies than traditional pitch formats, emphasizing preparation, authenticity, and meaningful connection over presentation perfection.
