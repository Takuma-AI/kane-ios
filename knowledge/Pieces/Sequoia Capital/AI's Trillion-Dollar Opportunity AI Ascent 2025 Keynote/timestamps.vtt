WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
All right, my name is Packer A.D. I'm a partner at Sequoia, Sonya and Constantine.

00:07.760 --> 00:11.520
And all of our partners at Sequoia will be your host for the day.

00:11.520 --> 00:19.720
Now, before we get into the real meat of the day, me and Sonya and Constantine are going

00:19.720 --> 00:24.640
to just share a few perspectives on some of the things that we've learned over the last

00:24.640 --> 00:25.960
year or so.

00:25.960 --> 00:30.400
And we're painfully aware that we're the appetizer, not the entree.

00:30.400 --> 00:34.840
I got an email from one of the founders that I worked with yesterday who said, oh, hey,

00:34.840 --> 00:36.360
man, I'm going to be a little bit late to this thing.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.200
I'll probably show up at like 9.35.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.040
And I was like, well, that's oddly specific.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.600
That's exactly when Jensen comes on.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.360
And so, so look, we get it.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.480
But we're going to share a couple thoughts and then we'll get into the real stuff.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.680
All right.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.680
First off, some calibration.

00:53.680 --> 00:57.240
What do we think is going on in the world of AI?

00:57.240 --> 00:59.040
Simple framework that we use to look at markets.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.240
What is it?

01:00.240 --> 01:01.240
The Don Valentine question.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
So what?

01:02.240 --> 01:03.760
Why does it matter?

01:03.760 --> 01:04.760
Why now?

01:04.760 --> 01:07.240
It may be inevitable, but is it imminent?

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
And then finally, what now?

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
What do we do?

01:09.240 --> 01:10.240
How do we take advantage of this?

01:10.240 --> 01:11.240
How do we play to win?

01:11.240 --> 01:14.320
And we've talked about each of these in years past, but we're going to update some of

01:14.320 --> 01:17.080
our thinking over the next couple of minutes here.

01:17.080 --> 01:20.640
And I actually, I have to be honest with you, I had a real banger on the what.

01:20.640 --> 01:25.320
Constantine delicately suggested that telling a roomful of AI people what AI is, not a

01:25.320 --> 01:26.320
great idea.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.240
So we're actually going to jump straight to the so what?

01:29.240 --> 01:30.240
OK, just for fun.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.840
Who remembers this slide from last year?

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
All right.

01:33.840 --> 01:34.840
Thank you.

01:34.840 --> 01:35.840
Wonderful.

01:35.840 --> 01:36.840
Top row.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.840
Cloud transition.

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
Bottom row.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.840
AI transition.

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
Left side of the page.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.840
Yesterday.

01:42.840 --> 01:43.840
Middle of the page.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
Today.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.840
Right side of the page.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.840
Tomorrow.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.320
What does it say?

01:49.320 --> 01:55.960
It says that the cloud at 400 billion of revenue is bigger than the global software market

01:55.960 --> 01:58.200
when that transition began.

01:58.200 --> 02:03.840
If we reasoned by analogy, the market we're going after in the world of AI, services,

02:03.840 --> 02:07.160
the starting point is at least an order of magnitude bigger.

02:07.160 --> 02:13.520
The end point, 10 or 20 years from now, has a chance to be absolutely massive.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.520
Important point.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.280
Now, we've actually updated our thinking.

02:17.280 --> 02:21.080
It's not just the services market that AI is going after.

02:21.080 --> 02:27.000
It's both services and software.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.040
Means that both of these profit pools are under attack.

02:31.040 --> 02:35.320
We've seen plenty of companies that start with software, gets a little bit smarter, becomes

02:35.320 --> 02:40.360
more of a co-pilot, gets a little bit smarter, becomes more of an autopilot, and they actually

02:40.360 --> 02:47.000
progress from selling a tool into software budget to selling an outcome, to selling work

02:47.000 --> 02:49.320
into labor budget.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.160
Both of these tams are up for grabs.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.160
Okay.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.160
Who remembers this slide from last year?

02:56.160 --> 02:57.160
Oh, man.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.160
I'm a little sad.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.160
Those are only like three or four people.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.160
All right.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.160
There's one more.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.160
All right.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
Thank you.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
Don't get bashful.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.160
You guys can raise your hands.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.160
Okay.

03:06.160 --> 03:12.560
It represents the waves of technology that have stacked up over the last several decades

03:12.560 --> 03:15.520
to bring us to the present moment.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.960
There are two points to this slide.

03:18.960 --> 03:24.840
One, AI is, in fact, imminent, not just inevitable.

03:24.840 --> 03:27.840
The present conditions are in place.

03:27.840 --> 03:35.680
Compute, networks, data, distribution, talent.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.240
We have all the ingredients we need, so we're ready to go.

03:39.240 --> 03:44.680
Second point of this slide, these waves tend to be additive, and so the opportunity is

03:44.680 --> 03:48.440
much bigger than it's been for prior waves.

03:48.440 --> 03:52.160
It's also coming much faster.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.120
Now I hate this slide.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.720
X-axis, time, y-axis, vanity metric.

03:58.720 --> 04:02.040
People use this to justify all manner of sense, okay?

04:02.040 --> 04:03.360
But the observation is correct.

04:03.360 --> 04:07.400
These are happening faster and faster and faster than they had before, but not a lot

04:07.400 --> 04:09.120
of people have dug in on why.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.680
And so we just want to take a second on it.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.200
If you think about the physics of distribution, you just need three things.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.280
People have to know about your thing.

04:16.280 --> 04:18.520
They have to want your thing, and they have to be able to buy your thing.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.520
That's it.

04:19.520 --> 04:24.600
Does anybody remember that logo?

04:24.600 --> 04:26.920
When the cloud transition got going, nobody was paying attention.

04:26.920 --> 04:31.200
Benioff had to do these crazy gorilla marketing tactics to get anybody to pay attention.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.480
AI is very different.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.320
November 30, 2022, Chatchee PT comes out.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.800
The entire world is paying attention to AI.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
Middle column.

04:41.800 --> 04:47.480
These are the combined monthly active users for Reddit and the artist formerly known as

04:47.480 --> 04:48.480
Twitter.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.720
It didn't exist at the start of the cloud transition, barely existed at the start of

04:52.720 --> 04:54.320
the mobile transition.

04:54.320 --> 04:58.840
Somewhere between 1.2 and 1.8 billion people on these platforms today.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.080
Not the only way to find out about cool stuff, but a pretty good way to find out about

05:02.080 --> 05:04.080
cool stuff.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.680
Right side of the page, let's imagine you listen to Benioff.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.960
There are only 200 million people connected to the internet.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.640
Today it's 5.6 billion.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.760
It's effectively every household and every business in the world.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.440
And so what does all this mean?

05:17.440 --> 05:19.520
It means the rails are in place.

05:19.520 --> 05:25.600
And when the starting gun went off, there were no barriers to adoption.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.400
This is not an AI specific phenomenon.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.440
This is the new reality of technology distribution, the physics have changed.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.760
Train tracks are in place.

05:33.760 --> 05:38.040
Okay, another slide from last year.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.040
What do we do about it?

05:39.040 --> 05:41.360
Where do we play to win?

05:41.360 --> 05:42.560
Two points on this slide.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.560
Number one.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.640
A lot of white space.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.480
Again, this is a slide from last year.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.720
There's a little less white space now.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.440
People are starting to break out.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.560
But for the most part, the opportunity is still white open.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.200
Point number two.

05:56.200 --> 06:02.920
These logos represent the companies that got to a billion plus of revenue.

06:02.920 --> 06:06.840
We don't care about unicorns, we care about revenue and free cash flow, got to a billion

06:06.840 --> 06:11.200
plus of revenue during prior transitions.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.120
Most of them are at the top of the page.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.000
Most of them are at the application layer.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.360
We have believed and we continue to believe that the same will be true for AI.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.040
The value is at the application layer.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.400
But guess what?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.560
You got competition.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.600
We got a second scaling law.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.640
We got test time compute.

06:32.640 --> 06:37.560
We got reasoning with tool use and inter agent communication.

06:37.560 --> 06:42.480
That allows the foundation models to get pretty far into the application layer.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.880
What do you do if you're a startup and you're not building a vertically integrated business?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.640
Go from the customer back.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.240
Think vertical specific.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.000
Think function specific.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.320
Think with complex problems, it might require human in the loop.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.880
But this is the race.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.360
This is where the value is going to be.

06:59.360 --> 07:03.960
This should be top of mind for everybody.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.960
How do we play to win?

07:05.960 --> 07:06.960
All right.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.960
Come on, you guys can laugh.

07:07.960 --> 07:08.960
This is a good one.

07:08.960 --> 07:09.960
All right.

07:09.960 --> 07:10.960
How do we play to win?

07:10.960 --> 07:13.760
Well, we showed this last year, so I'll presume you're not laughing because you saw it

07:13.760 --> 07:14.760
last year.

07:14.760 --> 07:18.400
So, 95% of building a company in AI is just building a company.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.400
It's the same old stuff.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.640
It's all an important problem in a unique and compelling way.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.200
Get great people to follow you, all that good stuff.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.000
The other 5% is AI specific.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.800
And in the context of that race for the application layer, there are a few things to consider.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.960
This is the Leoni merchandising cycle.

07:35.960 --> 07:43.360
Our partner Doug Leoni, the goat, spent 40 years lovingly crafting this little piece

07:43.360 --> 07:44.680
of content.

07:44.680 --> 07:50.600
This represents everything you need to take an idea in your brain and turn it into a product

07:50.600 --> 07:53.440
in the hand of your customers, okay?

07:53.440 --> 07:56.960
That idea has to turn into a product that has to be built by an engineering team that

07:56.960 --> 07:59.760
has to be taken to market and sold and supported.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.640
This is the value chain.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.720
Bottom of this page is the tech out point of view.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.160
Top of this page is the customer back point of view.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.680
That's how you can build modes across the entire value chain.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.560
Your customer is not sure what they want out of AI.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.640
You can have an opinion.

08:16.640 --> 08:20.160
You can give them an end to end solution that just solves the problem as opposed to throwing

08:20.160 --> 08:22.160
a tool over the fence.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.520
You can build data flywheels with the usage data of your own product.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.920
That's something that nobody else has.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.000
You can be of the industry for the industry, kind of like what open evidence does for the

08:32.000 --> 08:33.800
medical industry.

08:33.800 --> 08:38.640
You can speak their language, Harvey sends lawyers in to talk with law firms.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.800
You got to be honest with you, we wouldn't recommend for deployed engineers, but you can

08:41.800 --> 08:42.800
do it.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.480
Tough way to live, but you can do it.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.560
You can put a big bear hug around your customers in a way that foundation models probably

08:48.560 --> 08:49.560
won't.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.880
By the way, we love foundation models too, but we're assuming that most of you are not building

08:52.880 --> 08:53.880
foundation models.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.880
Most of you are building applications.

08:56.880 --> 08:57.880
Okay.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.560
I have two more slides, then we'll hand it off.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.720
So we can ask the question a lot, what do you look for in AI companies?

09:06.120 --> 09:09.880
And again, 95% of it is the same stuff that we look for in any company.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.880
Okay.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.680
Here's the 5% that's AI specific.

09:12.680 --> 09:16.000
Point number one, revenue.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.680
Vibrevenue can kill you.

09:18.680 --> 09:19.680
Everybody loves Vibrevenue.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.680
It feels so good.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.080
Oh my God, we have so much revenue.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.080
Go look at it.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.080
Okay.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.080
Is it tire kicking?

09:26.080 --> 09:28.920
Are you actually creating durable behavior change?

09:28.920 --> 09:29.920
Okay.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.440
Oh, I don't have the metrics to do that.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.960
Yes, you do.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.800
Respect the adoption, the engagement, the retention, what are people actually doing

09:36.800 --> 09:38.680
with your products?

09:38.680 --> 09:41.480
And don't delude yourself in a thinking you have real revenue when you have Vibrevenue

09:41.480 --> 09:43.600
because it'll bite you, okay?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.520
The good vibes piece of this is important too.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.520
Actually real quick.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.520
Andrew Reed.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.520
Are you in here?

09:48.520 --> 09:49.520
Vibeshack.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.520
How are we doing?

09:50.520 --> 09:51.520
How's everybody doing?

09:51.520 --> 09:52.520
I don't care about you.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
How's everybody doing?

09:53.520 --> 09:54.520
Impackable.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.520
I heard impeccable vibes.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.520
Okay.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.520
Good.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.520
You need good vibes to their customers.

09:58.520 --> 09:59.520
What does it mean?

09:59.520 --> 10:02.000
Your customers have to trust you and you have to earn that trust.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.360
This is more important than your product at this point in time.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
Where we are in the cycle.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.280
The products will get better.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.800
If they trust you to make it better, you're in good shape.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.880
If they don't trust you to make it better, you're in bad shape.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.280
Point number two, margins.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.520
We don't necessarily care where your gross margin is today.

10:18.520 --> 10:22.040
The cogs component of that is probably going to keep going down.

10:22.040 --> 10:25.000
Cosper token is down 99% in the last 12 to 18 months.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.520
That cost curve is going to continue.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.920
Those cogs are going to go down.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.880
I know it's stepping up with test time compute and all that, but that's going to go down

10:30.880 --> 10:33.440
to the price component of that.

10:33.440 --> 10:38.640
If you are successfully marching from selling a tool to selling an outcome and you're going

10:38.640 --> 10:43.240
up that value chain and you can capture more of that value, your price point is probably

10:43.240 --> 10:44.880
going to go up to.

10:44.880 --> 10:49.200
Your gross margins may not be great today, but you should have a good path to really healthy

10:49.200 --> 10:50.920
gross margins over time.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.720
Point number three, data flywheel.

10:54.720 --> 10:59.720
Raise your hand if you got a data flywheel.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.160
That business metric does that data flywheel move.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.720
Okay, I see less certainty.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.320
I got good news, I got bad news.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.680
Good news is, if you can't answer that question, I still love you.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.880
The bad news is your data flywheel is bullshit.

11:16.880 --> 11:22.200
Either you don't have a data flywheel or it just doesn't matter.

11:22.200 --> 11:26.160
It needs to tie to a business metric or it just doesn't matter.

11:26.160 --> 11:31.280
This is really important because this is one of the best modes that you can build.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.200
Last slide.

11:33.200 --> 11:38.320
Who can tell me how these two things go together?

11:38.320 --> 11:39.560
I'd be really impressed if you can't.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.160
It's not logical at all.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.320
All right.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.080
Nature hits a vacuum.

11:46.080 --> 11:51.000
There is, we'll get there.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.360
Nature hits a vacuum.

11:52.360 --> 11:59.240
There is a tremendous sucking sound in the market right now for AI.

11:59.240 --> 12:04.600
All of the macroeconomic stuff, tariffs and interest rate, noise doesn't matter.

12:04.600 --> 12:10.200
The rising tide of technology adoption absolutely swamps any of the volatility that you see

12:10.200 --> 12:11.200
in the markets.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.200
Ignore it.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
Okay.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.040
There is a tremendous sucking sound in the market.

12:15.040 --> 12:21.880
And if you don't get in front of it, somebody else will because nature hates a vacuum.

12:21.880 --> 12:26.320
And so all the stuff we just said about modes and metrics and whatever, notwithstanding,

12:26.320 --> 12:29.560
you are in a run-like heck business right now.

12:29.560 --> 12:40.360
Now is the time to go at maximum velocity all of the time.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.360
Thank you, Pat.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.280
So I'm going to use my section to focus on what's happening with AI right now.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.240
And we'll start with a quick year in review, both from the customer back and from the technology

12:49.240 --> 12:50.240
out.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.040
That's a year in review.

12:52.040 --> 12:57.480
Back in 2023, we showed this chart of the ratio of daily to monthly active users for AI

12:57.480 --> 13:00.720
native applications versus for traditional mobile apps.

13:00.720 --> 13:05.400
And the punchline at the time was that AI apps had terrible engagement ratios, hype exceeded

13:05.400 --> 13:08.360
reality in the data.

13:08.360 --> 13:12.240
We're very pleased to report that that punchline has now changed dramatically.

13:12.240 --> 13:17.000
It's been stunning to see, for example, the daily monthly active ratio for chat GPT

13:17.000 --> 13:20.240
climbed the curve and now getting close to reddit levels.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.040
I think this is extremely good news.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.880
It means that more and more of us are getting value out of AI.

13:24.880 --> 13:30.480
And we're all climbing the ladder together on how to weave AI into our daily lives.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.480
And sometimes that usage is good and fun.

13:32.480 --> 13:37.360
I personally melted an embarrassing number of GPUs trying to jiblify everything.

13:37.360 --> 13:41.480
But while the jibli moment was fun and it was viral, the more exciting thing is all the

13:41.480 --> 13:44.200
deeper things that were just scratching the surface of.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.880
So for example, advertising, the ability to create stunningly accurate and beautiful

13:47.880 --> 13:53.040
ad copy, education, the ability to visualize new concepts with the snap of a finger, health

13:53.040 --> 13:57.080
care, the ability to diagnose patients better with an app like open evidence.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.080
We're just scratching the surface of what's possible.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.680
And as the AI models become more and more capable, the things we can do with them through

14:02.680 --> 14:05.280
this front door become more and more profound.

14:05.280 --> 14:08.520
OK, who here is saying the movie her?

14:08.520 --> 14:10.360
OK.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.480
And we have Brendan in the audience today.

14:12.480 --> 14:17.480
We still don't have AI Scar Jo, but 2024 gave us what I would call the her moment for

14:17.480 --> 14:18.480
voice.

14:18.480 --> 14:22.720
And voice generation went from almost there to fully crossing the uncanny valley.

14:22.720 --> 14:27.160
I've had a few folks say that, but keep your cards close to your chest.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.920
Let's see if I can truly blow your mind.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.120
Have you ever seen the movie her?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.120
Oh, yeah.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.120
Her.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.120
Classic.

14:34.120 --> 14:38.800
Walking Phoenix really nailed that falling for your OS thing, right?

14:38.800 --> 14:41.960
Makes you wonder what the future holds.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.960
Sesame's voice demo was incredible, friend, and I'm excited to see what you built.

14:45.960 --> 14:50.480
And it's crazy how quickly the gap between science fiction and reality is closing on us.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.520
And it feels like the touring test really just snuck up on us, actually had a tip for

14:53.520 --> 14:56.640
that to Jim Fan who tweeted it and I stole it for this presentation.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.640
So hi, Jim.

14:58.640 --> 15:03.360
Finally, the breakout application category of the year was coding, which reached screaming

15:03.360 --> 15:04.840
product market fit.

15:04.840 --> 15:09.400
Anthropics, clawed three, five, sonnet, dropped last fall, triggering a rapid vibe shift

15:09.400 --> 15:10.920
in the coding landscape.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.520
And people are now using AI coding for really impressive things.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.520
So for example, this person vibe coded their own docs and alternative.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.400
And so whether you're a veteran 10X engineer or somebody who has no idea how to code,

15:21.400 --> 15:26.240
we do think that AI is fundamentally changing the accessibility, the speed, and the economics

15:26.240 --> 15:28.840
of software creation.

15:28.840 --> 15:33.120
From the technology back, the bad news is that pre-training does seem to be slowing down.

15:33.120 --> 15:37.800
We've scaled pre-training by 9 or 10 orders of magnitude since the AlexNet days.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.760
And that means that a lot of the low hanging fruit has been picked.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.320
The research ecosystem is finding new ways to break through.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.920
The most important breakthrough was reasoning from OpenAI.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.720
We were lucky enough to have no embrown from the strawberry team give us a preview of

15:51.720 --> 15:54.880
what was going to happen with reasoning at AISN last year.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.360
And this year we're happy to have Dan Roberts in the audience who's going to be giving

15:57.360 --> 16:00.640
another talk on what's happening with O3 and reasoning ahead.

16:00.640 --> 16:05.040
It's not just reasoning, it's synthetic data, it's tool use, it's a genetic scaffolding,

16:05.040 --> 16:10.040
all of these things are combining, combining to create new ways for us to scale intelligence.

16:10.840 --> 16:15.120
Anthropics MCP created strong ecosystem and networks, and we're also excited to see

16:15.120 --> 16:19.240
what that does to accelerate a genetic tool use.

16:19.240 --> 16:24.080
So all of this bigger base models, inference time reasoning, tool use, it's all combining

16:24.080 --> 16:28.480
to create AI that's capable of increasingly sophisticated tasks.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.640
The meter benchmark is one good quantitative measure of this, but I think what's even more

16:32.640 --> 16:36.880
powerful is talking to each of you about the types of things that are only possible now

16:37.040 --> 16:40.920
because of O3 or operator or deep research or Sonnet.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.720
And then finally, a lot of the most exciting technology innovation in AI right now is

16:46.720 --> 16:50.920
happening at that blurry boundary between research and product.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.040
And I think the two breakthrough examples of this over the last year were deep research

16:54.040 --> 16:55.520
and notebook LM.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.680
And we're excited to have the creators of both of those products in the audience with us

16:58.680 --> 17:03.680
today, Ryza and Jason from Notebook, we're creating a new company called Hux and Esafelford

17:03.680 --> 17:04.680
from OpenAI.

17:05.680 --> 17:06.680
OK.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.480
Talk about where value will accrue in the AI stack.

17:12.480 --> 17:16.880
I remember debating this question with my wonderful partners at Sequoia at the time.

17:16.880 --> 17:22.320
I was personally the midwits in the middle of this chart saying, like, I don't know about

17:22.320 --> 17:23.320
the GPD rappers.

17:23.320 --> 17:28.200
And I remember my partners, Pat in particular, were adamant that the value was going to accrue

17:28.200 --> 17:31.320
to the application layer.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.920
And I remember thinking, like, OK, Pat, sure.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.120
Good luck with that.

17:38.120 --> 17:42.680
But having seen how the last few years have played out, I think you were right, Pat.

17:42.680 --> 17:43.440
You belong over here.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.440
Good job.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.400
If you see where value has been created, if you see companies like Harvey and OpenEvidence

17:49.400 --> 17:53.600
really creating that customer back value, we very much believe that the application layer

17:53.600 --> 17:58.160
is where the value will ultimately accrue and that the battleground is intensifying in

17:58.160 --> 18:02.280
this layer of the stack with the foundation models increasingly competing here.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.280
OK.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.360
Quick aside, the jokes actually on all of us, because the real undisputed king of the stack who

18:07.360 --> 18:12.280
was making all the dollars was the goat himself, Jensen Huang, who were excited to hear from

18:12.280 --> 18:13.280
shortly.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.280
OK.

18:14.280 --> 18:20.760
Back to the application layer.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.880
We now think that the first cohort of AI's killer apps has emerged, whether it's Chatchy

18:24.880 --> 18:28.440
BT, Harvey, Gleens, Sierra, Cursor, a bridge.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.360
But there's a whole set of new companies on the rise across a very rich and diverse set

18:32.360 --> 18:36.440
of end markets, including listen labs, including OpenEvidence.

18:36.440 --> 18:41.480
We're excited to feature many of you today.

18:41.480 --> 18:45.320
Another prediction is that many of these new companies will be agents first, and that

18:45.320 --> 18:48.600
the agencies companies are selling will evolve from prototype so they're often just

18:48.600 --> 18:51.520
pieced together today to ones that are really robust.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.800
And we see two paths that companies are taking to build that.

18:54.800 --> 19:00.720
Path one, orchestration with rigorous testing in the eVALS, path two, agents ten, tuned

19:00.720 --> 19:01.720
on end-to-end tasks.

19:01.720 --> 19:06.240
And we're excited to hear more on this from both Harrison of Langchain and Issa of OpenAI

19:06.240 --> 19:07.240
today.

19:07.240 --> 19:12.800
Our next prediction on the shape of agent companies in 2025 is vertical agents.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.760
Vertical agents are a wonderful opportunity for startup founders who deeply understand

19:15.760 --> 19:16.760
the domain.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.200
And we see companies creating agents that are trained end-to-end to excel in a very

19:21.200 --> 19:25.640
specific workflow, using techniques, including reinforcement learning on synthetic data and

19:25.640 --> 19:30.840
user data, to make AI systems very performant at very specific tasks.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.320
And the evidence we've seen so far makes us really optimistic.

19:34.320 --> 19:39.240
In security, Expo is now showing that they have an agent that can outperform human penetration

19:39.240 --> 19:40.360
testers.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.760
In DevOps, traversal is showing that they can create an AI troubleshooter that is better

19:43.760 --> 19:46.280
than the best human troubleshooters.

19:46.280 --> 19:49.240
Same goes in networking with meter in networking engineers.

19:49.240 --> 19:53.360
And so all of this, all these data points, they're early, but they make us very optimistic

19:53.360 --> 19:57.240
that vertical agents trying to solve a very specific problem can outperform the best

19:57.240 --> 19:59.560
humans today.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.080
One final prediction on agents in 2025.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.240
We're entering an abundance era.

20:04.240 --> 20:09.000
Code as the first market category to tip will offer us a preview into what that abundance

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
era actually means.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.960
What happens when labor is cheap and plentiful?

20:12.960 --> 20:16.200
Are we going to get a bunch of AI slop?

20:16.200 --> 20:19.000
And what happens when taste becomes the scarce asset?

20:19.000 --> 20:22.200
We're excited to see the continued progress of coding agents and what that does to the

20:22.200 --> 20:27.120
technology landscape, but also as a harbinger for how other industries will be changed by

20:27.120 --> 20:28.120
AI.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.720
I'll turn it over to Constantine.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.720
Thank you, Sonya.

20:30.720 --> 20:31.720
All right.

20:31.720 --> 20:32.720
Great job.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.720
All right.

20:33.720 --> 20:34.720
Good morning, everyone.

20:34.720 --> 20:35.720
Thank you, Sonya.

20:35.720 --> 20:36.720
Thank you, Pat.

20:36.720 --> 20:45.320
So we just talked about really big important topics, the so what?

20:45.320 --> 20:48.360
Why does this matter so incredibly much?

20:48.720 --> 20:49.720
What now?

20:49.720 --> 20:50.720
What's going on in the world?

20:50.720 --> 20:54.200
The state of AI today and it's immediate future.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.520
Now we're going to take a step back.

20:56.520 --> 21:02.800
We're going to think through predictions about what's coming in the mid and long term.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.840
In this section, we'll have three parts.

21:04.840 --> 21:08.560
We'll talk about what we see as the major next wave.

21:08.560 --> 21:13.000
Then we'll get into the technology needed to achieve that wave.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
And then finally, we'll talk about what it means for each of us, our day-to-day lives.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.120
A year ago, AI sent was all about agents.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.520
We were talking about agents and they were just beginning to form into businesses.

21:26.520 --> 21:31.520
The topic was really these machine assistants that eventually we predicted would come together

21:31.520 --> 21:33.760
as machine networks.

21:33.760 --> 21:38.520
These machine networks are now broadly called agent swarms.

21:38.520 --> 21:43.800
They play a role in many of your companies and are beginning to form into a really critical

21:43.800 --> 21:45.520
part of the AI stack.

21:45.520 --> 21:49.320
They're just working with each other against each other, collaborating, doing reasoning

21:49.320 --> 21:51.280
with each other.

21:51.280 --> 21:58.840
In the years to come, we think that this matures even further into an agent economy.

21:58.840 --> 22:05.120
An agent economy is one which agents don't just communicate information.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.280
They transfer resources.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.800
They can make transactions.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.320
They keep track of each other.

22:12.320 --> 22:19.280
They understand trust and reliability and they actually have their own economy.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.520
Well, this economy doesn't cut out humans.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.280
It's all about humans.

22:23.280 --> 22:31.240
The agents work with the people and the people work with the agents in this agent economy.

22:31.240 --> 22:37.720
But in order to achieve that very big, important next wave that we're all going to enter, we

22:37.720 --> 22:42.400
have a lot of important technical challenges and we'll talk about three of them.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.520
Frankly, this room is going to be addressing those three as you build.

22:46.520 --> 22:49.720
Well, the first is persistent identity.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.480
When we talk about persistent identity, we really mean two things.

22:52.480 --> 22:56.120
The first is the agent itself needs to be persistent.

22:56.120 --> 23:01.600
If you're doing business with someone and they change day to day, you probably won't

23:01.600 --> 23:04.480
be doing business with them for very long.

23:04.480 --> 23:08.680
That dramatically different experience will take its toll.

23:08.680 --> 23:13.320
The agent is going to have to be able to persist on its own personality and its own understanding.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.840
The second type of persistence is understanding you.

23:16.840 --> 23:20.880
Similarly, if you're doing business with a person and they don't remember anything about

23:20.880 --> 23:23.600
you, they can hardly remember your name.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.760
That's also a big challenge to trust and reliability.

23:27.760 --> 23:34.640
Now, we've been trying everything from RAG and VectorDBs to really long context windows,

23:34.640 --> 23:39.400
but ever in this room knows that there are still major challenges in true memory and

23:39.400 --> 23:44.480
self-learning on that true memory and actually getting the agents to be able to be consistent

23:44.480 --> 23:50.200
where it matters and only different in the areas where they should be differing.

23:50.200 --> 23:56.760
The second major technology shift is we need to have seamless communication protocols.

23:56.760 --> 24:02.840
Now the great news is everyone seems to be focused on this now, but imagine personal

24:02.840 --> 24:11.360
computing without seamless communication protocols, no TCP IP, no internet.

24:11.360 --> 24:15.600
We're just now building that protocol later and there's certainly a lot of excitement

24:15.600 --> 24:16.600
around MCP.

24:16.600 --> 24:23.480
It's so great to see the big players collaborating and working together to come up with this

24:23.480 --> 24:28.600
is just one, but a series of protocols that are going to allow for transfer of information,

24:28.600 --> 24:31.800
transfer of value and transfer of trust.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.960
Finally, security.

24:33.960 --> 24:38.040
This is a topic that's going to be on the rise and is certainly on top of many of your

24:38.040 --> 24:39.280
minds.

24:39.280 --> 24:45.600
If you can't meet the person you're doing business with, palm to palm, face to face, that importance

24:45.600 --> 24:49.360
of security and trust is even further elevated.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.640
You can't with agents.

24:51.640 --> 24:58.280
So we're going to have an entire cottage industry formed around that trust, that security,

24:58.280 --> 25:03.640
and it will be even more important in the agent economy than it already is in our current

25:03.640 --> 25:05.840
economy.

25:05.840 --> 25:09.600
So we talked about the technology needed to get to this big wave, to get to this agent

25:09.600 --> 25:10.600
economy.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.640
Now let's talk a little bit about what it's going to mean for each of us.

25:13.640 --> 25:17.760
Well, first of all, it's going to change our mindsets.

25:17.760 --> 25:23.880
And frankly, this room is already there on what we're calling the stochastic mindset.

25:23.880 --> 25:28.480
The stochastic mindset is a departure from determinism.

25:28.480 --> 25:33.760
You know, a lot of us fell in love with computer science because it was so deterministic, right?

25:33.760 --> 25:39.280
You program the computer to do something, it does it, even if that results in a sag fault.

25:39.280 --> 25:43.120
Now we're entering an error of computing that's going to be stochastic.

25:44.080 --> 25:49.440
If you ask a computer to remember the number 73, it'll remember that tomorrow, next week, next month.

25:49.440 --> 25:55.360
If you ask a person or an AI, well, it might remember 73.

25:55.360 --> 26:03.440
It might remember 37, 72, 74, the next prime, 79, or nothing at all.

26:03.440 --> 26:09.480
The point here is that this is going to be materially different thinking from what we've done

26:09.480 --> 26:12.280
in the decades past.

26:12.280 --> 26:16.200
Second change is a management mindset.

26:16.200 --> 26:22.920
And this management mindset is going to be all about understanding what your agents can and can't do for you.

26:22.920 --> 26:29.000
Everybody knows that being a really good IC engineer is pretty different from being a great engineering manager.

26:29.000 --> 26:36.000
And this is going to be the transition that most of the economy is going to make into more complex,

26:36.000 --> 26:41.680
managerial decisions like blocking processes and giving feedback.

26:41.680 --> 26:46.720
And I really hope it doesn't result in year end reviews of agents.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.080
Let's try to avoid that.

26:49.080 --> 26:53.880
The third major change for each of us is a combination of the previous two.

26:53.880 --> 26:59.440
Way more leverage with significantly less certainty.

26:59.440 --> 27:05.960
We're entering a world where you can do more, but you have to be able to manage that uncertainty and manage risks.

27:06.240 --> 27:14.360
And in this world, ever in this room is extremely well suited to thrive.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.840
A year ago, at AI Cent, we talked about this chart.

27:18.840 --> 27:26.640
And we were talking about leverage because we said individual functions at an organization will begin to have AI agents.

27:26.640 --> 27:30.400
And then we predicted that these functions would begin to merge.

27:30.400 --> 27:35.920
They cluster and entire processes would be completed by AI agents.

27:36.200 --> 27:40.440
We even made the prediction that we'd have the first one person unicorn.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.800
Now, that hasn't happened yet.

27:42.800 --> 27:49.520
But we have seen companies scale faster than ever before with fewer people than ever before.

27:49.520 --> 27:55.000
And we do think we're going to get to the highest level of leverage that we've ever seen as economy.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.600
Eventually, these processes and agents are going to merge.

27:58.600 --> 28:03.920
You're going to have neural networks within very large complex neural networks,

28:03.920 --> 28:06.640
a network of these neural networks.

28:06.640 --> 28:10.880
And this is going to change everything.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.560
It's going to reinvent individual work.

28:14.560 --> 28:18.720
It's going to rewire companies.

28:18.720 --> 28:22.160
And it's going to recreate the economy.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.440
Thank you all for joining us.

28:24.440 --> 28:28.560
We're going to have an amazing AI Cent today and we're very grateful for you being with us.
