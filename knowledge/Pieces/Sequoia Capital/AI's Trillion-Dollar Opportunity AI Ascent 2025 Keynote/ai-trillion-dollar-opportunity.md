## The Market Opportunity: From Services to Software

### The TAM Evolution

Pat Grady frames the AI opportunity through Sequoia's market analysis framework, starting with Don Valentine's fundamental questions: "What is it? So what? Why now? What now?"

> "The cloud at 400 billion of revenue is bigger than the global software market when that transition began. If we reasoned by analogy, the market we're going after in the world of AI, services, the starting point is at least an order of magnitude bigger."

The critical insight: AI isn't just attacking the services marketâ€”it's going after both services AND software:

> "It's not just the services market that AI is going after. It's both services and software. Means that both of these profit pools are under attack."

### The Progression Path

Companies are evolving along a clear trajectory:
1. **Start with software** - Traditional tools
2. **Become co-pilots** - Augmentation phase
3. **Become autopilots** - Automation phase
4. **Sell outcomes** - Transition from software budget to labor budget

> "We've seen plenty of companies that start with software, gets a little bit smarter, becomes more of a co-pilot, gets a little bit smarter, becomes more of an autopilot, and they actually progress from selling a tool into software budget to selling an outcome, to selling work into labor budget."

## Why Now: The Physics of Distribution Have Changed

### The Rails Are in Place

Grady emphasizes that AI is "imminent, not just inevitable" because all the necessary conditions have converged:

> "Compute, networks, data, distribution, talent. We have all the ingredients we need, so we're ready to go."

### Unprecedented Adoption Speed

The adoption dynamics are fundamentally different from previous technology waves:

**Awareness**: When cloud computing emerged, "Benioff had to do these crazy gorilla marketing tactics to get anybody to pay attention." But with AI: "November 30, 2022, ChatGPT comes out. The entire world is paying attention to AI."

**Distribution channels**:
- Combined monthly active users for Reddit and Twitter: 1.2-1.8 billion people
- Internet connectivity: From 200 million during cloud transition to 5.6 billion today
- "It's effectively every household and every business in the world"

> "The rails are in place. And when the starting gun went off, there were no barriers to adoption. This is not an AI specific phenomenon. This is the new reality of technology distribution, the physics have changed."

## The Application Layer Battleground

### Where Value Accrues

Sequoia's conviction remains firm:

> "Most of them are at the application layer. We have believed and we continue to believe that the same will be true for AI. The value is at the application layer."

But there's increasing competition from foundation models:

> "We got a second scaling law. We got test time compute. We got reasoning with tool use and inter agent communication. That allows the foundation models to get pretty far into the application layer."

### Building Moats in the Application Layer

Grady outlines the "Leone Merchandising Cycle" approach to building defensibility across the entire value chain:

**Customer-back strategies**:
- **Have an opinion**: "Your customer is not sure what they want out of AI. You can have an opinion."
- **End-to-end solutions**: "Give them an end to end solution that just solves the problem as opposed to throwing a tool over the fence"
- **Data flywheels**: "Build data flywheels with the usage data of your own product. That's something that nobody else has"
- **Industry expertise**: "Be of the industry for the industry... Harvey sends lawyers in to talk with law firms"
- **Customer intimacy**: "Put a big bear hug around your customers in a way that foundation models probably won't"

## Critical Metrics for AI Companies

### 1. Real Revenue vs. "Vibe Revenue"

> "Vibe revenue can kill you. Everybody loves vibe revenue. It feels so good. Oh my God, we have so much revenue. Go look at it. Okay. Is it tire kicking? Are you actually creating durable behavior change?"

The key is measuring true engagement:
- Adoption metrics
- Engagement patterns
- Retention rates
- Actual usage behavior

### 2. Trust Over Product

> "Your customers have to trust you and you have to earn that trust. This is more important than your product at this point in time. Where we are in the cycle. The products will get better. If they trust you to make it better, you're in good shape."

### 3. Margin Evolution

The economics are improving dramatically:
- "Cost per token is down 99% in the last 12 to 18 months"
- Companies moving up the value chain from tools to outcomes
- Path to healthy gross margins through value capture

### 4. Data Flywheel Reality Check

Grady's provocative challenge to the audience:

> "Raise your hand if you got a data flywheel. What business metric does that data flywheel move? Okay, I see less certainty. I got good news, I got bad news. Good news is, if you can't answer that question, I still love you. The bad news is your data flywheel is bullshit."

The critical test: "It needs to tie to a business metric or it just doesn't matter."

## The State of AI: 2024 Year in Review

### Engagement Breakthrough

Sonya Huang presents the dramatic shift in AI application engagement:

> "Back in 2023... AI apps had terrible engagement ratios, hype exceeded reality in the data. We're very pleased to report that that punchline has now changed dramatically."

ChatGPT's daily/monthly active ratio is now approaching Reddit levels, signaling genuine value creation.

### The "Her" Moment for Voice

> "2024 gave us what I would call the her moment for voice. And voice generation went from almost there to fully crossing the uncanny valley."

### Coding as the Breakout Category

> "The breakout application category of the year was coding, which reached screaming product market fit. Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet dropped last fall, triggering a rapid vibe shift in the coding landscape."

The significance: "AI is fundamentally changing the accessibility, the speed, and the economics of software creation."

## Technology Evolution: Beyond Pre-training

### The New Scaling Paradigms

While pre-training scaling is slowing ("We've scaled pre-training by 9 or 10 orders of magnitude since the AlexNet days"), new breakthroughs are emerging:

- **Reasoning**: OpenAI's O-series models
- **Synthetic data**: New training approaches
- **Tool use**: Expanding capabilities
- **Agentic scaffolding**: Complex task orchestration
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Ecosystem connectivity

> "All of this bigger base models, inference time reasoning, tool use, it's all combining to create AI that's capable of increasingly sophisticated tasks."

### The Research-Product Boundary

> "A lot of the most exciting technology innovation in AI right now is happening at that blurry boundary between research and product."

Breakthrough examples:
- OpenAI's Deep Research
- Google's NotebookLM

## Agent Evolution: Toward an Agent Economy

### The First Cohort of Killer Apps

Huang identifies the emerging winners:
- ChatGPT
- Harvey (legal)
- Glean (enterprise search)
- Sierra (customer service)
- Cursor (coding)
- Abridge (healthcare)

### Two Paths to Robust Agents

1. **Orchestration with rigorous testing and evals**
2. **Agents fine-tuned on end-to-end tasks**

### Vertical Agents: The Opportunity

> "Vertical agents are a wonderful opportunity for startup founders who deeply understand the domain."

Early evidence of superhuman performance:
- **Security**: "Expo is now showing that they have an agent that can outperform human penetration testers"
- **DevOps**: "Traversal is showing that they can create an AI troubleshooter that is better than the best human troubleshooters"
- **Networking**: Meter outperforming network engineers

## The Coming Agent Economy

Constantine Johnstone outlines the evolution from agent swarms to a full agent economy:

### The Progression
1. **Individual agents** (2024)
2. **Agent swarms/networks** (2025)
3. **Agent economy** (2026+)

> "An agent economy is one which agents don't just communicate information. They transfer resources. They can make transactions. They keep track of each other. They understand trust and reliability and they actually have their own economy."

### Technical Prerequisites

**1. Persistent Identity**
- Agent consistency: "If you're doing business with someone and they change day to day, you probably won't be doing business with them for very long"
- Memory of users: Understanding and remembering interactions

**2. Communication Protocols**
- "Imagine personal computing without seamless communication protocols, no TCP IP, no internet"
- MCP and emerging standards for information, value, and trust transfer

**3. Security Infrastructure**
- "If you can't meet the person you're doing business with, palm to palm, face to face, that importance of security and trust is even further elevated"

### The Mindset Shifts

**From Deterministic to Stochastic**:
> "If you ask a computer to remember the number 73, it'll remember that tomorrow, next week, next month. If you ask a person or an AI, well, it might remember 73. It might remember 37, 72, 74, the next prime, 79, or nothing at all."

**From IC to Manager**:
> "Everybody knows that being a really good IC engineer is pretty different from being a great engineering manager. And this is going to be the transition that most of the economy is going to make."

**More Leverage, Less Certainty**:
> "We're entering a world where you can do more, but you have to be able to manage that uncertainty and manage risks."

## The Abundance Era and Its Implications

### Code as the Harbinger

> "Code as the first market category to tip will offer us a preview into what that abundance era actually means."

Key questions for the future:
- "What happens when labor is cheap and plentiful?"
- "Are we going to get a bunch of AI slop?"
- "What happens when taste becomes the scarce asset?"

### The One-Person Unicorn Vision

While not yet realized, the trajectory is clear:

> "We have seen companies scale faster than ever before with fewer people than ever before. And we do think we're going to get to the highest level of leverage that we've ever seen as economy."

## The Urgency: Nature Abhors a Vacuum

Grady's closing rallying cry captures the moment's urgency:

> "There is a tremendous sucking sound in the market right now for AI. All of the macroeconomic stuff, tariffs and interest rate, noise doesn't matter. The rising tide of technology adoption absolutely swamps any of the volatility that you see in the markets."

The imperative is clear:

> "If you don't get in front of it, somebody else will because nature hates a vacuum. And so all the stuff we just said about modes and metrics and whatever, notwithstanding, you are in a run-like-heck business right now. Now is the time to go at maximum velocity all of the time."

## The Transformation Ahead

Johnstone's closing vision:

> "Eventually, these processes and agents are going to merge. You're going to have neural networks within very large complex neural networks, a network of these neural networks. And this is going to change everything. It's going to reinvent individual work. It's going to rewire companies. And it's going to recreate the economy."

*This keynote from Sequoia's AI Ascent 2025 presents both a state of the union for AI and a roadmap for the transformation ahead. The message is clear: we're past the hype phase and into the building phase, where real value creation happens at the application layer, but the window to capture that value is finite and competitive.*
