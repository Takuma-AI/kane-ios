00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
All right, Doran, let's take a look at what you're working on.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Yeah, and I'm just sharing my screen.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Okay.

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
Yeah, so this is an update based on your last round of feedback on stacks on homepage.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
And just a quick refresher stacks on a whole page would allow you to stack multiple projects in what we call stacks.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
And there's three ways in which you can do that.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Like a folder basically, right, like putting things together that are related.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Exactly, exactly.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Yeah, you can think of it as a folder, essentially.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
So there are three ways in which you can do it.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
You can either drag a project and recently visited on top of another project.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
And you'll see that the context changes into a create stack.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Once you release that, you'll move to the top to the pinned areas.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
So over here, you can see that you have a new stack here.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
You can click inside.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
You can give it a new name.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Let's call it cycle five.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Save it.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
And the projects they just drop on top of each other, of course, will form that stack.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
You can as well just drag the project from recently visited on top of let's say,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
a house remodel in this case.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
And a new stack is going to be created exactly the same as previously was.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
So again, you can rename it, etc.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
You can as well drag a project from, let's say, getting started to any corner.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Within the pinned area at the top and same, you get a new stack.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Let's call it a little world.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And that's done.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
You can move the stacks.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
You can still move them around in the top section.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
So let's say I'm working on cycle five.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I want to have it on the top left.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I'm going to move it there.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Maybe, you know, this is companies stack where I have all my base camp.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
So I can rename it base camp.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
And I can, it's just so much easier to organize your pinned areas.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
And I know many people have many projects in the pin areas.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
It is very hard to keep track of, you know, where things are.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
And you know, when we stack so it's just much easier to control that.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
And I can ask a couple of questions.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
This is great.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Really like the transition.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
When you rename the stack to, it's really smooth and direct.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
What.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm wondering, did you guys explored all.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
So, so every time you create a stack, it says new stack.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
And we don't ask you to rename it there.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Had you explored or do you want to explore like concatenating the two projects that you if you create a new stack.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
So, you know, only on creation, if there's just two, which of course is how it might work to start.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
I wonder if I could say like, can you open that one, for example?

02:56.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, so it's house remodel on project name three. I almost wonder if it could be like.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
House remodel plus project name three, but then again, like as you add more, we wouldn't want to keep concatenating.

03:10.000 --> 03:19.000
I just wonder if, if it would, if it's going to be something people are going to have a bunch of stacks called new stack.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
But then again, maybe they'll just figure out how to rename it. I don't know any thoughts on that.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Do you play with that at all?

03:25.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I've considered when we when we first started this was to have the stack name being the name of the project that you first drop.

03:36.000 --> 03:48.000
So in this case, if I'm dropping, for instance, project name four on top of the little laptop, the project is going to be called project name four because that's the one that I'm dropping.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
But again, you know, to your points, like it might not make sense for a lot of people.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And you know, it's a good example for our case.

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
You know, if we have cycle five, if I'm dropping a project in cycle five, it's not going to be reflecting the actual thing that I want.

04:05.000 --> 04:19.000
So do you have the previous design we looked at before this because that that's sort of in a sense, solved it because it showed the miniature versions of the projects inside the stack.

04:19.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah. So, so this is the this is the previous version where the stack would not be actually, you know, a wide project like box.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Something like that you see the projects within the stack.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
And that was the nice side about this is that you would just like in a glimpse, see what's inside.

04:39.000 --> 04:50.000
And when you click, it will open, sorry to go back, it will open and you see the exact projects that you see in smaller version.

04:50.000 --> 04:59.000
So that's one advantage, perhaps, to the previous design, but I think that as we looked at it.

04:59.000 --> 05:13.000
It in this one situation, it kind of looks alright, but when you have a bunch of them, it starts to feel pretty overwhelming pretty quickly. So, okay, one of the thought I had, can you go back to the to the, yeah, in chrome.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
Close that out and drag a project on top of another project, but don't drop, don't create a stack yet.

05:19.000 --> 05:30.000
See what says create a stack. I wonder if we should say stack these projects or something like that, instead of create a stack, it's not, it's a little bit like.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
It's a bit more about the end goal, which is stacking them up versus creating something.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
I don't know, just a thought, I'm just kind of riffing out loud, but that was something I was thinking about.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
The other thing I want to bring up real quick, can you open a actual stack?

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
The link at the bottom empty stack, I assume that just removes the projects, can you try that?

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah, so when you click this, the projects go back in the pinned areas, then you get a message, no projects in this stack.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And then that bottom link changes to delete stack.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
At this point, you can just remove the stack completely, which will get rid of it.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah, I like that.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
The whole thing I would think about is, instead of saying empty stack.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
Since it's worth, since we have room, it's not a button, it's like, I wonder if it could say like.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
Remove projects from the stack, remove all projects from the stack, or maybe, yeah, maybe empty this stack.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
Just empty stack is a little bit brutal in a sense.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
It's like, it's pretty short, and I'm not totally sure.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
I think I know what it does, but it feels a little stark.

06:44.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah, one thing we can do to kind of combine, so I was also wondering about, potentially, you know, do we need to explain it more or just tell them what's going to happen at all.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
So like, you could combine it to like, move projects back to pinned.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, but they're not all pinned.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
They are.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Okay, we need to talk about that then.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, that doesn't make any sense to me, but okay, we'll get, we'll get into that in a second.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah, so we could, we could explain that.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
Related to the empty stack, and you know, we've kind of gone back and forth on whether or not.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
You know, I mean, just basically like, is, do we consider this destructive?

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
During QA came up, like, should we do need to be warned what's going to happen?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Do we need to, you know, really be explicit about what's happening?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Generally, I think it's like, it's a stack.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
You're not losing anything when you empty it.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Like, I don't think you, you know, so like, I think we could be better on the worry about.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
I don't personally think we have to, like, warn on it.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
No.

07:43.000 --> 07:52.000
The only thing is though, just to play this out is it's not destructive, obviously, because you're not deleting any projects, but.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
It's something you can, you can hit it by accident.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
And if you did have a dozen projects in here, it would be really frustrating.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
To hit that and not get.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
I think that was the main QA thing is that you could just like, you accidentally click or whatever.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Oh, yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
I wonder if there's a place to put it where it's less accidental.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Or I mean, we could of course have a confirmation, but it feels, it feels heavy.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
I mean, we could say empty stack, you click it and it says, are you sure?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And you have to click it again or something like that.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
There are some things we could do, but let's.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I'll just leave that on the table.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah, one of the, one of the things that we, we've done in one of the initial versions was to have, have the delete stack or empty stack.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Once you click on the edit.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
So you would have it here, essentially.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I like that too, actually, Doran, can you actually do that again?

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
So we don't currently have a delete unless you write empty it out first, which is a nice, also a nice.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Safety mechanism, safety valve there.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, we could have when you're in that mode.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
We could actually reveal the empty stack link at the bottom, even.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
I don't even know if I put it right next to that, but like maybe that, just that whole thing.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
It presents all the options that you would have.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah, I mean, we went back up to that.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
My main hesitant, I was just like.

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
It feels like you're not entering an edit stack mode as much as you're like entering an edit title load, you know, so like it's hard to know if.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Is that where you think you would find that find that, but like.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
You know, how often do you need to empty a stack?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
How often do you need to delete them?

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
This is kind of one of those like.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
The obvious easy, the possible situation is like.

09:48.000 --> 09:58.000
I agree that it's not an edit state necessarily, but like it's, if you ever need to do it, and you don't know how and you wish there was a way and we show you how and now you know it's like great, you can do it.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Versus trading that off against the frustration of like hitting that back center.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
And you're not entering out a dozen things that you carefully put in there, like that would be pretty frustrating.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
So I would almost prefer to like have that as part of the.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
Quote edit state, even though it's not an edit mode, whatever, whatever it is, settings mode, essentially.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Just so you don't do it by accident, you know.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, probably, you know, you're going to have to figure out how to name them.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
However, I guess there's also an empty thing. I mean, it's pretty soon you'll notice that there's this other option.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Right.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Cool.

10:37.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah, I think it's a good idea to show the empty stack, maybe at the bottom where it is now, but only when you click the edit title, this one shows up.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
In which case, you would not click it by accident, because this would not, you will not see it.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah, I think we should do that. I actually think we should probably do that.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Okay.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
And then how do you get a project out of here?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Normally, just drag it out.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes, we can just drag it out and it just goes away.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Cool.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
And then when you drag, if you drag the other one out, is that essentially the same as.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah, we can just condition there.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah, you should show a message. You should show this message.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Catch.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Cool.

11:23.000 --> 11:32.000
So close that door and one very minor thing, but they said we were talking about the empty stack text there, like.

11:32.000 --> 11:46.000
We talked about a few different options, like it was a little bit confusing to many activities, but like, because we have that like empty stack language currently, you know, like that that's an action you can take to empty this tack, you know, so if I was strange to use that word those words there.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah.

11:49.000 --> 12:08.000
It felt like we had like zero projects before instead of like empty stack and it felt like it was generated by the computer rather than, you know, put some thought into it and make it more human.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
So yeah, I wonder what's your.

12:11.000 --> 12:21.000
The first thing that comes to mind, even though I don't think I love it is like nothing inside or no projects.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah, it's me it's like it's inside, even though it's a stack is not really an inside thing.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
No projects was one that I thought of too.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
What was that, what was that project?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
No projects.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I thought that too.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Like that scene.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah, no projects seems better than zero projects.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
You could all say this, I mean, this stack is empty, but, but, but, but empty of what?

12:46.000 --> 12:56.000
So I do like the directness of just getting to the point like no projects or, yeah, no projects, perhaps could be fun.

12:56.000 --> 13:06.000
You know, I also say I'm not, I'm not a fan of the italics simply because I love the talics, but I don't think our italics are, I don't like this typeface really lends itself well.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, at this size, especially so I would probably just go.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Just lose it.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
I mean, I like the style.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
I really do like there's an elegance to italics, but I don't think they add anything here.

13:17.000 --> 13:27.000
I was, I was, I was waiting for the session to ask you about Alex because like a few people suggested it's moving back to San Serif.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
But then I thought it's just as Jason about this.

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
I go all caps, I go, so like see the little brand header over there on the right hand side.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, I think we use all caps in a few spots like small all caps, I think would be, could be nice.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah, I'll try that.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah, play with that.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
You're good at type. So that's what that.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Cool.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Okay.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah, so that's that.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
And then of course you can drag all the projects within the stack.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
If it's open, can you open a stack?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Can I drag something in now?

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
No, so this whole area is locked.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
And it's because the this panel is taking so much space.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
Yeah, it would be quite fiddly to try to drag stuff inside.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah, right.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
So we decided to kind of like blank out all the space.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
And if you click it, of course, you will close it.

14:17.000 --> 14:25.000
It exists to like a model, except that it doesn't have a dark background like as we, as we have it in other places.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
What do you think about that?

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
What do you think about sort of blurring or dimming the background?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Given the fact that you can't drag things in when it's open.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
Do you think it would make sense to almost stylistically double down on that?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Like if it's blurred out, you wouldn't expect you can do anything with the background.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Right now, I kind of expect I can.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah, so the initial idea behind not having a background was that this is supposed to be like a quick action.

14:51.000 --> 15:01.000
This is not, this is not like a model where you go in and you have to focus on something else like a form or a button or like whatever or read something.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
This is more like click, click, die.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
And it's almost like memory muscle rather than you're actually having to consume the content that it inside.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
And this is why I see it slightly different from what a model usually is.

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
And this is why I removed the background essentially, but you know, that said, it's so easy to edit back that.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
No, I can see, I can see how it does.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I think I buy that.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
By the way, the transition sometimes over zoom. It's hard to see.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
Does this sort of zoom up or is it just like materializing because it'd be nice.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
If it grew, it fades, it fades in.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Okay. Can we grow it?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Can we?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I'll try and expand from there.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah, I just would, if we can get that to look nice, I think it'd be, it feel.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
More like what you expect.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Yeah, yeah, more, more control.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Cool.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Nice.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Okay.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Does escape.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
If you hit escape, will it, will it X out?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Cool.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
All right.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
So let's get to this.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Contention, contentious point.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
If you, if you clear a stack, all those projects become pinned.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't, I assume there's some reason for this, but I don't like it because they didn't,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
like you can pull one from recently visited.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
To me, putting it up there is just putting it in a stack.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's not saying pin it also.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
So it's, it's doing two things when it shouldn't do two things.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
It should do one thing.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Can we not have it to that or were we out here with that?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Why, why was that decision made?

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
I mean, this is truly contentious, of course.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
The idea is that the, the, the stuff that you have at the top, they're all pinned.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
And people are used to that.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I'm used to that.

16:54.000 --> 17:01.000
And it's, it's kind of implicit that once you have a project at the top in the pinned area,

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
like this pinned itself, regardless if it's in a stack or outside the stack,

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
I do understand and agree with the argument that, you know, project in the stack,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
you don't see pinned here.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
So surely they are not pinned in this case.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
There's, of course, a technical aspect on this as well to mix, to mix the,

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
if you hear something screaming, that's my cat.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
It's not a baby.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
You're something screaming.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
It's, it's my kids.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
So,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
the cat doesn't scream.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Yes, going back to this, there's, there's also like a technical aspect to it.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
In, in the way these cards are modeled.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
So the idea is that once you drag a project, let's say, 100 designed newsroom here into the new stack.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
It becomes pinned automatically.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
And even though it doesn't show here, but because the stack is in the pinned area.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
Surely the projects within the stacks or pinned as well.

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
It's almost like it's hierarchically the top section, it's everything is pinned.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
What's underneath the section is, is recently visited.

18:14.000 --> 18:23.000
Yeah, we embrace that more when we added the ability to, you know, to just drag a recently visited project up to pin it.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Because that's new as part of this as well.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Like before you could never do that.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
And, you know, really it is.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
You know, without majorly remunning this in this page.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
Like it is a pinned section is how it just functions, you know, code wise, etc.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
And so I think letting people drag recently visited projects up there.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
I think it's really cool.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
We've talked about how we've always wanted to just like, oh, that's how you pin it.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
You just drag it up there and now it's pinned.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
So like dragging a recently visited project up onto a stack.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
To me, makes just as much sense that like it's pin now.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
This is the pin section that doesn't have to always be that way.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
But I think based on where we've come from, it would be really hard to change that assumption.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
Okay, so this is a primarily technical.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
I mean, I would say.

19:13.000 --> 19:19.000
And as far as like for this specific project, I'd say 70% technical.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
But personally, I mean, to me, it makes more sense this way.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
That this is a pinned section.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
I think if we wanted to rethink like, no, things up here, they can be anything.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
They're not pinned.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
They're just, this is just another group of projects pinned or not project.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
I think we'd have to like rethink this page more of like what is this section?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
If it's not the pinned section.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
This section is a part of your desk where you put the stuff that's important to you.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
That's how I would think about this.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
So let me, let me make my case, at least share my point of view on this.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
I think once we introduce stacks, it's not just pinned.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
So it was just pinned.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
So we're coming from a place of just pinned.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
But now it's not.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
Now it's, it's like things that are to pinned or, or, or together, these are,

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
this is just like one separate place to put the stuff that's in play.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Like currently kind of in play.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Now, if you think about.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
When, so let's say you open that new stack.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
It says four projects, don't.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
So if you're done, let's say the cycle is over.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Let's say you had a 12 cycle projects in here.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
And you had all your 12 cycle projects in here.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Brian, you're managing these projects.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
You put them all in here.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Cycle is over.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
You hit empty.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
Think about what, what's going on in that moment at that time.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
You're saying like, I don't want these together anymore.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
There's a pretty good chance you probably don't want them at the top anymore either

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
because they're like done.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
It's sort of like they're kind of like over.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
But now you've got 12 pinned projects that have just shown up in this pin section.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
You had three or four pinned things before because you pinned these four things.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Now you've got 12 things that are pinned, which is overwhelmed the four things that you had.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
And now you probably have to go through and unpin the things that you don't want up there anymore.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
So the way I'm thinking about it is when you, when you take stuff out of a stack.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
It's probably because it's over, in a sense, the way this is currently designed.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
So I don't think pinning it by default at that point.

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
Would line up with the scenario I'm, you know, we're assuming here.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
The scenario that I think would be most likely, which is I'm done with this stuff.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Don't need it up here anymore.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
So, so my, my, just my preference.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
And this is not a veto or anything like that.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
But my preference would be if it's possible to remember the state of the project.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
If it was pinned great and you take it out, it stays pinned.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
If it was before in previously, previously seen or previously, what's it called?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Recently visited recently visited.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
I'm thinking, hey, and basically recently visited you take it out.

21:59.000 --> 22:12.000
And it was came from there to go back to there is, is my, my thinking to me this, this new section is a, is an, is an, is a expansion of the concept of up top.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
I think of the section now is up top.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
What goes up top pin stuff and stuff and stacks.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
But it doesn't change the nature of the projects within the stack itself.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
The projects are the same.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
It's not a conversion.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
It's a new pin.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
It's just their together and all the things that are together live up here.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
So that's, that's my thing.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I don't know what's, what's possible.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
What's reasonable.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
No, I think, I think I think that makes a lot of sense.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
And I think the scenario that you painted is, is, is, is, is more common than not.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
And I, I totally agree with that.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
I think one of the technical challenges we had around that was without getting it too much detail here.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
The challenge was like, how do you drag a project from here there without actually pinning it?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Right.

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
But I think we should flip that on its head and say, actually, we can pin it.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
But only look at unpining it when you hit empty stack.

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
Rather than, because these are pinned here now, essentially in the, in the back end.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
So that, that though, don't know that.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
So if, if empty stack unpinned everything, there might have been things that you had pinned that you did want to stay up there.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
But I, I would just wonder if you could ask who you're working on this with.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
But Nicholas, Nicholas, if you could ask Nicholas, if it'd be possible.

23:35.000 --> 23:42.000
To, I, and I can see, like, I can see through why maybe it wouldn't be right now.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
That, that this is sort of an adaptation of pins.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And so therefore, that's how it works.

23:48.000 --> 23:57.000
But if we could remember the state of a project and putting it up there, if it goes into, if it goes into a stack, it just in a stack.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
And stacks are essentially themselves pinned.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
But what's inside of them is the things that are inside of them are what they were.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
If it was pinned, it was pinned. If it wasn't pinned, it wasn't pinned.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I don't think it should change the state.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
It's not intuitive to me that it's changing the state.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
And in fact, it's doing something to a project without me seeing it, without me understanding what that means.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
And I know we don't want pins here either because they have no meaning inside of the stack as you can't unpinned in a stack.

24:25.000 --> 24:33.000
So understanding though that like, we're probably, there's some leverage here because just the way things currently work.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
And I know this might be changing. So I would just inquire and just see, like, is this a day?

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
And it is worth the work. Is it, is it like this actually would change a whole bunch of stuff would be really complicated.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Because I think that's worth just understanding.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Yeah, we're looking to it.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
We'll go to it.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
All right.

24:51.000 --> 25:06.000
But just one additional thing like on that, like, to see how far we would need to take it, which is, you know, what happens when you drag a recently visited project just up to that section.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
Like, if you just grab, I want to call it the pinback section.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Let's call it up top.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Let's call it up top.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
If you drag it up top.

25:15.000 --> 25:22.000
So like I was saying, so like right now, and then the latest thing, I say, what's live, you can't drag it at all.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
This is what we're about to ship.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
You can drag a project from recently visited up top.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
In a pin.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Empty space.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Right.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
So I think that project three, drag it up into the empty space somewhere.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Yep.

25:39.000 --> 25:47.000
It makes sense because you're placing it up there individually by itself, individual things by themselves up top are pinned.

25:47.000 --> 25:57.000
But stacks, which also exist up top, are not pinned. They're just, they just live up top.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
So I think if you drag a project into a stack, it just retains a state that it had.

26:02.000 --> 26:09.000
If you drag a project from recently visited up into pinned and drop it alone on its own, it does get pinned.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
So logically, I think that all adds up whether or not it's doable.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
I mean, anything's doable, but doable within, you know, where we're at in this project.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I mean, like for me, it feels.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.000
Just like from my, the way my mind works, I guess I said, like it feels, as it feels logical that.

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
It feels strange that dragging a card off reduces two different.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
Like sometimes you drag a card up and it's pinned, sometimes you drag a card up and it's not pinned.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Like that to me seems to reach.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Okay, well.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
If the session wasn't called pinned in your head, right?

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
Because it's been called pinned for the past, however many years now at this point.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
If it was always called up top.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
I know where there's like the counterfactual here like, can you, can you forget what it was called before?

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
And can you imagine if it wasn't called pinned, but like pinning things put stuff up top.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
And now there's not new things that can go up top, which are stacks.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
And this whole section was never called pinned.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
Or another way to think about it would be this, let's say anything up top turned green.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
And dragging projects into folder into stacks would just turn them green also.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
You're like, why is it green?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Like it's in a stack.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
What does that do with changing the color of the object?

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
Normally the behavior was if I drag a project up on its own up top, it turns green.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
But putting it in a stack, why would it also turn a green?

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
What I'm trying to do is just groups and things and group stuff lives up top as well.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Maybe that's kind of a weak argument.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
I don't know.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I'm just wondering trying to like break.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
Whatever I find myself in those in those patterns, I try to break away from.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
Like the title of the section.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Injecting too much meaning.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Just because the history momentum of it, right?

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
And I might be, I might not be making good argument by the way, it's just.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
I would try to think of this as up top now has two kinds of things.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
Things to sing on their own or pin so they stay there.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Stacks also stay there.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
I mean, you can think about it in terms of like weight almost a stack is heavier.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
It stays up there because it's heavier.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Can.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
You know, you pin something.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Actually, this is backwards.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
That doesn't even make sense.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Forget that even said that part.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
But I'm just thinking there's two kinds of things that are up top.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
And putting something in a stack does not also do two things to it.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
It doesn't pin it first and then put it in a stack.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
It just puts it into a stack.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Yeah.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Yeah.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
Only I wonder though is that if we do that, which.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
I can't.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Definitely can see.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Houses.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Some places to it.

28:58.000 --> 29:05.000
But like, if we do that, it kind of seems like in the stack, we would need to show whether something's pinned or not.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Like.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
I don't think it matters here because.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Think about what you're doing here.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
I don't need to know the state of something.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
I can't move things around in here, right?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
You can you can shuffle them around.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Right.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
But, but what I'm saying is you can move anything around.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
So.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
The fact that two of them were pinned.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Then you couldn't move.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
It actually would add more complexity.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Here's.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Here's what I'm referring to.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
It's just that like.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
You could take two actions here to get first up.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
You can drag it out.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
And you can.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Empty stack.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
So you can.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
And then those cards go somewhere.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
And my point is that like, if you don't, you know, because you don't remember where you drag the stuff from.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
So like, if we don't show what's pinned or not.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
And you like drag a card up.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Like some of the cards are going to land and pin to some of the cards going to drop back.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
And they say,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
and you wouldn't know which one it's going to which way it's going to happen, you know.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Yes.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
That's true.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
So that makes it feel like, oh, now we need to show like, which is pinned and which isn't pinned.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
But then can you unpin from here?

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
And you know, they could just, it seems like more complication than it helps.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
So that's, that's fair.

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
Um, I would argue it doesn't matter what it was to you right now.

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
Like, I would just argue that if you take it out, it, it was what it was.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
So if it was pinned, it goes back into pinned.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
If it wasn't pinned, it goes back down below.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
Like, I don't, because I can't change the behavior of the item.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
I, I, because I can't, let's say something was pinned.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
And I wanted it to be unpinned.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I couldn't unpin it and then drop it down below.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
It just is going to retain, it's going to, it's going to revert back to what it was.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Regardless.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
And there's, there's nothing I can do about that.

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
So I would, I would just, um, let it do what it was or let it be what it was.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
But anyway, that, that's just, you know, I, I think it's worth mulling it over.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
But the bigger, the bigger question is, before you even mull it over, technically,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
what would be possible to do that?

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
And if, if it turns out that that's like a major rework, it's not worth it at all.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
I think so, this is a matter of like.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
I think both arguments are, are fair.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
One argument, my argument would not be even worth entertaining at all.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
If it turns out that's technically quite difficult at this point.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
So it'd be nice to find out.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
And then maybe we can discuss it again.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Okay, let's do that.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Yeah.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
I mean, overall, I think both both arguments are great.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
And I'm, I'm for both among the fans on, on both those.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
Um, I also say that like.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
If we go with the way it is, it's not the end of the world.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
It's, it's still fine.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
You know, I just, uh, I think that.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Well, anyway, let's see.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Okay.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
If it ships the way it is, I'm, I'm not going to like really argue beyond that.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
It just feels more intuitive.

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
Um, that these things don't pick up additional variables.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
I really like the wording that you used like up top.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
And I wonder in that case, if you reframe it like that,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
that would make a lot more sense.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
Um, not to have, you know, the confusion between pinned on pin, etc.

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
In which case, like, do we actually need pins, you know, because you can just drag it up.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Right.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
The pins are not really needed.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Um,

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
and you know, in which case we, we, we remove that, that confusion.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah, I think that's an interesting point to you.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
I would say there's something about the pins that, um, visually.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
Um, help to distinguish.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Things in a different way.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
I like up top versus like up top as a conceptually up top.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
I don't know what that really means on its own.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
Um, until I pin something or I, I, I make a stack or something like.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
The section doesn't describe itself very well when it's one or the other.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
When it's both kind of does.

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
Um, but if they were just like six pin things, I would prefer that section was actually called pinned.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
Um, but, um, it also doesn't even need a name.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
I mean, as it doesn't have one.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Like, it doesn't have a name.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Yeah, in part.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
I mean, part of the research.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Didn't it?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
When we did before stacks or no.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
What's that?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Did it.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
I'm like blanking.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
Did it actually used to, it didn't say pin before, right?

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Yeah.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
It used to, I think in a previous iteration, a few iterations ago.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
But right.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
So the pins, the pins do the own, their own job here to say, like, this is the pins stuff.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
But now that there's stacks, it's, it's just like it's up top.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
We can, we can just call it that.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Yeah.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
And part of the reason that your pins exist or have value is like, you know, first of all,

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
you need a way to like move it, pin it, move it up top whatever.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
You need a way to do it, you know, without dragging the dropping.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
That is one thing.

34:00.000 --> 34:06.000
And then also, like, at least in the current design, there's not a empty section waiting for stuff to be dragged into it.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
Like, if you have a pin to anything, there's no section there.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
It doesn't, it doesn't exist until you pin your first thing.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
So, right.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
We would need to like, adding section that's always empty, saying, drag your first project up top.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Exactly.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Exactly.

34:19.000 --> 34:25.000
Can you remind me, if you drag house remodeled down into recently visited, does it unpin it?

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
No, can't.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Okay.

34:27.000 --> 34:36.000
So, in that case, I don't think I'm okay with the way it works.

34:36.000 --> 34:41.000
But I don't think it's necessary that you can drag a project from recently visited up and dependent to pin it.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
I think you can drag it up to make a stack.

34:45.000 --> 34:52.000
But to, to drag it up and pin it, not be the drag it down and unpin it seems a little bit odd to me.

34:53.000 --> 35:01.000
Anyway, mind, these are minor edge case outlier things that don't really matter.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
We're, you know, we're in the weeds, right?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Because this is really good.

35:04.000 --> 35:11.000
So we're in the weeds, like, you know, how to, how to finish the last one or two percent of this.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
But this feels like this feels a lot better than, than, than the version we looked at last week.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
And I appreciate how quickly you guys made these changes.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
Yeah, happy with how we turned out.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
One quick question.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
The mobile side of things.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
So like, mobile is working on supporting this.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
And it's just going to be, you know, read only on mobile.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
So you're going to create stacks and stuff like that.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
We're not doing that right now.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
But like, you know, you'd be able to see your stacks, obviously, on mobile.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
So that's probably going to be, you know, two wish weeks, maybe a little bit more.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
And before it's ready on mobile.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
And so there was the question of, you know, are we okay shipping this.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
You make a bunch of stacks.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
You go to mobile and the stacks aren't there.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
And you know, all the projects are there because, well, they're all, they're all pin print.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Anyway, all the projects are there.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
But they're not in stacks.

36:02.000 --> 36:08.000
You know, my general take was it like, you know, like, two weeks we can announce, you know, available soon on mobile.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
You're not really losing anything.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
It's probably good enough.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
But I just want to double check it.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
You saw much reason.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Like, how do you think it'd be like, I mean, all these stacks.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
So I went to mobile.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
And I don't see my snacks.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
My, my gut on that is that.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
And I never say this, but I think we shouldn't wait.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
And the main reason why is because.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
If you put a dozen projects, you start to really organize things.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
You put a dozen here and a dozen there.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Before you had three pin things because like those are your top three things.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
And you always want them at the top.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
And now all of a sudden, you're going to have, you know, 27 things at the top.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
You know, a dozen on this and a dozen on that.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
And then the three pinned that you had.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
And now, now your pins are less valuable.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Then, then before.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
And then I imagine if you start to unpin projects because you're like, wait a second.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
I just want these three pin.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Then it's going to start to mess with your stacks on desktop.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
But you won't be able to see that until you get back to desktop.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
And now your folder or your stack has eight things instead of 12.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
There's just like these mixed behaviors that.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
I feel like in the grand scheme of things, we should, we should wait until that works.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
We don't need to wait.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
It's not like it's breaking anything.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
But it just feels disconnected.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
In a way where it might be.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I would say it probably would be frustrating.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
To have a few pin things.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
And then a few stacks.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
And then on, on mobile.

37:38.000 --> 37:45.000
It's just like this long list of pin things.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
You know, normally we, we just ship stuff.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
And mobile would catch up or mobile would be ahead of us or whatever.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
But given the fact that this is the home screen and mobile screens are small to begin with.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I think people.

37:58.000 --> 38:05.000
That might find, you know, a few dozen surprise projects up there and pin to be quite frustrating.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
That's my general gut sense.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
I don't know.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Yeah.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
Do you, do you buy that or do you think it's not important enough or.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Yeah.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
It's totally reasonable.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Yeah.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
Certainly going on sort of our, you know, normal approach of like, well, don't we don't want to be waiting on stuff.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
So, you know, just like didn't want this branch to sit out there for too long.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
And now we got to rebase it.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
You know, just.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Yep.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
That's a tradeoff for sure.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
And, you know, just like the fact is like, OK, so people would have, you know, how many people were going to be involved.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Like people would have to know about the feature.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
They'd have to try the feature.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
They'd have to probably create a bunch of stacks or a lot of projects in the stacks.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
And then they'd have to be using mobile and use it a lot.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
So by general thought was like, you know, the risk was fairly low.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Let's keep things moving.

38:53.000 --> 39:03.000
I'd say, you know, I think the best part of what you were saying there was about the, you know, just as like, you know, the screen size of mobile, like just kind of like thinking about it, like.

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
You could almost take advantage of these stacks because it's going to make your life on mobile a lot easier.

39:08.000 --> 39:15.000
And like, you know, like, oh my gosh, if I could put all my cycle projects in my stack and on my phone, it'd be so much easier to manage and then you do it and like it doesn't work.

39:15.000 --> 39:24.000
Yeah, so I think that the fact that it stacks are actually very beneficial on a small screen on mobile is another plus and in waiting.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
And I don't, I don't think if we have major implications to wait.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Here's another way to do it.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
We could just ship it as is don't tell anybody it exists.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Yeah.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Or people are going to find an idea, you know, just like just put it out there.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
We can start using it anyway.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Some people will find it somehow by accident.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
And then we don't have to keep branches synced up like this.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
It's in production.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
We're good to go.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Yeah.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I would actually vote for that.

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000
You know, thinking it through because we don't have the tradeoffs of keeping branches in sync and rebasing and the whole thing.

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
So just ship it as is once we've tightened up a couple of these little details and you don't play with them.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
We've changed the edit state and a couple of things like that.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Ship it quietly.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
We can start to play with ourselves.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Someone will discover it. Don't tell the community yet. Don't tell anybody.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Although maybe we could tell the community.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
We could tell the community and just say, hey, look, here's how it works.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
Just so you know, for the next few weeks, it's not going to be available on mobile.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Therefore, if you do this, this is going to happen.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
So you might want to hold off on that.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
But we can get some more people involved that way.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
That'd be a nice thing to actually to involve them.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Now they think about it.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Just letting them know up front.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
We wouldn't announce it publicly in that way.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Where hey, just by so you know, like this is going to be kind of weird on mobile.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
This is like more of an insider thing.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And then we can move on.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
I'd be up for that.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Yeah.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Yeah, it's like a soft soft lunch.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Yeah, soft lunch.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Yeah. Yeah.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
You had a very good point about this experience.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
You know, creating stacks and organizing your stuff is such a personal thing to do.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Right.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
Like I can definitely see myself organizing all my stacks and then going on mobile.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
I'm not seeing them.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
I'll be like, where's my stuff?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Yeah.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
Well, as long as we again, tell the community that this is sort of hey,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
you guys have an early preview essentially.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
This is live in your account, but it's a bit of a, you know, early preview.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
We're not going to announce this formally for everybody until.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
Uh, this is working on mobile, but here's what will happen if you do it.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
So, you know, proceed at your own risk, essentially.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Not like there's any risk, but, you know what I mean?

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Yeah.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Yeah.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Yeah.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Okay.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
That'd be, that'd be good.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
I would solve all of our problems too, but branches won't know.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Okay.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Cool.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Cool.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
I think that's everything that we have so far.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
So, Dorn, do you want to just check it with Nicholas about?

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
Like, what would be, it would it be possible to maintain?

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
The status or the, yeah, the status of a recently visited project or a pin project in the stack.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Even though stacks are always going to be displayed up top.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Yeah.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Oh, let's find out.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Let's just find out that we can discuss asynchronously, wherever.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Yeah.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Okay.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Cool.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
This is great.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Cool.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
People are going to like this.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
You can see where this goes.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Like, click into a stack for a second, Dorn.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
I can imagine and then click on the name of the stack to go into like whatever edit mode.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I can imagine like adding a background image.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
You know, I can imagine changing the color of the stack.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
Like, there's a lot of things that a lot of levers off of this week and pull.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
To make these stacks stand out even more.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
I mean, you can imagine creating a stack for a client and uploading the client logo.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
You know, and so now you got Nike got the swoosh.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
And it could replace the name just like, you know,

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
hit never mind or close out of here.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Close out completely.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Yeah.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
And scroll, scroll down to the top again or up to the top.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Sorry.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
So we have hauncher design.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
But of course, if you, if you hover over that.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
And you replace with your logo, it could replace with the logo.

42:53.000 --> 42:58.000
So the new stack could be called Nike or it could have the swoosh, right?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
And then you're like, oh, this is pretty great.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
All my Nike client projects are in here, got the Nike logo.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
So there's a lot of opportunities here to expand this simple idea,

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
which is what we get when we simplify this compared to the other version,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
where we had like a window into all the little projects,

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
you kind of lose the ability to do more.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Yeah.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
I mean, there's not much room here for that if we went there, right?

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
So I think I think this.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
This is going to be a really nice improvement.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
It also it's within the within the within the be the spirit of just.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
Fisher price, which is, you know, simplifying these things,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
making them very straightforward.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
And we're trying to reduce some clutter here.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
So I like it.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Yeah.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Yeah. Cool.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Good work.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
All right.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Thanks guys.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Thanks.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
See you.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Bye.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Bye.
