# Design Feedback and Microcopy Refinement

## Language and Clarity

### "Create a Stack" vs. "Stack These Projects"
Jason suggests: "See what says create a stack. I wonder if we should say stack these projects or something like that, instead of create a stack, it's not, it's a little bit like. It's a bit more about the end goal, which is stacking them up versus creating something."

### The "Empty Stack" Language
Jason's critique: "The whole thing I would think about is, instead of saying empty stack. Since it's worth, since we have room, it's not a button, it's like, I wonder if it could say like. Remove projects from the stack, remove all projects from the stack, or maybe, yeah, maybe empty this stack."

"Just empty stack is a little bit brutal in a sense. It's like, it's pretty short, and I'm not totally sure. I think I know what it does, but it feels a little stark."

## Typography and Visual Design

### The Italics Question
Doran: "I was, I was, I was waiting for the session to ask you about Alex because like a few people suggested it's moving back to San Serif."

Jason's response: "I'm not, I'm not a fan of the italics simply because I love the talics, but I don't think our italics are, I don't like this typeface really lends itself well. Yeah, at this size, especially so I would probably just go. Just lose it."

### Alternative: Small Caps
Jason suggests: "I go all caps, I go, so like see the little brand header over there on the right hand side. Yeah, I think we use all caps in a few spots like small all caps, I think would be, could be nice."

## Empty State Messaging

### Current State Issues
"It felt like we had like zero projects before instead of like empty stack and it felt like it was generated by the computer rather than, you know, put some thought into it and make it more human."

### Proposed Solutions
Various options discussed:
- "Nothing inside"
- "No projects"
- "This stack is empty"

Jason's preference: "No projects seems better than zero projects. You could all say this, I mean, this stack is empty, but, but, but, but empty of what? So I do like the directness of just getting to the point like no projects."

## Safety and Destructive Actions

### The Accidental Click Problem
"The only thing is though, just to play this out is it's not destructive, obviously, because you're not deleting any projects, but. It's something you can, you can hit it by accident. And if you did have a dozen projects in here, it would be really frustrating. To hit that and not get."

### Solution: Hidden Until Edit Mode
"I think it's a good idea to show the empty stack, maybe at the bottom where it is now, but only when you click the edit title, this one shows up. In which case, you would not click it by accident, because this would not, you will not see it."

## Confirmation Patterns

### The Debate on Warnings
"Generally, I think it's like, it's a stack. You're not losing anything when you empty it. Like, I don't think you, you know, so like, I think we could be better on the worry about. I don't personally think we have to, like, warn on it."

### Alternative Safety Mechanisms
"So we don't currently have a delete unless you write empty it out first, which is a nice, also a nice. Safety mechanism, safety valve there."

## Visual Feedback and Transitions

### The Background Blur Discussion
Jason: "What do you think about sort of blurring or dimming the background? Given the fact that you can't drag things in when it's open. Do you think it would make sense to almost stylistically double down on that?"

Doran's rationale: "The initial idea behind not having a background was that this is supposed to be like a quick action. This is not, this is not like a model where you go in and you have to focus on something else like a form or a button or like whatever or read something. This is more like click, click, die."

### Transition Animations
Jason: "Does escape. If you hit escape, will it, will it X out? Yeah. Cool."

The importance of smooth transitions: "By the way, the transition sometimes over zoom. It's hard to see. Does this sort of zoom up or is it just like materializing because it'd be nice. If it grew."

## The Edit State Clarity

Doran observes: "It feels like you're not entering an edit stack mode as much as you're like entering an edit title load, you know, so like it's hard to know if. Is that where you think you would find that find that, but like."

Jason's pragmatic view: "I agree that it's not an edit state necessarily, but like it's, if you ever need to do it, and you don't know how and you wish there was a way and we show you how and now you know it's like great, you can do it."
