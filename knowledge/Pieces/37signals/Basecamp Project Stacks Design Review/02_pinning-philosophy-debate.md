# The Pinning Philosophy Debate

## The Core Tension
Jason identifies a fundamental issue: "If you clear a stack, all those projects become pinned. I don't, I assume there's some reason for this, but I don't like it because they didn't, like you can pull one from recently visited. To me, putting it up there is just putting it in a stack. It's not saying pin it also. So it's, it's doing two things when it shouldn't do two things. It should do one thing."

## Technical vs. Conceptual Constraints

### The Technical Reality
Doran explains: "There's, of course, a technical aspect on this as well... In the way these cards are modeled. So the idea is that once you drag a project, let's say, 100 designed newsroom here into the new stack. It becomes pinned automatically."

The team acknowledges: "Without majorly remunning this in this page. Like it is a pinned section is how it just functions, you know, code wise, etc."

### The Conceptual Shift
Jason proposes a reframing: "I think once we introduce stacks, it's not just pinned. So it was just pinned. So we're coming from a place of just pinned. But now it's not. Now it's, it's like things that are to pinned or, or, or together, these are, this is just like one separate place to put the stuff that's in play."

## The Cycle Completion Scenario

Jason paints a concrete scenario: "Let's say you had a 12 cycle projects in here. And you had all your 12 cycle projects in here. Brian, you're managing these projects. You put them all in here. Cycle is over. You hit empty."

The problem: "You're saying like, I don't want these together anymore. There's a pretty good chance you probably don't want them at the top anymore either because they're like done. It's sort of like they're kind of like over. But now you've got 12 pinned projects that have just shown up in this pin section."

## Reframing: From "Pinned" to "Up Top"

### The New Mental Model
"I think of the section now is up top. What goes up top pin stuff and stuff and stacks. But it doesn't change the nature of the projects within the stack itself. The projects are the same. It's not a conversion."

### Two Types of Things
"I would try to think of this as up top now has two kinds of things. Things to sing on their own or pin so they stay there. Stacks also stay there."

### The Behavioral Rules
Jason's proposed logic:
- "If you drag a project into a stack, it just retains a state that it had."
- "If you drag a project from recently visited up into pinned and drop it alone on its own, it does get pinned."
- "So logically, I think that all adds up whether or not it's doable."

## The State Memory Challenge

### The Implementation Question
"I would just wonder if you could ask who you're working on this with. But Nicholas, Nicholas, if you could ask Nicholas, if it'd be possible. To, I, and I can see, like, I can see through why maybe it wouldn't be right now."

### The Desired Behavior
"If we could remember the state of a project and putting it up there, if it goes into, if it goes into a stack, it just in a stack. And stacks are essentially themselves pinned. But what's inside of them is the things that are inside of them are what they were."

## The Visibility Problem

Doran raises a concern: "If we do that, it kind of seems like in the stack, we would need to show whether something's pinned or not."

Jason's counter: "I don't think it matters here because. Think about what you're doing here. I don't need to know the state of something. I can't move things around in here, right?"

## The Asymmetry Issue

Jason notices an inconsistency: "Can you remind me, if you drag house remodeled down into recently visited, does it unpin it? No, can't. Okay. So, in that case, I don't think I'm okay with the way it works. But I don't think it's necessary that you can drag a project from recently visited up and dependent to pin it."

"To drag it up and pin it, not be the drag it down and unpin it seems a little bit odd to me."

## The Resolution

Jason's pragmatic conclusion: "If it ships the way it is, I'm, I'm not going to like really argue beyond that. It just feels more intuitive. Um, that these things don't pick up additional variables."

The team agrees to investigate: "Let's just find out that we can discuss asynchronously, wherever."
